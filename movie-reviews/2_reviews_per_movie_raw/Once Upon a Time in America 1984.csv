","Many people compare ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with ""The Godfather"". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?<br/><br/>What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. <br/><br/>The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut. <br/><br/>The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.<br/><br/>Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.<br/><br/>I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10."
"oldguybc","10","454","886","11 January 2005"," A masterpiece and an atrocity!
","This movie was a masterpiece. It ranks as one of the very best in film history, if not the best. At Cannes people yelled and screamed, couldn't believe just how good it was. The profound atrocity was a combination of two completely brainless acts, the first being Zack Stienberg's hatchet job for US release, supposedly requested by either Warner Bros or The Ladd Company (one blames the other now) and the second was the lack of anyone (and everyone)to post anything in this great film for Academy Award consideration, of which probably as many as 14 nominations and 4 sure- fire Oscars went down the toilet. <br/><br/>These atrocities were perpretrated, I believe, with two reasons in mind, the first to preserve the dim hope of ""The Killing Fields"" (Daly & Semel's baby) of garnering any awards... and second, to try to boost up the non- foreign chances. Warner Bros knew just how good it was, that goes without saying. The problem was... they already had their share of cash cows and they wanted a real star- studded showpiece to point at. The small minds already had their showpiece but, alas, it was an ""eye- tallyan"" flick with a producer/director who didn't communicate well. The hatchet job was carefully planned, I believe... the so- called ""sneak preview"" was done in Canada and not well received, probably due to the fact that the sound system was over- amped and the film 'broke' 3 or 4 times during the showing, what a farce! The awards snub started with the GGs and carried right thru. What a myriad of stupid and utterly pointless decisions! Must have literally tore Leone's heart out when he learned what they had done. <br/><br/>Morricone's score was a sure- thing Oscar, no question about it. DeNiro and maybe even Woods would have fought it out for best actor, Tuesday Weld as supporting actress, any one of 4 or 5 other supporting actors & actresses, most notably William Forsythe, cinematography, film editing, the list goes on & on... (best picture...Amadeus???? give me a break!!) Just what in the hell were they thinking? <br/><br/>Saw it in a theater 20 years ago and then again on TV about 1998 and finally in its correct format(on DVD) about two years ago and again last week at a friend's house. Stirred up all those angry thoughts all over again... sorry about that, getting' old & crotchety."

"jack_thursby","2","150","285","4 September 2005"," There's a lot of good reasons this movie bombed
","I'm familiar with most of the great gangster movies that have come out, but I've never heard of this title until recently. Well, I found why I've never heard of it -- the film is long, boring and disappointing. Somewhere in there is an interesting story, but ""Once Upon a Time in America"" does not tell that story.<br/><br/>Basically, with flashbacks occurring here and there, the movie follows a group of kids in their journey from young hoods to adult hoods. However, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is too long, too disjointed, the story is not compelling, and the acting in the early parts of the film is atrocious (especially the child actors). A large part of the problem with the movie is Sergio Leone's directing style. Leone loves long stares and glances and wide panoramic shots, and unlike in his westerns, this style simply does not work here. In Leone's westerns these long sequences effectively built up tension while here they are just boring cinematic filler.<br/><br/>It seems that Leone lost objectivity in editing because a lot of scenes drag on unnecessarily, making the nearly 4 hour running time seem twice as long. In the first hour alone there's more than 5 minutes devoted to a scene of a 12-13 year old girl dancing ballet while a young Noodles (the main character) secretly watches. Did this really need to be 5 minutes? The point is made in the first minute -- she's a beautiful young girl and Noodles is in love with here. Why stretch it out for another 4 minutes? There's no point to it unless you like watching young girls ballet dance.<br/><br/>Soon afterward we're treated to a another 4-5 minute scene of a little kid eating pastry while melodramatic music gushes in like its some sort of pivotal scene. It boggles the mind why stuff like this was not edited down -- it doesn't move the story, its not cinematic and its not even acting, its 4-5 minutes of a kid eating cake.<br/><br/>Lastly, whereas a movie like ""The Godfather"" comes across as realistic and believable, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" while ostensibly gritty and realistic is anything but. Certain events in the story are completely unbelievable and hard to view as anything but fiction, which is not an asset when you are making a hard, gritty gangster movie.<br/><br/>If you like long 4 hour movies I guess this is for you, but to anyone else I would say that there's a good reason this movie has largely been forgotten, so proceed at your own risk."
"jeanpaul-3","Null","302","594","29 October 1999"," Mesmerizing and haunting tale of love, greed, regret, betrayal and revenge
","This is, for me, one of the finest examples of cinematic art. It isn't a simple, cut-n-dried 90 minute little package that gets wrapped up with a pretty bow at the end. You get pulled in by the enigmatic opening that unwinds the threads of the story to be found later. For many people having half an hour of purely visual story telling, of stories that are only mysteries at that point, before anything becomes truly linear is difficult to follow and discourages to many people. Our own memories are only snippets that only become linear as we concentrate on scenes from our lives. Once Upon a Time in America is like that as we follow Noodles through the `significant' part of his life - the times that formed him. When the story actually starts, we meet the girl that he always loved but could never have.<br/><br/>David `Noodles' Aaronson (DeNiro) was a kid on the very mean streets of Brooklyn when organized crime was born in America and he grew into and out of it. That's the simplest synopsis of the plot. The reality is that this isn't a movie about gangsters. Being a gangster is the easiest way for Noodles to survive and get ahead, but it also alienates and ruins his one love. Whenever he is close to giving himself to Deborah he always gets pulled back into the gang, in some form or another.<br/><br/>DeNiro's portrayal is of a gangster, through and through, who also has a conscience that, while not preventing him from being a ruthless killer, rules his life with regret, remorse and guilt. Leone takes a bit of poet/historic license by showing the Brooklyn Bridge being built in the background (the bridge had been built 40 years before), but it symbolizes Noodles' own growth. When the bridge is just pilings and incomplete towers, Noodles is just forming his future. By the time the bridge is complete, Noodles is nothing but a gangster and the bridge is majestic. When he returns 35 years later our view of the bridge is from under a freeway -- the world has moved along, but the bridge and Noodles are just as they were.<br/><br/>The length: If you're looking for a brief distraction that you'll barely remember 30 minutes later, this isn't the movie for you. However, if you are prepared and able to be undistributed for the nearly 4 hours that this film uses to compress a lifetime -- you will be rewarded with many facets of thought and examination."
"Larry-115","1","226","439","8 April 2004"," An exquisite, ridiculous movie
","Once Upon a Time in America is Sergio Leone's epic tale of the lives of four Jewish gangsters in New York City. The period spans decades, ending in the 1970's, but focuses on three periods - the childhood of the gangsters on the Lower East Side, their young adulthood and the old age of the survivors. <br/><br/>
The protagonist, in a manner of speaking, is Noodles (Robert DeNiro), who along with Max (James Woods) calls the shots for the gang. The story focuses on their odd friendship and their relationships with the other gangsters (William Forsythe and James Hayden), and with Fat Moe (John Rapp), a non-gangster friend from the neighborhood.  <br/><br/>Watching Once Upon a Time in America is a very strange experience. Director Sergio Leone directs with the same eclectic, erratic style he employed in his better-known `spaghetti westerns' starring Clint Eastwood. The result is an exquisite, ridiculous movie. <br/><br/>At least it's a thing of beauty to look at, and this gets you half-way there. At times, the movie has overwhelming visual impact -- when Leone films the actors close-up, they look like portraits painted by the Great Masters, and in wider shots he frames the actors so that they interact electrically with the locations or sets. And the sets are themselves beautifully produced - his reconstruction of the Lower East Side, for instance, is vivid and incredibly detailed. It's all wonderful to see.<br/><br/>
Leone also skillfully uses music to set the scene and convey emotion. True to form, his melancholy theme music is hard at work in the movie, and it performs yeoman service. Now and then he trips up, however -- his trademark use of pan-flute solos is even weirder here than in the spaghetti westerns, and, to be frank, when the Beetles song `Yesterday' popped up at one point, I laughed out loud, so out of place was it, so cloyingly sentimental. For the most part, though, Leone's characters are amazing to look at, set in vivid backgrounds and propelled forward by terrific music.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, the plot and the writing are terribly clumsy, and so the movie does not make it all the way to the status of a great film. It's a bridge half built, which can be more frustrating than no bridge at all.<br/><br/>
Actually, the movie's premise is intriguing at first, and the fatuous dialogue doesn't get in the way too much. Noodles has been driven out of New York and has lived in exile, hiding for more than 30 years until he receives a mysterious invitation to return to New York for an unknown reason. But the screenplay itself is a toxic brew of histrionics and adolescent bravado, with an almost comically-exaggerated sense of its own gravitas. It was clearly written by a staff of writers, and what's even more clear is that all of them spoke English as a second language. The movie is reminiscent of a story written about adult life by a teenager -- it is not nearly as deep as it thinks it is. <br/><br/>Troopers all, the very talented actors weather the implausible situations and hokey dialogue as best they can. As the hours roll on (I watched the four-hour long `director's version'), and the story marches toward its unsurprising conclusion, the viewer begins bracing for this with a mixture of dread and relief. At the end, the disappointment is all the more palpable because the cast, sets and cinematography are so good, and some of the initial scenes held great promise. <br/><br/>The fact that the movie is itself mostly about rough people is absolutely no excuse for any of this, as Martin Scorcese's phenomenal Goodfellas readily proves. Likewise, the fact that the movie is set amidst a haze of opium at certain points is even less excuse for shoddy characterizations . The simple truth is that the movie is trite and makes little or no sense, long version or short. <br/><br/>Leone assembled an impressive cast of young talent to act out the story of Once Upon a Time in America. As mentioned, most of them try very hard to make the fatuous story float, and some - particularly Woods and Tuesday Weld as Max's sometimes-moll - are terrific. DeNiro himself is strangely out of place and not terribly convincing as a Jewish gangster, although he is good in his scenes from the 1970's.  Elizabeth McGovern does what she can with the role of Deborah, but it's probably the worst-written role in the movie, and again her strongly-Celtic face doesn't exactly conjure images of a first-generation Jewish immigrant.<br/><br/>Received opinion has it that Once Upon a Time in America is a great movie, possibly because it is a very long gangster movie (like those other ones), or because it was an epic work of passion for Leone, or because DeNiro is in it (again, like those other gangster movies), or maybe it's a combination of those elements. But here, as is often the case, received opinion is mistaken. Once Upon a Time in America is a mess, though an often-beautiful one."

","... Directors of all time. Let's start with a story. Many years ago, when your grandfather was still a boy, a failed, beaten-down actor named Clint Eastwood packed up his horse and saddle (speaking metaphorically here), left Hollywood forever (or so he thought) and headed out to Europe to pick up cash wherever he could. He ended up doing a film in Italy for an almost-unknown director named Sergio Leone and an almost-unknown sound guy named Ennio Morricone. The film was (as history would later record) an ""Italian Western,"" that is, as the iconic western drama was all but disappearing in the US, it was being ""re-imagined"" by Italian writers and directors, and then filmed in Italy, using mainly Italian actors. On the set, Eastwood spoke in English and everyone else spoke in Italian. (Dubbing later fixed all that). Filming now over, Eastwood took his cash and left. Weeks later, in a bar in another part of Europe, he overheard mention that a certain film was the leading box office attraction on the continent. The name sounded familiar but, frankly, during production, a final name for the film he'd just done had not even been selected. He investigated. Yes, this was the film he had just completed, now titled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The rest is history. Sort of. Two sequels were done with Eastwood playing the same character. Monster hits. <br/><br/>By this point the critics began to acknowledge not only Clint, but also the man behind the camera, Leone, who was one of the most promising directors of the era. HE DID THINGS WITH THE CAMERA THAT NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE, especially his use of closeups, especially his ability to match powerful emotional orchestrals to key scenes. The fourth film in the series, done by Leone but by this time lacking Eastwood, was ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. (Eastwood meanwhile had returned to America as a major celebrity, formed his own production company, Malpaso, and over time became a director as well as the #1 box office star. Over the course of his career, Eastwood subtly voiced his distaste for Leone's work by scrupulously avoiding all Leone's trademark camera angles, even in his westerns!) <br/><br/>Back to Leone. While he lent his name to a handful of oddball productions, the last passionate work he left behind as his legacy was this film. OMG. What a film. Showcasing not only Leone's talent behind the camera, but also his musical magic as well as his ability to tell a complex tale like no one before him. It was by and large produced in obscure locations in NA, and the performances of the players, especially James Woods, and also de Niro, could possibly rank even today as the best they have ever given. (Also a performance from a young and charismatic Jennifer Connolly that by itself is worth the price of the ticket) <br/><br/>The film is magical. But here is the catch. Very few people have ever seen it. Even people who ""think"" they have seen it, really have not. The studio behind the film went berserk when they saw the length and, fearful of losing dollars when they could be changing reels and selling more tickets, they brought in a butcher to shorten it. Now maybe the new editor was not a butcher by trade, but he was sure one by disposition. The late Roger Ebert said that, in his career, this was the most abusive re-edit he had ever seen. The actual film, the one that Leone left, was not seen until years later when the director's version surfaced. It is astounding. It is magical. It is one of the best films ever made. It is a must see."

"noilie","1","191","378","8 April 2004"," Complex, but not a 'masterpiece'.
","I concede that the film is well made and quite intricate in its structure (and that it takes time and patience to attempt to come up with an explanation for the unfathomable gray areas in the screenplay). Leone evidently had an eye for detail, composition, lighting and camera movement. I am sure that no-one will deny that the technical side of the film was handled with care and it does show. <br/><br/>The screenplay is a mess. I expect to be lambasted by angry fans that will claim that I am an unimaginative watcher and would like all aspects of plot and character explained to me instead of having to think and immerse myself. Fine. I also know that art defies easy definition, and that all the best art in the world offers itself up to multiple interpretations. Fine. I maintain that Leone is being wilfully obscure in his attempts to cover up the head-scratch-inducing narrative techniques that he conjures up. He does so by claiming an opium/dream logic: some kind of remembrance of childhood and prohibition (an immutable, fixed past) as well as a progressive imagining (regarding the ""future"") on the part of the focaliser Noodles as he lies in the opium den. This may not be the case as he could not possibly know of the exact styles, decor and music of the sixties without having lived through them to some extent. So here we have an organic problem with the screenplay: claims to dream logic to confuse and inspire debate regarding the plot's many unsure points (e.g. was that Max in the dumpster? How Why? What does that wry smile at the end mean? Etc. Was it all a dream of the past and possible future?) counterpoised with the impossibility of this evident in the physical and cultural environment presented to us in the visuals. This, to me, is just vague and sloppy. It is not just a case of great art being unfathomable, it is a case of sloppy art trying to be unfathomable. Take that incessant telephone sound and its related imagery. Did Leone himself know what effect he was trying to achieve when he put it in there? I would say yes in one respect: in order to mystify his audience. I do not think that it stands for much more than that. Perhaps also to establish the confusing and ultimately untenable nature of the film's time structure (he is literally 'calling into the past') and it's relation to Noodle's 'dream' (which the film quite clearly can not be). <br/><br/>Also, the film's attitude towards women is just plain nasty, containing two of the screens most unapologetic rape scenes. We could claim that it is merely the nasty attitude of our enigma focaliser Noodles. He most obviously is not a very nice guy when it comes to women and the film does present itself as an exploration of his singular consciousness (if it is a dream). To put it crassly: he is nasty to women so the film has also got to be nasty to women if it claims to be deeply related to his attitudes and point of view. If it is a film of dream and imaginings, then certainly Noodle's dream is mutable (as we know all dreams are) and what he 'does' to the characters played by Tuesday Weld and Elisabeth McGovern is heightened by his desire and imagination. This is the only way in which to explain why Tuesday Weld's character seems to enjoy rape, that it is Noodles imagining her enjoying the rape. This is vague, but it at least validates the epic romanticization that pervades this ugly world (of which rape is only a part) when the main character is an absolute lout: it is him who romanticizes it. This is a sneaky way around a touchy subject. But, as has been established by many, this world may not be a dream- back to that inconsistency in the plot. Is it? Isn't it? If not then there is not much of an excuse for the rape sequences. <br/><br/>The dialogue is also slightly off, too often it sounds stiff and mechanical, and it is too self-consciously scripted to sound like naturalistic street parlance. Ennio Morricone's score is alright. It is evocative in places (when he sticks to the minimalist piano melody) and far too saccharine in others (that pan pipe stuff I find grating and kitsch).<br/><br/>
So to be sure, it is a complex film. It is a rewarding film. It requires more than one watching. It falls far short from a masterpiece, though. Too inconsistent when it should be incisive. It bears the marks of a troubled production and evidence of Leone himself not quite knowing what to do with the beast he had created."

Naively, I sat through endless period son-et-lumiÃ©re, gratuitous sex and violence, dubious ageing makeup jobs, unrealistic dialogue and nondescript music, hoping that the ending would tie it all together in a satisfying way. Epic fail. It's a bad B-movie plot dressed as The Sting.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* Noodles (De Niro, wasting his prime - the ridiculous name of the protagonist says it all) returns to New York after 30 years to find he has been advanced a million bucks for a hit, but why? It's Max, (James Woods) his boyhood gang chum that he thought he'd double-crossed and got killed, wanting Noodles to kill him before the real baddies get hold of him. What rubbish; after all, a million buys a lot of secret hideaway. It is so telling that the movie's premise considers a huge sum of money a good enough maguffin to hang a four-hour marathon melodrama on. Mild, ostentatious tedium follows - mystified, Noodles wanders from mausoleum to left luggage office to cold-cream besmeared dancer's dressing room, all the while flashing back to a squeaky-clean 1930's gangland, where we eventually learn that it is a bad idea to call Max 'crazy'. Because instantly he goes crazy, in a piece of character development that probably had the Scooby-Doo writers looking to their laurels. That was said of 'Bugs' Moran, actually - you didn't call him 'Bugs' to his face. <br/><br/>There's no chance of any such real-life wit or irony in this script. No chance of any reality at all, because the intention seems to have been to make grand opera, so it doesn't matter that a man can be forced to sit in a vat of gasoline (and drink it) yet jump out when rescued as though it were gameshow gunk. It doesn't matter that driving a car at speed into a quay with no-one wearing belts would result in a bloody mess, not male bonding. Grand opera requires grand passion to drive the plot; Noodles' only passion is for looking at length through one of the movies' two terribly unconvincing peepholes at a budding ballet dancer, whom he goes on to rape. As you do; another piece of meaningless quasi-characterisation. Grand opera requires grand symbolism to resonate with people; there is no symbolism in OUATIA, the whole thing is a completely pedestrian display of directorial indulgence. But then, in 1984 we all thought the money would last forever. This movie certainly feels like it."

","This film is a profound expression of truth regarding friendship and betrayal.  Noodles, played by Robert De Niro and Scott Tiler (during childhood), is a simple man and a thug with one credo: you can battle the entire world but you never betray a friend.  During the course of this film we experience various pieces of Noodles's life, from childhood, through young adulthood and old age. We learn what happens to his friends, his foes and the love of his life, Deborah.  The time span considered is long, including Noodles's childhood shortly after the turn of the century, through the prohibition era, and finally the 1960's.<br/><br/>The film is about relationships; the many years Noodles spends away from his friends receive only a cursory mention. The film, like life and memories, unfolds slowly and reflectively. Sergio Leone's cuts are long and each scene is beautifully amplified my Ennio Morricone's haunting score.  The story is not told chronologically. Instead, the chapters of the story are slowly revealed like pieces of a great jigsaw puzzle. Each delicious piece might make us laugh, or cry, or smile, or feel shock.  But, as each piece falls into place, a mystery unfolds. When the final piece is revealed, the true essence of the story becomes clear and a sad and beautiful tapestry comes into view.<br/><br/>This film is a true masterpiece, expressing a profound statement about friendship and betrayal, with fantastic acting, writing, directing and music.  There is a shortened, two-and-a-half-hour version of the film released that is a disaster.  It is like trying to understand a jigsaw puzzle with half of the pieces missing.

"cvm_caveman","3","116","227","31 December 2006"," Tediously slow paced, disturbing, disappointing.
","I have now watched this film twice in my lifetime and still cannot understand why it is deemed ""a classic"". The opening scene of a murder and search for the films main character Robert DeNiro as ""Noodles"" is reminiscent of Sergio Leone's openers for his ""man with no name"" westerns, but the thing that even sinks this interesting beginning is an annoying telephone ringing, that rings for about 3 scenes at least for 3 or 4 minutes before anyone answers it and the piercing noise of this phone only makes you irritated, I really couldn't wait for someone to answer it.<br/><br/>So right off the bat I am agitated with the movie, to paraphrase the rest of the film's first 3 hours and more annoyances and perverseness. I ask these questions: <br/><br/><ul><li>Do we need to show a young girls (Deborah) naked breast and behind, played by 14 year old Jennifer Connelly?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Do we need to see a teen boy sitting on a toilet, or groping a buxom teenager in the same bathroom?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Or losing his virginity to the same girl on the roof of a building. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Or statutory rape of the child by a police office at least 40 years her senior.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Then we have an uninteresting character named Moe whose face was beaten to a pulp in the opening sequence, fully recovered and owning some bar in 1968, played by one of the worlds most boring actors (Larry Rapp) in a cast of boring actors. Question: Why couldn't it have been the ""Moe the bartender"" character from the Simpson's instead? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We have to put up with a rape scene of ""Deborah"" now full grown and portrayed by Elizabeth McGovern, by her childhood ""sweetheart"" Noodles (Robert DeNiro) who is supposed to be the ""Good guy"". Why does this scene need to go on and on?</li></ul><br/><br/>The rape scene takes a good 2 or 3 minutes to transpire and when he is done, he rips off her top and rapes her again without any regret. The scene is so vile and repulsive it makes the Jodie Foster rape scene in THE ACCUSED look like a gentle kiss on the cheek by two friends.<br/><br/>Has Leone ever heard of the expression ""less is more""? We can learn a lot with only a few seconds devoted to a subject rather than the entire act being played out in all its disgust.<br/><br/>Now the pacing, the pacing is so slow and tedious without any real sense of awe or marvel. Why take so long to uncover something as mundane as a crypt where we already know that the 3 buddies of ""Noodles"" are kept? I was half expecting James Woods to be sitting atop his casket saying ""thought I was dead didn't ya?"" with all the time it took Deniro to walk in the darn door, the door that he seemed to open then close then open again then look at the names on the graves then close the door then get the key. Why does this scene take so long? What was the point?<br/><br/>I found myself asking this question about almost every scene. Throughout the film.<br/><br/>The pacing is just so slow and non revelatory in any real eye opening sense that it just leaves you frustrated.<br/><br/>This movie is neither a classic nor even a good gangster movie, all the good things he did that made ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST so great he doesn't do here, and one of the major things he failed to do when casting great actors like DeNiro and Woods (all the other actors are awful) is give them interesting characters to play or interesting things to say. Heck even a narrator could have helped me out here.<br/><br/>And Burt Young? Why Burt Young? Does anyone even know how this guy achieved an acting career? I had to rewind a few times just to understand what he was saying when he was telling that joke in the restaurant.<br/><br/>In a scene where the 4 Jewish gangsters rob the diamond merchants; All I could think to myself was that Guy Richie did this scene so much better (obviously Richie was influenced by this scene) in the movie SNATCH.<br/><br/>Then during the heist Noodles rapes Weld's character who is I guess a masochist? This is basically done to set up how he treats women he actually cares for, like Deborah who he rapes in the limo as listed earlier. Oh that's correct the man was in prison, I forgot.<br/><br/>And what the hell was that about the 4 friends whipping out there dicks for the Tuesday Weld character to measure with her eyes? I thought a porno was gonna start happening. I could hear the ""Dun-chicka-dun-dun"" music in my head somewhere.....<br/><br/>This movie was dull, non revelatory, brutally shocking in many places for no good verifiable reason and humorless, even when the 38 different writers that are listed in the credits tried to be funny. OK there are not really 38 writers more like 6.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was a waste of 4 hours and should have been edited down to 2 and even then nothing could save it from being boring, filled with wooden performances by B movie actors, a bad score, anonymous background noises, phones ringing seemingly forever, pointless rape sequences, women treated with the utmost of disrespect and did I say Burt Young? Well Treat Williams and Larry Rapp are in this too and THEY SUCK as well!!!<br/><br/>Give me Millers Crossing, Road to Perdition, Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, The Sopranos, The Godfather and Mean Streets any day!! Heck I would even watch Christian Slater and Richard Grieco in Mobsters again, that Once upon a time in America!!<br/><br/>Classic?? As in classic over pretentious, unsubtle garbage!!!"
"noilie","1","179","360","27 July 2003"," An unnecessarily padded and ersatz schlep of a film.
","It is high time that American critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned, sloppy veneration of films like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America'. The checkered history of this opulent film (and the grand, fanciful myth associated with it's production and many versions) belies its mediocrity on a narrative level. The film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts, its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets, the minutia of production detail and the, by 1984, cliche'd but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience. The plot's time frame is confusing, gimmicky and laboured, leading some critics to imagine the Noodles figure's opium binging to be the antecedent of some future 'dream reality' as well as the sepia-toned remembrances. This ham handed, overly fan boy-apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display. Even at this full (?) running time, figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness: the Deborah character is fleetingly established in child form, a cold and unattainable 'trophy' female, not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re-establish her relationship with a post-prison Noodles, the said re-union henceforth rings completely false. The deadening pace is somewhat to blame, certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long, signifying very little, hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production, fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof. The trajectory of the figures' lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of America's teens through prohibition and its spoils, ending with the (arguable) ruin of its moribund central figures (save Deborah- a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders). This notion is commonplace, even banal. The cast of characters as imagined in the one note script (written by seven Italians no less) are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors, who at least venture a few variant facial expressions. This is understandable given the almost unworkable material. Some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably self-absorbed, but actively seek their own goals, assuming the compliance of others (e.g. when Noodles gets out of prison, Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming Noodles will comply). This explanation of their abrupt, abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense. Although Ennio Morricone's score is much revered, it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive, it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves, many violent, just do not warrant. At points it is questionable whether or not Morricone was watching the same film I was so incongruous is his work. As a paean to American Filmmaking, it succeeds in terms of mood (helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods) and visuals (not helped by said score) but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity."
"tenco","Null","171","347","16 May 1999"," Leone's ultimate film
","Sergio Leone's films are all love letters to America, the American dreams of an Italian who grew up at the movies, who apprenticed with Wyler, and Aldrich, signed himself Bob Robertson, and gave us Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Charles Bronson as we know them.  Sadly, America didn't always repay the compliment.  Leone's were ""spaghetti westerns"", money makers to be sure, but deemed  disrespectful of the great tradition of Ford, Walsh and Hathaway. Many critics and Holllywood insiders called his earlier Eastwood films cynical and violent bottom-line commercial exploitation.  By the time that they caught on to Leone's genuine popular appeal, the director had already moved on.  And, his Once Upon a Time in the West was damned as pretentious, bloated, self-indulgent: an art film disguised as a Western, the Heaven's Gate of its day. That film's canny blend of pop appeal and pure cinematic genius gradually dawned on the powers that be (or were), and helped give rise to the renaissance of American filmmaking in the early seventies. It is worth noting that The Godfather could have been made by Leone, had he chosen. Leone had been pitching a gangster film that would encompass generations, for a generation or two, himself.  Rather than do the Puzo version finally thrown back at him, he waited an eternity, and finally realized this, his last finished project.  That ellipse of a decade or so between conception and completed movie is paralleled in the film, itself, by Robert De Niro's (""Noodles'"") opium dream of the  American twentieth century, its promises, and betrayals.  Naturally, Leone was betrayed, once again, himself, by America, and this truly amazing film, with its densely multi-layered, overlapping flashback structure was butchered upon its release, becoming a linear-plotted sub-Godfather knockoff in the process. Luckily, the critics had grown up enough in the meantime to finally get a glimmering of what Leone was up to, and demand restitution.  Very few saw it properly in theaters, but the video version respects the director's intentions, more or less.  Ironically, Leone had foreseen television screen aspect ratios as determining home viewing of the future, and abbreviated his usual wide screen format for this movie, so this most troubled last project was the first released on video to most properly  resemble the true cinematic experience.  For diehard fans of the Eastwood westerns impatient with this at first, watch those movies till you want and need more.  This will eventually get to you.  For art film fanatics who don't get the earlier Leones, travel in the reverse direction, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is the movie that Leone spent a decade conceiving. It will deliver for decades of viewing to come."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","134","269","26 November 2005"," Leone's ""Godfather"" Version, And About As Good
","This Godfather-type film was done by Sergio Leone, of spaghetti-western fame, so you know you will see and experience several of his trademarks. Namely: (1) a lot of facial closeups; (2) some slow-motion or slow-moving dramatic scenes; (3) good overall photography and (4) a unique soundtrack.<br/><br/>The period sets here are magnificent. You get a real feel of the time, whether it's 1910, 1933 or 1967. The colors are awash in blacks, browns and grays and the DVD brings all these out very well, especially considering the film is over 20 years old.<br/><br/>Despite some of Leone's slow moments, this is a fascinating film to watch for the story, too. There are numerous memorable scenes, some of them involving some downright shocking violence, even for today's movies. However, the amount of violence is less than what you see today.<br/><br/>The movie also sports an interesting twist near the end involving the two major characters, played by Robert De Niro and James Woods. The story is not always clear, either, so be prepared to be possibly confused about a few things....at least on the first viewing. Confused or not, this film always is fascinating to view, especially with intense actors such as the two men just mentioned, along with Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Joe Pecsi, Burt Young, Treat Williams and more.<br/><br/>The child actors in here take up almost half the movie and are excellent. What an injustice they don't receive any publicity for their acting, especially the kids who played De Niro and Woods as youngsters. One of the girls has become a famous adult actress: Jennifer Connelly. She was 12 years old in this film and was already alluring.<br/><br/>This is Godfather-type crime movie that ranks right up there with that famous film, not taking a back seat to it at all."
"Killakai","5","95","187","12 June 2007"," A long ride in a broken time machine
","I have a rule, if a movie goes past that 2 hour range it has to be really good. 3 hours, it must be epic, and 4 hours, well...you get the picture. I have this rule because the only thing worse than a bad movie is a bad movie thats really long. This movie wasn't really bad, but was really just OK, and definitely not worth the 4 hour run time (directors cut). <br/><br/>The back story of how the characters grew up and was good and the plot, sets and costumes made up for the bad kid acting in the first section of the film, but things go way downhill from there.<br/><br/>First off, the movie is like a ride in a broken time machine. why does the director or editor think its appropriate to jump around from decade to decade? How does that help tell the story? It doesn't, it just makes a long and complicated story very difficult for the viewer to follow (and I had the subtitles on so i didn't miss a word). The dialogue gives the actors very little to work with as Deniro has a blank stare throughout the film. Then there is the timing of the delivery, its like: who is it? [10 seconds later] its me. And I'm left thinking, wtf? Is that extra 10 seconds supposed to be 'dramatic'? Well its not its annoying and in a film this long, you'd think you'd want to keep the action moving. <br/><br/>There are a few scenes where Max (james woods) is able to show us his ability to act but it happens in a way that makes the story seem unbelievable. I am left thinking, good acting but why would this character behave like that? This guy goes from never robbing a bank, to wanting to rob the federal reserve? its just too stupid, and Max isn't that stupid.<br/><br/>The love story that develops makes absolutely no sense and is interrupted with other scenes of random and quite disturbing bizarreness. I could go on, but unlike Sergio Leone, I know when to stop. The movie had a good start and a good premise, but the plot went everywhere, too many people did too many things that didn't make sense, none of the characters are electrifying, and the film is just waaay too long to be enjoyable in spite of all of that."

I mean, just like Driving Miss Daisy or Blues Brothers or what have you Hollywood must add a Jewish dimension to green light a movie. Watching this three hour long film made me realize Star Wars is a more realistic story than this film which would never happen in America or anywhere else.<br/><br/>Sorry but I have to be frank here."
"MovieAddict2016","10","150","305","19 August 2003"," On par with ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas""...
","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a film set free of time; it spans many different years and, like ""Citizen Kane,"" never tells the audience where it is. As many times as I watch it, I can never guess what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>And watching ""Once Upon a Time in America"" on the new extended DVD is like revisiting an old friend, finally seeing a masterpiece in its entirety. Many people complained of the choppiness in the three-hour-version of the film originally released in 1984 - and the new four hour version puts all the pieces together and is truly marvelous to behold.<br/><br/>This is the dirty, gritty version of ""The Godfather."" It has an incredible amount of violence, especially for a film made almost twenty years ago. I'm not sure how much violence, sexual content and so on was in the original cut, but this extended version is pretty close to an NC-17 rating.<br/><br/>The film stars Robert De Niro in one of his most memorable yet forgotten roles. He plays Noodles, a gangster operating sometime during the 1930s. Noodles grew up during the early 1900s, and on the streets he and four other kids started their own crime operation. After a local crime lord named Bugsy gets jealous and murders the youngest member of Noodles' operation, Noodles returns the favor and kills Bugsy. Apprehended by police, Noodles is sent to jail for years.<br/><br/>Sometime, years later, Noodles is released into the free world. He isn't a changed man, either. His old crime buddy Max (James Woods) picks him up and introduces him to the old gang members. Soon they are back in business, working for Frankie (Joe Pesci). <br/><br/>This is the truest definition of an epic. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is one of the most forgotten gangster films, and yet it is ironically one of the best. It took director Sergio Leone almost ten years to get this motion picture to the screen. Sergio's original script treatment - the outline for the story - was 200 pages long. Just the outline. Soon he employed numerous writers to redo the script, and they bounced it up to 400 pages. There is a saying that for every page in a film script, there is one minute of screen-time. You do the math. <br/><br/>After the long scriptwriting process, they then had to get permission to film the movie, from the author of the novel this film is based upon. Then, after that struggle, there came the film itself. How to turn such a bold narrative into a compelling film? What techniques should be used? Where to start?<br/><br/>The beginning of the film opens up during the 1930s or sometime around then, fast-forwards to the 1960s, then flashbacks to the early 1900s. It skips around a lot. This makes the viewer active, trying to figure out where and when they are. It is an element that gives a film rewatchability. Roger Ebert pointed out that ""Citizen Kane"" is set free of chronology, and the same goes for ""Once Upon a Time in America."" <br/><br/>Sergio Leone is the master of extreme close-ups and wide frame shots, seen in ""Fistful of Dollars"" and here with wide shots of busy streets. In one scene a young girl (pre-stardom Jennifer Connelly) walks along a street, and Leone pulls the camera up, up, up and back, back, back, revealing the entire street. Soon she is lost in the crowd. The same thing is done with De Niro's character as a child, and we lose image of him in the crowd, but then Sergio uses an almost invisible dissolve and we come back upon him.<br/><br/>The acting by De Niro is superb. His character, Noodles, is probably the character in this film who is most in-touch with his feelings. We often feel for him, but numerous times in the film he does things disturbing and sickening and we are repulsed. One scene extended in the DVD is the controversial rape scene between De Niro and Elizabeth McGovern. After it is all over, Noodles climbs out of the back seat of the car and walks to the side of the road, standing there, looking into the distance. Many people say this is guilt because he knows what he has done and is ashamed. I don't think so. During the film he rapes numerous women and doesn't seem to mind at all. I think the point Leone was trying to make is that De Niro's character has no idea how to treat or respect women. His entire life he grew up around women who were treated as objects (such as the young prostitute who lived in his apartment complex). So when Noodles stands by the side of the road, this is not from the guilt of what he has done - it is from the guilt of not knowing how to treat a woman, not knowing what to say, not knowing what to do. Not knowing how to respect her. His entire life he was taught that women were just there for pleasure, but when he stands by the road this is a sign that Noodles is starting to think this may all be wrong. It is the guilt of naivety, not self-awareness.<br/><br/>""Once Upon a Time"" is the master of gangster flicks. Two other tremendous gangster flicks, ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas,"" have gotten the respect they rightfully deserve over the years - but ""Once Upon a Time in America"" has been seemingly ignored - up until know. I hope that this DVD sparks a newfound interest in the film, because no one should go a lifetime without seeing this moving motion picture."

","I've seen a lot of great reviews for this movie, along the lines of, 'it's great, one of the best of all time', etc. I really have to disagree. This movie was just too slow for me to sit through. I am usually a great fan of Sergio Leone's work, and I love most things with DeNiro and even James Woods, but I just couldn't sit through this movie.<br/><br/>The pacing wouldn't have been a problem if the story were better, but I felt that it just meandered through a lot of scenes and recollections that were unnecessary. Some of the comedic scenes, for example between the 'young' DeNiro and Woods characters and the cop, were too slap-sticky and didn't ring true. those scenes would've been more in place in an Italian movie, perhaps like 'yesterday, today, and tomorrow.' It just didn't ring true for the Lower East Side during prohibition.<br/><br/>To the people who say, 'if it's too slow for you, why don't you go watch Armageddon or something,' I can only respond that I loved The Seven Samurai, and also the Seventh Seal, two magnificent movies, which were slowly paced but still riveting. Once Upon a Time in America does not stack up to them. It doesn't measure up to the Godfather(s), or even Miller's Crossing.<br/><br/>A noble effort, visually very beautiful, but guaranteed to put you to sleep."

"tgdane","10","123","249","6 January 2002"," An operatic epic
","Once Upon a Time in America, which bookends Once Upon a Time in the West as director Sergio Leone's best work, is a powerhouse of a movie. A gangster epic told in a very different style than the standard of the genre, The Godfather, it is in some ways (at least to this viewer) even more emotionally compelling. Although the movie was sabotaged upon release by an edited studio version eliminating about 40% of its original length, the version now available for rental is thankfully the nearly 4 hour version intended by Leone.  The story is at essence a basic one about friendship among thieves, telling the story of a group of Jewish kids in New York near the turn of the century who grow up to become powerful and ruthless mobsters, while maintaining (or trying to) their bond with one another.  As was most famously done in the taxi scene between Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront, the movie again makes the point that bad people can have good aspects to them, such as loyalty, devotion, and even love. I think this movie includes one of Deniro's best roles, and far and away James Woods best film work. The score, by arguably the greatest movie composer of all time, Ennio Morricone, is incredibly haunting in its beauty and sadness (with no fewer than three separate themes that are breathtakingly beautiful).  The non-chronological manner in which the story is told results in a wonderfully effective narrative device:  the movie begins and ends with the same scene.  The first time you see the scene, it is a frantic jumble, without meaning or context, and you do not know why it is so important.  When the scene recurs at the end of the film, everything has become clear, and the scene has an incredible poignancy and sadness to it:  although it occurs in the middle of events chronologically, you realize that, in a real sense, life stopped at this point for one of the film's main characters.  There is no other event that matters anymore to him. This is not a simple movie, and it merits repeated viewings.  Indeed, in my view one cannot fully appreciate the greatness of the film until the second viewing, when the full story is known, and the  events of the film resonate with knowledge of where they ultimately, and tragically, lead."
"milanbaros_948","10","139","284","28 August 2005"," Epic
","Leone's beautiful vision met with an epic story to create one of the most beautiful movies of all time. Four hours long but time melts away as you are transported into New York. In a movie where the importance of time is stressed, and how it should not be wasted, it is pleasing that this considerably long movie does not waste, rather enhance your time. Instead of regretting lost time we are instead left exhilarated and wondering. Performances all-round are fantastic right from the child performances, 'Noodles, I slipped' to the aged De Niro with a look in his eye that he has seen it all before. His weariness is astonishingly realistic and applause should be directed at De Niro and his method. A true masterpiece."
"Quinoa1984","10","142","291","19 October 2003"," A sprawling, deliberately paced, and generally a superbly crafted piece of work
","It's been said that when one watches a ""spaghetti"" western (one of the ""Man with no name"" films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good. <br/><br/>It's a story of life-long friends, in the tradition of the Godfather movies with obvious differences, and the story cuts back and forth to Noodles (De Niro) in his old age returning from exile, looking back on his childhood in Brooklyn, his rise to power with his partners, and the twists come quite unexpectedly. The pace is slow, but not detrimental, and it gives the viewer time to let the emotions sink in. The story is also non-linear, and yet doesn't give away facts to the viewer- this is something that more than likely influenced Tarantino (and many others) in style. By the end, every detail that has mounted up makes the whole experience rather fulfilling, if not perfect. Finally, I'd like to point out the exceptional musical score. Ennio Morricone, as it says on this site, has scored over four hundred films in forty years, including Leone's movies. This would have to be, arguably, one of his ten best works- his score is equally lively, saddened, intense, and perhaps majestic for a gangster epic. Overall, it's filled with the same spirit Leone had in directing the picture, and it corresponds beautifully- there are some scenes in this film that would simply not work without the strings.

","SPOILER WARNING: IN MY ENHTUSIASM TO EXPRESS HOW MUCH I DESPISED THIS MOVIE I DIVULGE DETAILS THAT WILL RUIN IT FOR YOU  EVEN THOUGH WATCHING IT WILL DO THE SAME.<br/><br/>Though my favorite genre, having watched dozens of gangster movies dozens of times each, I hated this movie. It shows evidence in practically every part how it tries to be like Godfather I & II yet fails miserably. It's worse than the worse parts of GF III and Mobsters. This is why ...<br/><br/>I found no reason to care about any of the characters, or want to follow them through the maze of scenes. In GF II we cared so much about Vito and Michael we anticipated every scene. We felt Vito's pain seeing his own mother killed by Mafioso and we so badly wanted to see his own children escape from under the same social threat that we hailed Michael's rise to the top and forgave both their misgivings. This willingness to empathize and forgive was so powerful we watched it eagerly even after seeing essentially the same story the year before in GF I. In 'America' any anticipation comes only from waiting for something meaningful to happen  and the growing disappointment after each scene fails to deliver.<br/><br/>The main character Noodles has no heart and is despicable: he slunk away after his friends were killed and raped the love of his life. Frustrated or not do you think a Corleone would rape anyone  let alone their loved one? The director also attempts to endear to us the other 4 crewmembers - an impossible task even in 3.5 hours  and fails by forcing likability on them like the scenes are forced on nostalgic backdrops. As children one crewmember chooses a fancy desert instead of using it as currency for a romp with a child harlot, one 3' tall calls a seasoned middle-aged gangster ""paisan"" and throughout the story another plays a sad tune on the harmonica  likable traits sure, but not nearly enough to leach a single tear as they burn to death in a car while you wonder why.<br/><br/>Lines and characters are inconsistent, contrived and outright stupid like Wood's girlfriend's minor disrespect causing him to yell 7 times ""SHUT UP!"". He was supposed to be the strongest and smartest but what kind of gangster needs to yell, or pretend to throw away a girlfriend, to earn respect? When a dying friend utters ""I slipped Noodles"" Deniro later refers to it as a life defining moment. What a crock. ""I made him an offer he can't refuse"" or ""I don't want to kill everyone Tom, just our enemies"" are also simple lines but they elicit respect without a character pushing it on us.<br/><br/>Mario Puzo was masterful with the way he wove together different eras in GFII perfectly clarifying what era you were watching regardless the scene. Leone's attempt was annoying and confusing. You can blame American editing that Noodles disappears early in the movie - which makes as little sense as his return  but not the mixture of same era scenes that don't even blend - even in the European version. Though much scenery elicited pleasant thoughts of days-gone-by the fact it was shot over 10 years takes toll, the resulting visual effect - exasperated by a lame 60-year long story line - causes you to feel like you're in a different movie in every scene.<br/><br/>Scenes too are contrived and inconsistent, like a peaceful beach scene where James Woods blows up angrily for no reason that's followed with an out-of-place disturbed seagull flock flying off toward a sunset; a scene which, I believe, is a poor attempt to match the GF II lakefront scene with Frido screaming, ""I'm smart, and I deserve respect."" The pathetic Frido scene is timely and makes sense, he was being coaxed to come clean, he was weak and stupid, and it showed Michael's resolve to stay in power  even when faced with familial betrayal. The Wood's scene, hell most of the movie, comes across as a ridiculous concoction of mob flick and Chris Cross music video.<br/><br/>I was so mad I bought this movie that I had to watch it three times to try to understand why it was made that way and why I hated it so much. As a writer I wanted to make sure I never ever create anything so bloody terrible. Many mob movies were made in the 80's because America loves them  but this one is the worse attempt of all to capitalize on that market. You will never love it like you loved GF, not even close  trust me."

","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is probably the most difficult film I have ever encountered in terms of completing an overall accurate cinematic criticism. This movie just grows in myth and debate as the years come and go. Co-writer/director Sergio Leone (who became an international success with ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" in the late-1960s) could not really figure out what to do with the complicated novel ""Hoods"" when adapted to the silver screen. He struggled through with writes, re-writes and several versions of this production. Every version seemingly has more questions than the one before. There are six screenwriters credited. In the end the final product (the very long running 229-minute version) is one of those films that cannot really be talked about. If you try to talk about this production with someone unfamiliar with it, you will leave them dumb-founded and completely confused. Elements of time, situations, heart of the story and characterization get mixed up into a long and winding road of a movie that is extremely deep and definitely complicated. An elderly Jewish man in the 1960s (Robert DeNiro with heavy makeup) comes back to his old New York neighborhood and goes on a quiet and sad journey of remembrance and personal loss. Flashbacks to the early-1920s start quickly as we see a young group of Jewish adolescents in New York (Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, Adrian Curran and Brian Bloom among them) run around town and take advantage of hard-core criminal syndicates and dim-witted beat police officers. The group is wise beyond their years. They have street-smarts that put them into a high class of law-breakers. Early problems develop and brutal multiple murders take place by Tiler. He is sent to prison for the better part of the 1920s and returns in the 1930s in the form of Robert DeNiro. The other youngsters have grown up to become James Woods (in his first legitimate screen role), William Forsythe and James Hayden. DeNiro's reunion comes and goes like a lightning strike and the group gets back to old crime basics. By this time Prohibition is a way of life for the gangsters of major U.S. metropolitan areas and the quartet takes full advantage of that opportunity to run wild around the city and create immense profits for themselves. Killing men in their way and even at times raping women in their path becomes a norm as the production advances. Other characters leave almost as fast as they appear. Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams and Danny Aiello make such short runs that if you are not paying attention closely you might miss them. The women make more pronounced impressions. Youngster Jennifer Connelly grows to become Elizabeth McGovern (DeNiro's childhood love who has aspirations of acting and singing professionally) and Woods finds companionship with the ultra-erotic and smart-mouthed Tuesday Weld (doing her best work by a mile). As the movie continues, DeNiro and Weld develop a bond of hate that turns into mutual respect and eventually they even become the oddest of friends. Woods and DeNiro have a mutual unspoken brotherly love that translates into one of the most important relationships in the history of the movies (DeNiro and Al Pacino would later share a similar bond in the vastly under-rated ""Heat"" some 11 years later). As all this happens though we begin to wonder if all we are seeing is the true reality. A dream-like beginning (which supposedly shows the fates of the four criminals) does not always fit with an amazingly strange final 30 minutes that seems to defy convention, time constraints for the characters and major cinematic screen-writing principles. Symbolism that has always been prevalent in the Italian cinema also comes into play here and these symbols may indeed hold the true answers to the mysteries within. And then again, maybe not. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" was Sergio Leone's final film and it grows in myth and legend due to that fact. Much like similar movies like ""Giant"" (James Dean's final performance) and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (Stanley Kubrick's hypnotic final production), this movie just seems to go into a higher stratosphere of Hollywood that totally ignores the typical norms that are always in association with other big-name movie products. James Hayden even died of an apparent drug overdose shortly after this film was initially released while performing on Broadway. And thus the legends grow and multiply. Overall in the end I do believe that ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is arguably the finest movie of the 1980s. It is definitely a unique production that stands near the paramount of a decade that was mired in stupid comedies, teen flicks and endless horror movie installments. DeNiro is truly a revelation once again here and he dominates most in a production of seemingly endless wonderful performances. The movie is one of those that should be studied and analyzed over and over by those who really want to get to the root of cinematic history and development. Much like its running time, the excellence of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is nearly immeasurable. 5 stars out of 5."

","Once Upon a Time in America is Sergio Leone's epic tale of the lives of four Jewish gangsters in New York City.

Next glue your butt to the chair. This movie moves slower than molasses. Each and every scene is so bloody long drawn. I could not watch it beyond 21 minutes. The movie starts slow. It remains slow.

","If you like Leone's films from the 60's like The Good the Bad and the Ugly, For a Few Dollars More and Once Upon A Time in the West, then you may be in for a shock if you expect a similar film in Once Upon A Time in the West. <br/><br/>This is the first film Leone directed in 13 years from the the last film he directed in 1971 'Duck you sucker'. I don't know what happened to him in his personal life in those 13 years but it shows in this film. A film is in a lot of ways a reflection of the director, his taste, his morals, his emotions. And to me this film was dull, at times disgusting, confusing and depressing. It's nothing like the vibrant TGBU or the emotional For a few dollars more. To me, after TGBU, Leone was on the decline. Even though there were some nice scenes in Once upon a time in the West (especially at the end), the story and the characters were lacking.<br/><br/>Leone's style became more pretentious as he attempted to make more 'serious' films. You can see that mostly in the endless closeups of the actors faces while they speak their often vague dialogue. It looks like Leone was trying to hard to be 'deep' and 'intense' to the point where he lost the humanity in his characters and they became his puppets trying too hard to impress us when we couldn't identify with any of them. <br/><br/>That's the main problem with this film as well. It's hard to care for any of the characters because they are all quite inhuman. The motives of the characters are never really revealed which makes it hard for us to identify with them and we're completely disconnected from them, as they start doing things that make us cringe, like rape, for instance. <br/><br/>After more than an hour viewing this film, I'm wondering what I'm watching and why. For the most part..I just don't care. There's nothing to draw you in and interest you. Sure the cinematography is nice, the score and the set pieces are impressive. These are the three things that deceive people into believing that they're watching a quality film. A lot of people who like this film are huge fans of Leone and that alone makes them bias. Also the fact that this was Leone's dream project and final film makes a lot of fans of refer to this film as the greatest film that Leone made which to me is laughable. The final reason I can think of why people would like this film is because it's vague. As I mentioned; there's a lot of close-ups on actors faces with a dramatic music in the background. Some people (while viewing these) will think of events that took place in their own lives and be moved by those and feel like it's the movie doing this to them which is not the case. <br/><br/>It's sad how Leone made one of the best films of all time in TGBU and ended his career with this depressing, long and troubling film. This film is often compared to the Godfather(2) but they have absolutely nothing in common other than the fact that both are 'gangsterfilms'."

","When I found this tape in my collection, I was astounded that I had missed it when it came out. The cast list reads like a who's who of awesome actors, suited perfectly for a gangster movie. And Sergio Leone directing! Wow! I read several reviews comparing this movie to the Godfather and Goodfellas, and was over the moon to see it. I set my machine up, got ready and sat down. An hour and a half later (I fast forwarded through so much of it) I was dulled to the point of near madness. The cinematography was great, and brilliantly imaged, but literally nothing of importance happened in this entire movie. The characters were unsympathetic with back stories of little to no relevance or interest. The plot dragged on ad nauseum, padded by long close ups of ""dramatic"" faces staring contemplatively as if they knew something we didn't. Oh they did, and that was that you should go to bed early and skip this one entirely. The few action scenes were few and far between, and the interminable dialog and love interest offal seemed to drag forever. Maybe I missed something, because I had to fast forward through a lot of this movie, something I rarely do, but I just couldn't stand it after the overwhelming pretentiousness of each character's chatter. Worst of all, nothing happened of interest. Nothing. It was as if the movie were made for the sole purpose of getting Oscar attention, without any nod to entertainment value. If you make a period gangster film, make it better than a History Channel documentary. the only redeeming quality of this film was the cinematography and the old cars. Instead, just watch Godfather and then go to a car show."
"DrLenera","Null","30","55","13 September 2005"," Not simply the greatest of gangster movies,but one of the greatest movies ever,a multi-layered,melancholic masterpiece that demands repeated viewings
","Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It's nearly four hours long,and demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.<br/><br/>Reminiscent at times of some very old gangster films such as The Roaring Twenties,one will find almost every gangster movie cliché one can find-one can imagine Leone half remembering bits and pieces from films he saw as a youth. However,he never glamourises his protagonists-he may dare us to like Robert De Niro's 'Noodles'-a murderous thug and rapist who always seems to make the wrong decisions-but that's different from glamourising him. The notorious rape scene is all the more hard to watch because its painful to watch Noodles try to destroy himself and his girlfriend by going through with it.<br/><br/>What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past. Therefore,starting in mid-plot in the 1930s,than flashing back and forth in time,was the right choice {if initially confusing!}. This is the culmination of Leone's increasing interest in the flashback structure-think especially of the parallel story told in A Fistful of Dynamite's flashbacks.<br/><br/>There is action,but it's mostly quick and brutal,and there is also humour,such as a very funny scene set to Rossini's Thieving Magpie where the gangsters are loose in a hospital filled with babies. However,the broody,melancholic tone never really goes away,and towards the end,the film grinds to a virtual halt. Be warned,there is no action climax,just a series of somewhat oblique dialogue scenes and revelations.<br/><br/>The expected Leone flamboyancy is hardly to be found,but the film still often soars most when dialogue is kept to a minimum and Ennio Morricone's gorgeous music takes over. Some of the most brilliant scenes just consist of Noodles seeing and reflecting. In one especially effective and poignant scene near the end,an old Noodles is leaving his love Deborah as her achingly sad theme plays,and he sees her son,who is the spitting image of,well,I try to avoid spoilers! As the music changes into the still sad but more majestic main theme,the camera slowly zooms,as it often does,into Noodles' sad eyes. We go to what is initially a blur,until we realise it's curtains. The person who holds the key to all this appears,like a ghost,through the curtains and goes onto a balcony,from where he sees the same 'son' with a girlfriend. Sheer brilliance,and not a gun in sight! <br/><br/>Of course De Niro is great,but he's obviously very restrained and reflective. It's James Woods who really dominates,so dynamic here,this should have made him a big star. One must also mention Tonni Delli Colli,who photographs three time periods with slightly different hues but still subtly.<br/><br/>Leone's original cut was five hours and if you want to be picky there are holes in the plot. Leone leaves a great many things ambiguous,but shouldn't all great art ask questions? Once Upon A Time In America is not necessarily easy viewing,but it IS great art,the final statement of one of the best filmmakers of all time."

","This film looked beautiful and pitting Jennifer Connelly to play a young Elizabeth McGovern is a brilliant piece of casting. But the rest of the film falls terribly short. The story is all over the place, the direction is utterly confusing, the script is laughable and, despite the great cast, the acting is pathetic at best. I've seen two versions of this film and it gets worse and worse every time. I'm not too sure how director Sergio Leone envisioned this film, but it felt like Leone lost his focus and tried to put two small overblown films into one hugely overblown film. How on earth this film got onto IMDb's top 250 is beyond me. I think Once Upon a Time in America may fall into the category of being ""voted"" a great film based on the names in the cast and production crew."
"newkophile","2","53","105","2 January 2007"," A fully restored disaster
","Warning: SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Viewing the special feature for this film, it's evident that the slashing of this otherwise very long film on its first theatrical release was responsible for the poor initial reception and attendant reviews. Now that the full 3 hour and 50 minute version is available on two DVD discs, I see absolutely no cause for celebration. The slow pacing (the phone ringing sequence especially egregious), witless dialog and most importantly, the wholly unsympathetic characterizations themselves, make me wish I had committed myself to doing anything else at all.<br/><br/>DeNiro as ""Noodles"" and Woods as ""Max"" are the main figures of a close knit Jewish gang of four, their religious background evident solely when they occasionally use a Yiddishism, e.g., ""mazel"". Otherwise, they kill, rape (apparently Noodles' preferred form of sexual advance whether it be with a woman betraying her husband in a large jewelry caper - Tuesday Weld's otherwise nymphomaniacal Carol - or with a woman he supposedly loves (Elizabeth McGovern's wholesome Jewish ""Deborah"") or for no apparent psychological reason get high in a Chinese opium den. We have no idea in this film that encapsulates several time periods what Noodles has been doing for 35 years in Buffalo and when we find out the reason he has been summoned back home, it's just simply ludicrous and not credible for words. As for the soundtrack that's been lauded elsewhere, I don't know how many times anyone else can listen to the syrupy ""Amapola"" tune, but I had my fill pretty quickly. But read your Ebert (four stars no less!) and see what you think."

In a movie like this, original music would have been better. Number two, the James Woods' character fakes his death and reinvents himself as a politician and none of his old friends from the neighborhood recognized him as his original person. Also, as great as DeNiro is, he portrayed a Jewish gangster better in Casino but will always look like who he is which is Italian. I can go on and on but I'll happily re-watch the film and add to how not to make an epic movie or you can just watch the Godfather or Goodfellas."

","This has to be the most boring gangster film I've ever seen.  Basically it's about Robert DeNiro and James Wood's friendship over fifty years or so as they rise and fall in the gang world.  It's interesting to do it about Jewish gangsters, because most films center on Italian gangsters, but their being Jewish didn't seem to make much difference in the film.  DeNiro and Woods were subdued, and I didn't buy for a second that they actually might care about one another.  The female lead and DeNiro had no chemistry.  Leone centered more on cinemetography than story, and the little story there was was painfully streched out to almost three and a half hours.  Speaking of the cinemetography- sure there were some very nice images, but basically they were going for the same look as ""The Godfather"" only maybe with a little more of a golden nostolgia feel for it.  I don't mind slowly paced films, but that deliberate pace must be used to draw the viewer into the film, the pace of ""Once Upon a Time,"" just makes the viewer wish that he had commited suicide instead of having to watch it. I'm not a big gangster film fan, but this one ranks low among gangster films.  It lacks the visual pop of ""Goodfella's,"" the emotional intensity of ""Miller's Crossing,"" the cultural/historic significance of ""Godfather,"" the moralistic elements of ""Angels with Dirty Faces,"" or the acting prowess of ""White Heat.""  And it is certainly a lot more boring than any of the above films listed."

","Noodles returns to the New York of his youth in response to an invitation to come and meet.  His return is his first for half his life having fled New York to avoid being killed for ratting out his gangster friends.  His return is mysterious and he doesn't know why he has been summoned.  His return sparks memories of his childhood and adulthood growing up in the area with his friends and eventual business partners.<br/><br/>A three and a half hour movie may not be everyone's idea of fun.  On the other hand, many people who see a running time over 180 minutes immediately assume it is an epic that must be `the greatest film ever made'. In this case the time is worth the effort, even if it a little luxurious and overlong.  The plot is too sweeping to go into detail, encompassing 30 years in the main part and a further 30 by way of suggestion.  Basically it comes down to Noodles memories of his life when he was growing up, up till the point we find him now, as an old man with little but those memories.  As a story this is moving and involving.  There are maybe too many lingering shots of Noodles staring into the distance but these don't feel as lazy as they have in other films.<br/><br/>Noodles past and the misery of him now is involving enough, but the main thread is Noodle's past, both childhood and adulthood in crime and love. The sheer detail that must be covered is well done.  The film not only includes many major events but also minor things like the scene where the boy is tempted to eat a cream cake!  This mix is very rewarding and makes it feel a lot more detailed than it actually is.  The story is a real feel of several generations of crime and is very involving.<br/><br/>The cast make the film and hold the attention during the scenes that are longer than they should be etc.  De Niro convinces as youth and bitter old man and holds the eye easily as both.  Woods is much better than usual even if his character is the same.  McGovern is good considering she has a minor role, but as an `old woman' she looks the same as she was when she was young.  Actors like Williams, Aiello, Forsythe, Hayden etc easily fill out the gangster etc roles without falling into cliché or caricature.  Just as rewarding are the child actors who carry the first hour of the film.  Not only do they actually look like the actors in question, but they also do a very good job.  There are some bum notes but they do mange the innocence of youth with the emotional basis for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent  both gritty streets but with an affectionate slant of Noodles' memories.  The direction is made almost perfect by the use of Ennio Morricone's score.  It is at once haunting but slightly warming and `Debra's theme' has become one of my favourite tunes.  The overall effect is one of a rich tapestry that eventually weaves into a very personal epic of regret and loss.<br/><br/>An excellent film that deserves to be recognised as both one of the great crime epics but also a personal and moving film."

There is just SO much screen time used ineffectively.

","Sergio Leone, best known as the godfather of spaghetti Westerns, here makes a film about a gangster called Noodles. With its broad historical sweep, achronological story lines, three hour-plus runtime and generous score (written by longtime collaborator Ennio Morricone), it's nothing if not ambitious. Indeed, some of the balletic collages of music and images in this movie resemble no other film more than '2001: A Space Oddysey', which is certainly not something you can say of most gangster movies. Unfortuantly, the dialogue and characterisation are not as strong as the imagery, the conclusion to the plot doesn't quite convince (or indeed, pack a big enough punch to wholly satisfy after a movie of this length), and at times the film seems almost to endorse its central characters' crude, and sometimes sexually violent, world view. It features a handsome leading couple in Robert de Niro and Elisabeth McGovern; but it's a shame that its substance is not as distinctive as the style."

Sergio Leone, is just one example – he joins the list of Pasolini, Bertolucci, etc....<br/><br/>I grew up thinking 'Once Upon A Time In The West' (and his other aptly named 'spaghetti 'westerns) were OK, until I revisited Leone's work years later – only then realizing how foolishly written and overblown they all were!

(and we're supposed to believe this toy would sound like Gheorghe Zampfir!!) You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. No matter what ridiculous sums of money you poor into a sloppy patch-work of a script in attempts to make it visually impressive - it still remains foolish. Seems most audiences are not so easily fooled as some critics and Hollywood types – this 30 million dollar splurge returned a measly $5 million. So, it's beginning to look like many of the 'rave' reviews may have been posted by some of those who lost 'BIG' money and just might be attempting to mark up some losses. After all, this is the picture that almost ruined the Ladd Company.<br/><br/>The lush symphonic music all seems to have come from another film (in 'Once in America's' case it did! and sounds like it's still looking for the other movie!) Along with sumptuous photography it's all just a further attempt to dress up a ridiculous convoluted script - written by nine different writers! - then given a confusing shape to hide plot holes and poor development of character. Here is a movie overflowing with just about every type of perversion: repugnant brutality, extreme sexual immorality with violence, drugs, glorification of criminals and the gun - it simply drags on ad nauseous for more than 3 hrs of over-the-top ugliness. They say you must see this long version but the short Vera (still too long at near 2 1/2hrs) might have helped.

The film keeps a very slow pace throughout, and as a result becomes entrancing and before to long you really start to hope you never leave the movie. You wish it wouldn't stop.

These are the plot's shortcomings, the creases that should be ironed out. On the other hand, some character contradictions can be explained. You know Noodles dug a deep hole and buried himself in it for 35 years, because he tells you and you also get it from the tone of his voice and the way he moves. Then you see him young again, rejected by the only woman he's passionately loved. His woman, as Max still calls her in their final conversation. You see Noodles lose the friends who shaped his entire world and his very existence, and bear that responsibility upon his shoulders. He's alone and weary.

He soon learns what makes him tick and is secretly in competition with his partner in crime. Max's feelings haven't been straightforward since the day the two met. He terribly needs to put his life as a gangster behind him, to find success in the legitimate world. On the contrary, Noodles couldn't care less about all that. Our romantic hero is reasonably happy with what he's got or, better yet, he doesn't think there's a lot more out there for him to take. He's only aware that he can't have Deborah, the girl who never ages in his loving eyes. Nothing would ease that pain. Then he's cheated out of the money by Max, the sad, sad traitor. When the two guys meet for the last time, it's hard to say which one is the loser. Max has suffered more. He's horribly missed his old friend and now needs to show him his guilt and accept his penance. At that point, though, Noodles cannot be forced to rewrite his life history. He doesn't believe another version of the truth will help him. ""We're old men, Senator Bailey, all we have is our memories. If we lose that, we'll have nothing left.""<br/><br/>We just learned a hard lesson. As our past poisons our present, truth doesn't have roots on firm ground. We'll live with sorrow and there's not a lot we can do about it. Are we ready to accept it?"

","Master of the Western Sergio Leone swapped Clint Eastwood for Robert DeNiro, Cowboys for Gangsters and the Wild West for an even wilder New York, with this seminal masterpiece. It was Leone's last film before his tragically early death at just 60, and although he was working on a big budget World War II film at the time of his demise, in a way that is tragically fitting as no film could have topped this one. Of course, whilst Leone naturally made his name in the sixties with the infamous Spaghetti western, the sheer sprawling grandeur of OUATIA is an unforgettable experience that attacks the senses. From the opening image of Robert DeNiro's opium filled body to the final scene some 229 minutes later, the sensation carries on throughout and hits home more powerfully than any cheroot-chewing Clint or twanging Morricone soundtrack ever did. DeNiro plays 'Noodles', a young man who grew up with his compatriots in Prohibition America, who then returns to his old haunts three decades later to reflect on his life as a hard-bitten gangster. Every scene is pitch perfect, and whilst there are some caps doffed to the likes of The Godfather, Leone doesn't hold back with scenes of rape, murder and brutality that give the film an edge sharper than a month's worth of Eastwood stubble. It's amazing in that Leone was returning to the helm of a movie for the first time in over a decade - there is no let up in the brilliance and certainly no signs of rustiness. And legendary collaborator Morricone is also back in tandem. Morricone delivers one of his most mesmerising scores and it was reported that DeNiro demanded some music be pre-written for scenes and then played back whilst they were being shot just so he could pitch the mood of his character. It's hard to say that this is Morricone's best work because his career is generously decorated with brilliant soundtracks, but it's also the case that 'Deborah's Theme', for example, is even played at funerals these days, such is the power of the music. Even Lennon and McCartney's 'Yesterday' gets an airing. James Woods and Elizabeth McGovern provide faultless support from the cast, but this is a movie of colossal brilliance and will rightfully live on for many decades to come."
"kentuckyfriedpanda42","10","18","36","21 August 2007"," Extraordinary film. Reminds me why I love cinema.
","I love this film. It is one of the films that truly made me fall in love with cinema as an art form. ""Once Upon A Time In America"" is one of the rarest of films where all cinematic elements such as writing,directing,acting, cinematography and score simply fit together and compliment each other so perfectly.<br/><br/>The story concerns the rise and fall of Jewish gangsters in New York during the Prohibition period. However, there is much,much more to this film than that. In a post-Tarantino cinematic landscape, just about every crime or gangster film has a post-ironic, knowing sense of its own 'coolness' and posturing. Most of the time, this comes off as pretentious and lazy filmaking.<br/><br/>""Once Upon A Time In America"" is truly a film without irony. There is this very powerful sense of melancholy and regret that infuses just about every frame of the film where the characters are adults. In the early flashbacks to the characters as children, this is absent until the scene of Bugsy's murder and the subsequent arrest of Noodles.<br/><br/>There is an unforgettable and key scene with Noodles in the back of the police wagon waving goodbye to his friends as he's taken away to jail. The sense of regret and sheer emotional pain that Noodles will feel as the story and his life progresses is first evident in that extraordinary sequence.<br/><br/>This is an incredibly ambiguous film that is very much open to one's own interpretation. A viewer could watch the film believing that everything on screen takes place. However, another way of looking at the story is that nothing progressed past 1933 and that the 1968 sequences were in fact an opium-induced dream that Noodles was having while in the opium den. I can see both sides and try not to make a decision either way. I love how this film can be viewed and interpreted in so many ways.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is an absolute joy to behold. This is one of the best De Niro performances.While an unlikeable character, Noodles is a very interesting study of a broken life. He is matched every step of the way by an exceptional James Woods as Max. Woods has said that this is his favourite performance of his. The younger cast members, including a 10 year-old Jennifer Connelly, are especially effective during the flashback sequences.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film highly enough. Admittedly, it is a very demanding film upon its viewer. However, concentrate and the rewards will be immense. I still find myself going back to it every so often. This film and David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" are the two films that taught me a great deal about subtext and how to truly 'watch' and appreciate cinema when I was discovering a love for this art form.<br/><br/>For that, I'll always have a soft spot for this film. This is undoubtedly my pick as Leone's best film."
"arthurdaley69","5","15","29","22 June 2010"," Could have been so much better....
","After watching this movie over the weekend I was left with the impression that Sergio Leone would have been better served by going into more detail on the early part of the movie which was far more entertaining than the turgid middle section and the woeful last hour. I am normally very good at staying with a movie that jumps around but this was a nightmare. It might have made a genuine epic if the tale was told chronologically rather than the backward / forwards mess it became.<br/><br/>The story is too complex and tries to be all things to all men. Too many plot lines and incidental characters are introduced only for their purpose or contributions to be left unfinished so the viewer is ultimately unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Having said that I was impressed with the acting - James Woods, Robert De Niro (and even Danny Aiello) who all put in stellar performances.<br/><br/>Spanning several decades this movie was never going to be easy to squeeze into almost 4 hours on screen. While I found the first half gruesome, violent, funny and entertaining by turns overall I was disappointed with this 'epic' homage to the gangster. It felt like decades passed - particularly while watching the last hour."
"murtaza_mma","10","33","73","23 October 2011"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Leone's magnum opus and a testament to the free spirit of Art
","In order to cater to their everlasting lust for making money, the movie production studios have always endorsed the motto of quid pro quo – ""A favor in return of another"". Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur—by the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty—has had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality. <br/><br/>At the beginning of his career, Leone got widely proclaimed as a master of technique and style as he added new dimensions to cinematography and screenplay. Leone's directorial debut was 'A Fistful of dollars'. Movie's success was marred when Akira Kurosawa sued the production house for plagiarizing Yojimbo. Leone bounced back with 'For a Few More Dollars'. He single-handedly reinvented the Western genre by providing a completely different perspective to the Old West, which was hitherto portrayed as the battle ground for the epic battle of virtue versus vice in the backdrop of chivalry and machismo. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', Leone perpetuated what would become his trademark: Spaghetti Western. Leone's distinctive style included juxtapositions, super close- ups, long continuous shots, and the rotating camera shots. Leone's collaboration with master-composer Ennio Morricone gave cinema some of its most mellifluous compositions. Once Upon a Time in the West elevated Leone from the position of a showman to a serious movie-maker—an auteur capable of much profound works. Leone refused a multitude of projects, including the opportunity to direct 'The Godfather', in a bid to realize his dream project.<br/><br/>OUTA is an epic crime saga based on the lives of Jewish gangsters from their humble childhood in the ghettos of New York to their rise in world of organized crime. 'Noodles', 'Patsy', 'Cockeye', and little Dominic struggle as street kids in the East Side of Manhattan in the early 1920s. They work for 'Bugsy', a local gangster, until they meet 'Max' and decide to start an independent operation, triggering a series of incidents which changes their lives for ever. Robert De Niro as 'Noodles' gives one of the most subtle performances of his career. James Woods is chillingly menacing as 'Max'. Young 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly as 'Deborah' serves as a pulchritudinous delight for the sour eyes, and I say this as a testament to her ethereal, nymphean charm that was evident even at such a tender age. The rest of the cast gives a great support to the actors in lead with special mention of Elizabeth McGovern, James Hayden and Joe Pesci. The music is composed by Leone's long-time collaborator Ennio Morricone, who once again works his magic by creating music that is so plaintively divine that even Mozart would be proud of it. <br/><br/>The film poignantly explores the themes of love, lust, friendship, greed, betrayal and loss of innocence in the backdrop of the 20th century America. For the European release, Leone cut down his original version to 229 minutes to appease the distributors. However, for the US release, OUTA was ignominiously edited down to 139 minutes by the muddle-headed studio personnel against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative was omitted as the scenes were put back in the chronological order. Many of the movie's most beautiful shots are not present in the shorter version, including the nigh magical sequence in which time-switching is indicated by the conjuration of a Frisbee. Movie's abysmal show in the US is attributed to this sabotage. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film again.<br/><br/>The dreamlike screenplay of OUTA gives it a lyrical, almost hypnotic feel. OUTA is a tapestry of highly complex mesh work: the story depicts the lives of same individuals across three different timelines. The time-switching techniques used in the movie are so effective that the switching seems absolutely seem-less. The mystical ringing tone that the viewer gets to hear in the beginning of the movie provides a great subterfuge in unison with the dream-like finale, and adds surrealistic elements to the movie by raising doubts that the events depicted in the movie could well have been a part of a drug-induced dream that Noodles would have been experiencing under the hypnotic effect of opium. The movie has a multitude of unforgettable moments, which can be cherished again and again with the same levels of indulgence. The sequence in which little Dominic—caught between the want to satiate his newly attained puberty and the fundamental urges—buys a pastry to charm a neighborhood girl, but succumbs to the universal temptation and ends up eating it himself is pure gold. The scene which depicts Robert De Niro molesting his childhood love represents cinema at its most macabre. The make-up, set designing and costume designing are all top- notch. The make-up artists have gone about their business with such meticulousness that the actors seem to genuinely represent their character's age in each era. <br/><br/>Overall, OUTA is a testament to Sergio Leone's dedication to the free spirit of Art. It succeeds at multiple levels and makes the viewer go through an entire gamut of emotions, keeping him engaged throughout. It is sanguinary and is surfeited with blood-cuddling violence that makes it unsuitable for the weak-hearted. OUTA, however, is as a must for the enthusiasts of the genre and the cineastes worldwide. 10/10<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

"ssang","5","22","46","25 November 2006"," Final Verdict: Guilty of being OVERRATED and BORING
","I sat down to watch this movie last night and gave it my undivided and utmost attention to the director's cut DVD for 3 hrs and 49 minutes. Let me tell you that I am a bottom line guy. And the bottom line is that the movie, IMO is flat-out boring. I tried so hard after reading the overwhelming amount of positive reviews on it. In fact let's start with the positives. There are good aspects to the film.<br/><br/>I think there are some beautiful shots throughout the film. ALso, Leone really nailed the set. I mean the look and fell of the movie was awesoome. The prohibition day scenes in NYC are flawless in terms of the set and costumes. Also, I did enjoy some of the shocking scenes. There are some tense moments in the film. Also, I think that James Woods did a good but not great job. He was solid. Robert De Niro was very good as Noodles too. But De Niro is good in everything. He is great in Once Upon yet again.<br/><br/>Now...on to the negatives. For a movie that is 3 hrs and 49 minutes I couldn't believe how poorly the character relationships were developed. I never got into the characters. I cared about NONE of them. I didn't see why they were such good friends. It was poorly developed. There were no scenes that showed me why the crew were so endeared to each other. It seemed very forced. Also, the acting and dialouge was below average. That's right. I said it. I was bored out of my mind during this film. I tried sooooo hard. Everyone was wooden as an actor (minus Woods and De Niro and Danny Aiello). Elizabeth McGovern, who played the Deoborah, was terrible. She was sleeping through every line. No emotion. I just had zero connection with any of the main characters. Treat Williams....what was that role? I am getting mad just sitting here thinking about the lack of character development and the BORING dialouge. AGH! Also, for a gangster film it didn't have enough action. It really didn't.<br/><br/>I didn't like Once Upon A Time in America much at all. I love movies, and appreciate the great ones. But this one is overrated, folks. You couldn't pay me to sit through this one again. IT WAS BORING! AND I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING FOR ANY CHARACTERS. NONE. Now that I think about it....I actually hated the film. I thought, after reading reviews, there would be a 90% chance I loved it, a 9% chance I'd be indifferent towards it, and a 1% chance I'd hate it. I guess the 1% won out here. DAMN, what a disappointment!"
"ryancroc","3","36","82","4 June 2000"," A Huge Disappointment - Warning: Possible Spoilers
","With such a promising cast and a director that I have heard great things about, I was utterly disappointed by this film. It started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes.(and yes I did watch the full length version). I love Robert DeNiro and as usual he did a fine acting job, but in all his other gangster films, no matter how many people he kills, I always still had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a lowlife drug-addict, rapist with no care for anyone but himself. Also, James Woods, another fine actor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and he flipped out came completely out of left-field and towards the end the writers just throw in this random comment about how his father died in a nut house and that's why James Woods didn't like being called crazy. So much was left undeveloped in this movie.  Also, we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out more about Joe Pesci's character.  It seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids.  The story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job.  Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and I don't see how anyone can even compare this to the Godfather 1 and 2, or even Goodfellas. I am sad that I wasted four hours of my life watching this film"

","Like the curate's egg, OUTIA is good in parts. The sets are evocative, the camerawork masterful, the actors excellent. But there's got to be a plot here somewhere, boys and girls, and it's just not in evidence. Things happen, of course, and there are flashbacks to titillate the critics, and as I said the thing looks and acts beautifully. But there is no point to the whole, no compelling storyline to cling to through four hours of mishmash. My expectations were high, admittedly--OUTIA carries a lot of critical weight--but even if I had come into this movie cold, I would still have found it wanting. And I never, ever want to see it again."
"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","15","30","16 September 2002"," Tries so hard to be a classic.... and fails miserably
","The story of the movie takes place in three different layers - each being a certain part of the main protagonist's life. First, there is his adolescence, where he slowly turns from rascal to junior gangster. Then there is his adult life in his gang, and finally, his return as old man to his old home city, after 30 years of hiding in excile.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a crucial scene: The death of his gang. The rest of the movie tries to tell the story of that event - how it came about, mostly.<br/><br/>But all of this does not capture the spirit of the movie: The summary of the story pretends that there is some sort of development, some movement. Yet the movie manages to slowly ooze from set to set, from time layer to time layer, without ever generating excitement, without ever feeling as if the story was progressing. There is painfully little dialogue - and whatever there is is slow. How many times does one character ask a question, only to receive the answer after a long break, during which his opposite pretends to be lost in thought or emotion or just lost? As a consequence, none of the characters seem real. Given the cast and director, it is probably considered a sacrilege to point this out: But whatever they were doing for this movie, they were not in the least succeeding in portraying life, or lifelike performances. Perhaps on some other planet, frozen in liquid nitrogen, there are life forms with reaction times similar to those depicted in the movie - but on earth people tend to talk, and act, and live, a lot quicker. Stealing well over three hours of our lives for this movie is way too much.<br/><br/>The only explanation is that this movie tries to be a piece of art - not entertainment. Which would make it a fairly ugly piece of art, showing prostitution, sex, drugs, violence, perverted sex, rape and almost every element that could shock or thrill, but without thrilling. And there are only two scenes in the entire movie that manage to shock. If it is to be seen as art, then perhaps they should have told the story as a long series of still images, as opposed to a movie (i.e. similar to the French ""movie"" that inspired ""Twelve Monkeys""). That way, the entire thing would not have felt so awkward and out of place, and perhaps, it could be more appreciated. Especially the soundtrack, as background to a series of images, would have made this a piece of art. In this movie, it feels oddly dominating - where there is little talk, the music is very noticeable. It is the only character that won't shut up...<br/><br/>In the end, the movie tries so hard to be a classic, it feels obvious and annoying. The ending is confusing, and everything between start and end is boring.<br/><br/>3/10"

The music was cheesy and unmemorable -- and yet others say that it's one of Morricone's best scores?! Not to mention that the music was mismatched to some scenes.<br/><br/>I'll concede that the cinematography did rise to above average from time to time and that the last 10-15 minutes of the movie (starting from the scene with the garbage truck) were outstanding -- atmospheric, surreal, disturbing, bizarre, and beautiful.

","Over the years, this film has gained a near-mythological status: how Sergio Leone turned down 'The Godfather' to make this opus, his 16 years trying to get it made, the film's 'butchering' upon its North American release in 1984, Leone's 'broken heart' that led to his death just a few years later, etc. So, after reading a glowing review about a new, uncut version on DVD, I couldn't wait to rent the film.<br/><br/>I wish I could say it was a masterpiece. Clunky dialogue, lousy acting, cardboard characters, a pompous, TV mini-series feel to the story, unbelievable situations all conspire to sink this movie under its own weight. <br/><br/>One of the problems seems to be that the script was written by Italians and then somehow translated into English by an American writer who must have a tin ear for dialogue. The actors, all of whom have been excellent elsewhere, are left to look foolish uttering the stuff. The only one who barely gets by is De Niro - we realize what a great actor he is since he makes the most what he's given, which ain't much. Poor James Woods, who has appointed himself the chief cheerleader for this film, leaves little scenery unchewed. The rest of the cast go from mediocre to embarrassing - even the lovely and talented Jennifer Connelly, who appears as the love interest as a child, does not escape unscathed.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I seem to be in the minority about this film. So go ahead and see it, if you must. Just don't mention it in the same breath as 'The Godfather'."

","Now, I am by no means a Sergio Leone fan, but he deserved the Oscar for Direction for this film. I firmly believe that this film stands up there with ""The Godfather, Part II"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Citizen Kane"" as one of the greatest films ever released (maybe the best). Sergio Leone's violent, visual, masterpiece of turn of the century Jewish boys from New York growing into a life of crime has a different effect on all those who have viewed it in its various forms. I, personally have never seen the shortened version so I can not comment on it. There isn't anything in this film that isn't worth the four hour running time. Brilliant, poetic visuals, great photography and fantastic performances across the board.<br/><br/>Leone touches on issues of violence (the scenes are gory and sometimes explicit), sexual depravity (its no coincidence that all sexual encounters are in unconventional places and only in Noodles' rape of Deborah does he exhibit any kind of emotion toward any of his partners, gently caressing and kissing her as he violates her in a pathetic attempt to show his love), and simply growing old (brought about by the reminisces of Noodles' childhood with a beautiful good 'ol days type feeling despite the criminal nature of his childhood) and leaves us clamoring for more after the four hours are through.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is fantastic as always as Noodles. But it is James Woods, in my opinion that steals the show as Max. William Forsythe, Treat Williams, Danny Aiello, Burt Young, Joe Pesci, Jennifer Connely and Tuesday Weld add to this film just as actors of their quality are expected to. Their performances, as well as the two leads at the very least deserved, but didn't receive any, Academy Award nominations. (In fact, the Oscars were the only ceremony to snub this film). Ennio Morricone's score was as beautiful and evocative as one would expect from the master of the Italian score.<br/><br/>Worth seeing.

A man struggling with himself, someone who plays evil acts, a man who sees the pure in his childhood sweetheart. A man never at peace.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Leone, a master of his art. I'm a huge fan of his work. Each of his films got better and better, and Once Upon A time In America was a picture which had all the experience which he achieved in the 60s. It's almost a gift to himself.<br/><br/>The film's locations are stunning, authentic and dirty.<br/><br/>The screenplay is excellent, but the direction makes the film. Maybe one or two characters were underwritten, but it seems that the director wanted us to talk about the picture, discuss the possible loose ends, make up our own minds. Leone's methodical pacing is stunning.<br/><br/>The acting is tremendous, can't praise James Woods and Robert De Niro enough, awesome!<br/><br/>The photography is beautiful, it lacks colour giving it a gritty look, perfection!<br/><br/>Morricone delivers another masterpiece, his score adds further depth and backups the director's story.<br/><br/>See it wide-screen, this film is a stunning piece of cinema. Leone, you were the master!"

Well, that concept not only failed to market the film successfully, but it butchered a great, great film<br/><br/>I don't like to throw around the word ""masterpiece"", but that term is valid for the 227 minute version of the film with the complex interweaving of time periods.

Are you going to tell me that the James Woods character becomes a prominent politician, steals the woman DeNiro loves, etc. etc. and ""Noodles"" (after 35 years of this) knows nothing about it? Also, the ""Deborah"" character does not age at all in the film, whereas DeNiro and Woods look a great deal older. The best thing about this film is Jennifer Connelly (as the young Deborah).

","Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 Italian-American epic crime drama film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niroand James Woods. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film of Leone's career and the first feature film he had directed in thirteen years. <br/><br/>The runtime of the film is 3h 50min and I didn't even go to the toilet all through it. It may be too long for most people but I can tell you that my wifey and me weren't even bored in the slightest. This is Sergio Leone at the height of his game and his direction is masterclass. His sketches of the characters are brief but underscored with verve. Words cannot begin to describe what he has accomplished here. The opening sequences kept me spellbound - a scene of violence, a sickening death, leading to De Niro at an opium den. You know the dragnet is closing in on him, then the fricking ringing phone that never stops ringing. I kept looking for an elusive ringing phone but it never comes. We are treated to images like three dead bodies which makes no sense at all, but dammit I couldn't tear my eyes and ears away, and then we flash forward 35 years and we see the bloody phone. What audacity! What spunk! The opening had me on the palm of its hand. I was minced meat, ready to be pounded, tenderised and moulded to become a viewer Sergio Leone wants. Such opacity in the images but you will instantly know you are in the hands of a master and have complete trust in him. Every scene is handcrafted to perfection with such a high level of meticulosity. <br/><br/>Don't get me talking about the ending. This is an ending that is impossible to shut up about. You will want to discuss with someone with at least some measure of acuity WTF was that about. For me there are two ways to look at the ending and what it means for the preceding over 3 hours you have just seen. This is as good as a mindfcuk but with such brilliance. I can say this is not a film for all tastes but it is definitely for cineastes out there"
"BA_Harrison","9","6","10","6 December 2015"," Leone's gangster masterpiece.
","Director Sergio Leone is best known for his classic spaghetti westerns, but for my money, his final movie, gangster epic Once Upon A Time In America, is his most accomplished work. With a running time of 229 minutes (more if you're watching the Extended Director's Cut), it's longer than either Once Upon A Time in the West or The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and it's pacing is just as measured (some might say 'slow'), but the time passes far less painfully, so engaging are the characters and the drama that unfolds.<br/><br/>Spanning decades, the story is truly monumental: it opens in the late 1960s with ageing gangster Noodles (Robert De Niro) returning to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty-five years in hiding, and then proceeds to cut back and forth between the present and the past to show his life as a young boy in an impoverished Jewish ghetto, as a tough gangster during the Prohibition period, and as an old man reacquainting himself with old friends. This skillful technique helps to keep the viewer engrossed long after their bum has gone numb, but fine performances from a stellar cast (which includes James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello, and a young Jennifer Connelly), excellent cinematography, and some brilliantly executed scenes of brutal violence, all accompanied by a wonderfully haunting pan flute score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone, help to ensure that nodding off is unlikely."

","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a crime movie which shows a former gangster who returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty years. He has to deal with some changes that happened and he missed all of those. We watch also the past of him and how all of these start and of course all of that has to do with the mafia and the gangs of New York.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found magnificent and the direction of Sergio Leone which was outstanding. About the interpretations I have to say that the interpretation of Robert De Niro who played as David Aaronson (Noodles) was for one more time great, equally good interpretation made by James Woods who played as Maximilian Bercovicz (Max). Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned is the beautiful Elizabeth McGovern's who played as Deborah Gelly. This movie reminded me plenty of movies with the same plot, gangsters, mafia etc but this movie was simply one of the best in this kind.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is one of the best movies that a crime movies fan wants to watch. It gives you many emotions and this happens because of the interpretations of the cast but also from the great direction of this movie."

","""this review contains spoilers""<br/><br/>I wanted to write down a review here long time ago,unfortunately never got round to it,but last night after viewing the newly extended version of once upon a time in America with 26 minutes of additional scenes,the time has now arrived to share my thoughts and feelings on what i describe a marvelous and unforgettable experience!<br/><br/>It has to be said..watching it at the cinema is totally different than watching it on DVD.i do own the movie,admired it on numerous occasions,but boy o boy i didn't capture me as much as last night;a good explanation perhaps is sitting in a dark movie theater isolated from everyone and everything,you feel part of that world that is been portrayed on screen.Like never before you manage to taste the profound feeling of friendship,betrayal,love and greed all of which are masterfully told by the maestro Sergio Leone,and most of all you can feel the heart and soul on which the film is founded and constructed on. Its an epic tale of ; Jewish gangsters that make their way through the prohibition era,narrates the rise and fall of David""Noodles"" Aaronson,Max,Patsy and Cockeye!A period of time that goes from the early 1900's to the late 1960's which includes many flashbacks and flashfowards about their childhood and adulthood...the characters are loyal and respect each other but towards the end enter a fase that will finish not only in tragedy but also in mystery.<br/><br/>this new version includes six to seven new added scenes,bringing it to a running time of 269 minutes,the version that Leone originally intended to establish,but got reduced to 229 minutes(European version).1)When Noodlees goes and visits his friends grave there is a scene while talking with the owner of the cemetery, a car(with covered windows)appears in the background and drives around the block to spy on him.noodles suspects something strange about the car so he writes down the plate number.2)the information about the car leads him to senator Bailey's house,while standing outside the gate that same car he saw at the cemetery is coming out of the mansion and eventually explodes..then this leads to the part when noodles is sitting in fat moe's watching firefighters in TV clearing the fire on a car...3)while noodles is waiting in the street to take Deborah on a date,he has a chat with the driver.4)After getting rid of Joe and his gang noodles drives the car with his friends on board in the water,an added scene shows max patsy and cockeye laughing it off in the water,and max tries to find noodles who disappears.5)Deborah is playing Cleopatra during a play at the theater and noodles is there as a spectator.6)before noodles and max meet in the end,max has a conversation in his studio with the famous politician that gets shot in the leg earlier in the film. other few scenes show how noodles meets Eve. Do these extra scenes add something more to the film??well certainly they help understand the movie even more,they cover up plot holes that were existent in the previous version, maybe a few sequences were not necessary,but it doesn't really matter. these sequences though do not improve the Frank monaldi character,he still remains in complete mystery.<br/><br/>this film is a masterpiece no doubt;if Sergio Leone would still be alive,he would be proud of his children,Andrea and Raffaella,who played a big part to finally bring to life the version that their late father had envisioned.A film that left him heartbroken by the lousy editing of the U.S version that flopped big time and that received extremely negative reviews.Flashbacks were all chopped off and the film's events were narrated in chronological order. Its safe to say that justice has been made.Works of art should just be left alone. This film definitely ranks up there as one of greatest gangster movies ever made and it surely worth the watch!!<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is exceptional,Woods is fantastic and the rest of the cast delivers on a high note.<br/><br/>Noodles turns towards the camera,smiles,credits start to appear and the music starts to play......EPIC<br/><br/>IT JUST LEAVES YOU IN TEARS!!"
"Magenta_Bob","8","6","10","20 June 2012"," Once Upon a Time in America
","I think the first time I saw Once Upon a Time in America I was a bit disappointed because I benchmarked it against Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns such as the endlessly more entertaining but not necessarily more emotionally rewarding The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Approaching this gangster saga, you will not find Clint Eastwood in a poncho, and you have to deal with it. Once you do, you have four very good hours in front of you.<br/><br/>The film follows Noodles (Robert De Niro) in three parallel acts. First as a child, where he and his gang of hoodlums starts out with harmless thefts against drunkards, before things escalate into a violent and life-changing confrontation with the older gangster rival Bugsy (James Russo), all the while chasing the girls of New York. Then as an adult in his life of organized crime and associations with the labor union during the prohibition era, where Noodles' best friend Max's descent into madness plays a key part. And finally as an old man returning to his old neighbourhood to tie up loose ends from his life. The three parts fit nicely together, and the editing between them works fine.<br/><br/>All in all, the film has a fine ensemble. De Niro more or less plays the same type of guy that he does in all gangster films I have seen him in, meaning that he is solid and knows his part as the back of his hand. Joe Pesci shows up as he does in all gangster films I have seen, although he is more understated during his brief appearance here. Tuesday Weld looks uncannily alike some Hitchcock character, perhaps one played by Eva Marie Saint, in her unthankful role as a gangster wife. The real star, however, might be James Woods in his mentally unstable portrayal of Max, whose madness breaks out whenever the condition is implied in conversation.<br/><br/>In four hours, Leone has time to cover a lot of ground, and there are several highlights. My favourite scene is the one where Noodles finally goes on a date with the love of his life Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern). It starts off romantically, but evolves into sadness as she says that he is the only person she has ever cared for, but then asks, in a moment of unusual clarity for women in gangster films, ""you'd lock me up and throw away the key, wouldn't you?"", to which Noodles replies that he probably would. This sums up almost every gangster relationship ever depicted on film. The episode, as many others, then concludes in a gruesome manner.<br/><br/>What might distinguish Once Upon a Time in America from other films of its ilk is how nostalgic and sentimental it feels, which I don't mean in a negative sense (except at its low point when it plays some washed-out version of Yesterday); the childhood act takes you back to a time when the streets of New York were brimming with life (due to terrific compositions) in another sense than today, whereas the (chronologically) last segment finds a worn out Noodles reminiscing about those days and what has been. The final scene, in which he sees some young people going by fast in their fancy cars, feels like the moment where his memories of youth escape him. Even the part that takes place in between, where the gang is doing well financially, is less than usual about being a high roller and more about regretting what you've done and dealing with its aftermath, as represented by a phone that won't stop ringing. The most conspicuous aspect of the film is perhaps Ennio Morricone's bittersweet, nostalgic score that runs through virtually every scene. It borders on sentimentality, but it fits a movie about a man looking back on his life perfectly."

","For me this is the best film ever but i can understand people who didn't like it. 4 hours for a gangster film is hard to bear. But this film has a record of unforgettable scenes, an epic narrative, an extraordinary score, so many layers inside, an unique use of time, classic themes like loyalty, friendship, love treated using mythology and legendary close ups like the enigmatic smile at the end. I want to remember only the scene that explains perfectly the characters when the young Deborah, played by a spectacular teen Jennifer Connelly, read in a personnel way the Song of Songs to Noodles. Speechless. If justice can come late this film could be re-release nowadays with the more than 4 hours director's cut and participate to the Oscars and win whichever the competition is"
"axismladen","10","6","10","11 May 2010"," Theatrical Version -- Average! Director's Version -- Perfect!
","Once Upon A Time In America is, as Leone hoped it will be, his best movie! It's perfect! <br/><br/>Many of you might wonder why this movie wasn't present at the ACADEMY AWARD'S. It's because of the producer's and Warner Bros, who ordered Leone to cut more than one hour of the movie for it's theatrical(original) release. It really ruins the movie. My most honest recommendation is that you see the ''director's version''! That version of the movie is simply magnificent! The director's version is the biggest rival The Godfather has and will ever have! It's simply perfect! True, it is long! But the movie is so good that the time will just fly! Trust me! I've seen it more than ten times and i'm still not bored. It's simply perfect! Not that the theatrical version isn't good, it's just that it's not even as close as good as the director's cut! And literally, not as close as good!!! It takes away the movies structure and leaves a lot of holes in the script! It ruin's it! It's still good, but it's no longer brilliant! <br/><br/>I don't think it's necessary to say anything about acting! Just look at the cast!<br/><br/>This movie is for everyone out there. This movie is a brutally honest story of a couple of friend's growing up together in a society that gives 'em no other choice but to become gangster's. Also there is a beautifully written love story in the background which comes to most unexpected twist. And i have to mention characterization! It's flawless! Simply perfect! -- Just as the entire movie is in the director's version!"
"LibertyValance27-1","9","6","10","18 February 2005"," Awesome crime drama tale from Leone, truly epic!
","I was a little hesitant to check this film out. Being a huge fan of Leone's westerns, I naively thought that his talents were restricted to that genre. But after reviewing the cast, which includes Robert DeNiro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Treat Williams, and Jennifer Connelly in her first film role, I just had to check it out. I am very glad that I did. I was missing out on one of the most ambitious, engaging, and epic of all crime drama/gangster films. This was Leone's final film before his death in 1989, but what a film to end an illustrious film career with. Maybe not as well known as other Leone classics such as ""A Fist Full of Dollars"", ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" or ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but none the less a film that deserves to be put on the same level as those others, and also enjoy a small niche in the Leone library all it's own.<br/><br/>The film stars DeNiro as Noodles (David Aaronson) a Jewish gangster and thug who has returned home after being run out 30 years earlier. He has come back at the request of an unknown person, a person who seems to know all about his past. Very few of his friends from the old days are still around, so with his curiosity peaked Noodles cautiously returns home. In the 30 years that Noodles has been gone, he has been haunted by the old days, by the choices he made, and by that one phone call he made that changed everything. He can still hear the ringing in his head. He feels guilty that he made that call that cost him so much, but as he finds out later, it was not his choice. He was being manipulated by someone very close and it was him that forced Noodles hand. He will also find out that his life ended up the way it did, because his dreams were forcibly taken from him, without his knowledge, by someone who perpetrated the ultimate betrayal.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time in America is an epic film that is thoroughly engaging from start to end. We Follow Noodles from his beginnings as a small time hood, to a big time prohibition era gangster, to a tired and hurt old man. This film is sort of like a journey, you just have to let go and allow yourself to go where Leone takes you. The sets and costumes give the film a truly authentic feel. The non-linear way the story is told works, and is very effective for telling this sort of complicated story. The music is excellent, another great score from frequent Leone collaborator Ennio Morricone. However the decision to use the Beatles tune ""Yesterday"" is understandable considering it's placement in the film, however hearing a pop song in a Leone movie was a little unsettling. But totally forgiven, being that is one of the very few flaws in an otherwise great film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended to all fans of crime dramas, gangster films, westerns, or of just good movies in general."
"raulito_343","10","6","10","5 September 2004"," This movie cannot be compared with any other in it's genre
","Once I saw for the first time this movie, I actually didn't know anything at all of Sergio Leone, what really attracted me to watch this movie is my passion for gangster films. This movie is actually in my opinion far superior than any of the Godfather movies, movies that actually were my favorites before I saw this film (and continue to be in some sort). I discovered a new way of creating a movie by a director, that actually was not so much involved in Hollywood style cinema (from what I have read).<br/><br/>Once Upon a time in America, its a tale of friendship, love, passion, crime, betrayal and history. I don't have that much experience reviewing movies, as a movie watcher I could tell you that there are many great movies out there, but once you encounter this masterpiece, there is no way you can compare it with other ""gangster"" films.<br/><br/>As far I could say I have seen better movies, but no other movie could have catch my attention, this is truly one of the best movies ever made. The score, I could say was wonderful, I can't understand why this movie didn't get any Academy award, at least the score, I think that Sergio Leone had to win an academy award for best director. But the fact that this movie has some scenes that are for some people ""ugly"" like the rape scenes, this movie had a lot of bad reviews when it was first displayed.<br/><br/>When you see this movie, and finish seeing it you will by a fact consider it too short, knowing it is 3 hours and a half, the time passes really fast, and its because its intrigue, its plot. This is actually a not very typical Hollywood movie, you could feel this is a very sad movie with an ending that won't give you a happy ending (like most of Hollywood films).<br/><br/>Sergio Leone was by much the best director of his era, I have seen a lot of Martin Scorsese films relating to crime, but let me say it again: Not even comparable to Leone's work.<br/><br/>Just to note, you have to see this movie twice or more to understand it, because of the changes in time, but this makes it more interesting!!<br/><br/>10/10 2 thumbs up, 5 stars<br/><br/>everything you have give it to this movie!! truly a masterpiece!!"
"eamon-hennedy","10","6","10","3 November 2003"," Well Worth The Running Time!
","Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In America is undeniably a masterpiece. A superb film on every level, it feels like the brother of The Godfather Films. While both this film and the Godfather Part II make use of the flashback structure and both feature Robert De Niro, all comparisons end there as this is a vastly different film. Yes they are both gangster films, but this is a different kettle of fish. Whereas the main theme of the Godfather films is that of family, here we deal with the role of friendship in the life of the gangster and how betrayal can lead to bitter recriminations and heartache. However it doesn't just tell the story of gangster betrays friends, oh no, it goes deeper than that. We go into a world where you question the events depicted and the role many characters play. This is a film with no easy answers and with it comes difficult questions. This is essentially the more deeper cousin of The Godfather films. We come to question whether or not the sequences in the 1960's are real. Is it just a dream concocted  by De Niro in the Opium den. It this a possible future, but one that is only possible. What about the brief case. Whereas in Pulp Fiction the case is more of a running joke, here it seems like a plot point that we have missed all of a sudden, while one also has to question why Noodles goes on to rape the woman he supposedly loves in one of the film's most shocking sequences.<br/><br/>To be honest I don't think Once Upon A Time In America is as good as The Godfather films, but it is a worthy film to be lined alongside Coppola's legacy. The story by Leone and his direction are first class, De Niro shows us why he is considered by many to be the finest actor working in American cinema today, while James Woods proves that no one can play a psychopath like himself. Then there is Ennio Morricone's music. Sublime and perfect, like The Godfather films, Once Upon a Time In America is complimented with a fine music score that adds gravitas to an already fine film.<br/><br/>Every part of this film is superb. The origin of the friendship between Max and Noodles is wonderfully done, the middle time frame sequences were we see the release of Noodles from prison and his reintegration with his friends and how it all leads to the ultimate act of betrayal and the later stages were an older Noodles reflects in the 60's all work well together. This film could have been a long, meandering sprawling bore fest, but instead it is one of the finest films committed to celluloid. However, it is not a film that is easily recommended. Nearly four hours long, very violent, containing a horrifying rape scene and an ending that  only leaves you with more question, I'm not surprised that many have been divided over it, but I love it. It is quite simply a work of art."

"iqlpd","10","19","42","11 February 2007"," Belongs in the ""Greats"" list of film-making
","One of my favourite films of all time! This is one of those films that changes the way you view movies. The characters are profound, both in youth and in adulthood, and so well developed, the storyline so complex, and yet simple; this is the kind of film you can come back to, time and time again -- and you really will see something different, something new, each time you view it. (The fact that there is more than one version of this incredible film, adds to its complexity. There are different scenes in the short version, that are not in the long version, so it is beneficial to see both.) <br/><br/>IMDb lists two running times, but I believe I've seen at least three versions: one a 5 hour version in French in the middle of the night! After viewing the long version, presumably the Director's Cut, I was particularly confused. I re-viewed another version, a shorter one, some time later, and finally understood the ending. While I love Mr. Leone's version (with his work I tend to feel the longer, the better) I found I didn't 'get' the ending until I saw the 'chopped version'. Needless to say, I've seen the movie many times through the 80s and 90s, first in the theatre, thank goodness, and later on television.<br/><br/>I don't want to imply that the understanding of this film is a cumbersome task. I cherish films that make me think of them long after the final credits have rolled. The director weaves a tapestry, where we see some of his intentions easily. Others times, we move in closer, or view the piece from a different perspective. His talent allows us to believe we're seeing something 'new'. That's partly because we ourselves change over the years, and see things differently as we grow in our own experiences, but credit is also due the film-maker, who pulls us out of our reality and totally immerses us in his story. <br/><br/>I have only to hear the score of this film, and my mind carries me back to New York at the turn of the LAST century ... I see the texture of the bricks, I recall the stunning beauty of both actresses who played the character Deborah Gelly, I see again the cream cake that was even better than the hope of sex, for one of the adolescent boys ... a scene that tells us there is still a child, a hungry child, in this young thug apprenticing to be a man and a gangster. <br/><br/>I don't want to imply that it's a difficult movie to understand; just that there are so many levels, so many interpretations, each compelling and intriguing. Most movies of this length would deter many from seeing it, I'm sure. But never once did I feel that this film was 'too long'; I was never even aware of time passing. I would happily sit through four-hour films if they were as well made as Mr. Leone's. (Sadly, there are few of his calibre.) <br/><br/>Beyond the script, the directing, the acting, ""ONCE"" is a visually stunning work of art. The music mesmerizes. The colours, textures and light in harmony with the score, are stamped in my memory, as clearly as my own recollections. This is great cinematography! The acting offered some of the best performances of many of the actors' careers. The timing is often impeccable (you'll know what I'm referring to when you view it), and a risk few directors would have dared to take. The writing is nothing less than brilliant, because of course, without a exceptional script, there is no film.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America belongs in the 'greats' list of film-making. The most shocking detail, in this film's history, is that it never received the recognition it deserved (in awards), and that it is less known that many inferior films. I feel privileged to have seen it on 'the big screen' a few times, back in the 80s. Some films translate well to DVD, but films of great cinematographic stature are always best appreciated on the silver screen. <br/><br/>You can't consider yourself a film-fan, a movie-buff, if you haven't seen this one (or two or three) in each of its versions, several times. I defy you not to love it (them?), too! <br/><br/>(Canadian spelling in this review)"

","'Never trust the artist.  Trust the tale' urged DH Lawrence of American literature, and it is a maxim we would do well to heed in watching any film by Sergio Leone, but in particular this, ostensibly his most realistic and straightforward.  None of his films have packed the given period with so much signifying detail - the gorgeous sepia-toned 1921 sequence, with its Jewish shops and inhabitants, horses and carts, cakes, clothes, the pervading brown, the corrupt cops, the sexual fumblings; the Prohibition years, the sharp suits, the mixture of bonhomie and surgical violence, the disused harbours and warehouses with fading signs, the speakeasies and opium dens, the vast art-deco restaurants.  Only the 60s sequence feels undersketched, a handful of stray signs - muzak Beatles, acoustic-strumming hippies, corruption-exposing TV - pointing to the era.  This, I think, is very deliberate.<br/><br/>1968 was a crucial year in American history from the assassination of RFK to the heated civil rights and anti-Vietnam protests.  It was as if all the bogus American myths had been exploded, rising to the surface the nasty, sour-tasting truth.  It was also the year Leone made 'Once Upon A Time In The West', the film that for all time defined the impulse behind American history - 'make believe it didn't happen'.  This self-referentiality is appropriate to a film about cinema, full of people looking through screen-like apertures, never acting, letting history wash over them; this is a milieu where shops and stations are named after the likes of Altman and Pabst, where the hero loves an actress, where his best friend spends 35 years playing someone else.<br/><br/>Allied to this careful, material realism, is a straightforward narrative, a mystery story: why did Noodles betray his friends?  As in a conventional Hollywood film, this central enigma is suspended, and background information is sketched in, to raise the stakes of solution.  Everything initially inexplicable is explained, we answer the telephone call from the past, we find out what Rosebud is.  But as Borges said of 'Citizen Kane', 'Once Upon A Time In America' is a labyrinth without a centre - we must tread warily.<br/><br/>Like 'The Godfather 2' and 'Reds', 'America' is an epic panorama of 20th century American history.  We see how gangsterism is less a metaphor for American capitalism, but its very essence.  We see how unions, the law, politics, even religious communities are infected by it, poisoned, learn to accomodate and live with it.  As Conway says to Max, the gangsters achieve more dealing with the bosses in one night than he would have in two years negotiation.<br/><br/>Leone shows how the American dream (oh yes), the very idea of capitalism, is inimical to democracy.  He shows this through the central story of Max and Noodles, the great betrayal.  And the revelation is numbingly shocking.  In a film full of ironic godlike long shots, at one stage the lads, after the hospital babyswitch farce, declare themselves deities, with the power to dispense lifelong happiness or misery.  But it is Max who pulls off the God trick in reality.  He is a Platonic kind of God, who creates a world of illusions, of lies; who dispenses power and paralytic guilt for his own ends, who can actually change the destiny of people's lives, not just in the usual sense of killing them, but in destroying their soul, making them live in a hall of mirrors, a world of empty memories reflecting back on each other, nothing reflecting nothing.  Watching De Niro in the 60s section is one of the most dispiriting things in cinema - it's like watching the walking dead.<br/><br/>Unlike the Dollars trilogy, which are full of disruptions, Brechtian jerks and jokey intrusions, Leone's last film seems very smooth and unified.  But underneath this surface, the tensions wrench.  There are some remarkable shifts in tone, from the extraordinary opening section, virtually silent, a fluid requiem; to the joyous rites-of-passage sequence; to the middle gangster segment, which contains some excellent comic bits, filmed with a disarming flippancy that seems to have intruded from another film altogether; to the somnambulations of the 60s.<br/><br/>Leone films much of 'America' like one of his Westerns, with an emphasis on extended rituals, extreme close-ups, and a contraction of time.  The very 70s use of zooms seems jarring in an 80s film.  The opening sequence, in its framing, its use of pace, decor and lighting, and in its editing, in its story of a helpless woman being shot by three killers, is pure spaghetti Leone.  This infiltration of the Western, with its expansiveness and codes, plays havoc with the gangster film, such a claustrophobic, urban genre. The chase and murder in the feather factory is jaw-droppingly beautiful.<br/><br/>The music plays a crucial part in the formal disjunctions - the manipulation of emotions it achieves is disturbing, so that you wonder why music that has signalled melancholy emotional crescendo is swelling at a boy eating a cake; of why the most gorgeous, heartbreaking melodies are made evoke the tragedy of a rapist, informer, murderer.  If we follow these cues too closely - and it is almost impossible not to; never has sentimentality been so ruthlessly deployed - we fall into the same trap as Noodles.<br/><br/>But does he?  Is the story of a man who has been hoodwinked, who never knows what's going on, who's always left out, or in the dark; a man who walks like a ghost through his own life, whose inability to act petrifies him, turns him into Lot's wife, actually an illusion as audacious as Max's?.  For many, the enigma of the film is the fate of Max, the mystery of the refuse truck,. Obviously he was planning a final self-saving scam, a way out of another mess, getting Noodles to think he's shot him, and then having his friend's mangled body, not for the first time, passed off as his own.  The body (and soul) snatching would be complete.  Does he in the end finally mangle himself; is this phantom, this resurrection from the dead, finally laid to rest?  The scene seems to crystallise Noodles' life - victim, dupe, onlooker, not knowing what's going on, shuffling in the dark outside the sites of great events?<br/><br/>But there is something very Gothic about this scene - the nocturnal setting; the mansion with secret passages; the wealthy, successful, melancholy man willing death; the idea of the doppelganger; the candle-lined avenue. Noodles begins and ends 'America' in an opium den, and the final image is of a big smile, like he's pulled off the biggest scam in history, fooling us, shrouded like Jill in 'West'.  The film actually begins in 1933, so that the 1968 scenes are flashforwards, rather than the central narrative, which is where the film begins and ends.  Like all Leone's films, there is a strong homoerotic charge, and Max has a clear longing for Noodles; the one consensual sex act in the film is in a hearse (heterosexual love=death) - the rest are violent rapes.  Is the film a working out of homosexual tensions, the narrative the ultimate solipsistic gesture?<br/><br/>
The 'revelation' doesn't explain anything: it opens new enigmas.  The film is full of inexplicable loose ends - what happens to Joe Pesci after he spots Noodles and Max coming out of a lift before they go to Florida?  Is he the drunk in 1921 the boys rob?  These repetitions, the longs shots of silent, tiny figures against huge backdrops, the rigid Kabuki gestures, the sparse oneiric 60s sequence, all seem to suggest a kind of dream; Noodles' passivity as he slopes through time seems that of a dreamer.  How reliable are the points of view, the assertions, the flashforwards of a film whose main character has been left in the dark for 35 years?"

"guyzradio","6","5","8","18 October 2018"," I watched...I rewound and rewached. An 8.4, it ain't.
","Perusing Netflix, I recognized this movie title and the names Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone; I particularly enjoyed the music of Cinema Paradiso, also the work of Morricone. The line-up of actors pulled me right in, but to what? After watching for a little while, I looked up the movie and noted how 10 hours of film were sliced and diced to a disastrous 2h 19m for US release, whereas the 3h 49m release was the one to make everything right. Well, at least I had that going for me.<br/><br/>At the end, it was still a disappointment. A movie that forces you to pay fanatic attention to detail to ""get it"" is not the product of good direction. It is the result of a riding on one's own name to varnish a deeply flawed product as ""art."" Even at 3h 49m, continuity suffered. The flashback method of story telling was clumsy and not handled nearly as smoothly as in its inspiration, Godfather II. The fact that these were kids from a Jewish neighborhood was inconsequential. Things happen in the movie often for no apparent reason and go nowhere, the opening 10 or 15 minutes being a prime example. Even the music of Ennio Morricone seems worn out by the end, as the same theme repeats throughout scenes where it seems misplaced or simply gets in the way.<br/><br/>You might will dismiss this review as the ramblings of someone who isn't sophisticated enough to realize what a masterpiece this really is. My guess is there is a coherent, thought-provoking story somewhere among the frames that made it to the screen and what was left on the cutting room floor. This still isn't it. To suggest that less than a point separates this move from The Godfather I just doesn't pass the sniff test."

","Injustice. This film deals with it, this film suffered it. Leone and his team never saw a single Oscar for what is, undoubtedly, one of the GREAT movies of film history. Supposedly the reason was that HIS version was far too long, and 'unapetizing' for the American public. Years later, this seems ridiculous. American cinema has topped the record for gore and 'unhealthy' material. And DVD finally gave us O.U.a T. in A. in its glorious entirety. And complexity. Yes, because this script is so perfect, so stimulating and so bewitching, that although I have seen the movie 3 times in the last 30 years, it still surprises me...adds nuances and revelations to it's original story. truly admirable! The facade of good ole, healthy America is severely battered by this story of unhealthy ambition, betrayal, revenge and power. 'Noodles' De Niro (the nick-name of our 'positive' protagonist reminds us that Leone was the king of 'spaghetti' westerns), returns, twice, to the site of past crimes... risking his life and ideals in the process. The savagely bitter finale remind us that he does so, simply because he is 'curious'. Because he NEEDS the truth. And this need, although painful, is necessary. Guilt, it is implied, is a powerful corrosive agent, however icy James Woods' character may be. There is , whatsmore, a sub-text which Sergio Leone works on here, and it is the role of DRUGS in society. In order to bear the injustice and treason, the violence and solitude that life has dealt out, Noodles resorts to Opium, as a source of relief; of contemplation. Could it be that the director is reminding us that Heroin's reign in Italy and in the U.S. during the 70ies and 80ies may closely reflect 'modern' Society's degradation? As always, Leone blends his political criticism of the American way with a strong misogynist vein. His women are few and far between in the westerns, but in the two 'Once upon a time..."" movies they are increasingly present, and increasingly foxy. The are either prostitutes or cock-teasers with a strong masochist element. And it seems he prefers the 'honest whore'. This film could be reviewed by a psychoanalyst, a priest, a gangster or a politician , and all, I'm sure, would offer a different reading, as in Kurosawa's 'Rashomon'. But Leone is NOT a subtle film-maker. And maybe this reputation of his as something of a gangster in the, very selective Italian league of the 60 ies and 70ies, cheated him out of the credit he receives only now. Somewhat like Ken Russell in the British panorama, Leone's stylish but brutal approach to the realities of life, hurt the shyly hypocritical sensitivities of public and censors alike... let alone the distributors' in Hollywood. Technically the movie is breathtaking, especially Pescucci's wardrobe, Rochetti's make-up (the aging jobs are almost all superlative, and fundamental in helping us deal with such a complex game of 'flash-backs'), the Greg Tolland-style photography and shots by Tonino Delli Colli, the sets, editing and...of course, dulcis-in-fundo, Ennio Morricone's timeless score which, once again, is part and parcel of the film, an emotional bomb which Leone knowingly 'drops' in all the right moments. Deborah's theme is crushing. And the brilliant use of music and silence in Noodles' visit to his friend's mausoleum... comic and audacious. So, it's 9 out of 10, given that the perfect film may not exist (Jean Vigo's 'L'Atalante' ?), and the nearest thing to reading a GREAT novel, but with the whole 'caboodle' of the art of our time. Il Grande Cinema.<br/><br/>p.s. It is absolutely extraordinary that an Italian,a ROMAN, with a VERY limited grasp of the English language, should endeavour, and pull off, such an ambitious American fresco. His great talent, and that of Mr. Brian Freilino (who helped him coach and survey the realism of nuances in both languages), and of the dialogue writers, greatly surpass the occasional hiccups that we encounter, especially in the childhood scenes. and by the way, ALL praise to the young actors who unjustly precede De Niro and Woods, but only chronologically."
"Egg_MacGuffin","10","5","8","10 January 2009"," I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could.
","Sergio Leone declined an offer to direct The Godfather to direct this film instead. And oh, how I wonder how a Leone-directed Godfather would have turned out (along with Orson Welles as Vito and Robert Deniro as Sonny)...Once Upon A Time In America more than makes up for that desire never having the opportunity to come true.<br/><br/>I mention The Godfather not only because this film is of the same genre, but also of the same level of quality. Seriously. The Godfather edges this one out in terms of acting and perhaps in the level of human emotion the audience feels, but in regards to every other aspect of film-making, it's equal to or better than The Godfather. Keep in mind that The Godfather is my all-time favorite film and book.<br/><br/>The story of Once Upon A Time In America is told in several different time periods simultaneously and seamlessly. Clocking in a nearly 4 hours, it seems like an arduous task to watch this film to completion, especially considering the fractured timetable, lack of a solid external throughline, and two rape scenes (one of which being a truly hard piece of cinema to watch), but the masterful direction of Leone, absolutely breathtaking cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli, and epic, tragedy-filled music by Ennio Morricone are guaranteed to pull you into the world of the story. <br/><br/>It's a truly rewarding experience to view this film from start to finish in a single sitting. It leaves pieces out of the puzzle for the viewer to interpret, ponder, and debate afterward. It's a film that stays with you and actually rewards repeat viewings.<br/><br/>Sadly, there is presently no living director with the skill required to make a film of this caliber. We can only hope and wish that someone comes along and gives us a few cinematic treasures such as this one, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and the acclaimed films of Kubrick and Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America has been on the rise in the IMDb Top 250 for some time now. Let's help it get to the top 10 where it belongs."
"leviot","9","5","8","25 April 2006"," Dramatic and artistic gangster movie
","The legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone has pulled off quite a feat in the making of 'Once Upon a Time in America', taking a story about brutal gangsters and weaving it together in such an artistic way, paradoxical as that may seem.<br/><br/>'Once Upon a Time in America' is an almost 4 hour long experience about the lives of four Jewish friends who grew up in the lower east side of New York in the 1920s. It focuses primarily on the life of David Aranson, better known as 'Noodles'. A spunky kid, with an awkward yet flamboyant personality, Noodles begins an unlikely friendship with Max Bercovitz, which leads him into a life of crime.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that this film is much more character-driven than it is action-driven. Each of the characters come alive as the story progresses from the 1920s to the 1930s and eventually to the late 1960s where the culmination of this lifelong drama occurs.<br/><br/>There are a number of very clear distinctions between this gangster movie and others of its genre. For one, it's not a very talkative film, relying rather on slow well-shot scenes and facial expressions to tell its story. The entire movie has a surreal dream-like quality to it, and is replete with symbolism and allegory. The soundtrack is great addition to the film, and the playing of John Lennon's ""Yesterday"" intermingled with the childhood flashbacks brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Just to give an example of the great symbolism in this film, there's a scene which seems rather insignificant, but upon further contemplation one realizes its allegorical meaning. When young 'Patsy' brings the cream pie in return for a sexual favor from Peggy. As Patsy waits for Peggy to exit her apartment, he can't resist the temptation of the delicious cake, and begins picking at its sides, figuring she won't notice. Then eventually he eats the cherry, then goes on to greedily devour the entire delicacy, leaving him with nothing to offer Peggy. This symbolizes the lives of these men, who with a little patience and forbearing could have lived much more meaningful lives, but they could never withstand the temptation of instant gratification and pleasure, which ultimately was their downfall.<br/><br/>If I would have to use one word to describe this film though, it would be 'ambiguous'. Many scenes and lines can be interpreted in a myriad of ways. In fact, the meaning of many of its scenes have been widely debated over the years. Not the least of which being the opening and closing scenes of the movie in which Noodles is seen smoking in an opium den, prompting many to speculate that the entire movie, or all that happens from that point on, is an 'opium dream'.<br/><br/>Nothing is more ambiguous and ambivalent than the central character of 'Noodles', played masterfully by Robert DeNiro. He is awkward and clumsy, yet he is cool and quick-witted. He is calm and collected, yet extraordinarily passionate. He is cruel, yet compassionate. Tough, yet very tender.<br/><br/>One thing is for certain, to be able to watch this film and appreciate it properly one needs a lot of patience. Sergio Leone is notorious for his slow-paced movies, and this one tops it all. In fact, originally Leone wanted to release a 6 hour version, but was persuaded to cut it down to a 'mere' 3 hours and 47 minutes."

","'Once Upon a Time in America' is quite simply the best gangster movie I have seen and is one of the greatest movies ever made. The entire story is like a long, beautiful, haunting, and scary dream. By the end of the film, it feels like I've witnessed the entire lives of the characters. It feels like I understood their every joy and sadness, triumph and frustration. The picture presented by Sergio Leone is bleak, but it is appropriate considering the subject matter. It manages to cover over 50 years of time, but the movie does not seem long at all.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro play Noodles, an aging man who can't forget the sins of the past. Just by looking at his face, I could sense the burden of a lifetime of mistakes, lost livelihood and friendships. An all around brilliant film and quite possibly a masterpiece."

","The other review was so off I had to say something. First off this is a gangsta film of epic proportion. It is rich with drama, dialogue and the most beautiful score ever written. Although the length of the film is intimidating I strongly encourage those who enjoyed it to watch it again. There is just so much happening here you wont pick everything up upon the first viewing. The main character Noodles (De Niro) is everything you could want. He is a hero and a dispicable person at times. I use the word hero because of my fascination with the crime genre. You must respect the drive of a man who rises from poverty to success no matter how it's done. Similar to Michael Corleone in the Godfather you cant help but to love the blurred line of Good Guy/Bad Guy in the complex character that is Noodles. You will swear you are in the 1920's or 30's Leone is a genius director and this is not only his finest achievment but one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. Ive seen Once Upon a Time in America over 20 times and it never gets old or<br/><br/>loses its effect.Also ask yourself one question after the movie... Why is Noodles smiling at the very end?...keep watching and thinking, you'll figure it out. - Ben"
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","5","8","3 April 2004"," One of the Greats
","Sergio Leone already had about 5 films before this which were masterpieces and as it was his last film we expect nothing less and that's what we got. Once Upon a Time in America is quite an unusual tale of Gangster's growing up.   It was one of it kind for it's narrative story being chopped up into different parts so we don't really get meaning of the plot till the very end.<br/><br/>The story has to be one of the most beautiful stories I have ever heard and a depressing one at that.   It has everything you want in a story as it keeps you guessing and wondering throughout it's nearly 4 hour run but without it being that long it would have never have been that good.   This was different for Sergio Leone as we usually expect to see all his characters living in the west and wearing ponchos but what he brought to the screen in 1984 was probably the greatest gangster film of all time even beating the likes of The Godfather and Scarface.   I once said that Goodfellas was the greatest gangster film ever but that was before I saw Once Upon a Time in America.   Before this was released on DVD did anyone find it hard to find the original copy?  I couldn't find it and it was becoming incurably frustrating as I ran sacked all the Car Boot Sales to try and bag myself a copy and I then come across this man on a market stall and asked if he had a copy and he said he's got one at home and he'll bring it in for me next time he is there.   I agreed to this and asked him what his price was and he said Â£20 and this is for a VHS which in my opinion a classic or not is daylight robbery so I was back to square one.  The angels were listening though as a couple of weekends later they showed it on BBC 2 and I got to witness one of the greatest films ever made but it just astounds me that this movie was so rare to own after it was released in the mid eighties and even then it was a cut version so I had to rely on the TV to come up trumps with it's full version and lucky for me it did.<br/><br/>There are some heartbreaking scenes here especially when Noodles rapes<br/><br/>Deborah only because he knows he can't have her any other way but I think it's great how Leone let's us get to know Noodles for him to then turn his back on us and show us his evil side by raping her or attempting to I couldn't really tell if he did or not.   There is no future as far as love goes for Noodles as he doesn't know how to feel it after so much rejection. He is a broken man and is desperate for Deborah to love him but she resists only for him to do that to her.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro's performance is one of the best of his career especially when he is an older man because his eyes do all the talking as his age goes and his movements from place to place when reminiscing is just brilliant as the more he moves the more guilt runs through him.   He is a lost soul and doesn't see anyway of putting his past behind and getting one with the future.  His past haunts him and he won't let it rest as he grows more suspicious trying to find out why he was invited back to his hometown after being obsolete for the past 30 years and whilst that is happening he is trying to find out the truth and while this is going on we see how his life has come upon him in flashback.   De Niro is not the only reason we should watch this but James Woods also as he gives the performance of his career as Noodles best friend Max.   Once Upon a Time in America may come across slow in parts and when it's your first time it may not even make any sense to you anyway as it did me.  It took me at least three watches to get what happened and what was De Niro's smile all about but once you have got past all that and have really taken it in you will see that Leone didn't make a great film before he died but he made one of the greatest films ever made."

","What makes this movie better then the Godfather films - The storytelling structure of the way the film is put together. The way time and space are overlapped with one another is just sheer brilliance. Kubrick in his film `The Killing' made a great attempt at it and it worked very well in that film but here in `Once Upon a Time in America' one sees and experiences it in it's most pure and perfectly conceived form as of yet ever done in any film that has been made to date. The Director frames his shots most uniquely and everything becomes interesting and important. I have never seen or experienced another film quite like this one. Being almost 4 hours long it seems to pass by like a well paced 90 min feature. That's just how good this movie is. I have seen this film many times on Video, Laser Disc, and now the long awaited DVD release. (More on the DVD in a moment) fantastic character development like the Jennifer Connelly/Elizabeth McGovern girl, the two blend so well that when I first saw the movie I thought it was the same girl, and the mythic way that Elizabeth McGovern moves thru the film, she stays the eternal myth that never ages as all else ages around her, this is conveyed brilliantly in her old age make-up - She still looks like a young girl and yet you can see the age wrinkles, it is simply genius. Then there is the back-story when they are kids, it's a film in it's self and so wonderfully presented. So many other aspects of this film have been talked about by others I will leave that and talk of the DVD release - I couldn't wait until this DVD came out, I rushed to Virgin Records and bought a copy the day it came out, it look beautiful except for the glitches and the fact that disc one ends right in the middle of a scene and does not match the index at all. Well I thought it was just a bad disc so I returned it for another DVD of the film and when I watched that one it was the same, So I'm going to return this on in the morning. Looks like they rushed this one out. Beware. Get the Video (if you can or better yet the Laser Disc)  Major disappointment over this DVD. Someone Goofed on this. I hope the next DVD that I get after I return this one will prove to be better."
"Loo-2","Null","5","8","11 May 2003"," America and the romantic Gangster illustrated to perfection
","Sergio Leone and Marconi have brought us some of the most beautiful scenes of cinematic beauty in their Italian made Western's.  They showed a more real version of the wild west then American directors dared to show.  The West was wild and lawless. We felt that all had no choice but to work outside of law as it did not exist.  America, from the 20s to the 60s and 70s, is a modern world of Democracy and Law.  Those who chose to be gangsters, did so out of their own choice.  Especially the Jewish ones, as they could all have gone to school and become successful in a totally acceptable manner.   This is the main difference between the world of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", and the world of ""Once Upon a Time in America"". Two different worlds and two completely different films.  Both mesmerizing.   We see the world and life of two Jewish Gangsters (Deniro and Woods) being Noodles and Max.  We see them from school children, to old men.  All parts important and shown in various forms of flashbacks.  All the flashbacks edited with music and scenery as to blend together in a dream.  The Actors who play the children, look like child versions of Deniro and woods.  The attention to details is wonderful.   The music is part of the characters and part of their lives.  At one point one of the charactors plays the main movie theme on a wind pipe.  We are watching a poetic fairy tale of gangsters in love.  They are in love with their image, themselves and their friends and sweethearts.  The movie is about temptation.  In one of the childhood scenes, a 12 year old boy is waiting to have a sexual experience with the local girl tramp.  Her price is an ice cream Sunday.  He has to wait until she finishes with someone else.  While he is waiting, the ice cream starts to melt and the camera pans the boys face.  He licks the melted cream and watches it.  After a little while he has forgotten the girl and finishes the ice cream.  He is just a boy after all.  His real temptation the ice cream and the sex just a result of peer pressure.   The scene is without dialogue and is beautiful.<br/><br/>
This is a Leone film and our hero is still thoughtful and silent.  Here he is played by Deniro and we are in awe as to how a great actor can convey the silent hero with expressions and emotional force.  Deniro is superb.<br/><br/>
The constant flashbacks in this film should make it hard to follow the story line, but instead sucks us into the characters, their motives and their life.  It sucks us in and we are captivated.  This captivation this interest allows us to follow the story with ease.  This is brilliance of the movie.<br/><br/>Leone has made a different film then he has made before and he has kept his style and reinvented the Hollywood version of the Gangster film.  There is no glamour in our thugs.  Even Deniro does not know how to make love to a woman.  After all he was in prison for many years.  He is a thug.   This is not ""The Godfather"".   It is real and stunning.<br/><br/>The ending is perfect as it makes you think.   A smile give out the last fact in the story that is missing, but it lets you figure this out for yourself.     Remember the smile.   Remember Deniro in his greatest role. Remember Leone.    <br/><br/>Great film.  A must see for all who love what is good in the movies."

","One of the Academy Awards great injustices,cruelly ignored round Oscar time,much in the same way that Forrest Gump stole the limelight away from the vastly superior ""The Shawshank Redemption"" at the Oscars in 1994,this tale of gangsters features one of De Niro's finest ever performances to date,and was Leone's final masterpiece,but to this day is relatively unheard of,and is overshadowed by many other gangster type films,of which in my opinion,there are very few better."

","The lives of a group of Jewish gangsters from childhood to adulthood.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is dismissed as an overrated film by many, which I can understand.  It's very long, lacks dialogue and characters seem less engaging than in other gangster flicks - certainly not the kind you might see in a Scorsese picture.  These are not necessarily large flaws in a film created by the master Leone, however.  <br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is an exercise in cinematic brilliance.  Each scene is memorable and extracts the desired effect from the viewer.  I was enthralled with each moment.  <br/><br/>Over 200 minutes might be a stretch for the attention span of today's viewing audience, but not for those who have a strong interest in film, and know Leone's career.  <br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is not only a classic film, it is a summation of every gangster film before it.  A pitch-perfect movie, and one that definitely ranks among the Godfather."

","I decided, on Christmas Eve, to reacquaint myself with an old friend- Sergio Leone's heavyweight gangster epic, which I had previously watched in two sittings, 10 years previously, at Uni.<br/><br/>I was rewarded with a movie of tremendous vision and creative style as well as emotional integrity. When you take an idiosyncratic, brilliant, stylish director like Leone, his composer counterpart, Morricone, and a cast including two of the foremost actors of their generation (de Niro and Woods) then you have an idea of the kind of quality this film has. In fact, the only gangster movie(s) I've seen that match it are the first two Godfathers (in fact Leone almost directed those too... now that would have been interesting).<br/><br/>In contrast to earlier Leone Westerns, the characters are more fully developed- although the detachment of the characters in these movies made for a more rollercoaster, loose style of cinema, no one was ever going to win an award appearing in one, although they were all great movies.<br/><br/>Although I could tell I was in a Leone movie almost from the beginning, what was different was the inner lives of the characters dictated the way the plot flowed in a pleasing way. I also think that the performance de Niro put in was the best of any film I've seen him in, and that includes any Scorcese picture. To make the audience actually care about a character who does such evil (including raping the woman he loves) is a towering achievement. The apparent effortlessness with which he achieves this is a mark of true greatness. Leone's style of filmmaking, with its long silences and pauses and (in this case) slow pace suit de Niro's style of acting perfectly. It's a real pity that they never had the chance to work together again.<br/><br/>I think this a great film, and, at 3 3/4 hours, it kept me at least interested and often gripped all the way through. Why are Hollywood studios scared of movies like this? Some people out there love them."

","Sergio Leone made epic cinema - he understood events resonate only when you set them up properly.<br/><br/>In the 4 hours extended edition of Once Upon a Time in America, it's forty minutes before the first flashback to the initial storyline kicks in, with the protagonists as members of a teenage gang roaming the streets of early 20th century New York; it's a whole hour before Noodles (played as a child by Scott Tiler, as an adult by Robert De Niro in one of his iconic performances) meets Max (Rusty Jacobs / James Woods, never better), his criminal partner.<br/><br/>Leone's darkest movie - where his trademark male friendships are betrayed and broken - Once Upon a Time in America has a complex structure jumping back and forth in time, following Noodles' meteoric rise and fall during the Prohibition era as he poisons the relationships with his best friend Max and the only woman he loves, Deborah (Jennifer Connelly in a great cinematic debut / Elizabeth McGovern).<br/><br/>As an aside, while I loathe sexual violence in movies, the rape scene in this film, although highly disturbing, is among the rare ones not included for cheap sleazy drama but necessary character-wise: Noodles has become so accustomed to violence, he cannot cope with Deborah's refusal and hurts one of the few people he genuinely cares about. The criminal life brings the wealth with which he attempts to win her over, but eventually ruins her life and turns Noodles himself into a miserable, lonely man full of regrets.<br/><br/>Classic Leone themes - like the inherent violence of civilized society in general and of business in particular - are given a darker spin. Max morphs into a businessman / politician involved in the higher spheres of crime, someone who doesn't get his hands dirty (like Morton in Once Upon a Time in the West), severing his ties with Noodles until he chooses his own karmic comeuppance.<br/><br/>Or is the whole story an opium-induced hallucination by Noodles as a young man? It's possible, but besides the point: the ending is a way to show Noodles trapped into his own self-inflicted nightmare of violence and betrayal."

","The version I am reviewing is called the directors cut. It is 4 hours and 11 minutes long!
Leone was aiming for EPIC here but it feels more like overwrought and overly long. Not every Italian director is Bertolucci or even Coppola!
This movie is about a old gangster who is summoned home and reflecting upon his youth and young adulthood as a gangster in same city.
The actors do their usual best but poor plot lines and editing between flashback and current scenes bog down the film.
The female leads are nothing but sex objects and there is no effort to flesh out or address their actions.
Leone does a good job of giving screen time to all the child actors but as adults De Niro and Woods deserve and garner most of the screen time.
There are several huge plot holes in the film I saw that are beyond the pale and greatly reduce the impact of this film."

","After so many years of westerns, Sergio Leone made ""Once Upon a Time in America"", about several friends forced to abandon their loyalty as they age. This is one of those movies that's too hard to simply describe; you really have to see it to understand it. And you may be disappointed if you expect something exactly like ""The Godfather""; they are gangsters, but they're Jewish, so that changes things a little.<br/><br/>If absolutely nothing else, this disproves the notion that we have nowadays that historical epics are always pieces of drudgery (blame ""Alexander"" for that stereotype). ""OUATIA"" is the sort of movie that could only star people like Robert DeNiro. It also stars James Woods, Joe Pesci, Elizabeth McGovern, Treat Williams, and Jennifer Connelly (in her debut), and they all do a great job. This movie is a masterpiece in every way. But don't take my word for it; see for yourself."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","18","41","11 April 2006"," My favourite film (spoilers)
","The Godfather is undoubtedly the most acclaimed gangster film out there, but I'd take Once Upon a Time in America over it any day. In fact, I'd take Leone's film over any film full stop. It's just a beautiful film. It's a film about friendship, love, greed and time  all the good stuff.<br/><br/>One of the most audacious things in the film is the way the exposition is delivered. Noodles (De Niro) is in an opium den, high as a kite, and he's woken up by a buzzing in his head. But then as he looks at a newspaper with the faces of some dead gangsters on the cover, the buzzing turns into the sound of a telephone. And the telephone rings as we're taken back in time. The first thing we see are dead bodies on a street, one whose face is charred beyond recognition. Then we see a party, where Noodles excuses himself to make a call. But when he picks up the receiver the ringing telephone on the soundtrack doesn't cease. Then we cut to a police station and see another telephone. Only when this one is picked up does the telephone stop sounding. It's a very elegant way of showing Noodles' betraying his friends and communicating that he's in the opium den because his betrayal is ringing in his ears.<br/><br/>Just as elegant are the shifts in time. The film is wrapped around an elderly Noodles returning to New York after receiving a mysterious letter. He thought he'd escaped his mob life. But as he returns to his old home, we have extended flashbacks. And the transitions are beautiful. Indeed, one of them may even very well be my favourite bit in any film.<br/><br/>The moment in question is when the old Noodles returns to Fat Moe's more than thirty years after he left. Noodles looks at some old photos of his friends and then wanders to the back of the establishment. Morricone's awesome score swells and Noodles stands on the lid of a toilet. He then pulls a peephole back and edges closer towards the hole. Through the other side we see his sad eyes and when we cut back we see what he's seeing. We see a young girl dancing in the back room of a bar  Noodles' beloved Deborah. And then when we see Noodles again it's the young Noodles. It's an amazing piece of cinema.<br/><br/>And I do have to say that of all the sections in the film, I love the childhood scenes the most. There's just so much energy and life in these scenes. You have Noodles and his gang of degenerate friends burning down a newsstand, Noodles flashing his nymphomaniac neighbour, Patsy trying to buy a 'favour' from the aforementioned nymphomaniac by buying an expensive cake only to scoff it himself when he's made to wait on the stairs, and the scene where the urchins blackmail a policeman. These kids are little bastards, but somehow Leone infuses their scenes with such a degree of innocence. We love these kids. Therefore it's devastating when one of them, the smallest and perhaps most innocent, is shot down by a rival gangster. And when the child tells Noodles that he slipped just before he dies, it's powerful as hell. Finally the fun and games are over and the consequences of a criminal life are revealed.<br/><br/>One of the consequences is that Noodles goes to prison for avenging his friend's death and for stabbing a policeman. But when he comes out things have changed between him and his best friend Max (James Woods). They just aren't on the same page any more. Noodles would rather talk to Deborah than take an interest in the criminal empire Max has built up in his absence. But despite his lack of interest Noodles does get involved. Indeed, during a robbery Noodles is asked to put a cork in a woman who wont shut up. And he does so literally.<br/><br/>But this is a good example of a complexity in Noodles' character. He's an interesting mixture of a romantic and a thug. And an even better example of this is his reaction to Deborah leaving New York to go to Hollywood. This is the woman he loves, and he tries his best to woo her by taking her to a fancy restaurant and hiring it entirely for the two of them. But when she tells him that she's leaving he's devastated. We see him in the car completely heartbroken. But Deborah makes the mistake of giving him a consolation kiss that leads to a brutal rape. Leone got into a lot of trouble for saying that this was an act of love, but he's right in a way. What Noodles does is completely wrong, but he does it out of a sick, twisted, obsessive love. In that moment he'd rather destroy her than let anyone else have her.<br/><br/>But it says something for Leone and De Niro that I care for this character. He does a lot of ugly things but he's human. And the scenes with the elderly Noodles are dripping with melancholy. ""What have you been doing all these years?"" ""Been going to bed early,"" replies Noodles. Since New York his life has stopped.<br/><br/>And it's quite interesting that the confrontation at the end of the film centres entirely around dialogue. It's a world away from the guns of Leone's westerns.<br/><br/>And the film's final image is perfect. We see Noodles in the opium den. He smokes, lies on his back and the camera closes in on his face. For a few moments he's pensive, but then he cracks a huge grin. His friends are dead and he's the one who betrayed them, but he's lost in oblivion. Finally he's free from everything. And of course, this hints that the film could indeed be some sort of opium dream, but that's another matter entirely..."

","Its inconceivable to me, how anyone viewing this great film in its 4 hour version could not be moved, excited & ultimately overwhelmed by it. From the opening with that Goddamn ringing phone, to the last shot of a smiling stoned out DeNiro this film is a true work of art. Complicated & personal, Leone weaves an epic tale about a bunch of Jewish gangster-friends from their criminal childhood on New York's lower eastside in the 1900's to the 1960's. And like many films of the genre,Once Upon touches on the themes of friendship, loyalty & betrayal but does so in what some find an unsettling structure. The film constantly weaves from past to present and back again & I think that this form of filmmaking makes some American moviegoers uneasy. They like their films with beginnings, middles & hopefully happy endings. Now this is a film that is all over the place, with characters that come & go impolitely & age without aging. Leone the artist takes a sacred genre and does marvelous tricks & turns to it. Its also a very violent & sexy film, a little too ""European"" for a mainstream American film, so the film is butched down to a 2 hour version that gets bombed by critics, and hated by audiences who came expecting another Godfather sequel, because hey after all DeNiro is in it. Also in the film is James Woods & the always great Tuesday Weld. The music is by Ennio Morricone & the beautiful cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli. I'm delighted to see how many positive and interesting comments this film has gotten here, and I too can't wait for it to be on DVD.

"JuguAbraham","9","11","25","21 February 2006"," Why I liked this film more than Coppola's ""The Godfather""
","Not many realize that Sergio Leone was offered the chance to direct Puzo's ""The Godfather"" but opted to make ""Once upon a time in America."" They say he regretted this decision later in life--but it would be pertinent why someone like Leone would have made such a decision. <br/><br/>Any Leone fan would know the importance the director gives to music, structure of the story, the importance of money and how it corrupts many values. All these elements are underlined in this gangster film. In Coppola's work, the story afforded more importance to social details, character details and fabulous camera-work. Both works are monumental--but I preferred Leone's work, truncated to less than 4 hours than his original cut of 6 hours.<br/><br/>The music. Leone's favorite Ennio Morricone provided one of the finest film music for this film and he won awards for this film as he had won praise for Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" and a host of other spaghetti westerns by Leone. But the real contributor of music was a Romanian flute player called Georghe Zamfir who plays the brilliant ""Pan's song"" just as Zamfir played the same tune equally effectively in Australian Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" made 9 years before Leone's film. Weir and Leone both know their music and both need to be complimented for picking up this obscure Romanian to enhance their films. Leone's cinema does not limit to brilliance of music--he uses sound to give effects that surpass the camera eye. The ringing telephone--a telephone ring that persists before the number dial moves on the instrument--provided a stamp of Leone that no viewer will easily forget--and no director had accomplished so effectively. Of course, the telephone call was so central to the film's plot. If the telephone was not enough, the sound of the lift moving up (without a passenger) plays another aural reminder of Leone's cleverness behind the camera.<br/><br/>The structure. Leone's screenplay of switching from the present to the past and vice versa increases the entertainment value. Coppola's work was linear and less demanding of the viewer. In many ways Leone's work comes very close to the Coppola's third ""Godfather"" film--his least appreciated Godfather film, which mixes pathos, irony and closure to intrigues. Leone's film is many ways quite philosophical as was Coppola's ""Godfather III""--far removed from the brutal and power-hungry Godfathers I and II. Leone was able to add a dash of comedy--scenes with antics of the Artful Dodger in Carol Reed's ""Oliver!"" are copied in the sequences of the early years. Leone's comedy can span from a simple act of hungry boy eating a cream pastry that he had bought to impress his love interest to a young girl taunting her boy lover that ""his mother is calling"" when his male friend whistles. Coppola's cinema rarely dealt with comedy, unless it was a precursor to tragedy. Several sequences where Leone switches time--the eyes of the protagonist changing from the old to the young man, the appearance of the protagonist in the railway station, and the Frisbee hitting the protagonist as he walks the lonely cold street--makes the film more exciting and colorful. The long film is suddenly less boring as it entertains you while unfolding the saga. The switching of the female child with the male, the corruption among the law enforcers, and the obvious dwarfing of the female characters against the male parts for Leone appears more pronounced than in Coppola, because the intent is to underline the weakness of male folly at the height of their power. <br/><br/>The film is Leone's essay on American's interest in getting rich and powerful at the cost of simple values of honor and friendship. At the end the director emphasizes the importance of honor and friendship even among gangsters and even women who often ultimately seek the rich guy to live with rather than the true lover. <br/><br/>The effect of De Niro's final laugh at the camera can be interpreted in several ways. Who is he laughing at? The camera? The audience? The irony of his life? Is the chase for money worth it? It reminds me of Richard Burton's character, a vicious bank robber in the final shot of the British film ""Villain"" (1971) turns around at the camera and shouts ""Who do you think you are looking at?""<br/><br/>Leone could not have made ""Godfather I or II"", but he could have dealt with ""Godfather III"". And Coppola could never have made ""Once upon a time in America"". Leone's decision to change the name of the film from the novel's name ""The Hoods"" gives an indication of where the director is leading the audience.<br/><br/>The more you see the film you realize the film is a robust one that will stand the test of time because Leone did not want to merely present an interesting saga on screen but entertain intelligently."

","i first saw this film when it was on 1 of the movie channels,showing the first half of the flick on the 1 night,followed by the second period on the next.to that point i'd never seen a DeNiro film and as i had nothing better to do i thought i'd give it a bash.<br/><br/>I'm usually 1 to commit myself to a film once i'm comfortably seated and after about 40 minutes i found i was totally drawn in to what i was watching and by the end of the first half had no intention of missing the concluding 2 or so hours the following night.<br/><br/>My whole opinion to film has changed since seeing this movie.Once Upon A Time In America has a certain aura about it that no other film has ever had upon me.There was nothing i could fault about it.From the story,to the music,to the exquisite acting this film will go down as the greatest film i've ever seen and nothing else has come close 2 comparison since.Its ranking of 120th in the top 250 list to me is a surprise to say the least.<br/><br/>DeNiro and Woods performance as the mysterious Noodles and the fiery Max respectively is second to none.The child actors who play the leading characters in the 1920's also do a superb job.Ennio Morricones haunting score was fabulous and its a crying shame that the soundtrack was never given the real accolades it truly deserved.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America is a film that sticks with you long after the end credits come rolling,which very few films manage to achieve.I wasn't too sure the next day whether i'd just seen a masterpiece or whether it was simply a film i wouldn't forget about in a hurry.<br/><br/>There are many memorable scenes that truly moved me.Such as the young Patsy eating the cake,Noodles meeting with Max after his 35 year exile and the dramatic scene in the 1920's when the gang lose,as the epitaph puts it 'their youngest and strongest'.<br/><br/>OUATIA isn't a film i'd recommend anybody to see.It is portrayed as a gangster film but once viewed it is actually also seen as a story of love,hate and betrayal.You'd need to give the film your full attention as the complex storyline and the constant flashbacks can easily cause confusion.Those who prefer more action packed gangster films would probably lean towards Goodfellas but those who appreciate the lesser known fine films should not live without seeing this masterpiece."

","Of course it's very hard to make up the minds of someone else. That's why there are always some rough discussions being held about the rating of a movie. Everyone has a personal opinion, and you have to respect that. Besides that it IS possible to rate a movie on technical aspects. You may not like a film, but in a good movie there are always things you do like.<br/><br/>Once upon a time in America is a fantastic movie. At least that's my opinion. The story is fantastic, because you're following three different threads, which in a way has much to do with each other. The Godfather Part II, another favorite of mine, tried to amuse the audience with two threads, and it succeeded very well. The huge difference of the Godfather II is it's speed, it's rhythm. I know a couple of people that don't like it, and that's because it's too slow. But not by far as slow as Once upon a time in America. That's probably one of the main reasons it's not being loved as much as other great films. <br/><br/>You have to like Leone's style, but his Westerns are admired, although they're very slow too. But in a way I think people didn't expect it in a Mafia film, and did in a Western. Leone plays with switching to another storyline in this movie, and he does a fantastic job. The way some remarkable objects (the missing brick, the wall at the station) are used to remark a flashback is extraordinary.<br/><br/>Another good aspect of Leone is that his scores are composed by Ennio Morricone since A Fistful of Dollars. Good music is the thing that gives a movie more weight, and makes you remember it. And again in Once upon a time in America Morricone succeeded compose one of the best scores ever made for a movie. <br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie was way too long for theaters, so they made the biggest mistake possible. Instead of dividing it in two pieces, they deleted an amazing amount of scenes, what raped this movie. The latest DVD release will hopefully give some of it's beauty back, because this movie is a masterpiece. The only movie I've seen that could compare with this is The Godfather Part II, in style and supremacy. If you don't like slow movies, it's a pity, because a movie like this will not be made anymore. And perhaps that's good, as almost every succeeded movie has an equivalent or remake. Once upon a time in America still is a unique performance."
"indra_v_2000","9","10","23","19 December 2004"," Once Upon a Time In America (1984)
","The first time I have seen Once upon a Time in America was on TV - the 3hrs 47 minutes (european) long version. Somehow I subconsciously had an association with that other Sergio Leone's epic: Once Upon a time in the west, but only because of the similar use of the title - Once upon a time in......I had only heard of the movie before, and had read the plot as described in the TV-guide, so i was aware this was a gangster's movie and not a western. After that first time I had not the idea this was one of the best movies i had ever seen (the slow pace of the plot is often discussed and I guess it did annoy me a little bit the first time). But being a film adapt I watched the movie the next weekend again and I already got really intrigued by the plot and the director's choice to cut the film in non-chronological style. That's why this is a typical movie you have to see at least three times. Now I believe the movie deserves to be rated 'a masterpiece'.<br/><br/>As it comes to the plot i also compared the film with the Deer Hunter -In both films you can see how a very close relation/friendship between a group of people can be very harshly torn apart due to either the evil things of war(in the deer hunter) or different ambitions between two characters (Max's ambition to be part of the rich elite and Noodles that wants to stay in the stink of the gutter....) Another similar detail between the two movies that - until so far - in no comment was noted is the score at the end of both movies: As well as in the Deer Hunter as in OUATIA, you hear 'God bless America', in the Deer Hunter, Meryl Streep starts to sing because they seek comfort with each other, and in OUATIA you hear the original version.<br/><br/>Finally, Robert de Niro's performance is again impeccable - probably one of his best besides Taxi Driver (1976). James Woods also shows his best performance like all other actors in a supporting role. I do not agree with the critic-asters that underrate the movie because of its length and slow pace of plot. In my opinion the slow pace is a strength of the movie which you can indeed only value after you have seen the movie several times. The slow pace contributes to the built-up tension (Noodles nerve-breaking slowly stirring his coffee when he returns from holiday and max deviates the pay-off)perfectly shot by Leone. Due to the slow pace the eventual impact of some of the scenes (and especially the last scene at the 1968 reunion at Secretary's Baily's room) makes you left behind appalled. <br/><br/>I rate this movie as one of my all-time favorite top 3."
"ignatz928","10","13","32","30 September 2006"," Leone's masterpiece
","As with all of Leone's films, America displays a fastidious concern with detail in its sets, costumes, and props. Leone's concern, however, is not with strict historical realism, but rather with creating a sort of heightened reality. Though his movie is a gangster story that takes place in small-scale or squalid places like opium dens, tenement buildings, and crowded delicatessens, production designer Carlo Simi gives everything a touch of opulence, a larger than life quality. And I mean ""larger than life"" quite literally- as has often been said about Leone's work, America's sets, while often evocative and convincing in their individual details, as a whole are grandiosely overscaled, so that the interior of a kosher delicatessen on the Lower East Side appears as large as a train station, and an opium den supposedly hidden in the back room of a Chinese puppet theater (with, according to Leone biographer Christopher Frayling, Indonesian puppets performing an Indian epic) has people on cots stretching up the ceiling. The epic quality of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West lay more in their style and physical scale than in the movies' actual stories, which are rather slight. Leone placed his characters against the background of vast historical movements and events, but he didn't focus on the powerful people causing or at least marshaling these events. On the contrary, much of the larger than life quality of his heroes and villains came from how they seemed to exist outside of society and normal human concerns, like, as writer Danny Peary pointed out, a more-than-human race of warriors doomed by the advent of civilization. Gangsters, of course, don't stand outside of society so much as they infiltrate it and corrupt it, and Leone adopts to this difference with a comparatively restrained style, particularly for his actors. Still, little remnants of his spaghetti westerns remain in his interpretation of mobsters. One important difference from The Godfather is that Leone's gangsters are not bosses- they do their own dirty work, whether it be smuggling, union racketeering, or murder. They're still outlaws more than figures of authority, and the main source of contention between Noodles and Max is the latter's decision to hire the gang out to ""the Syndicate,"" as represented by Joe Pesci's mob powerbroker. In interviews on the film Leone spoke of the Prohibition era as the second great era of frontier lawlessness in America, which makes no sense from a historical point of view but works beautifully from a pop culture perspective, which of course is the point. Leone puts an almost touching faith here in the viability of genre as a means through which to filter his epic vision of twentieth century America. The childhood scenes are like a wicked, R-rated version of Our Gang, with the pint-sized crooks exhibiting a strange innocence, displayed most memorably in the famous cream pie scene. But already this innocence has begun to curdle into amorality, into an unthinking amorality and disregard for others. Leone sympathetically and amusedly dwells on their battles with the buffoonish, corrupt neighborhood cop, known as ""Fart-face."" These scenes have a particularly Our Gang-like quality to them, depicting clever and precocious outwitting stupid and cruel adults. The first of the gang's exploits that we see, however, consists of them burning down them the news-stand of a man who has refused to pay protection money to the local boss. The kids watch excitedly through a grille as flames devour a man's livelihood before his eyes as if they were watching a show put on for their own amusement. All throughout the film, we see people watching other people at a remove, particularly men watching women. Noodle is the ultimate spectator, often silent, constantly watching others, desiring women he can't have, observing events he can't control, seemingly vanishing for extended periods of time (first for eight years, then for thirty-five,) to reappear in an America that has gone on without him, among people who have gone on without him. At least 2/3 of the film, and possibly the whole film, occur in his head, in flashbacks to his past, so Noodles can watch his own life unfolding like strips of film in a projector. Early on, we see patrons watching an Indonesian shadow-play in the theater that fronts for the opium den where Noodles hides from the world. The silent audience outside and the stoned customers within taken together are like a Janus-faced portrait of a movie watcher, subsuming their daily lives in the play of shadow and light on a screen in a state close to dreaming, or drug-induced hallucination, or even death."
"yihong.yao","10","13","32","30 May 2000"," The best gangster movie ever made
","Godfather is probably more entertaining. However, this movie makes you want to cry and think hard about life.  I have watched this movie about 10 times. Everytime after I watched it, I felt exhausted and extremely sad.  There is just so much stuff in this movie and it's basically impossible for me to compare this movie to any other single movie, maybe a string of Fellini's or Bergman's movies. Remember I am using the word string. A lot of people just do not like this movie. People I think (or used to think) had good taste think the movie is too long, too dry, and basically just a big waste of time. But some people who have seen it agree with my view that it is an enormously rich and rewarding film. The problem is that the film is almost four hours long, and can be somewhat confusing with its layers of flashbacks. However, the full story of the film is a large one, and Leone's style is so operatic at this point that it takes much longer than the plot demands. There are many slow crane shots of various streets in New York's lower east side, and many awkward silences and pauses where nothing is physically happening. The action, however, does not seem slow to me. None of Leone's movies seem slow. Leone keeps everything moving quite nicely, yet he pauses to establish the mood with, for example, a crane shot of the bustling New York street, or a scene where Noodles stirs his coffee for a couple minutes, letting the mood become extremely uncomfortable. None of Sergio Leone's Western characters seem to have much emotion in any of his movies. There is emotion, but it tends to be emotion that is extremely repressed, hidden beneath a calm, tough exterior. This film is different. Noodles (Robert de Niro) does not seem to have any emotions, extremely odd for the protagonist of a movie. When Noodles comes home and visits Fat Moe after 35 years away, his first words after seeing Moe are ""I brought you back the key to your clock"". There is a reason for Noodles loss of affect, as the psychologists call it. His emotion has been buried under the memory of having inadvertently killed his best friends, his soul has clearly died. After meeting Max (James Woods) as a kid, Noodles, Max, Patsy, and Cockeye form a gang. After spending mostof his childhood in jail for avenging the death of a friend, Noodles rejoins Max and the gang,to find Max starting an ambitious climb to the top of the organized crime ladder. Eventually,Max becomes too ambitious, and after prohibition is repealed, seeks to rob the Federal Reserve. To stop him from an obviously suicidal heist, Noodles turns Max in. However,Max and the rest of the gang get into a shoot-out with the police, and Noodles soon hears of the death of Max, Patsy and Cockeye. Noodles can't stop thinking about the call made that killed his best friends, and soon has to flee New York because the crime syndicate he worked for now is trying to kill him. Thirty-five years later, he is still haunted by the memories of his dead friends. He is mysteriously summoned to New York by an unknown person for unknown reasons, and soon discovers a trail of clues that will lead to a great revelation. At the end, there is the final smile by Noodles, doped up on opium, the only time in the movie that he looks completely happy and at peace. Even though this is an earlier Noodles, this is Leone's way of depicting Noodle's return to normality after 35 years of grief. It is the perfect conclusion to this movie. This is a story of a man at war with himself. Noodles is criminal, savage, ruthless, and is sexually animalistic (as demonstrated in the various raping scenes). Yet he is also tender, loving, down-to-earth, and honorable. The center of this conflict is Deborah, who loves Noodles, and tries to turn him away from his criminal side. Deborah is the one pure thing in his life, the one thing that he loves, and when she is about to leave for an acting career, Noodles rapes her. He rapes her because he is mad at her, he is confused, and realizes that this is probably the last time he will ever see her, so he must have sex with now or never. Besides, that is Noodle's instinct, and his sudden moves on Deborah would be quite acceptable with the kind of girl he normally sees. Perhaps he rapes her because he sees in her a purity that he can never have, tries to take it and in the process destroys it. When Noodles' realizes what he has done, he starts on a slow recovery process, gradually becoming less and less criminal, which forces the rift with Max, who is determined to build a huge organized crime empire. When Max and the others are dead, and Noodles flees New York, his bad side has vanished. And when he comes back, he is a changed man. The reason that I feel this is the best gangster movie is because none have the combination of style and substance that this films brings. It's not just about gangsters, its a look inside the soul of Noodles. Robert de Niro gives such a wonderful understated performance that the character of Noodles sticks with you. I can still remember Noodles just by a certain look in de Niro's eyes, a sort of calm depression, a look that has the weariness of the world in it. This is a movie where the mood of repressed sadness will linger long after the film has ended. Very few films are as powerful."
"ArtVandelayImporterExporter","2","12","29","7 July 2019"," Director's Cut Just as crappy as the 1984 Hatchet Job
","Remember when all the critics said this movie was great but got turned into an incomprehensible mess by the studio. Turns out they were lying. Once Upon A Time in America is a bloated, pointlessly violent, disgustingly r#pey, badly acted, boringly plotted pile of movie junk at any length.
It's hard to believe that the same man who wrote and directed Once Upon A Time in the West, with one of the strongest female characters in Western movie history (Claudia Cardinale's Jill McBain) or even Mrs Baxter in A Fistful of Dollars, could pen and helm a movie where the women apparently exist merely to be sexually assaulted.
Leone was on more solid ground in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly where there are, in effect, zero female characters and the entire sprawling epic rests on a love/hate triangle among three memorable male characters. The relationships in this, his final feature, are entirely unbelievable and unsympathetic. And my goodness the juvenile actors. they're more obnoxious than The Bowery Boys.
I thought Duck, You Sucker was Leone at the bottom of the barrel. But he saved his worst for last.
Special mention to Morricone for turning in a career-worst movie score. And to McGovern (or whoever dubbed her voice), who can't seem to decide whether her character is a surfer girl or some pseudo-Euro like Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly or any number of other mid-century actresses with fake posh accents.
Twist ending, so to speak, doesn't save it. Merely turns it from the tragedy Leone was trying to make into the farce the ticket-buying public treated it as.
I watched the entire thing, though, so I give myself 2 stars."

"shaftels2do","6","6","12","14 January 2008"," Visually stunning but incongruous screenplay
","""Once Upon A Time In America"" is both great and terrible. Ambitious and lavish, Director Sergio Leone's epic is an obvious attempt to create a work on par with Coppola's ""The Godfather."" Wonderful score and great cinematography in a decade-spanning story that wouldn't seem so long had it been written better.<br/><br/>Often compared to ""The Godfather,"" OUATIA has nothing to do with that story or characters except a parallel time line. OUATIA is about NY Jews, and this group of childhood friends who become gangsters in NYC during Prohibition. This film is not about Italians or the Italian Mafia, and the difference was largely missed by director Leone. He didn't do his homework on these characters and the history of Jews in New York. The characters and scenes depicted of what Brooklyn life was like during the first half of the 20th century are seen through Mr. Leone's non-American imagination. These guys are not ""organized crime,"" they were just a bunch of pals from the 'hood.<br/><br/>This film hits close to my family. My grandfather had a Kosher restaurant in Brooklyn in the 1920's-1940's, similar to the family restaurant owned by ""Moe's"" family. My father spent most of his childhood in the kitchen. I have photographs of Pop's restaurant that could have been research for ""Fat Moe's."" My father reminisced fondly of eating charlotte russe pastries.<br/><br/>Director Sergio Leone and Art Director Carlo Simi missed the mark on so much. The bond between all these characters was their Jewish identity, not family ties as in ""The Godfather."" Although these boys were not observant, at that time they would have been thoroughly Jewish in culture and very involved with their families, despite what they did when they were out of the apartment. Why wasn't even one of the lead actors Jewish? It's laughable. Only actor Larry Rapp as ""Fat Moe"" is Jewish and gets the mannerisms, gestures and pronunciations right. De Niro naturally gives decent NY/Brooklyn accent. The other lead actors never get it right. Elizabeth McGovern's accent is so awful she sounds like she's trying to speak after major oral surgery. We only get a few tastes of these characters' Jewish identity, such as when they toast Noodles' return, but even then most of them mispronounce ""L'chaim"" badly. The scene of the first night of Passover, where all the men in the neighborhood stream out into the street wearing talit (prayer shawls) makes a great visual cinematic statement that this is a Jewish neighborhood, but it is factually wrong; the men would not have worn their talit in the street. Burt Young tells a disparaging story about Jews, and the boys barely exchange glances. After the diamond robbery, Noodles and Max discuss their future working for Pesci, ""Frankie,"" but Director Leone misses half of the point; Noodles not only doesn't want a boss; he doesn't want to get involved with the Italian Mafia because his crew are not Italians and that's why he knows they wouldn't survive. After Max staged his own death, then reappears at the end of the film as a successful business man now US Secretary of Commerce, he's reinvented himself as a gentile named ""Bailey,"" because only a gentile could have risen to that status at that time in America, but that point is never clearly made.<br/><br/>There are many errors in continuity, geography, and anachronisms in props, set dressing, and scenery that confuse the audience as to where the action is taking place and what year it is- if you are knowledgeable about architecture, geography, and technology they are obvious.<br/><br/>The very first exterior shot of ""Brooklyn"" in the 1910's is obviously European and doesn't resemble Brooklyn at all. Most of the interiors are larger and grander than what they would really have been in New York, ridiculous past artistic license. Fat Moe's family restaurant is too large and sprawling; there were no buildings in Brooklyn that large, and the adjacent storeroom with the skylight was not believable. No speakeasy in New York City was ever that large; it came across as a glorious nightclub on par with a ballroom, and not a clandestine booze joint in the back of a building. The lavish hotel on Long Island where Noodles takes Deborah for dinner doesn't resemble anything that was on Long Island ever; the location is so obviously in Europe, plus the extremely poor choice of costumes for the orchestra. Did Leone and Simi really think that the Gare Du Nord train station in Paris could pass for Grand Central Station, an icon of American architecture? <br/><br/>With 6 credited Italian screenwriters, it's no wonder that the storyline has huge holes and wandered away from Harry Grey's book ""The Hoods."" The film begins with the murder of Noodles' girlfriend, and we never find out who she is and she is never mentioned again; it's just a gratuitous murder to set the ""gangster"" tone of the story. Robert De Niro appears as elderly ""Noodles"" in 1968 and goes to find Fat Moe at his family restaurant. Noodles asks Fat Moe about his history, and we eventually learn what has happened to all the other characters. We never find out what Noodles has been doing for the past 35 years. There are too many times where connecting story lines or information is left out.<br/><br/>Performances are uneven. De Niro is great, but there was no on-screen chemistry between him and James Woods, which makes their scripted deep friendship not believable. Burt Young steals the show with a cameo in one scene that is both disgusting and hilarious. Tuesday Weld is excellent as ""Max's"" masochistic nymphomaniac older girlfriend. Treat Williams plays a Jimmy Hoffa-type union boss, but his storyline is lost so his scenes don't connect with anything else. The ending of the film is just a big question mark of ""what happened?"" but not in an intriguing way. It's an unsatisfying and contrived mystery."

","Once Upon a Time in America (1984) Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Danny Aiello, Larry Rapp, Burt Young, Joe Pesci, Scott Tiler, Jennifer Connelly, Rusty Jacobs.<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>At the start of the 80's decade, cinema had already gotten a strong start for making great films. Surrounded by tons of mindless and idiotic films from the Comedy and Horror genre that nearly ruined the decade, films like Raging Bull (my favorite of the 1980's), The Empire Strikes Back, Ordinary People and The Elephant Man were some of the best to come out of 1980. Throughout the years, others like Platoon, Rain Man, and Do the Right Thing have been hailed as some of the best of the decade. With one of the best films that has ever been brought to the screen, Once Upon a Time in America, has been constantly ignored and forgotten.<br/><br/>Like Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, and A Clockwork Orange, Once Upon a Time in America is a turning point in its genre. It's the only film that I've seen that captures the atmosphere and tells the story so differently from others. Sergio Leone's final film, Once Upon a Time in America is actually one of the hardest films I've ever critiqued. It is all around astonishing in the sense that the film is extremely well made by Leone, in the longest film of his career.<br/><br/>The story begins as a mystery, with several men on the search for Noodles, a Jewish gangster on the run from the men for ratting out his ""friends"". As he escapes the city, we forward to thirty-five years later to him as a senior. There, he comes back to visit a friend and look back on the regrets from his past, from his childhood to him as a younger adult, where he and his best friends rise together in the mob ranks.<br/><br/>Leone, a perfectionist, took many years to write the screenplay. He went through script changes and re-writes many times, and never could get it exactly as he wanted it. When he was finally finished, he acted the film out himself. Objectively, Once Upon a Time in America is possibly the greatest gangster film I've ever seen along with The Godfather and Goodfellas. And it is that reason why I give him credit for giving one of the best directions in a film. His techniques obviously inspired Tarantino to go on making Pulp Fiction, and somewhat even for Martin Scorsese with Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Leone is probably most famous for making films such as the Dollars trilogy (Fistful of Dollars; For a Few Dollars More; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and Once Upon a Time in the West. Here, he uses a similar storytelling like ""West"" did, except here it is far more personal into the depths of the characters. The cast is fantastic. De Niro seems rather different in this role, but is still very good. James Woods, Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth McGovern give their best roles to date.<br/><br/>A 139-minute version was brought to the United States for a theatrical release, and was found disappointing by many critics and Leone fans in general. This version showed the film in chronological order, with many important (if intense) character pieces cut out. Ennio Morricone's (who also did the score for the Dollars trilogy) musical score is among his greatest. It is performed in haunting and beautiful ways, and it perfectly matches the film.<br/><br/>The scenes with De Niro's behavior toward women are the ones that give the film a disturbing feel. The scenes with rape may offend some, but you have to understand why he does it before you can go on with the film. I think he did it because he never grew up learning how to treat a woman with love, and after raping the woman who he did love, he looks at the ground with guilt, and wondering to himself, what had he done wrong? Also, the character development in the film is horribly unappreciated. This is a film I just adored from the very beginning- one to expand my imagination on the characters as I did in Cinema Paradiso and City of God.<br/><br/>I won't lie. The content in Once Upon a Time in America is extremely brutal. There are several scenes with shootings, beatings, stabbings- some even involving kids. If you can endure violence and some language- great acting, amazing directing, terrific writing, stunning cinematography, beautiful music. What more could you ask for in a great film? In the end, I would call it the greatest film of the 1980's along with Raging Bull and The Empire Strikes Back. It is an incredible cinematic masterpiece that's greatness within every year that passes. This is Leone's greatest, and sadly last, film. 5 stars out of 5."

","A fantastic film , that holds the attention, we are transported back and forwards in time, to a world were loyalty appears to be everything but personal ambition destroys the friendship.This film is visually stunning being brutal and beautiful at the same time, there are two rape scenes which are still shocking, the second after one of the most romantic scenes ever in movies.The violence is often bloody for these are violent men let down by the system they live in their own world and make their own rules.The film is slow and patience is required to Vi it, the length of the film is such that it needs an effort to find the time to watch but each time you watch it, your looking forward to viewing it again.The direction is excellent Sergios lasting legacy, the acting is out of this world DeNiro has never been better and James Wood is fantastic.The DVD has some interesting extras though i would have liked more, i believe there was 9 hours on film of this movie, Sergio was a genius I wished he had lived long enough for another two movies."
"cineasten89","10","6","12","16 July 2005"," A fine story in the spirit of The Godfather and The Untouchables but yet different...
","It is impossible not being impressed or loving this movie completely. Robert De Niro is making one of his greatest roles, along with Taxi Driver and The Godfather, in this movie by playing David Aaronson, a Jewish gangster, who hangs out with his friends - Cockeye and Patsy among others - when he was a boy, when they said that they would die for each other... They shared their fortunes (which they earned by making some crime in the under world), their loves and their lives. When they grew to men, they shared a dream, a dream to skip poverty, which was their world, and rise to power. But they don't realize that it will cost them their friendship - that it will be built on greed, violence and betrayal for making the dream come true. Finally, their dream would end as a mystery that refuse to die. Except from De Niro, James Woods is making his maybe best role of Max, who becomes the leader of the gang of which De Niro is a member. <br/><br/>It is a fine story by three and half a hour that tells the whole story by the beginning of David's escape from the justice after being accused of having betrayed his friends, and how he thirty years later came back to his youth, wanting to find an answer of his past, returning to his memories from his time in the gang, how he was in love with Deborah, how he was best friends with Max, how everything ended... the end that still is a mystery.<br/><br/>It is a very thrilling drama movie, which the ending will be nothing you imagine, but of which you understand will happen by the last ten minutes until the fine story ends. The photography is beautifully filmed, the cinematography realistic, which make it feel like you are in the first half of the 20th century, when you aren't, and the actors all simply great as well as the characters and the story. It's one of the best storytelling movies, along with movies such like The Godfather and The Untouchables, that I've been watching... All simply, it's a great experience of a greater movie."

","Where to begin? This hasn't always been on my list of favorite movies. I first encountered it when I was 9 or 10 and my parents let me watch the first videotape (first half) before deciding it wasn't appropriate for me. I didn't see it complete until five years later. Since then, I have seen it about half a dozen more times including once in a theater (crappy print, but still). I wrote an essay about it for my entrance paper to get into the graduate program at NYU and since I got in, OUATIA will always have a particularly special place in my heart. I now throw it out as my favorite film when people ask and the reasons that I love it are perhaps best encapsulated by Leone himself in the biography Something to Do with Death that came out last year:<br/><br/>""I make fairy tales for grown-ups. I pay scrupulous attention to detail and making the setting realistic so I can focus on making the story mythic.""<br/><br/>In a nutshell, that's all his films, but in particular the one that took fifteen years to get off the ground and ate up three full years of his life. OUATIA is above all else, for film lovers, with its spiderweb plot drifting through the decades and back and its deliberate, dreamy pace. It is also the finest gangster film ever, precisely because it focuses on the lowest rung of criminals and succeeds in never making the gangster life look glamorous. The friendship between Noodles and Max surprises with its refusal to paint one as the ""grounded"" half and the other as the ""loose cannon."" They're both given to violent outbursts and both capable of (increasingly diminishing) moments of tenderness and compassion. This makes Noodles'(DeNiro) betrayal of Max (Woods) all the more haunting, and since Noodles's guilt is what drives the entire film, it's crucial for that to come across.<br/><br/>Much has been said about whether the film is a simple story, told out of sequence, a flashback, a flashforward, or an opium dream/ nightmare. I opt for the latter interpretation and without spoiling any of the film's surprises, consider this: Move the last shot of the film to the very beginning and everything else falls into place. The beauty of the closing shot (and it is one of the greatest closing shots in cinema) is the way it reveals nothing and everything.<br/><br/>There isn't even time to go into everything else that moves the spirit (Morricone's mythic score, Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography that finds the right tone for each of the three decades portrayed, the art design, particularly in the 1923 sequence with the children). I am not automatically a fan of long films but Leone creates a world that is worth falling into for 227 minutes)<br/><br/>A note about the running time: the bio reveals that the film runs 229 minutes outside the US, the extra two minutes being from the rape of Deborah. No longer version exists. Leone had wanted the film to run for 250 to 265 minutes but the footage that exists to make it longer was never dubbed to do so."

"andrei1981-1","10","7","15","24 November 2006"," Friendship
","I have read several comments on this film across the internet ""Best movie on prohibition"" ""Comparable only to Godfather"". I believe the movie is really about friendship and sacrifice. What is remarkable about this film is not only the screenplay but the remarkable ability of director Sergio Leone to create three movies in one with disregard to any chronological sequence of events. I have seen the movie two times in one week and I still have to watch it over a couple of times to fully understand the message.<br/><br/>The most dramatic part of the movie is towards the end, when Noodles decides to call the police hoping that Max would be arrested and therefore give up his plan to rob the Federal Reserve Bank, a complete suicidal act. Upon his call the police comes and his friends are killed, than Eve, his girlfriend is murdered by the police.<br/><br/>The movie begins in 1933 and ends with the same scene, with Noodles played by de Niro smoking opium on the bed at the Chinese place. This led a number of critics to the conclusion that actually Noodles is fantasizing about his future and I think this interpretation is correct. His devilish smile at the end of the movie is probably one of the most enigmatic pieces in filmography. Why is he smiling about? He just called the police and gave-in his friends who died in a shootout. is he smiling because everything is over, like some critics argue? I don't think so. He didn't seem unhappy up to this point, or at least not that desperate to explain such an emotion. Is it because he failed? I think this could be a possible answer. He was telling Fat Moe"" You can always tell winners and losers"" and he thought himself a loser. So the hysterical smile can be connected to a resignation in face of his fate. Logically, the movie should end in 1968. In a way or another. But it ends, strangely in 1933 with Noodles on a dose of opium and with a mysterious smile on his face. I think he dies that night along with his friends, the rest being just a premonition of what would happen if he stayed alive. The fact that Max survives in his fantasy is only one more reason to see it as a fantasy. Max was more than a friend, they seemed connected in life and death and the fact that Noodles was seeing him again in 1968 is just a projection of this close relationship, his brain refusing to accept that he practically murdered his best friend along with his other two childhood friends and his girlfriend Eve.<br/><br/>The fact is even more dramatic and striking as you see the friendship of these boys starting in a harsh neighbourhood in the 20s and you see them sticking together ten years later. Noodles tries to save them but instead he kills them. His smile is only an ironical resignation of his failure. In his premonition, he meets Fat Moe once again in 1968 and at a point Moe says: ""I would have bet everything on you"" ""You would have lost"" comes the reply from Noodles. This is the essence of the movie...and it is a true masterpiece"

"paulcannon","10","7","15","16 May 2005"," My favorite film
","Once Upon a Time in America is my favorite film. It plays like a live-action novel, and at 229 minutes, it would probably be faster to read the book (it's loosely based on ""The Hoods"" by Harry Gray).<br/><br/>Sergio Leone uses his classic filming style in which broad landscapes and wide angle scenery shots are juxtaposed against close up shots of character's faces. Everything is meticulously edited and every shot has something important to say.<br/><br/>The strong point of the film is its meaning, which is generally overlooked by most critics, who are typically more interested in plot. The plot is convoluted and at times uninteresting, but the message that the film sends is far more important. This movie is ultimately about the individual versus the collective. Using the idea of the ""American Dream"" as a catalyst, Leone employs themes of friendship, love, crime, and nostalgia to illustrate why individualism is overrated.<br/><br/>Max (James Woods) gradually takes over Noodles' (Robert de Niro) childhood gang. As they grow older, Max acquires more and more of what Noodles once had: his lover, his money, his friends, and, ultimately, his life. Max discovered that he could use his close-knit friends to catapult himself into a better life, while destroying Noodles' life and getting his other friends killed.<br/><br/>Leone assumes that the American Dream has to do with our focus on the individual. He shows the flaw in our belief that individual happiness doesn't require collective contentment by showing it in an individual case. What's interesting about this film is that it takes the perspective of the man who lost everything, unlike most American stories, which tend to illustrate a struggle to success. Noodles is left without money and exiled from his home for 35 years. Max climbs to the heights of power, but is left regretful and unhappy.<br/><br/>In the final scene, Noodles is seen smoking opium and smiling in a drug-induced haze. Through the complex sequence of flashbacks, it's possible that everything in the movie after a certain point was nothing more than a dream of Noodles'. Leone is suggesting that the American Dream itself is nothing more than a dream."

All of the other actors are good, I also like Treat Williams, I think he's a very underrated actor. <br/><br/>Sergio Leone's gangster masterpiece is an example of perfect direction. When you can tell a four hour story without boring the audience, you're good. But in the end, he shows us that the whole movie was just a dream, dreamed by the Robert de Niro character Noodles. That's so cool. The first time I watched the movie I coulden't believe what I just saw. How can you end such a long and beautiful movie like that. It's great, it's amazing, it's beautiful.

","Rating  * * * 1/2<br/><br/>
Sergio Leone made no movies from 1975 until this film came out... and it was his final classic.  Before, he had virtually created the Spaghetti Western-- along with Clint Eastwood and composer Ennio Morricone.  In fact, Leone turned down the chance to direct ""The Godfather"" in order to make this.<br/><br/>And he made a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>The plot is, as usual for Leone's films, extremely complex.  It starts in 1933, flashes forward to 1968, then back to the earliest days of the 1900s.  It concerns four Jewish friends who are involved in crime even as children.  They stay friends until adulthood, when two of them, Noodles (Robert de Niro) and psychotic Max (James Woods) begin to have differences, though they were the closest as children.<br/><br/>It's hard to think of anything wrong with this film.  There is one, however.  It goes on for 227 minutes.  Not that it's ever boring.  It just has too much of a few things.  Example: was all the stuff with prostitutes absolutely necessary?  Still, the fact that you can still respect Noodles after he rapes a woman is one show of Leone's brilliance.<br/><br/>Other than too much sex and violence, there really isn't much wrong with this film.  It did certainly deserve its R rating (for more than just those reasons), but it is still a classic.<br/><br/>The performances are outstanding.  De Niro and Woods are two of the best film actors alive today.  De Niro matched Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather Part II,"" was incredible in ""The Score,"" and was absolutely hilarious in ""Meet the Parents.""  These are only three of his best.  But Once Upon a Time is America is his best.  Ditto for Woods, who actually saved one of Sylvester Stallone's worst films, ""The Specialist,"" with an incredible performance.  And this here is his best.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are truly touching, others horrifying.  The final half-hour, where an aged Noodles tries to find out who ruined his life thirty-five years earlier.  The final meeting between Noodles and Max is one of the best filmed scenes ever.<br/><br/>Still, it would not be a classic without Ennio Morricone's score.  He is probably the best one out there, and this is probably his best.  It is absolutely beautiful and one of the greatest film scores ever.<br/><br/>Also helping is the incredible production design.  It really captures the period, nearly as well as the score.<br/><br/>This crime drama is stunning in every way.  Every way.<br/><br/>How this did not sweep the '84 Oscars is beyond me.<br/><br/>This is a true masterpiece, and Leone's last.<br/><br/>You have to see this film."

","It is difficult to rate this film since parts of it deserve a nine and others a rather sad four.<br/><br/>The film begins quietly, violently and engagingly with De Niro's character, Noodles, taking time out in an opium lounge while heavies are on the search for him. This introductory chapter is a promising piece of cinema with some quite masterfully edited sequences. Aesthetically too, it is masterful and detailed. We are eventually taken on a nostalgic journey back to Noodles' childhood where we are shown the blossoming friendships and criminality that would become his life. <br/><br/>All very nice, all very romantic and visually brilliant. At these early stages in the film, you can see yourself really settling to watching a magnificent epic. But as the film goes on, one can begin to see why this has not become the hardened classic that The Godfather or Goodfellas has. Put simply, there is too much sexuality. From the awkward, fumbling teenager to the grown-up, amoral rapist that Noodles is shown to be, the theme of sexual desire dominates the main body of the film. Indeed, you're never more than fifteen minutes away from a scene where someone is being touched-up, ravaged or slobbered over. Of course, there is nothing wrong with displaying such issues in film, but surely not with such determined frequency as to make it just plain seedy? <br/><br/>The harm that does to the film is two-fold. Firstly it distracts from what could be a beautiful and engaging piece of cinema and secondly it alienates the audience by having no sympathetic character. The Noodles of the 1960s, who we are to follow through the film, is really just an overly-nostalgic, nasty old sex offender."

","This is a high-quality gangster flick, with a good story, interesting characters, and an outstanding cast. It was cool to see Jennifer Connelly shine so brightly, even at a young age, and in her first feature film role. The makeup artists were also impressive. In aging De Niro 30 years, they made him look pretty similar to his appearance now, almost 30 years later! The movie was extremely long, but there weren't many boring moments. While I initially thought that more of the film should have been cut, I later learned from its IMDb trivia page that:<br/><br/>(1) Leone was contracted to deliver a 2-hours-and-45-minutes-long movie.<br/><br/>(2) Upon completion of filming, the movie ran 8-10 hours.<br/><br/>(3) Leone and editor Nino Baragli originally cut it down to 6 hours, and planned to release two 3-hour films.<br/><br/>(4) The producers forced Leone to cut it down to 3 hours and 49 minutes, leaving 45 minutes that he considered essential on the cutting room floor, including: further explanation of the mob/labor relationship, Noodles (De Niro) meeting Carol (Weld) in 1968, and a good deal of footage featuring Noodles's relationship with Eve (Fluegel).<br/><br/>(5) The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival in its original running time of 3 hours and 49 minutes.<br/><br/>(6) The Ladd Company heavily edited the American release, against Leone's wishes, down to 2 hours and 24 minutes. This version scrapped the flashback structure Leone used, and instead arranged all the scenes in chronological order. Most of the major cuts were in the childhood scenes, making the 1933 scenes the most prominent part of the movie. The conclusion was also altered.<br/><br/>(7) A few days before the film's premier in 1984, Williams found out the 2-hour version would be shown in theaters. He was heard to have said that no one would understand the movie in the shortened version.<br/><br/>(8) The 2-hour version flopped in the U.S., and many American critics, who knew of Leone's original cut, attacked the short version viciously; some critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner's operas (some of which run over 5 hours), saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. The movie was shut out of the Oscars, with no nominations.<br/><br/>(9) When the 3-hour-and-49-minute version was released on video and DVD, the film ultimately found commercial and critical success.<br/><br/>(10) According to Woods, a critic dubbed the movie's 2-hour theatrical version the worst of 1984; years later that same critic watched the 3- hour-and-49-minute version and called it the best of the 1980s.<br/><br/>Based on the foregoing, I believe the studio should have let Leone put out two 3-hour films, or at least it should have added the additional 45 minutes that Leone wanted (and then split the movie into two). The script contains many complex relationships and sub-plots, which developed over the course of half of a century, naturally begging an unreasonably long run timeÂ…even after 4 hours, some significant relationships, characters, and sub-plots still needed more development. At first, I thought that maybe the answer would have been to eliminate those complexities altogether, instead of partly depicting them, but the widespread disdain of the 2-hour version suggests that the movie is much worse without them. Therefore, I think that the best answer would have been to embrace the complexity and give Leone the time that he needed to best develop this film.<br/><br/>I also would have liked to see the film explore more of the differences between Jewish and Italian mobsters. Other than a few camera shots of Jewish food, Yiddish expressions, the Star of David, and Hasidic Jews walking around New York, these characters could have been written as Italian, with no difference.<br/><br/>This movie is an 8 in pure quality, and I respect its ""it is what it is"" depiction of its protagonists, but I found De Niro's character so morally despicable that I had some trouble staying engaged. I was also a bit disappointed to learn of several historical inaccuracies in this film, according to its goofs page on IMDb."
"parableofthebeast","2","9","22","6 September 2001"," almost good, but not really: too long, too dark, horrible score
","There are some excellent scenes in this movie, chilling, moving, brilliant. But it is far too long and the jusxtaposition of events in random chronolobical order doesn't work. The strongest scenes are invariably followed by long, dull, slow moving, darkly lit, introverted characterization, as De Nero tries to pull off something. What that something is remains unclear. The movie fails at penetrating the surface of its intent - see movie description. We really don't come to understand much except that De Nero can smile after 30 years of being lost and betrayed. His final smile borders on ludicrous. The lighting and perhaps the worst musical score imagineable make a shambles of the movie's pace and continuity. It's too long, too poorly edited, and fails to develop the more than a few remarkable scenes and bring us something, anything, beyond random snap shots or old hand held 8mm home movies about some time and some place in the early part of the 20th century. The characters and their stories loose their vitality and are finally unrecognizable."

","This film is an amazing cinematic experience. Sergio Leones final film is in my opinion, also his best. The story is so deep, and so rich. The themes, love, friendship, betrayal, morality, memory, life, etc... are so poignant and universal that it is hard not to relate to the characters and situations in this film at least in some way. All the performances are exceptional, James Woods being the highlight in my opinion. I have watched this film three times now, and I plan on re-visiting it even more in the future, as I now own the DVD. To describe this film it is hard to know where to start, as the story is told almost completely out of chronological order; it is a film which literally requires you to watch it more than once. Basically, it is a film about the life of a man, played by Robert De Niro, from his boyhood, right through to his old age, and about the friends and enemies he makes, and all the major issues he encounters. But more specifically, it is about his relationship with one main friend, the adult part of whom is played by James Woods. I can't think what else to say but to recommend this powerful tale to you as strongly as possible, and to wish you several equally enthralling viewings of it!"

This movie might not have the best editing, but it has a great story and Acting.  De Niro is good as always, But James Woods is the one that stands out in probably the best performance of his career.  Like most Mafia movies it deals with the American Dream, but while Adding to the American Dream story there is also a theme of loyalty, friendship, and love.  The love story between Noodles and Debroah is probably one of the best love stories ever on film.  The scene where the youngest member of the gang dies and Noodles' retaliation is beautiful.  I have seen alot of Gang/Mafia movies and probably this is my 2nd favorite (Behind the Godfather.)  I thought the film would move slow but it moved fast un-like Godfather part II in which there was all this extra dialoge that the film didn't need.  There is great direction from Sergio Leone, and a great Musical score by Ennio Morricone.  I recommend all people to see this movie, it is a wonderful story.

This movie is such a failure on every angle, that one has to question what happened in Cannes. I presume people were trying to be nice to Sergio Leone, having become an old Gothic figure of the ""spaghetti westerns"". Morricone's musical score is amazing but does not fit into the mood or era for this film genre, and the theme keeps repeating till the end (Zamfir plays the Pan flute). Most of the children in this film, that play the parts of the characters when young, are not only the ugliest kids on film but the worst possible actors.

","After struggling through this movie, I had a very unique thought about how it came about. It is possible that the director(Sergio Leone), sitting in the year 2000 watching the Godfather trilogy and thinking about the mafia movies of the 90s, took a time machine back to 1984. There, he threw together this movie knowing that the actors would eventually be popular and by default, he would be know as ""discovering them"" for his ""masterpiece""? He would also have gotten the actors at rock bottom prices keeping the movie budget to something he could afford personally and therefore not draw attention to his time travel. This movie is arguably one of the worst, drawn out attempts at ""gangster nation"" that I have ever seen. A word of warning that you would do better spending all of this time(nearly 4 hours) watching the DVD extras on Showgirls and then throwing up."

","I watched the 347 minute version. I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a ""line up"" so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the ""was the whole movie an opium dream ?"" conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about. Vastly over rated, and NOT in the same class as the Godfather. Sergio Leone died 5 years after making this. He was 60 years old. He will be remembered for his 3 spaghetti westerns (in non speaking Italian countries), and for his contribution to the Italian movie industry."
"rmax304823","6","4","8","31 March 2010"," Corman Writ Large?
","I know this must be a good movie -- more than a collection of point-blank gun shots, close ups of greasy faces, and crude sex jokes -- because everyone tells me so. Therefore, there's something wrong with me because so many of its purported virtues escape me. Is it that I am actually a terrified anxiety neurotic trapped in this body of a robust, tattooed skinhead? Hmm. Nope. It can't be that, because for that I'd need the body of a robust, tattooed skinhead. Let me think.<br/><br/>First, this story strikes me as a kind of Kugel gangster story. Sure, the characters all have Jewish names but beneath that we can easily discern the fun-loving, solidary male society of the Italian cowboys on the plains of Spain.<br/><br/>Second, this must be the biggest budget Sergio Leone ever handled, and it must have left him tickled pink. He was already into his 50s and this was his biggest chance. It's like a Roger Corman gangster movie, only with money and ambition.<br/><br/>Roger Corman never seems to have thought behind the next scene, whereas the length, multi-generational script, and star power of the cast has enable Leone to give this the gloss of nostalgia. Corman wouldn't have bothered. And to a great extent it works too. There is the score of Ennio Morricone to remind us, lest we forget. Not only do we hear Zamphir or somebody on the Peruvian nose flute or shakuhachi or whatever it is, the score even borrows from the Beatles' ""Yesterday."" So, although it has all the earmarks of Leone -- the first 25 minutes have about a dozen words of dialog and they all come in a rush in the last ten -- I guess it has some virtues after all. I'm a sucker for nostalgia and male bonding. I'm a sucker too for the thirteen-year-old Jennifer Connolly waltzing around to ""Amapola"" in a mist of magical dust like something out of a fairy tale, criminal, prompting every man to dream of San Quentin. She's serene. She seems secure in her own Alice-in-Wonderland beauty, as if in the thrall of a belief that it will last.<br/><br/>It's a lengthy movie and at times slow. The director uses part of that allotment to give us a couple of grown-up scenes. In one, a doomed man holds a casually ominous conversation with his betrayer standing on the opposite sidewalk. A garbage truck grinds along the street between. When it passes the victim is gone.<br/><br/>In another, Robert DeNiro learns that the virginal love of his life is about to leave for a career in Hollywood. He rapes her repeatedly in the back seat of a limousine while she kicks and screams until the chauffeur, whom we've never met, brings the car to a screeching halt in the middle of nowhere and opens the back door. DeNiro stumbles out, arranging his clothes, offers the driver a handful of bills and says, ""Take her home."" Wordlessly, the driver goes back to the car, leaving the money in DeNiro's outstretched hand. The scene undoes a little of the damage done by Tuesday Weld and the array of penises. <br/><br/>Yes, thinking it over, I'll forgive the adolescent gag of the masked criminals demanding that the sluttish Tuesday Weld identify her rapist by his penis alone. Weld is the whore to Connolly/McGovern's Madonna. This movie has two kinds of women -- whores and Madonnas. The latter you take home to Mamma. The first you adopt as a mistress. You see what I mean? It's a little hard to squeeze past these calcified clichÃ©s.<br/><br/>But, okay. Leone has done one thing he deserves credit for. He tries, for the first time in his career that I'm aware of, to illustrate on the screen a genuine sense of loss, loss of friends and of love, of both men and women, not just through the script but Morricone's elegiac score and the judicious use of New York locations, and he comes close enough to get a pass."
"sundancekid26","9","4","8","8 November 2006"," A really gem of a film.
","Once Upon a Time in America was originally released in 1984.It starred Robert Deniro, James Woods, Joe Pesci and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Sergio Leone, the film featured an alumnus of Leone's crew who had worked on all of his films. This included Enno Morricone's musicality as well as Carlo Simi's production design and Tonino Delli Kelli's masterful and creative cinematography. Once Upon a Time in America is a complex tale about New York City Pals who grow into gangsters and live their friendship throughout prohibition. Near the end of prohibition, a bank heist gone wrong becomes the focal point of the story. A subsequent reunion of the surviving friends 30 years later primarily involves Noodles (Deniro) revisiting his past. The movie itself is almost four hours long and its 1.85:1 ratio shows off Leone's unique visual style. For instance, at one point we may see a crane drop down from the top of the frame like some sort of giraffe to catch Noodles entering an old pub or we may watch in awe as the Brooklyn Bridge is reconstructed right before our eyes. These are just two amongst many commodities that really do reinstate this as Leone's pinnacle masterpiece. It would also be his final film. Deniro delivers the goods as usual. His method style of acting that we are so used to seems to be replaced by a more complacent and tranquil demeanor in this film. James Woods's character has a hint of ambiguity; at the end of the film I both admired and hated his character. Joe Pesci has a minimalistic role as a small-time hustler. Another mentionable fact of OUATIA would be the quality child acting portrayed throughout the film. A young Jennifer Connelly nails her role as Noodles lost childhood sweetheart in the early scenes of the picture. Throughout OUATIA we are treated to Morricone's breathtaking compositions. Perhaps it is the orchestrated version of The Beatles' 'Yesterday', or any other of his musical motifs. Not since, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' has Morricone been so luminous. Overall this film is pure cinematic art. From time to time there isn't a word said but the music and pictures on screen carry the story forward. OUATIA was released in three different edited versions - apparently the full version created a quandary for Warner Brother's executives and it was butchered down two hours. This broke Leone's heart and he would never live to see the full version be released many years later on DVD. I would recommend Once Upon a Time in America to anyone who has a deep passion for movies. It contains gratuitous use of much Leoneism and will be talked about for many decades to come. However, it does take an average of two viewings before the plot begins to make complete sense, but when it does prepare to be engulfed in Leone's most enduring creation since the sixties. A gem of a film indeed!<br/><br/>10 out 10!"

","If Noodles had killed Max, I would take it as an epic; but he didn't, so I took it as a life-story which happened tens of years ago.<br/><br/>I saw the movie on last Saturday. If I have seen this movie 5 years ago, I will be very excited. But now not. People seeing too many movie are readily to be sick of movies which are designed deliberately. Just not so easy to be excited.<br/><br/>If it has a dramatic ending, I guess, I will throw the movie into garbage can, and never mention it again. But it ends quietly, just as I wished. Whatever ever happened, let it go when it is gone. That is life, not just a story,<br/><br/>So the ending changed my review of the movie. It touched me. It hit the sad half of my heart.<br/><br/>I love the acting of Robert De Niro in this movie. I have never realized more that he's such a great actor. Also love the pace of the movie. You may hate it, but it is great. It is that kind of pace that makes you feel sad, but not heartbroken.<br/><br/>I read some introduction about this movie before. I knew there was a turnover in the movie. So I was guessing who was the bad guy since the start and made the right choice. 'Max'! Other guys were not very strong here, and Max was ambitious. Ambitious people tend to be bad.<br/><br/>Though not surprised, I still feel sad for Noodles. He was a great guy, but he spent almost ten years in the jail for revenging for his friend, and more than 30 years in regret for protecting his friend. I was happy at last he didn't kill 'Max', otherwise he would lose the last years in his life. I still feel sad when thinking of what he said at the start, 'you can always tell who is the winner, who is the loser.'<br/><br/>BTW, the little girl was acted by Jennifer Connelly, he-he, I recognized her at first sight. Such a lovely little girl."
"supertom-3","10","4","8","18 March 2005"," An epic masterpiece of pure cinematic wizardry!
","Sergio Leone's final master-piece and a swan-song to outdo all swan-songs. Once Upon A Time is a purely magical film, as good as Sergio's other Once Upon A Time film, set in the West. A great debate rages as to which film of Sergio's is his best and that is a question I can't answer having not seen all his pieces. There is no doubt he has done several classic films, with his best Westerns and this gangster epic. What makes Sergio's films so magnificent is their timelessness. Leone's visual eye is astounding and while watching some old films can sometimes feel stale, past it. Leone is a director whose use of the camera was revolutionary, dynamic and iconic. Leone is perhaps one of the most inspirational and mimicked directors ever.<br/><br/>This is a movie of pure cinematic beauty. It is wonderfully shot and the lighting is fantastic. The sense of timing Leone's films have is amazing with each scene and captured performance magnificent. America is a marvellous movie to behold and never drags, even at near 4 hours. The narrative is told in a Tarantino-esque (I don't like referencing Quentin and make him sound like the inventor of a non-linear plot but he is the most famous user) with the action switching from the end of the 60's when it is set, right back to the 20's. The story is a recounting of the life story of Noodles, growing up from a young street hood, to a big time gangster to a kind of tragically lonely old man. The film focuses on his development through a 50 year period of his life about his friendships, loves, and guilt and betrayal. Noodles is magnificently portrayed by Robert De Niro in a role that a lot regard as one of his all time greats. Like every other aspect of the film, De Niro was tragically ignored by the Academy that year, and the film didn't receive one nomination. That's Oscar politics for you though, the film flopped and was as such ignored. The film shows the absolute pinnacle of perfection in acting (on several fronts, but particularly De Niro and James Woods), directing, cinematography, writing and perhaps most memorably the career best score of Ennio Morricone, Leone's long time collaborator.<br/><br/>So the story is great as are the technical and artistic merits of the film, but what of the supporting cast? Well as I said De Niro is outstanding, with James Wood's coming a very close second. Other noteworthy performances arrive from Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, Joe Pesci, Burt Young and many more. What works so brilliantly in this piece is the amount of memorable side characters portrayed by ""name"" actors. Brief cameos delivered with memorable class, for example Joe Pesci and Treat Williams who come and go quickly leaving an indelible mark in the film. Special note also goes to the young cast playing the main roles in the early years sections. They are faultless and excellent. Younger actors can often lack polish and maturity in their performances. There aren't a whole load of Dakota Fannings and Haley Joel Osments rolling off a production line. Finding a young actor who can move up from giving an acceptable performance to having the ability to captivate is quite rare, and so for Leone to have found a lot of brilliant young actors who look remarkably like their adult actors playing the older versions of the characters is truly amazing. While most of these young actors didn't go on to bigger and greater fame, one did: Jennifer Connelly. She plays the young Deborah before Elizabeth McGovern (who is the spitting image of the young Connelly). Jennifer Connelly has of course developed into an Oscar winning and excellent actress and in her screen debut here she shows those early signs of excellence at a very youthful 12 yrs of age. Her performance is excellent, and in an integral and key scene that many actors of her age, and indeed older would have buckled under, she is superb. The scene has her giving a recital to the young Noodles (Who is in love with her). The performance is given with such maturity and with such a sense of timing and delivery that it is truly amazing. It was one of the best performances from a young star to ever grace the big screen in my opinion. She was a superb young actress, who developed into a superb actress and her performance here shows genuine talent and of course kudos to Leone for harnessing that ability and extracting it correctly.<br/><br/>As I said Morricone's score is marvellous and of the best scores ever. The music of the film has also appeared in the Kill Bill movies as well. Morricone a composer of such a prolific CV manages to deliver a career best score at a stage in his career when he had been around for years. However he found and continues to find, the inspiration not to let his work become stagnant like some composers. Overall this is a film that is regarded as a classic, mentioned in the same breath as the Godfather films and Goodfellas. It is epic, beautiful and in all counts, masterful. *****"

","OK, there has been a lot said about this one. Either people seem to love it or they hate it. Let me just say this: this is a good film, nothing more nothing less. Is it too long? Yes. I read somewhere that Leone was going to release it in two 3-hour blocks, maybe it would have been better that way, as two movies. The problem with this film is that you NOTICE that it is long. In the Godfather films, the three-plus hours seem to fly by because it constantly keeps your interest. That isn't the case here, I watched the whole thing in one sitting the first time I saw it and I could never do it again. It isn't that the acting is bad (it's quite good), it's just that the story isn't anywhere near as interesting or gripping. It might have been better off as a miniseries or something just because it is not easy to sit through the whole thing without getting bored. 6 stars out of 10."

","One of the great moving pictures of our time.  Actually, I believe it's too short at 226 minutes.  Six-to-eight hours would have allowed for the necessary character development, and would have elevated the work to a new level.  The director's cut, however, is phenomenal.  Leone's re-creation of 1920s Lower East Side street life is breathtaking; the child actors are captivating (some feel they outshone Woods and DeNiro); the score will haunt you long after the closing credits.  No need to feel angry at Warner Bros. for the marketing disaster that clouded this film's original release (they sliced it to 88 minutes -- Danger, Will Robinson!  steer clear of this version -- secure a copy of the 226-minute director's cut at all costs!) -- we have the director's cut and we are happy. The fact that Once Upon a Time in America did not score big at the box office has no bearing on the quality of what you'll find on the video tapes.  Trust me."

","If you watched the long version of this movie then you probably know that it comes in two parts(two dvds), but the intermission is cut badly and is put on the beginning of the second disc. Now you can accept that bad cutting by assuming that the DVD is uncompressed and therefore the 229 minute movie cannot fit which would explain the high video quality because of it not being compressed.<br/><br/>This is a small little break down of some lack of continuity in this film that i saw as a first time viewer of this movie. This is for the reader who have already scene it. This is not for people who have not scene this movie yet.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie a five simply because the first half(the first disc) I loved it! Which gives the first half four out of five stars.<br/><br/>Next ""disc two"" stupid things start happening which are simply forgotten and ambiguous which really ruined the movie and cut some stars form my rating 1# For starters the plot revolves around the idea that Carrol tells Deniro that James Woods was killed,but some how SHE NEVER NOTICED THE SENATOR LOOKED JUST LIKE HIM?A guy that had to be on TV all the time when he was running for senator simply she never noticed after all these years? 2# And we also get a scene where Joe Pesci goes to the hospital that the unionist Jimmy Conway is at. Joe goes inside the hospital but it never once explained what he even did there in fact you never see the character(Joe Pesci) again after this confusing scene. At first I thought he went to kill Jimmy Conway but I remembered that that guy is on TV when Deniro is old so there is no explanation what happened, it was simply forgotten. 3# James Woods takes the money out of locker that all of them have been saving right? now i assume he could have taken the key from Fat Moe. Now after taking the money out of the locker he leaves an EMPTY CASE instead of taking the case out of the locker. so he must have taken the money out so he could put money into a case he brought with him instead of using the one that was in the locker?(I know this scene is not shown but this is the only way a empty case could be left there is for a guy empty it out into another case instead of the using case that was there which is pretty stupid) Also I am assuming he opened the Locker with Fat Moe's key since it would be pretty suspicious to use a pick or break open one of those secure lockers in a public place(right?) so therefore James Woods after stealing the money he had to take the Key he used and bring it back to Fat Moe?,but Fat Moe never noticed it was missing so he could not tell old Deniro in the beginning who had taken the money?. Otherwise there would have been no key for middle aged robert deniro to find in the beginning of the movie if it was not brought back. Yes it seems like quiet a bit but next time you watch this movie you will see that a lot of things that happen in the movie seem very insane. The reason a lot of inconsistencies happen is because for unknown reasons after the first disc all of the things in the second disc do not piece together all the things in the first disc such as how was a money taken out of the locker. I think something insane like Woods leaving a crowbar and the locker was smashed open would at least explain the theft even if Woods or someone he hired would have made a scene breaking in.<br/><br/>I give the second disc one out of five stars because it is full of plot holes. Now I have only scene this movie once and I found all of these problems god knows what would happen if I actually watched it a second time(which will probably not happen).

","Before I get to talking about the film overall, I think I should point out to anyone who wants to see ""Once Upon a Time in America"" that it is a very graphic movie. While it's rated R, it's a 'hard R'--and I could almost see it getting an NC-17 if shown today--especially when much more benign films like ""A Dirty Shame"" was recently given the NC-17 distinction. In the film, you'll see closeups of a guy peeing, lots of blood, a kid on toilet, lots of teen sex, a very, very explicit rape, and a closeup of a guy getting shot in the eye. This is not necessarily meant as a criticism (after all, this is a gangster film) but you cannot ignore this when you discuss the film.<br/><br/>This film is a long and VERY deliberately paced epic film about a small group of men in the Jewish mob. I say deliberately paced, as the famed director, Sergio Leone, took a very, very slow approach to the film. To me, this was a good and bad thing. On one hand, it was beautiful-- the camera-work was great and the look of the film was striking. On the other, the film was nearly four hours long YET most of the characters seemed underdeveloped and vague. In many ways, this makes it reminiscent of Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""--but I think ""West"" had a tighter story and more clearly understood characters. The film also was much like this earlier Leone film due to its musical score by Ennio Morricone--though the extensive use of Zamfir's panpipes did set the film apart. For me, I loved and disliked the film at the same time. I sure can respect it--but also was depressed that the film never seemed to completely gel.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film I would like to talk about and that is the rape scene. If you see the film, you'll know exactly which scene I am talking about. Part of me liked it because it tended to say that although DiNero's character seemed nice compared to the other thugs, he STILL was a vile thug down deep. And, making the rape so intensely realistic further clarified that this was NOT a sex act or sexy--it was violent and vile. On the other hand, I sure felt uneasy seeing such a super-violent scene begin portrayed THIS vividly--it could easily shake you up or cause strong reactions in rape victims viewing the film.<br/><br/>By the way, early in the film, Jennifer Connelly says 'Pesach'. This is the Jewish word for 'Passover'.<br/><br/>Also by the way, the makeup was often brilliant. DiNero was aged magnificently by the makeup artists. On the other hand, Elizabeth McGovern's makeup late in the film was pathetic--especially when they slapped on harlequin-like makeup to try to hide the fact that she STILL looked very young. This was sad--especially because in this same scene, DiNero looked 30 years older than her.<br/><br/>Overall, I think there's a lot to like and a bit not to like about the film. I think that it is a bit overrated--and reviewers that say it's just as good or better than ""The Godfather"" should maybe back off a bit on the hyperbole. It is NOT another ""Godfather""....and the only film that MIGHT get away with that claim is ""The Godfather II"". ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is worth seeing but is also very flawed--and a bit confusing, most likely due to the studio hacking out major portions of the film."

"CitizenDevi","Null","5","11","2 January 2019"," No real substance.
","I am not a fan of the gangster genre, so this might add to why I don't exactly think this is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>No matter what genre, this is definitely overly long and doesn't have the big ideas coming across that remotely do the four hour runtime justice. This basically shows why, when you have four hours of material for a film, you cut about half of it.
Unless you really have a lot to say, which this one does not.<br/><br/>It is filmed incredibly well, no doubt about that, and the actors are obviously very great and doing a fine job. But that, to me, does not save much of anything.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty sexist to say the least, and that gets almost unbearable after some time. Yes, it makes sense since the film revolves around people that are anything but good humans, but it is too much. So, the characters are overall nothing but a bunch of pricks, which I can respect and work with, but that can get on your nerves in such a long movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to say the length is probably the main issue. This movie just really wears itself out, in a way I have rarely seen. This could have been more, if it had been cut down.
In the beginning I was impressed and completely on board, but towards the middle and on, not that much.
I wasn't on board by then, but rather bored. Hah, good one. But really, it is just so shallow, and why should something like that be so long?
Not a fan, and it seems highly overrated to me.<br/><br/>What a letdown since it is so loved and has gotten high praise from many great directors and critics.
Not for me, I guess."
"LBytes","8","5","11","18 April 2004"," Good but not great
","I wanted to like this movie. I love some of Sergio Leone's other movies and kind of expected to enjoy this, his last movie, at least as much. For some reason I had never seen more than clips of it.  Leone's movies always have great atmosphere and interesting minor characters. It was a treat to see Jennifer Connelly in her 1st role, and of course it had to be her eyes that got her the part, since Leone tells at least part of his stories with the eyes. This brings up the movie's weakness, the story. I didn't think it was a compelling story, not one to spend 3+ hours on. There weren't many tense moments, unsympathetic main characters that all deserved to die if only for not cracking any good jokes or one liners, and there was none of the sweeping scope that you might expect from a Leone movie. The end was a muddy puddle that didn't make a lot of sense. I'm glad I watched this highly regarded movie, but I doubt that I will again."
"david-good-1","Null","5","11","27 June 2003"," My favourite film of all time.....
","Once Upon A Time In America is my favourite film, bar none of all time.. This picture is, in my opinion, Sergio Leone's finest achievement -his masterpiece. The movie can be viewed in several different ways and on quite a few different levels. For what it's worth these are my thoughts: This is the second loose trilogy that Leone made (The first being the Dollars trilogy - A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly)**The second trilogy being Once Upon a Time in The West( The building of the railroad between the East and West coasts of America ) A Fistful of Dynamite or Duck You Sucker or as it was called in France, Once Upon A Time The Revolution ( the Mexican Revolution ) and finally Once Upon A Time In America ( the Prohibition Era of 1920's and 1930's America.) These were in Leone's opinion the 3 most important periods in the history of the U.S. The film starts and ends in 1933 - although goes forward to 1968 and then back to 1923 - then back and forth throughout the story. Time is the most important character as the story unfolds. It is a fairy tale for adults...if you want the film can be viewed an an opium dream in Noodles' (Robert De Niro's) mind. If the film is looked at in this light, the fact that Elizabeth McGovern's character does not seem to age between 1933 and 1968 makes more sense. Another clue to the film's use of dream imagery is that the number 35 appears on the garbage truck at the end of the film (This is the number of years that Noodles was hiding out and spending the intervening years between 1933 and 1968.) Also when Noodles first returns to New York's Lower East Side and meets Fat Moe (Larry Rapp)-he gives him back the key to Moe's clock. This is then used to wind up the clock (and start time moving again so that the rest of the story can be told) In many ways the film is only told from Noodles viewpoint...we only find out that during his 35 years in hiding he was ""..going to bed early.."" Ennio Morricone's music score is haunting - about 2/3 of the music was composed prior to the film being shot - and, as was common on a lot of Leone's film shoots -the score was played while the actors were making the film - in one early 1923 sequence 'Dominic' is heard and seen whistling one of the main themes from the picture (Another use of dream imagery in this film) The use of flashbacks in many of Leone's films is important to the storyline - this film is almost entirely made up of flashbacks and flash forwards. It rewards repeated viewings and never fails to amaze me with its detail and sweep and scope."

","Best creative structure to a film. One of the best film reflections on the American Dream and the nature of memory and regret.  The opium scene ending, in combination with the hypnotic soundtrack, provides more lasting emotional impact and psychological reflection than any other ending in film save Godfather II, which the film resembles.<br/><br/>Plus James Woods is an acting deity in it.  Now if only Elizabeth McGovern knew how to act.<br/><br/>Watch only the director's cut."

","It's a great mobster movie. It's about the life of this gangster through his childhood and adulthood including him imagining his future through a dream state of inhaling opium. I have a feeling that all the scenes taken place before his opium smoking intro were real and he was hallucinating the scenes when he has grey hair. For one explanation, the phone kept ringing as a sign that something is off. He's slowly heading into the dream world from the opium. The story is told through memory and dreams and how the two begin and end similarly. For every time a scene ends, a similar image begins. It's 3 hours and 49 minutes, but doesn't feel long."

Jennifer Connely was great, playing the young love interest of DeNiro's character, however again, is it really necessary to subject young children of that age to nudity? There were some sex scenes that could have been done without, and although they have been needed for the film, they still could have presented them a little more tactfully.<br/><br/>I found it strange, to be honest, and I don't normally say that about dramas like these.

I felt that this strove to emulate The Godfather and Goodfellas, perhaps even Scarface, yet pales in comparison because it failed to connect me to characters in a way that I cared what happened to them. It bred indifference. I didn't care about anyone. Even the bad guys in a slew of other gangster films, I certainly formed an opinion about; positive or negative. That = viewer connection. The editing between eras was clever yet the editing within each scene often really dragged at times. While occasionally effective, as it can deliver a dramatic charge when needed, I had to keep my eyelids from dropping at other times. It had all the right ingredients just mixed and stirred poorly.

"IMDBcinephile","10","6","15","25 June 2011"," One of the Best Movies Ever (And Better Then ""The Godfather"" Personally""
","It centres on Noodles (Robert Di Niro) who from the streets of Brooklyn in part of a low class structure. Into the midst of the plot (40 minutes in) Noodles meets up with Maximilion as a teenager, and another teenager, James Conway Donnell, and they set up a hierarchal system, where they dispense liquor to people illegally, and they distribute through and out of the water. They are Jewish (Motif of the star on the coffee window shows this); they are already in cases where they are nearly killed in this chain of events, betrayed and in an ominous place. <br/><br/>It shows you Noodles as a young man who comes back to an area where he is under a vulnerable force which makes him resort to travelling to a different area outside his heritage – He comes back into the heritage and this is where the movie shows a great slick and emotional catharsis that Di Niro's character goes through to go back to a place where he has such an bad experience with and in the past and the dwelling of an invitation where he is dubious of the outcome but is lost to the dormancy in replying to it, is attributed to his age, his experience, his time and where he is. He has done things that are wrong, and only the movie chronicles through this - Every object has significance and every artifact is a cavil, for example Maximillian's pocket watch is referenced at the end of the movie, the gun is fundamentally important as well and the times and places from which we need to memorize everything, as to not get too disconcerted with everything; everything is important, both in their minds and on the surface.<br/><br/>There's one bit in particular that I felt was an attempt for us to get into the depths of this otherworld, where James Wood's character Maximilian is used as the pivot to the story as he negotiates with Frankie Monaldi who he says has everything at the palm of his hand – and then they go against the gang with bullets. To try and get references to step up to the plate during the prohibition ending period. Their entrepreneurial business is dissolving, and it's clear that the movie is putting us in this scenario of it. Of course, from the beginning sequence we already get a look at these things and juxtaposition with the events are anachronically ordered... <br/><br/>Let's understand that ""Once Upon in a America"" takes the story of the gangsters rise but begins with his fall, indicating that what will be engaged with us the audience is a story where the 100% reliable narrative is Leone's way of dabbling into our minds and keeping us focused. We want to know how it all works; Blondie in the Dolar Trilogy was invariably a loner bereft of his path and direction. We want to follow him, but we have to also look at where he stands in the world and his status – he is a complete enigma, a puzzling character and kind of a cynical upstart – but we are introduced to him and onward he does become the only way we get into a primary Point of View into the story. It's kind of a similar trait with this movie as we see.<br/><br/>I feel that ""Once Upon a Time in America"" isn't only one of the great crossovers of modern drama, crime and gangster but also a personal statement about the tragedy of it; with such movies at that time that were launched into the mainstream cinema (e.g. Scarface, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter etc.) none had a greater resonance with its structure and flair than this one did for me personally. The general consensus now say that Once Upon a Time in America was revived after its experience in the abattoir, a.k.a the editing studio that butchered up the movie from its premier cut, and that this movie is brutal, hard hitting, an emotional roller-coaster, a poignant journey and a very bittersweet rendering of characters who we are kind of forced to identify with, even though they're bootlegging alcoholic substances. The real striking thing to me was that you had to feel for their rise in profiteering and that you had to really experience the life of it; so that's where it's not so much identifying as it is an exploration. Believe me, if you haven't seen it then I strongly suggest that you try and get it because it is truly one of the great American pictures.<br/><br/>But if I were to nitpick the movie on all of the merits it has, I would probably nitpick Elizabeth McGovern's lukewarm performance; she looked slightly like her younger counterpart (Jennifer Connelly) but her performance is off key and a little bit cold and forgettable.<br/><br/>But apart from that, I think Leone's best movie for me is definitely his last one. He showed that to him cinema was an entertainment novelty and it was also a place for him to express the stories to people that he felt could put him out there. He showed a real passion in this project and I really think that my entertainment was achieved and that my attention was held long enough that I consumed it in 2hrs but it was actually 3hrs 44mins<br/><br/>The music create a foreboding, atmospheric, mawkish, powerful, almost tear-jerking and everything compressed into the emotions of any music, that it's a character, an entity and as it trickle feeds you the feelings of Noodles, Max and everyone, you can't help feeling that the music works accessibly well and almost unbearably; believe me when I say, everything emotional is invoked in that music.<br/><br/>It's up there in my favourite movies and I expect that if it is to ever be shifted down that it would be a rather small shift."
"mentalcritic","10","6","15","20 June 2006"," Leone turned down The Godfather to make this. It was the right decision.
","Don't get me wrong, I love The Godfather and all, but the story does not suit Sergio Leone's unique and distinctly European style of direction. Once Upon A Time In America, on the other hand, was a story practically made for the man. Running at over three and a half hours in the most complete cut known to exist today, its pace might be leisurely and its action incidental, but one other thing it has in common with other Leone films is that it is never slow or boring. As a film about gangsters, it is a fine example. As a film about looking back upon the twists and turns life can take, it is a masterpiece. Although there are moments when its sets or props reveal the time the film was shot in, OUATIA is a timeless exploration of how the bonds between boys stretch, alter, and even break as they become men. The tagline (""As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did."") is surprisingly accurate in summarising the film in spite of the fact that it gives very little away. It was Leone's last film, and a more fitting memorial simply does not exist in the medium.<br/><br/>Ironically, for a film directed by a man who has yet to be equalled for using the 2.35:1 frame in a dynamic fashion, Once Upon A Time In America is the first film Leone shot in the 1.85:1 ratio. I have to confess the cinematography disappointed me somewhat, with this narrower composition clearly allowing fewer opportunities for creative crowd shots. However, there still are fine examples abound of why a film should never be pared down to fit the box-like television that is now thankfully on its way into the kind of nostalgic past that this film spends a lot of its time depicting. Complementing the visuals is a score by Ennio Morricone that, while recalling shades of C'era Una Volta Il West, also provides a more subtle, emotional undercurrent for the visuals. The strings and choir heard when a rather young Jennifer Connelly is visible remind one of the haunting soloist heard when Jill McBain steps out into the train station being built at the end of the aforementioned C'era Una Volta Il West, only it is just as good and far more restrained.<br/><br/>Of course, no film can be what it is without actors, and Once Upon A Time In America has some of the best. The featurette included with the DVD-Video edition features James Woods describing how privileged he feels to have worked with Leone, and his performance in the film indicates he felt that way from the first. De Niro is also impeccable as the adult Noodles, portraying a young man, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man filled with regret using equal levels of skill and artistry. But in a contrast to Leone's other films, the surprise here is in the bit parts, where even the small walk-ons are portrayed with aplomb. Also surprising are the performances of the youngsters who portray our heroes during the earlier stages of the story. The aforementioned Connelly is a delight to watch, but Scott Tiler and Rusty Jacobs excel as youthful versions of De Niro and Woods. Even if you dispute Leone's composition and writing skills, one thing this film erases all doubts about is his ability to choose the right actors for the roles. Or perhaps he just brought out the very best in people.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert has said that editing is the soul of the cinema. He also said it was The Brown Bunny's salvation. In the case of Once Upon A Time In America, excessive editing was its damnation. For some reason too illogical to contemplate, the distributors chose to cut OUATIA from its intended length down to a little more than two hours. As Ebert has also mentioned, this decision, as well as that to arrange the scenes in a chronological fashion, made the film seem far longer than the more complete 229-minute cut, and also deprived it of that critical ability to make sense. If you hear someone telling you that this film is lousy or not well-paced, make sure to ask them which version they have seen. Leone has said that he would have liked the film to be anywhere from 250 to 265 minutes. One can only wonder what this other footage would have revealed, but alas, it is in a raw and possibly unusable state. Leone reportedly wished to finish these scenes for a future release, but we all know what happened next, sadly.<br/><br/>The use of transitions is also nothing short of brilliant. Early in the film, we hear a telephone ringing quite persistently, and the first twenty or so minutes feel quite disjointed. It is a testament to how well the film comes together that not only do all the pieces fit together like a sports car, the sound of a telephone ringing later in the film feels quite ominous. It is also a testament to the makeup artists' skill that Robert De Niro and James Woods appear at the chronological end of the film looking so old and ragged. About the only slip-up is that several of the main characters change eye-colour when they switch from their adult to child incarnations, and vice versa. For a younger cinemaphile seeing the film for the first time, it can be fun simply to see actors we have been taught to revere in the roles they played before they made portraying mobsters seem routine. After seeing OUATIA, I have developed a whole new appreciation for James Woods as an actor.<br/><br/>Out of ten, OUATIA is an unqualfied ten. Were I asked to choose a hundred films to send to an alien planet to demonstrate the creativity of mankind, at least two of them would be Leone's work, and OUATIA is certainly one of them."

The verve of Leone - the transition of his Italian glance on the American myths - created his unique style and rich cinematographic language. <br/><br/>Last week I bought the DVD with the integral version of Leone's ""Once upon a time in America"" (the only movie directed by Leone I had never seen). At the end I was in shock, because I couldn't understand what had happened to one of my favorite directors. Reading the reviews in IMDb, I notice that people confuse their affection for the director's work and look only to the extremely emotional side of the subjects addressed by the film, classifying it, among other things as ""the best movie ever done"". What I can say about this - If OUTIA had been directed by some unknown director, there would be no excuse to forgive so many basic mistakes of adaptation, script and art direction. I feel compelled to comment these factors here –<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>First of all, the fact of being a story of gangsters with a cultural Jewish background is absolutely irrelevant; the way the story is told, the gangsters could be Hispanics, Chinese, Japanese, Russians, because there isn't any cultural idiosyncratic motivation (like the Italian family ties showed in ""The Godfather""). The (absolutely lethargic and confused) character of Robert Deniro begins and finishes at a Chinese house of opium. It would Make much more sense, for example, if he looked for forgetfulness, redemption or origin, obviously, in a synagogue; There is not, in Heaven or Earth, something that justifies that the character Eve is never really introduced to the public, as well her deep relationship with the main character. She appears for a moment in the beginning, close to the end of the film, sudden and without explanation and then she finally disappears; I would use at least, the 3 minutes of the boy staring the candy to develop something about the character of Eve. The image of the unrecognizable cadaver of Max is quite a predictable trick, advancing since the first sequence of the film, his return. For the absolute lack of vigor and rhythm, Leone seems to have opted to show some grotesque, brutal, and nevertheless lukewarm sequences, as trying to affirm that the movie is a dense history, full of meaning. Seemingly, the rapes aren't in the book, what turns them unjustifiable. The long and tedious sequence of the dinner of Deniro and Mcgovern abuses of romanticism (the film massacres the music ""Amapola"" to such point that I will never want to hear that music again) - to finish in a repeated rape. That is one of the most absurd and implausible sequences that I already saw in a film. Quite out of order it's also the endless sequence of Carol inspecting the gangsters' ""weapons"". Under any point of view that sequence increases something to the plot. Ultimately, even keeping all these elements in the story, no one can understand the total lack of development on more relevant topics. There are terrible gaps, the size of continents, inexplicable under any point of view: The absence of any comment concerning the exile of more than 30 years of Deniro, the absence of any development of the Joe Pesci' character, the absence of any comment concerning the rise of Max to a circle of political power, the totally inexplicable union of Max with Deborah . All those factors have, as result, the sensation that you never really understand the characters' motivations. Finally, the art direction is precarious. The errors to portrait the New York Jewish culture are several and the construction is particularly forced in the 1968' ambiance; It's almost embarrassing to see Vietnam graffiti, the music of Beatles and some sixties' cars, unnecessarily spread in a garden, to guarantee to the spectator that ""Yes, you are seeing something that happens in 1968""; The fact you see Mcgover in 1968, without having aged one day since the thirties it's almost surreal; Curiously, the always great music of Ennio Morricone is inappropriate and repetitive in certain sections and surprisingly absent in others. I'm still a big fan of Leone, but I have to admit that the other Leone films are infinitely superior to this one and nothing justifies such large, almost esoteric errors. The explanation is a mystery as great as try to understand the motivations of this film."
"richardclarke13","10","5","12","29 January 2006"," A true masterpiece and an excellent swansong for sergio
","It is very rare that I see a film that me and my parants both have the same opinion on but once upon a time in America is one of those rare times. The story is a true study of betrayal, greed, corruption and violence in all its ugly forms yet its message is simple NEVER BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS AS YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY'LL COME AND GET YOU! The acting is magnificent with the central character noodles played by both Robert De Niro and Scott Tiler (playing him during childhood) being every inch the despicable little swine but yet still creating a character that rather strangely you can warm too. The film features a stellar cast including Eliabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, James woods and tuesday weld in a tale that twists and turns but all the way though makes perfect sense. The people in this film are nasty pieces of work and you can understand why noodles does what he does but you can also understand why people dislike him (largely because he is after them all). There are not one but 2 scenes of rape in the film (1 on Weld and the other McGovern) and these just go to show the utter vileness of the characters (there's also a memorable scene in a garage).<br/><br/>What Sergio Leone managed to do in this his final film is to create a society where the gangster rules (as in deed was very much the case in America during that time period) but he also puts you there in the thick of it with them and makes you hope for the happy ending which you inevitably don't get. A true masterpiece."
"boprieto","4","5","12","30 December 2005"," Bloated, Indulgent, Boring
","Sergio Leone is one of my favorite directors. So, it pains me to say it, but I hate the movie. It has a few memorable scenes (Jennifer Conelly's dance, the murder of the cop), but I can't vouch for this movie as a whole. I hate all of the characters not because they are bad people doing bad things, but because they are so goddamn uninteresting. DeNiro is wasted. Only James Woods is given a chance to shine. The story is rambling and the movie is long; which I wouldn't mind if I had characters I was invested in to follow on the journey, but I don't. Leone is a brilliant visual storyteller and he stages many scenes and sequences with his trademark flair, but the story as a whole is no good. It is bloated and indulgent. Leone focuses much time on mundane aspects of these kids' lives to give us a view of their world and invest ourselves with them and their journey, but really, who wants to watch a kid eat a cupcake for five minutes?<br/><br/>It's a funny thing, because I'm gonna give this movie a four star rating. I hated it yet I'm still giving it four stars because I feel there is something about this movie that is special. It is a master filmmaker doing a bad movie as only a true genius can. If some hack had made the movie I wouldn't have even written this review."

"said-buet10","8","4","9","5 October 2017"," One of the best crime dramas
","This movie is huge. I've seen the massive 229 min cut. And surprisingly it did not feel that boring! The pace was slow but for this story it was absolutely necessary. Otherwise the story wouldn't fell the way it felt. I was tired but also satisfied when this ended.<br/><br/>The acting was fitting. The child actors did an amazing job. In some cases I think even better than their adult counterparts.<br/><br/>One might get confused at the way this movie is shown. The constant switching between present time and the past might seem weird but its a massive buildup for the last segment. Once a person sees it all, he/she would understand why it was shown that way and would for sure appreciate the making.<br/><br/>The long shots and the enthralling musical score that shows and makes sure channels all the emotions into the viewers was expected from Sergio Leone. I always enjoyed his work and this didn't underperformed at all. It's sad that this was his last movie.<br/><br/>This was an epic tale and one of the best crime dramas I've seen so far. Too bad that it was a commercial mess due to a trimmed version being released in theater. I would recommend the whole 229 min version to anyone anytime."
"williampsamuel","9","4","9","9 January 2015"," A Criminall Underrated Mobster Masterpiece
","Sergio Leone is best known for his westerns, and with good reason. His 'dollars' trilogy made Clint Eastwood an international celebrity and pointed the way to newer, grittier westerns. And My name is Nobody was both a fitting tribute to and subtle mockery of the genre. But for his final work he moved into another traditional American medium, the gangster film. It was largely overlooked, both because of its original three hour and forty minute runtime, and a pathetic theatrical version that cut it almost in half. This is a real shame, because Once Upon a Time in America is one of the best gangster movies I've seen, almost on par with the Godfather.<br/><br/>The film follows Noodles (Robert De Niro) a former Jewish mobster who's returned to New York after thirty-five years on the lam. He's been drawn by a cryptic message suggesting that someone knows who he is, and what he's done. While he seeks answers and catches up with old friends in the present, flashbacks take us back to the twenties, when Noodles, his buddy Max, and a couple of friends not even out of grammar school banded together to make some money, stick it to the man, and earn a name for themselves in the underworld. The flashbacks then proceed to the thirties, as the boys established themselves as some of the bigger movers and shakers in the Lower East Side, even as Max and Noodles drifted apart, leading to the tragedy that would leave one of them dead, and another on the run.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is by turns comic, nostalgic, and poignant. It's about how a bunch of kids with lousy home lives and no real idea what they were doing rose to the top through luck, friendship, and determination. It's about a face of New York that was gone long before this movie was made, for better and for worse. It's about the price of success and how money comes between friends. And it's about guilt and regrets for past misdeeds, and trying to make amends.<br/><br/>For someone born and raised in Italy, Leone has done a superb job of recreating prohibition era Manhattan. The hustle and bustle of peddlers' carts and throngs of people, the children scurrying across rooftops and down alleys, and the cops blowing their whistles and waving their batons are all captured so perfectly that it's as if the director were working from his own memories. And even though Noodles and his friends are up to their ears in shady dealings, and even though the streets are dirty and the neighborhood cop in on the take, it somehow seems simpler, almost wholesome as the boys plot, make promises, and chase girls. Part of me wishes I could have been there.<br/><br/>But of course there's nothing wholesome about what they're doing, or what it's doing to them. Within a few years these boys have grown up to become hardened killers. There are murders, beatings, two rapes, and a scene where they nearly set a man on fire before finding out that their organization has switched sides and now he's their friend. Plus there's a death so gruesome it can only be hinted at. And most of this is before the betrayals start and everything comes crashing down.<br/><br/>In the present, most of the scenes have a melancholy air, as Noodles walks through a changed city, one that has just enough resemblance to the one he knew to bring back painful memories of choices he made, and opportunities he lost. And when the answers to his questions arrive, it only brings more heartache as we discover that the lies and betrayals ran deeper and in more directions than he knew.<br/><br/>The script is phenomenal, the production values sterling, and the acting truly exceptional. De Niro does some of the best work of his long career, bringing Noodles to life both as a young, ruthless gangster, and a tired, regretful old man. The make-up artists also deserve great accolades for their abilities to age the main characters more than thirty years. In the later scenes, De Niro looks almost exactly as he does today. And I would be remiss if I didn't praise the work of the child actors, particularly Jennifer Connelly as Deborah, Noodles's childhood sweetheart.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is a film that should be seen by any fan of the genre, or the director. It's grand, complex, and deals with the full range of human desires and emotions. It's a real shame that it isn't more widely known."
"the-fearless-america","10","4","9","3 January 2015"," Masterpiece of art ! Standing applause to Leone !
","Sergio Leone was a director that combined (mostly) drama and crime inside his movies. He also specialized in slow-paced with fascinating melodramatic sounds. Absolutely, for me he considered as 5 best director of all time. This was his second masterpiece ""Once Upon A Time In America"" with his ""Once Upon A Time In The West"".<br/><br/>This movie starts with some gangster-action typical. Then it slowly turns into an excellent drama. The storyline changes time by time, from the main character's young life, middle-aged, and old days. That was the strength of this movie. It makes the viewers always guessing what happen in the future that related to the past times, but its not that easy. This movie more complex than it seems.<br/><br/>A very creative plot by Leone. Timeless classic drama-crime with gangster aroma. Supported by high-touching sounds as it's strength. Strong friendship story which can't broke with a great drama.<br/><br/>For people that love arts, especially beautiful movie arts. You can watch this and feel it's sensation and the beauty inside it. Definitely inside my top 15 movies of all time. 10/10."

"apzijlstra","7","4","9","1 February 2012"," So good and yet so bad
","The 229 minute version of Once Upon a Time in America is too long because there is a repetitiveness in the presentation of the themes. Having said that, it is also true that the attention to detail and the lavish sets make the nearly four our of watching never a chore. Then there is also Robert De Niro who lifts the movie above an ordinary gangster flick. Arguably, one of the best things about the movie is the music, but since God Bless America was used so movingly in the ending of The Deer Hunter (also with De Niro), it was in poor taste to use it as the final song six years later again so stridently. The actors playing the gangsters as boys and those playing the gangsters as adults are all fine. With all that, what a pity that the movie finally fails. It does so in the sense that the ending is a farce, something that sits poorly with an epic movie, and it does so in the sense that it makes the mistake of practicing alchemy, of distilling friendship and love and sensitivity from a group of extraordinary vicious men, murderers whose sense of humor is expressed in swapping babies in a nursery. The viewer is asked to believe that these cockroaches are capable of great sensitivity. Deborah calls one of them a cockroach early on and she should have taken herself more seriously for she could have known she was right. The director wanted it both ways, violence and love undiluted from the same source. Kiss kiss, bang bang: it can be done, but not like this."
"mak_600","10","4","9","12 January 2010"," a masterpiece of modern cinema and perhaps the most beautiful film ever...
","I first saw this film back in 1985 as an 18 year old and was simply blown away by it despite parts of it leaving me in the dark as to what the hell was going on! Since then i've watched it many times and over those repeated viewings i've come to understand more and more what the film is about and what the characters and story represent. But that is my take on it and as such, one of the beautiful things about this film is that people, i feel, will take what they want from it depending on how much time and attention they want to put into it. In simple terms this is not a film you can watch just the once - if you do you will feel confused and probably let down. Persevere, watch it again though and most likely you will start to ""get it""...<br/><br/>Because of this i think OUATIA could truly be a unique cinematic experience, something you really have to delve into and immerse yourself in otherwise you will not come to recognise and spot the nuances or the messages contained within. It's not so much a gangster flick in the obvious sense, more a story told of love lost and lives wasted, friendships forged and ultimately betrayed. Much has already been said about the cinematography, the score, the sets and the acting of which all are truly first class even allowing perhaps for my slight reservations on McGovern. The child actors for me are every bit as good as the seasoned pros and Jennifer Connelly is simply wonderful.<br/><br/>The film has flaws absolutely, but what again makes this a unique experience is that those flaws (for me anyway) just add to the mystique of the film rather than take anything away. It's not mean't to be a historically correct story-telling anyway and the reviewer elsewhere who bemoaned the bridge not being the Brooklyn bridge or some such is so missing the point, as do the few who from their words you can tell have just not taken the time to really watch and involve themselves. Maybe some people will just never get it anyway...!<br/><br/>To sum up this is a film for those who are prepared to give more of their time, thought and effort to it than just your normal 120 minute Hollywood banality ride demands. If you truly love cinema and have the patience to give it the attention it deserves you will i'm sure be richly rewarded. In the 25 years since first seeing this masterpiece i've yet to be as affected by any other film in quite the same way..."
"kurciasbezdalas","10","4","9","23 October 2008"," One of the greatest stories ever told
","This movie is unbelievable. It's much more interesting and effective than The Godfather. This movie is about the life of one gangster and it's told so perfectly that I feel like I experienced it myself. It's a crime movie but what's different about it is that we get to know everything about main character, like who was his first love, how did he met his friends, what was his first experiences with girls and many other details about his life so it seems like Noodles is a real person which you know all your life. It lasts only 4h but it seems like a life time and not because it's boring but because there is so many twists that it's hard to believe that all this could fit in 4h movie. There is some black humor and violence but that of course is not the most important thing in this film but still makes it even better."
"galileo3","10","4","9","11 December 2007"," Leone's epic, breathtaking, tragic masterpiece - one of the greatest films ever made
","Once Upon A Time In America (1984)<br/><br/>Top 2 - 1984 <br/><br/>Top 10 - 1980s <br/><br/>Top 100 - All Time<br/><br/>Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America' is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. A beautifully crafted film following the lives of a gang of friends who grew up together in the Jewish Ghetto of Lower East Side in 1920s New York and gradually become involved in organised crime.<br/><br/>The film, in its full glorious cut of 220 minutes is a vast and intense experience; graphic in nature but powerful and heartbreaking in its deep and profound message. I have not seen the 139 minute cut, which is the slaughtered American version, but I cannot imagine 80 or so minutes of this cinematic masterwork being removed or altered.<br/><br/>1921. 1933. 1968 - Those are the main dates that the film flashes back and forth from.<br/><br/>1921 - The year that the friends meet and start their petty illegalities. It is also the year in which 'Noodles' goes to prison for killing a gangster who shot his friend and a policeman who was violently beating him.<br/><br/>1933 - 'Noodles' ends his 12 year sentence and is warmly greeted by his old friends, who have established a solid business in the underworld, mainly with the import and sale of alcohol, which was illegal at the time of the Prohibition. It is also the year where three of the friends die.<br/><br/>1968 - 'Noodles' comes back from hiding after 35 years in Buffalo he returns to New York to find out what happened and what is going on, until he realises a shocking truth that changes the whole direction of the film...<br/><br/>Director Sergio Leone's one main weakness was the ability to wrap up a picture of average length. The film is an astonishing 3 hours and 40 minutes, but for once, Leone's persistence in making long films pays off. Each second of the film is important. This is an enormous achievement.<br/><br/>FRIENDSHIP. LOVE. HONESTY, TRUST. BETRAYAL. DEATH The film seems to follow a route similar to the one above; from the early years to the late ones, nothing seems to end on a positive note. Ironically 'Once Upon A Time' does not end with 'They All Lived Happily Ever After'. We do not seek this. This is no little film that aims to entertain, sadden and then make the audience leave satisfied at the end. This film is a grand tragedy, a powerful journey, a harrowing study of humanity.<br/><br/>The film starts and ends in an Opium Den of a Chinese Theatre, where 'Noodles' is in hiding from the Mafia. There is a theory that David 'Noodles' Aaronson is just revisiting his past and visualising his future as he spirals into a dream like state from the opium. I myself doubt that this is the truth, since such discards all the elements of the film, its psychology, relationships and destructive characters.<br/><br/>This is definitely a cinematic treasure an important film that is powerful and personal, tragic and beautiful - it is no surprise that Sergio Leone is so highly respected among many critics and filmmakers. In my opinion his best film and one of the top 100 films of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Spondonman","9","4","9","16 June 2007"," A fable for adults
","This is an unforgettable roller-coaster ride, a mammoth 217 minutes (UK TV runtime) of love, hate, friendship and memories (Leone's words). And routine bestiality. Leone brought to the American gangster movie all he had given to the American Western movie in the preceding two decades, leaving this stuck out somewhere between The Good Bad And The Ugly and The Godfathers. I've only ever seen the full European cut (still well edited down from Leone's original), I assume the original cut US cut is the one that draws the bad reviews.<br/><br/>Disjointed story set in 1968, 1923 and 1933 has handsome chap Noodles played by DeNiro being called back from self-imposed exile to his old stomping ground by someone after decades of hiding, he wants to find out by who and why. Although he turns out to have been a vicious murdering rapist gangster when young we have to root for him as he's really the best of a bad lot. We're treated to lengthy arty flashbacks and many heavy poignant moments, softly tender scenes giving way to scenes of brutal sadism  all in the name of so-called Realism. This, remember, is via persistence of vision viewed on a two-dimensional screen, with a fictional plot contrived to fit logically into a timeslot complemented by a stirring orchestral soundtrack you'd never get in Real Life. Leone himself said he never tried to make realist films, so why pile on the violence and smut? And to crown it all, within is a woman who apparently ""age cannot wither"". Morricone excelled himself with his score for this  like Cinema Paradiso, the film could simply not stand on its own without it, the repetitive and relentlessly moving and melancholic main themes, especially Deborah's Theme can leave you in tears and yet sometimes you don't know why. And they ""forgot"" to enter it into the Oscars nominations  Doh! Also the lush orchestral version of Amapola in the dinner for 2 sequence can give you a lump in your throat, though make the most of it because the dreamlike spell is ruthlessly broken in the back of the car come the dawn. DeNiro was perfect for the role of Noodles, his highly visible semi-intelligent thought processes struggling along but almost creating a few longueurs at times. The climax seemed a bit fast with all that had gone before  you might even call it a rubbish ending (hem)  but it still fitted in well. Even the static 6 minute end credits with Morricone's music is worth watching!<br/><br/>A helluva lot happens in these 4 hours, good and bad and happy and sad  overall brooding melancholia spurred by memories of mistakes made. I love it with all its faults, and even though at times it makes me wince it's definitely a masterpiece."
"grezza_2004","10","4","9","3 March 2007"," Up there with the best
","Sergio Leone's last film was also his best, with this epic life story of two best friends who work together as gangsters. Whether it is a real life story, or simply Noodles' drug-induced dreams is never resolved, but this and the film's non-chronological order add to its effectiveness. The usual brilliant camera-work of Leone's films, and the wonderful musical score by Ennio Morricone are a wonderful accompaniment to the strong violence and character's emotions. The story takes you through all the emotions, but ultimately leaves you feeling happy that you have viewed such a masterpiece. The acting of not just De Niro and James Woods, but all the characters, young and old, is superb and at no point does the storyline become overlong or boring. At 220 minutes, it takes some watching, but believe me it is well worth it. This is one of the best ever gangster films, a true masterpiece from one of the world's greatest directors, and was a perfect sign off for Leone."

","Easily one of the best movies ever made. The acting of the impressive cast is every bit as good as one would expect and the script is excellent. The cinematic quality is pure artistry. The movie has just the perfect look: the muted colors, the use of both close-ups and panoramic shots - very Sergio Leone. The score lends an ethereal quality to it that is essential to the mood. I thought the ""Yesterday"" injection when Noodles returns as an old man to Fat Moe's was a bit over the top - but the boys whistling the score as they were waiting to roll the drunk was pure genius. Avoid the butchered 2 1/2 hour version at all costs, buy the director's cut and watch it several times - you'll see new things each time. I did think the garbage truck was a bit bizarre and unnecessary, but that's another small issue with what is truly a masterpiece."

","Once Upon A Time is a great epic about the life of a Jewish gangster. It is a story about friendship and betrayal.<br/><br/>The first time I watched this movie, I was so confused and frustrated, disturbing opening scenes, complex and detailed plot and a shocking end.<br/><br/>For a second view, I got the whole picture, the opening and ending scenes began to make sense, the chronological order of the story was comprehended.<br/><br/>I needed a third view to begin feeling the music of this film, and then the magic of ""Once Upon A Time In America"" caught me. I was fascinated by that wonderful soundtrack, the long scenes, regarded by some as boring, became more meaningful now, thanks to a great background music, which set a unique, intense and charged atmosphere, and that's what is so special about this film. It would have never been a masterpiece without Ennio Morricone's work.<br/><br/>Once the story is understood, you feel more the intensity of it and some of the scenes become more emotionally involving. You will be attached to the atmosphere of the film to an extent that whenever you decide to watch a scene you'll continue to the end of the movie. I entered a whole new world for a week, the world of the American dream.<br/><br/>OUATIA is a great cinematic achievement to be compared along with the great ones, one of the movies that resemble to myths, they grow in debate from generation to another, but the important thing is that you give the movie the time it deserves, because if you're not emotionally involved and focused on it you will be lost, frustrated and you'll probably hate it. But, if you concentrate from the beginning till the end and give the experience the adequate state of mind, you'll be amazed by what you'll get through.<br/><br/>10/10.

","OUATIA is a fantastic character study of four friends during Prohibition. This film is excellent because the story itself is excellent. You care about the characters and you care about what happens to them. The music is perfect for this film. (*SPOILER WARNING*- If you haven't seen the movie yet, stop reading now.) The way Sergio Leone constructs the film with the flashbacks is flat-out brilliant. Robert De Niro is the perfect actor to portray Noodles because he can play him young, a gangster who wants power, and an old man, broken by the knowledge that his phone call to the police to saves his friends from a certain death inadvertently led to a shoot out with the police that caused their deaths anyway. The way De Niro portrays the broken Noodles who is broke in finances and spirit 35 yrs. after his friends' death is what makes his performance wonderful to watch. James Woods is another great actor who plays Noddles closest friend, Max. These two characters and actors make up the heart of the film. The final revelation of the film ties up all the loose ends and completes one of the most brilliant movie puzzles I have ever seen. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves gangster films, stories about friendships, or a good mystery. I also recommend only watching the 4-hr. cut. I haven't seen the 2-1/2 hr. cut, but I heard it destroys the film."

Some of the sets are like time capsules. However, unfortunately for the this viewer the movie comes off as often incoherent and self-indulgent.  Some reviewers seem to like Morricone's soundtrack.

","Once upon a time in america, is simply the greatest film ever directed and conceived.  The camera angels and shots and blah blah.  Are simply brillant. The whole film comes together throught different time periods and locations. Your never really sure what is going on towards the end.  The film doesnt simply tell you whats happening, you must figure it out yourself. The acting is brillant, perhaps one of Robert Deniro's best roles.  The long version is much better than the edited version......."
"edh83","Null","4","9","27 September 2002"," ESSENTIAL CINEMA
","I will be the first to admit (and please do not beat me to a pulp) that I found Leone's 'Dollars Trilogy' tiresome alongside 'Once Upon A Time In The West'. Both were stylistically ingenious, but I found them to be overtly prosaic. I can still appreciate why they are loved though.<br/><br/>So when Once Upon A Time In America came on TV, I approached with caution having been dissappointed with the above films. I recorded it and watched it the following morning. I was absolutely blown away, all paled in significance when put alongside this unfathomably superlative masterpiece of cinematic art.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AFOOT...) Sitting here writing this Im trying to think why it is so astounding. Firstly, its Robert DeNiro. He effortlessly assumes the role of Noodles, underplaying him to full effect, every statement is profound and poetic because of its honesty: ""You can tell who the winners are at the starting gate; you can tell the winners and you can tell the losers."" Similarly listen to the speech he gives to Deborah on the beach after their romantic meal, he opens his heart to her and is shattered by her rejection. Look at the close ups on his face and his tearful eyes, a man consumed with an inward passion. Look at his reunion with 'Senator Bailey' at the end, you are almost convinced he had never met him. Where was DeNiro's Oscar?<br/><br/>Secondly, the score to the film is utterly breathtaking. Especially the theme that links Noodles and Deborah, Morriconne's signiture sweeping orchestral score harmonised by a solo female voice. Romantic and devastatingly beautiful. Listen out for the pan pipe score when the young members of the gang are running away (in slow motion) from Bugsy who is armed with a gun.The score is sublimly atmospheric, even the strange but insightful use of Lennon and McCartney's 'Yesterday'. Where was Morriconne's Oscar?<br/><br/>Thirdly...EVERYTHING else; Directing, Cinematography, Set Design, Supporting Roles, Screenplay etc etc WHERE WERE THE OSCARS?  The Acadamey has disgraced itself, but we do not need their approval to rate this as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishements ever put onto celluloid.<br/><br/>You are no lover of film if you do not like this. Four hours of unimaginable bliss. Miss it and by heaven you'll miss out. This is ESSENTIAL cinema."
"pimpchimp3","10","4","9","21 July 2002"," The best Org. Crime movie i have ever seen
","This movie should easily be #1 on the 250 list, especially if Godfather is there now.  This movie has all that the Godfather has, and in my opinion more.  Sergio Leone created an instant classic.  It's a shame too many people would rather be disappointed with the version that is missing over an hour of important content than be amazed by the 4 hour version that i couldnt take my eyes off."
"Bill-309","10","4","9","1 February 1999"," Best of the Best?
","This ranks easily as the best film ever - 10 of 10; an all-star cast led by Woods and DeNiro with strong support from Burt Young and Tuesday Weld. Don't EVER see the U.S. original version- it was cut to pieces - the Director's Cut is perfect.<br/><br/>Some effort is involved to follow the story line, but becomes clear as the movie progresses.  The haunting theme song will stay with you a long time and the character development is excellent.<br/><br/>If you like action and drama, don't miss this one!!!!"
"LeonLouisRicci","9","3","6","5 August 2013"," Delightfully Detailed
","Do not bother to watch the shorter version. Cut and mangled for American Theaters by some 90 Minutes, it is still out there and should be avoided. The intended 227 Minute Movie is readily available on Disc and that is the Director's intent. Anything else is blasphemous.<br/><br/>That being said, it is the almost Four Hour Film that will have some, less patient, viewers wriggling in their seats and demanding a more friendly version. It is a lengthy, at times lethargic, sprawl that can be an attractive display of Period and Time hopping.<br/><br/>This was not a common Film Style at the time, much more so now, and it feels like a Dream sometimes, and there are some Nightmarish Scenes to be sure. With a Movie so long and Artistically involved there is a lot to take in. Most of it is richly rewarding, but it can be overly complex. It is a Film that takes investment and waiting for the payoff may be tiresome, but ultimately satisfying.<br/><br/>For those willing to become involved for the long haul it can be a Baroque, Powerful Experience. The haunting Score and the beautiful, soft, hazy visuals combined with some clever Cinema tricks and excruciating sense of detail, to make this a fine Film for those with an eye for demanding and delightful, disturbing and dense, fictionalized and fancied, Gangster Americana."
"thegreatshonen","9","3","6","14 November 2012"," Sergio Leone's Masterpice
","OK this film was a workout to sit through but boy was it worth it. Sergio Leone's final movie, Once Upon a Time in Amereica, is an epic and arguably his best film. After seeing this, I recognize the great tragedy of the film's editing in its original theatrical run in 1984. Years later we've finally learned what this film is. A dying will of one of the most influential directors of all time.<br/><br/>The film is about the lives of four Jewish gangsters as they grew up in Prohibition era and the haunting consequences of one of their decisions. its the story of a lifetime of childhood friends, from boys growing up on the streets in the Jewish district of Manhattan getting involved with the mob, to becoming the biggest bootleggers in New York. This film is just a wonderful trip through. The story line is well planned out and the pacing is done well to where events flow seamlessly throughout those nearly 4 hours. Each frame is painstakingly shot and shows the artesian craft of Leone. Performances of Robert DE Niro, who is good like his usually is, and James Woods, who is especially standout in his role, give human depth to the film that so many other epics/gangster films lack. the film's score adds even more to it with beautiful string melodies to pan flute solos(go figure in a movie like this). <br/><br/>Overall if you have the time to devote to watch to this, the do it. This can stand alongside The Godfather or Goodfellas in its genre. This is something to watch it if you can appreciate the art and journey of the story throughout. Sergio Leone's farewell is an amazing film. <br/><br/>9.5/10"
"hardeep-pathak","8","3","6","13 May 2012"," A marathon masterpiece
","Different from the typical Leone-style of western films, this is a novel- esque, visually bold & non-linear narration of the lives of two gang members spanning over decades. The transitions during the time travel are superb and neat. The movie slows down at various intervals just to instill blatant entertainment with intrinsic awe.<br/><br/>After redefining the western genre through his earlier flicks, Leone now redefines the gangster-flick genre. And manages so easily to leave you mesmerized. Epic in terms of length and direction. Leone's direction is visionary as always and hypnotic and so is De Niro's acting. Jennifer Connelly looks so beautiful as a 14 year old in her debut movie. James Woods gives a career-defining performance too. Do not dare to ignore the movie only because of the length."
"dave13-1","9","3","6","13 April 2012"," Worth the investment of time.
","Some reviewers of this movie have complained about its length (almost 4 hours). So? Watch it on two successive nights in two hour installments, and count your self lucky. For years, the sole version of this movie that was available on video was severely cut down, shorter by 90 minutes, and the result was nothing less than butchery. It was like somebody deciding Picasso's Guernica was too huge, so let's take these scissors and make it smaller... Actions taken by the adult characters often made no sense, since those actions were supposed to resonate with actions taken when the characters were young, and those earlier actions were cut out. Spend the time, watch the movie and think about what you are seeing. This is, simply put, one of the five best movies of 1984 and in the long version you get to see it in all of its broad sweeping and elaborate narrative structure and all of its interesting little details. Marvel at the cast of young actors (including a then 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly) who dream of something better than the immigrant ghetto poverty they grew up in, and watch as their dreams and schemes and casual morality sow the seeds of the adults they will become. Live in their America, in the moment and across the decades - an America of limitless opportunity, but also of infinite potential for corruption and exploitation. Success in this America meant always having something on the go and it usually meant trying to keep one step ahead of the cops, whether you were a street punk or a 'legitimate businessman'. Note: other Zippers have made much of DeNiro's gangster's attempted rape of his former childhood friend in the film, but this scene was by no means gratuitous or exploitative. It was, in fact, a demonstration of how far the worlds of the two had grown apart, and this is just one example of how deeply and symbolically EVERYTHING in this movie resonates. A movie this ambitious or good can't ever be 'too long'."
"johnnyboyz","8","3","6","18 May 2011"," Don't let the title lead you astray, this is no fable-like fairytale; Leone's final film formulating into a mesmeric and thoroughly worthwhile three and a half hour opus.
","Once Upon a Time in America begins with some music featuring an artist singing of an America to be proud of; of an America worth dying for and a nation of which is generally somewhat better than just rather decent. The places Sergio Leone's 1984 film, the last before his 1989 death, will go are places not necessarily inclined towards painting images of the place as the song would suggest; his film an other-worldly and quite fantastic hierarchical tale told across numerous decades in the early to mid-twentieth century about kids coming to grow into adults but all the while living a persistent existence as criminals. The film begins at the ground zero stage of the 1920s streets of Brooklyn, New York City, before going on well into the 1960s; a stage by which time friendships have been forged; mistakes have been made and people have come and gone for whatever reasons. By the time it has ended, we are exhausted but in a strictly positive way.<br/><br/>Despite being as close to death as he was, we don't necessarily feel Leone lost much of what made him the director he was. When a gangster rummages through an opium den with his cronies looking for somebody specific, he comes face to face with a female patron and her lover; a scene which is allowed to play out in that fashion that sees it oddly disgusting in its overall tone and yet oddly beautiful in its overall craft; that fashion Leone was always able to wedge out of such instances – a wordless exchange purveyed through facial expressions and feeding off of the threat somebody carries via their lowered brows and narrowed eyes. Such an instance is similar to that of how a group of ugly, disfigured bandits waited at a train station nearer the beginning of 1964's A Fistful of Dollars – their toying with the surroundings, systematically seizing and weighing absolutely everything up as what is essentially a hunt for blood takes a brief excursion, feeling prominent.<br/><br/>The reasoning for the gangsters doing what they're doing is because of what Robert De Niro's David Aaronson, nicknamed Noodles, got himself involved in at a very early age and kept with him as he grew up. Leone has the sorts of people after Aaronson mercilessly gun down a young blonde and then beat a guy within an inch of his life in hunting their prey, a playful cut to the desired lying face-up in said drug parlour looking severely spaced out and rather vulnerable heightening tension. As it is, Aaronson knows his time has come; the curious notion of having a lead character in a gangster film effectively run from his both troubles and the enemy, when the comparable thing might be for confrontation thus leading to action. Aaronson's exit and re-entry to New York a whole forty years later is carried out in a remarkably played sequence paying sly homage to its own passing of time; specifically, utilising the sole words of ""yesterday"" (temporally) and ""suddenly"" (spacially) so as to establish an awareness of the transition from one era to another.<br/><br/>The proceedings begin in earnest in the 1920s with Aaronson still a boy; a boy forming a clan of four with some friends and a boy whose chief items on one's mind lie in that of milling around with these pals, stealing a little something here and there, and the equally young Deborah towards whom he takes a fancy. We feel Aaronson has a genuine fondness for Deborah; the instance in which, through a corrupt cop doing things he ought not, he is permitted sexual relations of some kind however brief and crude, does not deter him from an overall goal of naturally coming to bond with Deborah. It is during these promiscuous times that he comes into contact with that of the slightly elder, but equally street smart urchin, Max Bercovicz; eventually played by James Woods. Bercovicz appears to ride into proceedings, indeed town, with his family on a horse driven cart, as if unreal; as if coming on in from the horizon: this mythical figure surely not even belonging to this realm. Aaronson and Bercovicz's oneupmanship begins mere minutes after they first meet, the targeting of an elderly drunk as a robbery victim seeing Bercovicz effectively come out on top over Aaronson but nicely teeing up what will become a series of fascinating crime infused interplay. The distinct underpinning of homoeroticism in the pair's relationship is fascinating. Overhanging it all are failed relationships with various women and quotations when things get heated, such is the way these two bicker like an old couple, along the lines of: ""Maybe I really should just dump you"" or De Niro's gem ""Wherever you go, I go""; entirely encapsulating the nature of their ties.<br/><br/>Without letting up, Leone's exploration of these men whom grow up out of the boys we initially witness is little short of tremendous; a firm eye on the pratfalls of a life of crime. The covering of the advancing through a life of crime by Aaronson and Max et al is as dramatic as it is fraught with a great deal of substance; an occurrence in which the crew execute a diamond robbery and then double-cross the employers seeing said instance unfold within an isolated coastal locale rich in grounded tug boats. The killing of those executed a figurative running aground of those, perhaps literally, previously having had to pull along the likes of Aaronson and co. – now reduced to neatly echoing the presence of a number of small tug boats in the vicinity: rusted, unnecessary and not needed – their time to be discarded has come. Leone crosses from strand to strand; decade from decade with ease, the overhanging mystery of whom it is is involved in Aaronson's calling him back looming over everything in what is a miraculously played, really rather wondrous gangster film that is wholly recommended."

"janecamacho","8","3","6","23 January 2010"," Leone's final Jigsaw puzzle
","This is truly a complex film to watch! Leone's final testament to his cinematic artistry and his most beloved project is a movie that draws inevitable comparisons to such films as The godfather and Novecento. There are many elements in common with these pictures: the chronological leaps in the story, the gangster background, a love-hate friendship, all of which are treated in a unique way that distinguishes this movie from his pears and gives it Leone's brand. <br/><br/>Robert DeNiro is David ""Noodles"" Aronson, a young hoodlum turned gangster that, as we are told in the beginning of the movie, has betrayed his friends and partners and so goes in to hiding. Several years later he returns to track down a mysterious person who found him and somehow knows all about his betrayal all those years ago. This premise stars off a series of flashbacks from Noddles that, piece by piece shed some light in to previous events and scenes from the beginning which to the viewers didn't make much sense.<br/><br/>Leone's storytelling is slow. It was in his previous two movies and much more so in Once upon a time in America. That in itself might detach even the more patient viewers. Truly he aimed very high with this picture, and if you take on the suggested comparison I mentioned, you have DeNiro's ""Noodles"" a tragic character that ends up losing everything and everyone in the end, much like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, or some of the characters from David Lean's movies for that matter! So, the epic proportions of Once upon a time have a precedent that must have been present in Leone's mind when he conceived it. Even more: Franco Arcalli, co-writer of the movie, was also co-writer, and editor of Novecento, so you can't help wondering how much of the ""two men friendship"" motif transpired from that Bertolucci film. But I think the similarities stop there! In Once upon a time in America the love triangle between Noodles, Maxie and Deborah come to the central fore, and the prohibition/gangster plot, despite providing long pauses in the narrative, serve as a stylistic background to the main theme. Leone was a passionate for American History, as his Western movies confirm, so it would be expected that he explored an American period (the prohibition era) with so much elements in common with the violent and mythic Wild West. Furthermore, to add to the complexity of this film he introduced yet again an unexpected turn in the story witch unfolds in the very end, and keep you guessing about what you have just seen. It was so in the end of Once upon a time in the west and in Duck you sucker, and here you get the idea (as suggested by Leone himself) that the whole movie is Noodles opium based dream, and you really never leave the Chinese theater where he is smoking his pipe in self pity for his actions! Complex? Very much. In the end you get the feeling that Leone got through his point rather more effectively in his earlier western Once upon a time in the west. But enough with the critiques! If you can get through the slow pace of the movie, and really sink in the intended suggestions in the narrative the reward will be, as the whole movie in itself, grandiose and epic. After all this is a Sergio Leone film. As a ""master painter of pictures"", if you don't quite grasp the meaning of the painting you can still get reward by just admiring the colors. You have the beautifully composed shots of 1930's New York through the cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli (Leone's regular collaborator); the extreme close-ups that depict character emotions like with no other director; Leone's trademark eyes close up which are reduced to a single, beautiful transition shot between the elder and the younger Noodles watching his beloved Deborah; the final showdown, which evolved into a duel of words between the two friends; and last but not the least, Ennio Morricone at the helm of the soundtrack (composed prior to the film) conveying the dream like feel to movie, both idyllic (in Deborah's theme) and cruel (in Dominic's death scene). My advice? Whach it! After all, this was Leone's final masterpiece!"
"john.brady","9","3","6","11 December 2005"," Friendship and love
","Sergio Leone's last film is a belter (and, for my money, his best since ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"").<br/><br/>Famously butchered into chronological order for it's original US release, this flawed masterpiece has an extraordinary flashback structure that spans half a century.<br/><br/>Beginning in 1920's New York, the film depicts four boyhood friends and their journey from petty street crime to gangsterism. The the dramatic centre of the film is the relationship between Noodles (played as an adult by Robert De Niro) and his relationship with his friend and rival Max, and the beautiful but out-of-his-league Deborah.<br/><br/>The childhood scenes in turn-of-the-century New York and poignant and beautiful. Leone takes the time to explore the milieu in which the boys live. They live in poverty, with crime and corruption an everyday part of live, and they use their wits to earn a living. They are also sexually precocious, and there is a bizarrely moving scene where one of the boys devours the cream cake he was going to use to secure a sexual favour. The way in which he hesitantly steals a dollop of cream and reties the parcel, before abandoning hope and scoffing the lot, is strangely touching.<br/><br/>This sexual undercurrent pervades the film, and soon mingles with the violence in some harrowing scenes of rape. The defining moment in Noodles' relationship with Deborah is when, as an adult, she snubs his romantic advances and says she is moving to Hollywood. He rapes her in a prolonged and disturbing scene, but it is clear from the aftermath that this is not a ""victory"" for him but an abject failure - he has demonstrated at last why he has never been worthy of her. In the next scene, where he races to the train station to catch her before she leaves town, she pulls the shutters down on him and this is when his life falls apart.<br/><br/>Equally key is the relationship with Max. In their first encounter they are rivals, then they develop a strong but uneasy friendship. Noodles is the ostensible leader of the gang, but Max slowly assumes control and it becomes clear by the end that Max has been pulling the strings all along.<br/><br/>The plot is propelled by both the rise of the gang (told through flashback), and also the unfolding mystery (told in the 1960s) of what happened to each of the character's and their haul of money. But the relationship between Noodles, Max and Deborah is the emotional heart of the film.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is amazing as Noodles. There is a scene in which he does nothing other than stir his coffee for over a minute, and the menace he generates is absolutely palpable.<br/><br/>With a superb supporting cast (Tuesday Weld, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello), wonderful cinematography and one of Ennio Morricone's best scores, this is a classy production from start to finish.<br/><br/>The film does lose its way towards the end, and there is an under-explored (and apparently heavily cut) subplot with Treat Williams as a trade unionist which serves mainly to confuse. The ending is notoriously obscure and open to interpretation.<br/><br/>As a gangster film, it is equalled only by ""The Godfather"" (parts I and II) and ""Goodfellas"". Poignant, funny, moving, and at times horrifically violent, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a film with enormous dramatic range."
"Hancock_the_Superb","9","3","6","21 August 2005"," Leone's ""Moby Dick"": A Flawed Masterpiece
","This movie was the culmination of a sixteen-year obsession by director Sergio Leone. Ever since he first read ""The Hoods"" in 1967, he wanted to make this movie. But, the studios saw him as a Western director (given the Clint Eastwood ""Man With No Name"" trilogy's success, not really surprising), and he was forced to make ""Once Upon A Time In The West"", a masterpiece, and ""A Fistful of Dynamite"", an interesting but uneven political Western. After a decade of producing various films, Leone was finally able to get this film off the ground, with a major studio backing - and then, when it was finally released in 1984, Warner Bros. criminally hacked the movie down to just over two hours from a final cut near four, ruining the scope and feel of the movie and causing it to flop. Now, the movie is available in a not-quite-complete (the director's cut is somewhere around 270 minutes) form at 227 minutes, but still complete enough that the scope of the film and Leone's intentions can be appreciated. Obviously, the film - long, violent, and somewhat hard to follow - is not for everyone; classifying this film as a ""gangster"" or ""crime"" movie simply does not do it justice. But for those willing to check it out, OUATIA is a rewarding, bittersweet experience.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is told mostly in flashback, and is so labyrinthine and complicated that it's difficult, at least for someone as long-winded as myself, to adequately summarize. Basically, it's about Noodles (Robert De Niro), a former gangster who in 1968 returns to his old stomping grounds of New York City and recalls in flashback his early childhood days with his gang, their years as important figures in the Prohibition era in the '30s, his unrequited love for local girl Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern), and the tragedy when his three friends are killed by the Feds. However, the film also shows why it is DeNiro has returned, and - well, I won't spoil it for you.<br/><br/>On a technical level, this is arguably Leone's best. The childhood sequences in particular give a stunning depiction of the mean streets of New York's Jewish ghettos, circa 1922, with Tonino Delli Colli (R.I.P.) providing his usual flawless, and beautiful cinematography. Ennio Morricone provides one of his two or three best scores, particularly the haunting ""Cockeye's Theme"" (played on pan flute by Gheorghie Zhamphir) and the melancholy and heartbreaking ""Deborah's Theme"".<br/><br/>The movie is a dark character study before it is a gangster movie. Noodles, in 1968, is basically reviewing his life, and his complicity in losing his friends, dream lover, and basically everything about his life. De Niro gives his usual fantastic performance: it isn't quite in the league of, say, ""Taxi Driver"", but it's still impressive in its own right - particularly in his 1968 sequences, when he discovers that, no matter how hard he tries, there is no running from the past.<br/><br/>The supporting cast for the most part is under-used, though the more prominent members do a great job, particularly James Woods, who would never again have a role which even approached this complexity and depth. Woods does a truly marvelous job as Max, Noodles' friend who eventually takes over the gang and drives it to destruction, and manages to steal pretty much every scene he's in (which, when dealing with De Niro and Co., is quite an achievement). Elizabeth McGovern, despite many negative comments by others, does a great job as Deborah, showing her vulnerability and personality, and managing to make her a very sympathetic character. Tuesday Weld is also a standout as Carol, Max's nymphomaniac girlfriend. William Forsythe and James Hayden do a nice job as Cockeye and Patsy, the two other members of the gang, while other veteran character actors - Joe Pesci (""Goodfellas""), Burt Young (""Rocky""), Danny Aiello (""Leon: The Professional""), James Russo (""Bevery Hills Cop""), Treat Williams (""Hair""), Clem Caserta (""A Bronx Tale""), and Richard Bright (Al Neri of the ""Godfather"" films) - do a nice job with fairly limited material. The acting by the child actors, particularly Scott Tiler as young Noodles and Jennifer Conneley (in her film debut) as Deborah, is surprisingly effective; it's almost a shame that except Conneley none of these kids really made it to the big time. (Particularly touching are the sequences where Conneley reads the ""Song of Songs"" to Noodles.) <br/><br/>The movie is filled with memorable images throughout, some funny and heartwarming, others dark, some almost horrifying. The relentless ringing of the telephone in Noodles' head as he contemplates the deaths of his friends; the young Patsy preferring a delicious cake over sex with the local slut Peggy; the death at the hands of local hood Bugsy (Russo) of Dominic, the gang's youngest member, and the brutal aftermath (for my money the best scene of the movie); Burt Young getting shot in the eye through a looking glass; Deborah cutting ties with Noodles by pulling down the blinds of the rail car; ""Max"" in 1968 stepping into the back of a garbage truck; and, of course, De Niro's (1933) final, drug-induced smile at the end.<br/><br/>The violence in the movie is graphic and brutal, but not in any way glamorized. The rape scenes are very hard to sit through, but neither (in my opinion at least) are gratuitous; they show that in the world of small-time hoods, women are an afterthought. It may come across to sexist as some, but blame the characters, not Leone.<br/><br/>The movie has a poetic feel to it that is hard to describe. It isn't perfect; some bits of the movie go on for too long, particularly in the later 1968 scenes, and there are a few plot holes that can be debated or hopefully overlooked. But overall, ""Once Upon A Time In The America"" deserves its status as more than a gangster movie, but rather a dark piece of cinematic mythology. 9.5/10"
"AudemarsPiguet","9","3","6","21 April 2005"," Seldomly a film of such beauty...
","I was in my teens,about sixteen or seventeen,when I first saw this film and,incidentally,I was at an age when the twenties imagery fascinated me-well it still does... Highly artistic was the opening scene,when the annoying phone calls are associated with a lavish party scene-a symbol for life's vanity and the revenge of a guilty conscience for all the pleasures(similarly in Shakespearean theater the obsessive repetition of nagging noises is actually stands for the guilt complexes from the past reemerging). It's,like previously other viewers noticed,the story of a few poor immigrant boys trying to conquer the new promised land-even if they end up building an empire of crime(let's face it,they did't have any other chance to evolve from rags to riches considering their social background)they are somewhat American pioneers,these solitary,strong-minded and ambitious heroes who turned the U.S. into what it is today. By the way,American capitalism and political life,even if apparently honest and fair-play are not necessarily based on legal methods... Eventually their twisted friendship will(like in a passionate,irrationally intense love-story)destroy everything it touched-and in between an epic spanning between 1915 and 1968,a visual treat of elegant vintage cars,stylish clothing and sophisticated champagne bottles-all the luxury and fascination of the legendary prohibition age. The scene where Prohibition is ""buried""-somewhat resembling the ""Death of Glitter"" concert from ""Velvet Goldmine"",actually a coffin-shaped chocolate-cake is surrounded by four candles stuck into Cordon Rouge bottles,is one of the most influential in film history,probably known and loved even by the ones who aren't much into this genre,did not watch/enjoy this film. In my opinion this scene is capturing all the beauty and vanity of life,youth,ambition and pleasure-it is almost possible to feel,to sense an utterly voluptuous universe fading away,becoming impossible to hold back... I don't think that the characters were homosexual,in spite of their very strong friendly love,I guess this film is rather a hymn in the honor of a myth as old as mankind:friendship;even admitting that this film involves a certain homo erotic subtext,it is that high-minded, poetic,strictly Platonic homo eroticism to be found in the strong bonds that existed among e.g. ancient warriors wanting to be buried together and have their ashes mixed for eternity-this ritual(though altered) actually happens this way in this film too. I also don,t buy the preconception that Max was a traitor-notice that even his more balanced friends are actually brutes occasionally violently bursting out like wild animals-he's just a better survivor and fighter that the rest.Of course he might be more megalomaniac,self-indulgent and egocentric than the others,but he's acting according to the rules of gangland and of his Jewish background-the Jewish origin of most of the characters partly explain their talent for money-making,their compellingly manipulative personalities,their practical intelligence. While Noodles turns out,in my opinion,as a winner in the end.Even if poor and forgotten,even if he gets high in order to forget life's misery,he seems balanced and appeased in the end.After going trough pretty much of what his century had to offer,after undergoing so many experiences and changes,he takes refuge in a world(even if artificially created by drugs)where,in an almost godlike way,only the beauty,the legendary side of the violent age of gangsters exists.He therefore rescued,almost like Proust,trough the power of memory,his glamorous and adventurous youth from extinction. Another fascinating (among many others) scene is the one when a posh partying crowd is throwing with Cordon Rouge bottles out of an old timer swiftly and almost invisibly driving by-this scene somewhat exhales the ghastly,nostalgic roaring twenties beauty,like in a novel by Fitzgerald or a visually disturbingly compelling&lush period piece by Ken Russel. Irespective of the dark,violent and bleak message of this film,I'll always remember it as one of the most accomplished visual poems dedicated to youth and the unlimited ambitions it is often linked with. Therefore a lush and highly fulfilling treat due to its immense and very credible evocative power,depicting credible and actual scenes without ever being common or boring."
"marc-366","9","3","6","1 April 2005"," Uncomfortable but compelling viewing
","Although I have been a huge fan of Sergio Leone's work for sometime, I have only just got around to watching Once Upon a Time in America. Probably largely because I've never been too much of a fan of the gangster genre. I'm so glad I did, as it is another Leone masterpiece.<br/><br/>Morricone scores always seem to add so much to a movie, and the same is clearly the case here. The story itself is based in three different times - Noodles as a child, as a young man, and 30 years later. The film plays the flashbacks intermittently, and not in chronological order order - to great effect - with the story gradually making more and more sense as it evolves. It explores the relationship between Noodles and Max, from childhood riffraff to big-time gangsters.<br/><br/>At times it is painful to watch - with the rape of Debra being particularly uncomfortable viewing. But the film is very challenging, has a good twist and leaves you with many unanswered questions. A great film for those of us that want more than action action action and explosions.<br/><br/>If you have a fair few hours to spend (it is a long movie) I would definitely recommend that you watch this."

","Anyone who thinks that this film is slow is surely showing their level of maturity. This film is decpicting a very large portion of a lifetime hence the length of it. I cannot see how the quality of this movie is degraded in some of these user comments. Personally I can sit and watch movies all day and night. Those of you who said that it was too long should go and rent Toy Story! This film is exactly what I want from a film. It has purpose,a good storyline thoughout, vision and delivers on all other fronts. It is sheer brilliance. De Niro shows his marvellous ability to literally become the character a feat he accomplishes time and time again, and James Woods is fantastic throughout. Storyline and directing is at it's best. I do actually believe that this storyline is better than that of the Godfather in that there is more to it. I don't blame the director for choosing this over the Godfather storyline. I enojyed this film for so many reasons that I wouldn't have the time to write them all but basically it delivers everything from a film that I am after and so much more.<br/><br/>3 Hours 47 minutes- that's how you make a film!!"

","I rented this movie back in 1985 and thought it was one of the best crime dramas I had ever seen. The story was great and so was the acting. But what I liked the most was the way it was directed. Long stares, the way scenes jumped from past to present, and the way it all ties together at the end. I like the way that it makes you think about some of the things that happened without just making it obvious. There are some different versions of this film, one which was originally shown to american audiences was a 2 hour mess, a horrible film that made absolutely no sense. Then there is the almost 4 hour movie that Leone originally wanted and is a masterpiece, See this one it is a great film.

"cathcacr","9","3","6","8 May 2002"," Masterpiece?
","That's the word that keeps popping up in the users' reviews of this film, and not without reason.  I don't know if I'm prepared to draw that judgment myself (I'd really have to see it again), but I'm among those who, at the least, take seriously such claims.  I think there are few films in American cinema history that clearly meet this level of quality: the _Godfather_ saga, _Schindler's List_, _Apocalypse Now_, a great number of Kubrick films, some of Hitchcock's films, some Welles films, David Lean's epics, and maybe some others that don't come to mind right off.  In the ""maybe"" class I'd put this one, perhaps Leone's other epics (though, again, I'd have to see *those* again), _Chinatown_, and perhaps several others.  In any event, the list of such films (masterpiece-level or very near it) is not very long, and this one belongs on it.<br/><br/>In the pantheon of great gangster films, this has to be right up near the top, below the _Godfather_ films and above _Goodfellas_ (and _On the Waterfront_, should one so classify it).  In the relatively barren landscape of 1980s American film, this one towers above just about all of them.  It's a truly special film and, aside from its decent placement in the top 250 on this website, has been unjustly neglected/overlooked for the past couple decades, as evidenced by the fact that it's yet to be released on DVD (the arrival of which I'm among those ever-so-patiently awaiting).<br/><br/>This one is among the two dozen or so films that I'd rate a 9/10 or higher."

","Sergio Leone's films are all miserably, awkward attempts by a sick, childlike individual. This film is no exception. Unlike true classics like The Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, and Scarface; Once Upon a Time in America is incredibly inept. Like the director (what's his name?) who was responsible for The Deer Hunter and Heaven's Gate, Leone is terribly inept, and it shows. Scenes such as the woman who begs to be raped, the switching of babies in the maternity ward, and the pulling out of penises so a woman can identify the rapist are sick. The scene where the extremely fat prostitute kisses Noodles is sick. The scene where Noodle deliberately drives off a pier is inexplicably stupid. The scene where they shoot up a car when the mobsters inside are obviously already dead is very strange. <br/><br/>Stupid and sick. That sums up Sergio Leone. Implausible garbage."

","Of all the entries in the gangster/mob genre, this one is by far, my least favorite. The drawn-out, extended opening of this film sets the stage for a rather lengthy (more than 3 and 1/2 hours) and far-fetched story about the rise of Jewish mobsters in New York City. Although a huge fan of his, I have to admit that this is one film where Robert DeNiro just does not seem to fit. While James Woods turns in a competent performance, he too just seems a bit over the top and unconvincing. The rest of the cast, as well, while convincing at certain points, doesn't seem to gel and many of the scenes should have been shortened or deleted completely. The storyline is poor and leaves nothing memorable. Clearly, this is one genre where Sergio Leone just does not belong."

","Given the cast I was expecting so much more. I love a good epic and a gangster yarn spanning a lifetime has all the makings of great movie but this is just a mish mash of flashbacks, flash forwards, and possibly a flash sideways. The basic premise is a little confusing and the actual script is pretty terrible so it makes for a long four hours. Didn't think it was possible to make a bad gangster movie with Deniro in it but this one succeeded. It's a shame, it had the ingredients of a great film."

","A disappointment. Living proof of 2 old adages: ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" and ""the longer the joke, the bigger the punchline has to be."" Too many cooks definitely hurt this flick, and as long as the movie is, it should've had a MUCH bigger punchline. In this case the journey was far more enjoyable than the destination. It would've been nice if the bunch that wrote the first part had communicated a little better with the crew that did the second, so we'd have a more coherent second part. After the intermission we are introduced to a whole new Max, one who suddenly is Bugsy Siegel and flips out periodically (which he never did before) because his old man was nuts (which we never knew before), and whose life ambition is to knock over a Federal Reserve bank--which we not only haven't been told before but he and he crew have (as far as we know) never even robbed a bank! At the inexcusably weak punch line, a long talky confrontation between a still newer Max and Noodles (did we ever find out how he got that stupid nickname?) we also learn that Noodles is a stone cold killer who Secretary Max wants to kill him, for reasons that are muddy at best. Almost as muddy as the way he went from street tough to Cabinet member. This despite Noodles' not having killed a single person in the whole flick--in fact having gone ballistic when people were killed. Say WHAT?? I won't even go into the whole business with the garbage truck and the amazing disappearing whozit. Even the commentary throws up its hands at that. And finally there's the whole ""friendship/loyalty"" schtick. It works for the kid versions of Noodles and Max, but De Niro and Wood have NO chemistry at all. They act friends because the script says so, but that's all. Woods has never had chemistry with anyone, in any flick. And I thought the first US release was muddled. The movie should've stayed with the kids."

","I'd think the best film I've seen, probably is ""Once Upon a Time in America"". The film is based on the novel by Harry Gray ""Once Upon a Time in America"". It was directed by an Italian man called Sergio Leone and stars Robert De Niro. It's based in America. This film about some desperate guys that met in the twenties years. They became kings of underworld, but one of them was a traitor. This film about a friendship, betrayal and love. It lasted about 4 hours. The film is long, but don't slow-movie. It immerses into the atmosphere of the twenties. The movie thing about life, teaches how to act. The story is very complicated. The end of the movie a riddle and I don't understand. I recommend it to everyone."
"ElMaruecan82","10","4","10","12 July 2011"," We don't spend our lives writing the future, we spend our lives writing the PAST ...
","*** Like the movie starts with the sound of ""God Bless America"", I'd like to open this review by the following words : 'God Bless You Signor Leone for this cinematic epitaph, whose only criminal aspect is the unfair butchery that prevented it from a higher recognition in your lifetime. But time did justice to this masterpiece whose greatness transcended the notions of screen time. And wherever you are, I hope that, knowing the reputation of ""Once Upon a Time in America"", your smile would be as wide a Mr. De Niro's in the last iconic frame.' *** <br/><br/>A kid is about to pay the services of a prostitute with an appetizing pastry. Waiting on the landing, he tastes the cream, licks the paper, takes the cherry, puts it back, and finally succumbing to the irresistible call of childhood -hell with it- he eats it. No words needed for one of the most beautiful scenes in cinema's history, Ennio Morricone's music is enough to remind us that even the most corrupted souls have been pure once.<br/><br/>One of these souls is David ""Noodles"" Aaronson, a man with memories like a double-edged sword, enriching his heart with so many precious jewels, and tormenting it with the weight of a deadly secret. And we literally endure the guilt through a long sequence where an annoying phone ringing is heard in the foreground. Leone even teases us as the ringing persists when an anonymous hand takes the receiver. It's not about who calls but who's called, during the Prohibition's farewell party, which foreshadows a more brutal farewell.<br/><br/>Noodles appeases his remorseful heart in the Chinese theater's opium den then manages to escape from a bunch of goons coming to kill the 'traitor'. He takes the key from the gang's ex-headquarter, Fat Moe's speakeasy. He goes to the train station, opens a locker and takes the briefcase containing all the shared funds of the late gang, its emptiness ironically mirrors Noodles' new condition. He leaves New York, the heart full of a sentiment that Morricone's haunting score beautifully conveys : nostalgia, the death of innocence mourned through the haunting music of a pan flute, also heard in the iconic Manhattan Bridge scene, where Dominick, the youngest kid of the gang, ""slipped"".<br/><br/>And in one beautiful ellipse, ""Yesterday""  an old man is back home, 35 years later. The poignant ""Deborah's theme"" brings back the nostalgia with an intensity that makes us feel like we grew up in that neighborhood. ""What have you been doing all these years?"" asks an older Moe. ""Been going to bed early."", replies a laconic Noodles, whose Proustian innuendo associates his long exile to a wise resignation for nothingness. A sentiment we could feel after half an hour, but Leone trusts our patience : we must understand the value of the loss before plunging into it. And the transition is magical between the eyes of the old and the teenage Noodles watching through the hole in the toilet wall while Deborah, the love of his life, practices her steps.<br/><br/>All the transitions are brilliantly directed by lights, from candles or cars, as the allegory of this invisible stuff that only our hearts can see in our reality's darkness, the memories. The whole movie is a dreamy introspection which is one with the history of America, with the childhood part as a tribute to the Great Emigration Wave. Noodles grew up in the New York City's Jewish quarter, a setting reconstructed with a sense of details that reminds of the epic reconstitution of Little Italy in ""The Godfather Part II"" and the Feast of San Gennaro has been replaced by Pesach, during which young Deborah reads a poem to Noodles implicitly declaring her love, sincere but impossible.<br/><br/>Many years later, after a magnificent dinner, Noodles reveals to her that the two things that prevented him from insanity in jail was the remembrance of Dominick's last words and the last part of his innocence still left in his heart : her. But Deborah, corrupted her way, became a star and leaves a speechless Noodles for Hollywood. Her decision sealed his fate as a vulgar criminal and what followed then in the cab, was the weakest and saddest expression of a man who had nothing to lose anymore, not even pride. Noodles took with strength what his heart couldn't, a desperate act that would haunt him forever.<br/><br/>Adulthood terribly distorts the most meaningful things. Max mechanically cleans his shoes, Deborah maliciously tells Noodles to see ""his mom"" but something doesn't ring true anymore. Even the tone of the film radically changes, more 'gangster' and political material, and the confusion can be upsetting ... except if we believe that the essential would be elsewhere, especially when 35 years later, the money suddenly resurrects in the train station's briefcase and Deborah reappears from Noodles' eternally point of view : he's old but she looks as young as ever, a poetic irony when we learn she's the mistress of the powerful Senator Bailey, who's no one else but a man from the past.<br/><br/>Max resurrects in Noodles' life and asks him, as a redeeming act of vengeance to kill him for he took his money, his girlfriend, his life. Max could easily accept, but he can't afford to lose his pride again, and the most valuable things he still possesses, his memories ... even if the illusory happiness implies an illusory guilt. Noodles, in a voluntary denial, wishes the best for 'Mr Bailey' adding : ""It'd be a shame to see a lifetime of work go to waste."" The last words of the film.<br/><br/>And the beautiful ""God Bless America"" rocks us like a peaceful lullaby transporting us back to the Chinese theater, where Noodles' heart finally relieved, if not redeemed, can savor his memories  painful, but intact. No words, again for one of the most beautiful endings in cinema's history, only a big smile."
"Tom326","6","4","10","5 September 2009"," A disappointment
","I waited years to see this film. It was not worth the wait. I had seen and loved many of Leone's earlier films. Ironically, however, I watched for the first time his breakout movie (Fistful of Dollars) and this, his last, within two days of each other. Night and day. Fistful is a masterpiece, wonderful in so many ways. America, however, does not work on many levels -- many of which are pretty objective and so I am shocked at how many people love this film and claim it deserves to be in an ""all timer"" category. I would rate it as my least favorite Leone film.<br/><br/>The problems, as I see them are: (i) This is not a ""four hour"" film. It is a 2.5 hour film stretched to four by overly indulgent long scenes of people staring at each other. I admire artistic choice but (a) did not feel the artistic feel to his scenes worked, they felt over indulgent; and (b) found them unforgivable in taking a movie that did not need to be so long and stretching it (actually, this could have been a proper 4 hour movie, with an extra hour of plot put in). (ii) There was little emotional impact to the overall story. People love to romanticize gangster pics for some reason, but I was not seeing it here. The Max faked his death angle was (a) obvious, predicted it as soon as I realized ""who"" Max was; (b) hokey; and (c) the big ""reveal"" was perhaps the least interesting part of the movie. (iii) The plot is choppy and we don't get a clear enough view of certain characters. This is not a major attack, but if the first two had worked, this would have kept the film out of masterpiece status. (iv) Not impressed with the acting. Elizabeth McGovern was frankly awful. DeNiro, eh. Woods, OK. Loved Jennifer Connelly. (v) The music was like Quint running his fingers down the chalkboard. Loved it in other Leone films. Hated it here.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is not an ""awful"" movie. It has positive elements. It is beautifully filmed in many instances. There is somewhat of an epic and historical feel, even if the plot does not completely work. But such a disappointment compared to expectations based on Leone's earlier works. I can see how people would like this film more than I. I am dumbfounded that anyone could rationally state that this is the best (or even one of the best) films ever as so many posters have. Way, way, way too many flaws."

","I had heard quite a bit about this film before I finally bought the DVD a few weeks ago.I had never seen it play on TV so I picked it up and watched it that very day.I must say, I was blown away.I knew it was going to be good, but the film was excellent.It is definitely in my Top 5 favorite gangster films.It's one of the few films I know which concentrates on Jewish gangsters as opposed to italians.Everything about this movie is great, from the score, to the acting, to the story.It's almost perfect.It's a bit hard to understand at times and you might need multiple viewings to get the complete experience.The film is in non-chronological order and jumps from three different time periods, the 1910's, the 1930's and the 1960's.We see the characters as kids, how they meet and how they start their own criminal activities while worrying about another gangster.They then jump to the 1930's, where they are adult gangsters, robbing banks and dealing in alcohol during prohibition, and finally the 1960's where the leader returns to the old place after 35 years.The cast of the film involves Robert De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, William Forsythe and Jennifer Connelly.The acting is excellent from everybody involved.It's quite bloody and violent for a 1980's film.It's also a good thing the original version has been released here.Apparently, for the U.S theatrical release, the film company cut almost 90min of footage and re-edited the film in chronological order.This caused the film to be a mess, it got horrible reviews from critics and did not make much money at the box office.The original version is widely praised and is an excellent film.If only they had released that version in the first place.The cut version is very rare nowadays.I personally think this is one of the best mafia films of all time and if you are a fan of ""The Godfather"", you will probably love this film."

","Like so many, I find ""Once Upon a Time in America"" to be about as perfect - in ALL respects - as a movie can be. EVERY actor/actress was superb....the story so convincing and true-to-life......the costuming so authentic.....the score so beautiful......each scene so well-developed...every character fully developed, etc., etc., etc., etc...<br/><br/>BUT - I had to read many comments here to confirm that I wasn't the only one who truly loved it. I had NO IDEA it had been chopped and there were other footages of film unreleased. I have the 4-hour VHS version and wondered if TCM would show it all at one time. Last weekend and this coming weekend, it is divided for two showings. I had already watched it several times, so decided that I would pay very close attention to the details TCM presented. Unfotunately, I did not get good reception on TV although I have satellite (too far away from the receiver; I have another TV for watching VHS and DVD), so I cut immediately to my VHS. I now realize that TCM IS showing the uncut version, even with scenes that are not in my VHS. For instance, in the first scene when the girl is shot, she is shot twice, not once. When the hoodlums are beating-up on ""Fat Moe"" (fabulous character played by Larry Papp), they put a gun in his mouth to get him to tell where ""Noodles"" (DeNiro) is hiding....that's not in the VHS....and on-and-on. Someday, I'll get the DVD, but I don't always like them. The VHS is so moody in its colors.<br/><br/>Read some of the other user's comments to get the full story if you've missed this great film.....I'm not saying a thing about the story. I've personally known gangsters and they are portrayed authentically in ""Once Upon a Time in America"" - if you think they don't still exist, you're uninformed. They are a different breed than the ""gangstas"" who roam our streets today.<br/><br/>I am terribly confused about the running-length of this movie....nearly every comment has a different time. I don't have ANY trouble with long movies....yes, I was confused the first time I saw it, but it's beauty drew me right back to it - you have to really get involved in this story, beautifully directed by Leone with crystalline cinematography. I suspect I'll watch the last half again on TCM this Saturday, good reception or not.<br/><br/>""Best"" is a personal decision: I stand steadfastly with those who think this movie is one of the most moving films ever made.

"rchrdshelt","10","4","10","27 June 2006"," Absolutely Outstanding
","I originally heard of this movie about 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really know much of what it was about or who it starred. However, about 8 months ago I stumbled upon a review of John Ulmer (an IMDb critic I generally agree with and respect) who believed it to be a forgotten gangster flick that was just as good as The Godfather and Goodfellas.<br/><br/>After hearing such praise in his review and on IMDb I knew I had to find out more and try to see it when I could. Being a fan of Gangster films, Robert DeNiro and non-linear movies (such as Tarantino films and The Godfather Part II) I knew it must be worth seeing. Having finally got it last Christmas I had high expectations and perhaps that was the reason I was disappointed on my first viewing. I didn't have a problem with the running time. It was that it was that I found it a little too hard to understand and what messages it was trying to convey. Otherwise I thought the film was brilliantly made. However, I thought it would be unfair to judge the film after one viewing. Moreover, it seemed it was a movie that required several viewings to realise its full messages.<br/><br/>Today, 5 months on, I gave the film its second chance and was absolutely blown away. Having seen it before, I understood more about the characters and their situations. The film is absolutely outstanding and warrants every minute of it 3 1/2 hour running time. I can understand why so much anger arose from it being butchered into a mess on its release. It is not a quick 90 minute action or comedy flick. Its much deeper than that. I'm of the opinion that its a dream of a man looking back at his past and into the future- looking at his good times, bad times, regrets and what could be coming in his life. I think the deepest message of the film is to choose the life YOU want to lead and live it to the full otherwise you may live in regret. Perhaps I'm wrong but I don't think thats the point. I think Sergio Leone has left the viewer to make up their own minds about it. I have done so. Perhaps I'll find other messages each time I watch it. Thats the sort of masterpiece this film is.<br/><br/>On the subject of the film itself it's virtually flawless on every level. However, there's two particular things that stand out for me and I feel should be mentioned slightly above the rest - Ennio Morricone's truly outstanding score and the brilliant production design of an early 1900 New York which, in my opinion, tops that of The Godfather Part II flashbacks. I had never heard of Morricone before I saw this film but his score for it could well be THE greatest I've ever heard. As pointed out on the trivia section of IMDb it was criminally unable to be considered for an Oscar because of another mistake by the distributors. The score beautifully captures the films tone, particularly in the scenes between Noodles and Deborah. He also has several others which also work perfectly throughout the film. As far as the Production Design is concerned New York looks absolutely outstanding in the 1900's scenes and also in the 1930's ones. For the former in particular, every shot (like in Coppola's Godfather Trilogy) is beautifully designed and contains all kinds of early 20th century aspects you can think of such as smoke, horses, shop signs etc. Even in the indoor scenes, all the buildings and designs look very contemporary and every effort has gone into making you feel the film is taking place 70-100 years ago. They succeeded, and I honestly found it impossible to believe this film was shot in 1984.<br/><br/>Other aspects of the film are tremendous as well. DeNiro (in what appears a largely forgotten role) and Woods are both outstanding in the leads along with the others such as Tuesday Weld, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Elizabeth Mcgovern and others. However, some of the real scene-stealer's are the child actors featured in the 1900's scenes- my favourite section of the movie. Scott Tiler matches DeNiro as Noodles and a truly beautiful young Jennifer Connelly (who has deservedly gone onto bigger things and is now an Oscar winner) in my opinion upstages Elizabeth Mcgovern. The rest of the child actors all do good jobs as well.<br/><br/>Leone's Direction and vision really shine through here with the use of Tonino Delli Colli's photography. It is particularly evident in the 1900's scenes featuring the young Deborah walkthing through crowds.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the 3 1/2 hour running time. This film is one of the few such as The Godfather Trilogy, The Green Mile and Titanic that warrants its running time. Both times I've watched it, it moved very fast and I was never bored. Leone always keeps you interested and I never looked at my watch or felt uncomfortable. In fact I honestly felt as though I'd been watching a 2 hour film instead of nearly 4 hour one when I watched it today.<br/><br/>If I had any criticisms they would be of one or two distasteful scenes. I didn't have a huge problem with the disturbing rape scene as i think it was trying to tell you more about Noodles' character. However, I heavily disliked the baby switching scene, finding it incredibly distasteful and unnecessary. I know the characters aren't very likable, but that scene went too far for me.<br/><br/>Otherwise, there's nothing else that can be criticised about this masterpiece. It is now one my all-time favourites alongside Seven and The Green Mile, and I believe as John Ulmer rightly said, ""No-one should go a lifetime without seeing this wonderfully moving film"".<br/><br/>10/10"
"SoulPoet1818","6","4","10","15 June 2003"," A Disappointment
","I thought this movie would be amazing, but the scenes that added to the long length were not needed and did not propell the movie in any way. The directing was horrible. Coming from a directory straight out of the Dirty Harry series. The editing was choppy and the camera angles did not detail enough to where you could get more information. A waste of 4 hours. The story is very weak as well, it never goes anywhere, but just fills in the blanks of what was shown to you in the first scenes. Sergio Leone should take notes from Christopher Nolan on how to tell a story from the past, etc. A disappointment and waste of time. I give this film a 4/10 and that is giving the film leniancy."

Somewhere down the line, people undervalue the treasure of love and friendship but in actuality when one is standing at the dusk of life, everything seems small in front of a true friend and the innocent and happy time spent together.

"moonspinner55","6","3","7","18 March 2017"," Reflections on a turbulent life
","Stylish, perceptive and violent crime drama from director Sergio Leone, an epic-scaled adaptation of the book ""The Hoods"" by Herschel Goldberg (aka Harry Grey) about the lives of four gangsters in the years 1921, 1933 and 1968. Former street kids from the Jewish ghettos of Manhattan's lower East Side graduate from petty crimes and bootlegging to robbery and rape, to providing muscle for a union boss. Initially crippled by the film company's decision to hack the U.S. release print down to 2 hours and 15 minutes (the current extended director's cut runs 4 hours and 18 minutes), ""Once Upon a Time in America"" took many years to garner its now-sterling reputation among admirers of the gangster genre. Still, even in its mammoth original state, the wan subplots involving the ladies (Elizabeth McGovern as an actress and Tuesday Weld as a lascivious moll)--and a penchant for vulgarity and the exploitation of women in general--lessens the overall impact of the tale. The art direction, the score (from Ennio Morricone), the cinematography (by Tonino Delli Colli) and Leone's rhythm are each florid and outstanding in their individual respects, while the performances by Robert De Niro and James Woods (and, in a smaller dimension, Joe Pesci) are dynamic. **1/2 from ****"
"krn-68304","10","3","7","30 June 2016"," Take a bow, Leone.
","One can simple say that Once upon a time in America is director Serigo Leone's masterpiece. The Italian director most famous for his curry westerns was offered to direct The godfather which he rejected. Hence came to be this film, as Leone's version of a crime movie, and oh boy it sure does not disappoint! The story follows the protagonist Noodles(Robert De Niro) and his friends through the years, making money through petty crimes until his old age. This movie is apt in exploring friendship, love, betrayal, with so much subtlety and it shows that the movie maker has genuine care for each character. Every character in the movie has its own flaws and the actors portray it masterfully. Robert De Niro gives a masterful performance by being subtle and avoids his usual Deniro mannerisms that we are used to. Through the last half of the movie we can see the regret through his eyes, conveyed so beautifully. Observe his expression in the scene where Deborah leaves and you'll know. James Woods is great in the role of Max and does steal some scenes, especially the one scene with his new chair. The cinematography off this film is top notch. The close ups of the actors look like beautiful portraits and the wide shots are just as beautiful. The score by Maestro Ennio Morricone is haunting, giving a feeling of nostalgia in important scenes.""Deborah's Theme"" is one of my favorite themes of all time and so beautifully used by Leone in this picture. Many people are turned off by the run time of this movie which is almost four hours and complain its slow etc. Well, i request those who are planning to watch this movie to be patient and concentrate and i assure you, it will be rewarding. This movie was Leone's last before his death and it was butchered by the producers- the original being cut by almost 2 hours leading to a mixed reaction by American audiences. Hence i recommend to watch only the 4 hour version and ignore the other version of this movie. Cinephiles, do not miss this one"
"jimbo-53-186511","9","3","7","28 April 2013"," An epic film consisting of love, greed and betrayal
","This is one of those films that is probably hard to sum up in one viewing as there is so much to take in throughout the film. This is not a criticism as I thoroughly enjoyed Once Upon a Time in America and thought that it was an emotional and beautiful film.<br/><br/>The film begins 35 years in the past with the mob searching for Noodles (another great De Niro performance - his younger self was portrayed by Scott Schutzman Tiler). Noodles ends up going on the run from the mob and returns 35 years later and goes to see his childhood friend Moe (Larry Rapp) about a letter he has received. It is a warning telling him (from an anonymous source) that they know where he has been hiding and to get ready, but Noodles doesn't know who it is from and must look back into his past and try and find out who is out to get him. <br/><br/>The film begins with Noodles as a young boy and shows his early friendship with 'Cockeye' 'Patsy' 'Max' and 'Dominic'. The story is told in a similar way to Goodfellas (also starring Robert De Niro) in which we see the rise of a criminal organisation in their early years. The boys start off by merely trying to steal from drunk people until they set their sights on bigger and better projects. Things start coming good for the gang when they set a police officer up and blackmail him by telling him that if he turns a blind eye to the crimes they commit that they won't rat on him. This gives the gang a free reign to do what they want and enrages mobster Bugsy (James Russo) and his crew as they now have a rival crew who are also 'above the law' and a feud develops between the 2 gangs. Their true rise to power comes when they sell their idea of using bags of salt to initially weigh down illegal shipments to conceal from the coastguard and once the salt dissolves the shipments rise to the surface (with the aid of a ball). This earns Noodles and the gang a substantial amount of money from corrupt business men.<br/><br/>Noodles also has a love interest in the form of Moe's sister Deborah (played by a very young Jennifer Connelly). The relationship is always awkward between Noodles and Deborah, but I think this is partly to do with Noodles insecurities - he is not very good at forming relationships with women and this is highlighted by a couple of other scenes in the film. He tends to just view women as 'tools for his pleasure' and as such never really forms a 'proper relationship' with any of the women he comes across in life.<br/><br/>One thing that is fantastic in this film is 'the score'. The music in this film was fantastic and truth be told I could have sat there and just listened to the music and that would have made me pleased, but coupled with an excellent film it's just wonderful. <br/><br/>Joe Pesci and Burt Young also star as Frankie Manoldi (a mob boss who gets Noodles and his crew to pull off a job for him in Detroit) and Joe (his assistant). Although they are credited as being near the top of the cast list they are both only featured in very small roles which is a shame as they are both excellent actors - Pesci in particular.<br/><br/>The film covers so many other aspects such as 'Greed' and 'Betrayal' but I don't want to say anymore as I don't want to spoil the film, but one thing I will say to viewers is not to be put off by the length of the film. Although it is nearly 4 hours long, the film never drags and every single scene was relevant. This film also benefits from a few comedic moments to help provide a bit of light relief in between dramatic scenes which I always feel helps to raise a film's score in my mind. OUATIA is definitely a film I would recommend and I will definitely watch it again as I think it is one of those films that you will get more from it following a second viewing."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","7","11 December 2012"," A Tale In America
","Leone is one of the few 'multilayered' directors who really understand their craft. His films are usually both story driven and character driven. They have a larger than life look but at the same time they're also very subtle. Leone especially succeeds in subtly building tension. His films are also atmospheric creating a distinct feel of mystery, darkness and an impending doom and at the same time he steers clear of melodrama.<br/><br/>'Once Upon a Time in America' is also one such film except that this one is more disturbing and emotionally engaging than most of his other works. How a man ends up raping the love of his life, how a friendship that emerged in childhood is permanently destroyed by greed and betrayal, how guilt can eat a person up...all of these themes are explored in an intriguing story.<br/><br/>The film is also visually fascinating. The topnotch cinematography by Delli Colli, Morricone's wonderful score and Baragli's solid editing and the work of the lighting team are first rate. The work of the art department is also very precise and detailed as they successfully capture the time and smoothly display the difference between each time period. Lastly, the performances are of top quality. De Niro, Woods, Williams and McGovern are excellent. The child actors deserve special mention and the supporting cast is great too."

"Artimidor","10","3","7","27 May 2012"," Once upon a time there was Sergio Leone
","Sergio Leone's life-long struggle to make the perfect picture would eventually culminate in a crime fairy-tale on Jewish mobsters, aptly titled ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984). And it would hold its ground despite heavy competition of Coppola's well received ""Godfather"" films and the critically acclaimed Scorsese's gangster epics. Made 13 years after his previous picture, Leone's interlude as a producer didn't take away his passion to get the ""America"" project that was in the pipeline finally going. Eventually it bore fruit and would also turn out to be his ultimate one, and maybe his best. In it the former master of spaghetti westerns takes the time to tell a multifaceted story and crams several whole gangster lives into a nearly four hour long epic, still complaining about essential 45 minutes that he was forced to cut. Well, that's Leone for you...<br/><br/>At any rate the result is an operatic classic based on the quasi-autobiography of a gangster turned informant, packed with period details of the 1910s, 30s and 60s. It's a nostalgic trip through half a century with time as the key player that washes over the viewer like a mesmerizing, beautiful dream in an opium den, however at the same time feels like a violent nightmare commenting on themes of past vs. present, memory vs. dream, love vs. desire and above all betrayal vs. friendship. Add to the extensive script that was honed for years an array of beautifully photographed scenes, breathtaking Technicolor cinematography and a truly numinous score, and you've got yourself a masterpiece. For it all is married with such a tremendous amount of meticulousness for details that one can't help but get lost in the gangster world of Lower East Side of Manhattan. Aside from Leone's superb visuals, the accompanying music that links times and suggests themes needs special mention as it single-handedly raises the aesthetic level of the whole production by another notch. Created by Ennio Morricone, the famous memories evoking melancholic pan pipes not only fit the film's emotional ride through passing time, but also help to transcend it.<br/><br/>The flashback story, with bits and pieces falling into place like in a jigsaw puzzle, is what makes the films so overwhelming, so emotionally intense. This time around a Leone picture however is not so much about landscape and close-ups, but about characters and their environment, the area they live in and their history. De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello let it all come alive. And at the side of the young Jennifer Connelly the 13 year old unknown Scott Schutzman Tiler plays the young version of the protagonist Noodles and nearly steals the older one's thunder, which is no other than De Niro. On the one hand the street urchin's lightheartedness shines in the character's youth while the veteran actor immerses himself so completely in the aging gangster that the weight of his past becomes almost palpable.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone not only made Henry Grey - the man on which the story is loosely based - a larger-than-life monument, but also himself as a grand narrator of adult fairy-tales. Actually, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is two movies in one, and the overarching flashback structure makes it an unforgettable experience. All that of course was butchered on US release that sank the picture - even more reason to re-discover it as it was intended to be seen, in all its nostalgic glory."

It was and still is one of the greatest movies ever made. The four hour one is the only one approved by Mr. Leone. There is talk of a 41/2 hour version which Leone arranged early on that may still see the light of day. The six-hour version will never be seen, nor will the eight hour version!

Although non-linear these make sense and are beautifully shot and performed by a cast uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>There are many troubling (to me) aspects of this film including sexual scenes involving minors, rape and absolutely savage violence. All of this appears convincing in terms of the narrative and not cheap exploitation. This film is seductive because beautiful romantic scenes are interspersed with shocking acts.<br/><br/>The 4 hours of this film passed very quickly, a surprise since as I say, I almost switched off after 10 minutes."
"Eternality","10","3","7","31 July 2010"," Once Upon A Time In America is a massive film; it is a landmark of its time and a colossal achievement rarely equaled.
","On the cover of the video for Once Upon A Time In America is a sepia-toned picture of a gang of five in trench coats and hats strolling past the Manhattan Bridge. The smallest of the quintet appears to do a dance backwards as if imitating Chaplin. This nostalgic shot eventually leads to one of the most unforgettable sequences ever captured in American film - a stunning mix of strong visuals and powerful music.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone, whose film masterpiece remains to be Once Upon A Time In The West (1968), has embarked on perhaps the most ambitious motion picture about organized crime since Francis Ford Coppola's two-part mafia drama The Godfather in the early 70s, putting together an original cut that runs nearly four hours, transporting viewers back to nearly fifty years of American underworld history.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking aspect of Leone's crime epic (apart from its extraordinary length) is Ennio Morricone's legendary score. Truth be told, it is one of the greatest film scores never to be nominated for an Oscar (due to a late submission caused by a clerical error). The beauty of Morricone's score is largely confined to the first half of the film where it is played more often and has its most resonance because it perfectly evocates the nostalgia of early 20th century America.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America stars Robert De Niro (Noodles) and James Woods (Max) in the film's two lead roles, and is accompanied by an extensive cast of young and old including a 12-year-old Jennifer Connelly, Joe Pesci, Tuesday Weld, and Elizabeth McGovern. The acting is consistent throughout; every role is given time to develop. This is especially so for roles which have two different actors playing them in two different timelines. Of course, the best performance comes unsurprisingly from De Niro, whose powerhouse display of male chauvinism and uncompromising personality does no harm in affecting his reputation as one of the world's most proficient actors.<br/><br/>The bloody violence is reminiscent of The Godfather but Leone's film is harder to watch because there are two graphic depictions of rape shown. Although Once Upon A Time In America tends to devalue and victimize women by portraying them as objects of sexual and verbal abuse, the film's strength lies in Leone's ability to build a story around core values of friendship, loyalty, and brotherhood amongst men.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America does not move in a linear fashion. It is a series of inter-cutting character development flashbacks and flash forwards edited with excellence and assembled with coherence to a main narrative that reveals few things. Its puzzling ending is shrouded with mystery and till today remains the most talked about part of the film. Each character is distinctive and developed with immense depth, yet after four hours, we still know so little about them. Yet it is this enigmatic quality that these characters emanate that makes Leone's film such a satisfying watch.<br/><br/>Coppola romanticized organized crime with The Godfather while Martin Scorsese's take with Goodfellas was explosively visceral. Sergio Leone, on the other hand, has opted for nostalgia. Once Upon A Time In America is a massive film; it is a landmark of its time and a colossal achievement rarely equaled. To see this film is ""to be swept away by the assurance and vitality of a great director making his final statement in a medium he adored"" (Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times).

"CalvinValjean","10","3","7","3 January 2010"," My Favorite Film of All Time
","The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was just okay. The childhood sequences were great, but the story was long, and I guess I felt it lost its way as it went on.<br/><br/>A year passed before I saw it again. I had only meant to watch a little bit, and soon found myself sucked into watching the whole thing again. Something just clicked that second time, and the first 40 minutes in particular held a lot more weight. That is why I feel this film, more than any other, NEEDS to be seen multiple times to be understood.<br/><br/>This movie is not really about gangsters, or prohibition, or unions. This is all the window-dressing. This movie is about three characters: Noodles, Max, and Deborah. Or rather, it is about one man's life, the two people he loves, and the choices he makes. It is one of the few films that really seems to capture an entire life on screen. And, while this may sound clichÃ©d, it's a story of the American dream, of wasted potential, of the mistakes we make in our lives, of what it is to be an old man. It tells an interesting story in its flashbacks, but then wraps a ""modern-day"" story around it that is built on its own mystery. Indeed, the movie is one big puzzle; it's probably the best example of flashback structure ever done on film. Yes, even better than Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>The movie has some flaws, mostly because it was conceived on such a vast scale. As you watch it, you definitely get the sense some scenes are missing, and that some characters (Patsy, Cockeye, and Eve, in particular) feel underdeveloped. However, the movie is able to get away with this because what it DOES offer is so strong, and Robert DeNiro's performance, so unstated, is so good. Despite its long run-time, it's actually a very tight story; nearly every scene is about Noodles, and that's why it is so intimate a portrait.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, you also have excellent art direction, costumes, and Ennio Morricone's best score. ""Deborah's Theme"" is one of the finest pieces ever composed. Also, no one ever mentions the cinematography, which is so rich, particularly in the childhood scenes.<br/><br/>It's interesting that I've never been a fan of Sergio Leone's westerns. Here is a film so different from most of his main body of work, not only in physical setting, but in structure and tone. Once Upon a Time In America, along with Fanny and Alexander, is one of the few films that truly makes me think of a novel in film form."
"khanbaliq2","10","3","7","11 December 2009"," This is Leone's gangster film to end all gangster films, a work of tremendous intellectual depth and emotional range.
","It is, finally a heart-breaking story of mutual need. By matching that need with his own need to come to terms with his own cultural memories, director Sergio Leone has made his most oneiric and extraordinary film. The story chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, greed, betrayal, loss, violence, the passage of time, broken relationships, and the appearance of mobsters in American society.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America is a vast, sprawling, violent crime saga with a neat circularity about its rags-to-riches-to-rags narrative. It is operatic in style, often brutal in tone, nostalgic in mood and mesmerising to watch. A stunning, towering achievement, not afraid to stray into lurid territory when the plot demands it, that taps into audiences' guilty fascination with dangerous, sociopathic characters. James Woods and Robert De Niro could hardly be improved upon, and Ennio Morricone's score is exquisitely fitting. The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival in April and, according to Howard Hughes' book Crimewave: A Film-goer's Guide to Great Crime Movies, received a ""15 minute standing ovation""."

","Once Upon A Time In America is arguably the greatest gang movie ever. The Acting by De Niro & James Woods was spectacular, how the movie never academy award nominations i'll never know. Robert De Niro steals the show, i mean really, he's one of the greatest actors of all time. The Kids who acted in this were just as good as everybody else. The movie was great because it was about lies, love, & betrayal. The thing that made the movie great is when De Niro is having flashbacks throughout the whole movie. <br/><br/>The whole movie was great but i only had one problem with one scene, when Elizabeth McGovern tells De Niro she will leave for Hollywood, & of course he harassed her in the backseat but the whole movie was great. Especially the ending with James Woods when he goes in to the truck, the he went through that slicer because he was upset that all the pain he cause De Niro over 35 years, so he figured why have De Niro kill him & he said "" no."" That was a great set-up, making u think James Woods was dead when the body's face was burned off. This movie should have been nominated for many academy awards & win Best Picture, a phenomenal plan & simple."
"garydiamond","10","3","7","10 July 2007"," Extraordinary masterpiece
","I often go into the viewing of a long film thinking that my patience may not hold out for long enough to see the creative scope and vision in full, that I might forget how the story began. However, having recently seen two movies of similar length - Das Boot and Seven Samurai - both of which I enjoyed, I was willing to put the effort in to see if this critic's favourite could justify it's seemingly endless supply of accolades. The short answer is, it does.<br/><br/>It all starts so inauspiciously. We see Noodles (De Niro at the pinnacle of his abilities) a broken, thoughtful man retreading his steps through the town he grew up in. At this start point we have no frame of reference with which to judge this man, no way of telling what his motivations are. Through longer and longer flashbacks we are able to piece together all the moments that define his life, and through those, get a feel for the man, to follow his triumphs and tribulations.<br/><br/>As we do so, everything feels smooth and well considered in all aspects of the picture. The pacing is relaxed but never unnecessarily so, and when it does suddenly jolt and change it still feels right, never forced and contrived. We see the way people change and grow in the same way the city around them does. Simple, honest motivations of childhood wealth are traded for conniving betrayals as Noodles and his mobsters reach adulthood. Through the excellent dialogue and subtle expressions and body language of the actors, we are able to see how Noodles and his friends make difficult, character-defining decisions that are often advantageous but always come at cost. The character development from children to successful adults through to the melancholy situation of later years, complete with the many strings attached, is entirely believable.<br/><br/>Leone has created a picture so compelling, so consistent, so beautiful and at times so very ugly, that it becomes it's own world. It mirrors aspects of our own life so perfectly that the three and a half hour length is of no consequence. It simply had to be that long in order for the rich fabric of the story to take hold effectively - so that the events of the first forty five minutes can be returned to with what we have learnt enabling us to make sense of it all.<br/><br/>An extraordinary masterpiece through and through, and perhaps the only film I'll ever give top marks to. 10/10"

He is a superb actor (my favourite) who maintains the emotion behind his character 'Noodles'. He manages to portray not only a young/middle aged man but an extremely convincing old man. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing and simply adds to the emotional effects. It combines an extremely emotional musical score including 'Deborah's theme' and the tune played by Cock-eye , with The Beatles 'Yesterday'. <br/><br/>Please watch this film, only then will you truly understand the greatness of this movie!"
"simonk_h","10","3","7","13 July 2006"," Better than The Godfather
","I can't watch the Godfather. It's so boring! Both these films are slow but there is a difference, which I think I've figured out. Once Upon a Time in America is slow because it has an attitude. This attitude needs to play itself out over each scene. Example: Noodles returns to gang headquarters and stirs his coffee for two minutes. The gang know that something has gone wrong between him and Deborah and want him to discuss it. Noodles does not want to discuss it and so stirs his coffee until someone talks about something else. The Godfather is slow because nothing happens. Example: The scenes in the hospital with Michael and Don Vito. Nothing is going on. It's no fun to watch. It's not entertaining. Still, come to think of it, Once Upon a Time in America is not exactly entertaining as such. Those rape scenes are really horrible and I, personally, can't watch them. However, one can appreciate how great a film it is and what an achievement in story-telling. Leone does not attempt to make these men seem sympathetic because they are bad men. And though it seems simplistic to say it; bad men do bad things. What can you do? That is just one facet of the strength of the movie, though. The child actors are a revelation. The kid who plays Dominic is brilliant, why we never saw more of him and less of Macauly Culkin is anybody's guess. The other thing is that they look just like young versions of the older actors. The final word, however, must go to Robert de Niro and James Woods. James Woods has rarely been better. He's come close, no doubt about that but never bettered. De Niro is on excellent form with a marvellously restrained performance. Sometimes you have to have a protagonist who is not an extrovert and this is just that character. Noodles, as portrayed by De Niro, is unhappy with his lot for several reasons and let's people know about subtley. The best Leone film? Difficult to say. They're all great films so this would definitely rank as one of the best and certainly deserves more praise than it gets, even now, in the film world."

","I decided instead of returning it unwatched, I would actually sit through the 229 minute Director's Cut of Once Upon a Time in America. It has DeNiro and Leone, so it's gotta be really good right? Right?<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>Like, it's not a horrible movie by any counts, but it's just way too long. Like some movies benefit from being longer, fleshing everything out, and making it great. And some movies just eat up the time, and make it seem to go by fast. <br/><br/>This does neither.<br/><br/>A lot of it is just purely random. Characters pop up, and don't come back. Some show up for a bit, then come back and have zero significance later on (Joe Pesci being key example). And a lot of it is just plain confusing. <br/><br/>People are getting killed for no reason. People are arguing for no reason. Things are grazed over, and not really talked about. Things happen, and aren't explained. <br/><br/>There's random breast rubbings with a gun barrel, random sex sequences, and just random things in general going on. There's even a wild rape scene featuring DeNiro. And after watching it, you're just left saying ""What the hell?"", especially because she openly talks to him later in the movie.<br/><br/>This is a 4 hour movie for Christ sake. You'd expect everything to be tied up by the end.<br/><br/>Now I see why Once Upon a Time in Mexico is so flawed.<br/><br/>But it's not all terrible. The actors are all fairly good, even if I've seen them do better stuff before (yet I still don't look at James Woods the same, ever since Videodrome). Leone's direction is great, having the trademarks of a usual Leone film (little dialog, long drawn out shots), but more focus on story as opposed to style (so sadly, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, this movie is not). And Ennio Morricone's score is just perfect.<br/><br/>All in all, it's worth watching, if just for once. By no means is it really Leone's masterpiece as I have heard, but it's worth a look anyway. I'm just really disappointed because of the fact that it just drags for long periods of time, and isn't as stylish as I would have thought.<br/><br/>8/10."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","3","7","9 August 2004"," Excellent gangster film from a great film-maker
","Sergio Leone is truly a magnificent director; I hadn't realized the magnitude of his talent and abilities until I saw this great film. The film deals with a group of friends, who meet each other and start a partnership as children. They start out as criminals, and end up as criminals. The story is excellent, and the way it is told is great, and almost unique. The non-linear time-line in the film has been copied since this film was made, by other, mostly lesser talented, film-makers, such as Quentin Tarantino. I liked the way the first 30 minutes moved along, between present and immediate past, and then went all the way back to the very beginning of the story. The plot is excellent. The way it unfolds is truly spectacular, and while some might say that it is cheapened by the fact that we know pretty much how it'll end from the beginning, I really think it added to the greatness of the film and story. The plot also moves along at a great pace, it's never boring, despite the fact that the film is over three hours long, and it's not really an action film. I would say that it has it's share of action and suspense, though. There were sequences that rival action films that are considered as some of the best in newer times. There was at least three sequences were the suspense was nerve-wrecking, and the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. The special effects were amazingly well-done, much better than most of the same time period. I'd have to say that effects-wise, it's probably the best movie of the 80's. The acting is spectacular. Even the child actors were amazing; it was interesting to see Jennifer Connely, who's since become a star herself, play a role at such a young age, and playing it so well. The performances of the child actors are some of the best that I've ever seen in any movie, children or adults. All of the main characters, as well as most of the supporting characters were well-acted. The characters are well-written, credible, and rarely ever seemed out-of-character. The way gangster methods is portrayed is realistic and authentic, as is some of the plot. I would have to say that this film actually almost rivals The Godfather Part I as the best gangster film ever made. The only thing that bothered me was the plot twist at the end; it really seemed wrong and unlikely to me, as well as my father, who's reading a lot about the mafia. We both agreed that it seemed weird and out of character. That one thing marred the ending for me, and brought this film down from a perfect score. Apart from the ending, the final plot twist, this film is great. I recommend this to fans of Sergio Leone, gangster films, and just great films in general. Fans of any of the actors might also find it interesting. Don't be thrown off by the long runtime; it's worth every minute, up to the end(the last 15 minutes bothered me, but nothing else). 9/10"

Sergio Leone has created a completely authentic visual representation of a time that has long since past. The film has tremendous acting courtesy of, Robert De Niro, James Woods, Tuesday Weld, Elizabeth McGovern, and Jennifer Connelly (who would go on to win the best actress oscar for 2001's ""A beautiful mind."") Even the smaller roles were equally impressive. To name a few: Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, and the most entertaining, Danny Aiello. The script leaves no stone unturned in the tragic lives of the characters. The directing is as beautiful as Ennio Morricone's unforgettable and mesmerizing score. This movie may be a challenge for those who have difficulty sitting through long films. ""Once upon a time in America"" clocks at 3 hours & 47 minutes. This is the long version. Steer clear of the horiffic shorter version. Despite the films length, this film does not drag at all. As there is never a dull moment.

","This is not another film, this is simply a jewel very well done by its director Sergio Leone. The sequences go forth and back each time giving an idea of the lives of several boys-hooligans, who later became real gangsters. The scenarios were right ones at each time starting from early 1900 and ending at 70s of the 20th century. One must acknowledge that each detail was really taken into account for making such a film and that acting of De Niro, James Woods and several others was the best. This time De Niro is a cool-blood gangster while Woods shows himself with more temperament. De Niro also shows a kind of ethics in his behavior with regards to his colleagues, being a teenager he is the one able to kill another gangster or a policeman with a knife to revenge the murder of of his youngest colleagues and to go to jail for long time; when his best friend Max wants to accomplish a very risky robbery he calls the police to prevent him doing this non sense act, but his colleagues were not so friendly as he was, they were wolves in their business, something that Noodles (De Niro) understood late in his life.

"saveespy","10","3","7","9 May 2000"," Extraordinary.
","People ask me why I love cinema as much as I do. I usually reel off a list of titles and say ""Just watch this film"". ""Once Upon A Time In America"" is such a film. Sergio Leone was an absolute master of cinema and unfortunately, this turned out to be his swansong. And what a swansong it is. I can never get sick of watching this film. Without a doubt, this would be in my personal top five movies of all time. Luckily in Australia, we never encountered the two hour version. That would have been a fate worse than death. Some films, like ""Gone With The Wind"", use this length merely to show off. Everything in ""Once Upon A Time In America"" counts. Even the slightest line or gesture, like the running discussion between Max and Noodles about swimming. This is a film that lets its characters breathe rather than follow a set pattern. More than once, this film goes totally against what one expects it to do.<br/><br/>Personally, I found the whole question of truth of dream that permeates the film, particularly in the 1960's sequences, one of the most compelling aspects of the entire film. I still have'nt decided where I stand as far as the ambiguity the film displays in this respect. The amazing way that aspects of these sequences, such as where Noodles comes face to face with Deborah's son, also named David like Noodles, are plausible, but at the same time exaggerated. For a director to even attempt to combine such conflicting emotions, let alone make it work as well as Leone does without detracting from the story, is truly remarkable. This is a gangster film that goes where few others do. ""Once Upon A Time In America"" is a film that relies on charcter and story, rather than mere visual 'tricks' or shock tactics. However, it can be extremely brutal when necessary. This Gemini-like change in mood can be seen as a mirror image reflection of Max, particularly as the story progresses.<br/><br/>I could talk about this film forever. I'll conclude by saying that you can not call yourself an afficionado of cinema unless you've seen ""Once Upon A Time In America"". The words 'modern classic' don't even come close to describing the sheer unforgettable beauty of this tour de force. Cinema is a little bit poorer without the presence of Sergio Leone."

Great filming, great actors, great locations, great story, and some mystery...James Woods acted like never before of ever after and De Niro was amazing. And the ""flash-back/non flash-back"" screenplay is something never seen before, only Leone could have done that.<br/><br/>Since then, I have watched this movie something like 30 times, and never get bored of it. I was amazed to learn that in the States, the movie was cut by half 2 hours instead of 4. WHY?<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope to be able to see the director's cut soon.

Don't you get that this is pumping the hundredth lie in your simple-minded heads? This whole masquerade is only intent to suggest that there has always been the violence and lust we're used to, and thus lull us asleep: you needn't worry, all this isn't abnormal because people always were like that. Well, they were not. It's absolutely untrue and you're fooled when you believe that nonsense. The degeneration on this scale springs mainly from the seventies and has developed to a mode of complicity among film directors. Do not believe it; our parents and (great-)grandparents still had the decency the majority of us lack today. Church membership was common, and people wouldn't think of all that filth we display and welter in at present. We don't even recognize anymore how divergent it is and think it's the standard way of living.

","It's a film that is an epic gangster and friendship story all in one. Sergio interweaves timelines with the finesse of a master and all the acting is superb.<br/><br/>The film starts in earnest with the cast as children. The friendship built up at the start makes the developments throughout the film that come all the more heartbreaking. It also shows both a real and gritty side to New York and the adolescents themselves. These are children from effectively the ghetto and it doesn't hold back on showing that.<br/><br/>What's also brilliantly done is the rivalry between the two leads Deniro and Woods, but also the great friendship and love each of them has for each other.<br/><br/>This film though is also a gangster film and what's so well done here is it shows the whole spectrum of a gangster's life. So you see the consequences of their choices which you rarely see in one film.<br/><br/>Then there's the actors themselves. This us one of Deniro's best films as noodles is a very flawed and human character. He is both a monster and relatable in the same breath.<br/><br/>James Woods is also exceptional. He is the best friend and protagonist all in the same breath. Theirs very much a sibling vibe to his and Deniro's relationship.<br/><br/>Then there's McGovern who is the escape for and potential downfall of Deniro's character all at once.<br/><br/>The child versions of all these characters are also brilliant especially the young Jennifer Connelly.<br/><br/>The final main character is the music.

","This movie is not on par with The Godfather part 1 and 2. Nor is it as good as Goodfellas. I find that Leone's flawed masterpiece is to self indulged with it's epic status to be thought of in the same way as those three movies. Which is not to say it's bad - lets just say it has to settle for 4th place.<br/><br/>The story is a sprawling one, not to dissimilar to The Godfather part 2, where we see the account of Noodles, a hood in Prohibition New York. It is relatively simple to follow, the story flicking from child hood gangsters, to the sadness of old age, looking back on being young. Memories come flooding back to the characters, and the effect is astonishing. Leone creates layers slowly as the film goes on to make a deep insight into Noodles life. Much like the slow build up of Once Upon a Time In the West - where we learn why Charles Bronson was brooding for so long - the same effect is done here, but in a more subtle manner.<br/><br/>The movie is violent. Not like the Goodfellas violence, or the stylised killing of the Godfather, instead this film seems more immoral and brutal. Children having sex on the rooftops of New York, corrupt cops, rape scenes, shootings (the one through the eye being a good one) - this film really pushes it, but never gets too violent. Just play time for gangster film buffs! Running in at nearly 5 hours long, the film is surprisingly easy to watch - the story just flows by because it's told so well. The story does go off at a tangent sometimes, telling little tales of the kids when they were gangsters - sometimes mere padding for this ""epic"" tale. But damn it, is this the saddest gangster film I've seen! The acting is superb. De Niro is flawless as Noodles - his eyes carry with them the memories of old - it really adds great depth and ambiguity to the film. James Woods is charismatic as Max, being totally believable and at the same time, totally despicable (as a character!). The women are all on great form too, McGovern and Weld giving layered performances. The kids in the movie coped well with the material, but some of the lines they deliver were terrible - but hey, they're just kids, they kid a fantastic job otherwise! <br/><br/>This is so much more different than the other gangster films. It is much more of a sad film, concerned with nostalgia and the sadness of remembering times past. The violence is there, but is subdued by the epic story and sadness conveyed. Goodfellas and Godfather still stand supreme, but this movie is really unique.<br/><br/>A flawed masterpiece."

The characters in the film never really strike me as being Jewish. If you watch the Godfather, you notice how often Italian is spoke, especially in the flashback in Godfather II. Jews in New York at the time of this film would either speak only Yiddish or, more likely, a mixture of Yiddish and English. There are only a couple of lines in Yiddish in the film and they are simple expressions, not conversation The fact that none of the actors were Jewish would make that difficult I know, but it does take away from the authenticity of the film somewhat.

","Everything about this movie would point to a masterpiece: the infamous Leone/Morricone combination, an impressive cast a very colorful setting and even a grant story. However, this movie is a failure in quite a few ways. I am explicitly referring to the extend version here.<br/><br/>When you have a movie of around four hours you have to give the viewer a character he can clinch to with some amount of sympathy. Noodles was supposed to be this character but he is incapable of doing so because of some of his actions he committed in the movie. Yet there is a bit of a heroic air about him which makes it even more confusing for the viewer.<br/><br/>Another major shortcoming is that the story presented is obviously stretched to fill four hours. There are passages which bring the flow of the story to a halt. This in itself can be an interesting stylistic means and it certainly is rather typical for Leone. It worked splendidly in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Once upon a time in the west"" but failed here. I therefore assume that the 140min version might suffer less from these problems.<br/><br/>* SPOILERS AHEAD *<br/><br/>The funny thing is that - despite its runtime - the movie doesn't make other important aspects of the film clear enough. The fact that Maximilian slipped into Noodles' life after his faked death isn't sufficiently explained. Moreover, and this is a cardinal sin, the film utilizes the dead-man-revival trick that is often used in mediocre films to fill some holes in the plot. This wouldn't be necessary since in essence the plot is fine and wouldn't need such mending.<br/><br/>There are minor other things why this movie is not as good as it should be. The amount of violence presented in this movie can put off the viewer. It wouldn't have been difficult to present the violence (which is, afterall, part of the story so that's not the point) in a more subtle and less explicit way. With respect to this, some of the violence seems utterly misplaced: Noodles' raping of Deborah which comes as a nasty surprise to the viewer. This scene would be ok if some reflection on this followed later in the film. But it doesn't. Even when Deborah and Noodle meet again 35 years later, the silence between them seems to be targeted at a different issue.<br/><br/>And then there is the ending between Noodles and Maximilian. It isn't badly done, but it could have been done better. Max doesn't give any explanation for his faked death. Noodles reaction however makes sense and is convincing.<br/><br/>* SPOILERS DONE *<br/><br/>Eventually, the soundtrack is a little tame by Morricone-standards (although this is probably a tribute to the fact that this movie really tells the story as though it was a melodrama).<br/><br/>I'd give this one 7 out of 10. It is a grant movie, no doubt, but it is also a disappointment in many respects."

In fact, the film is about those characters, much more than it is about the events of their lives.  ""Character development"" is the name of the game, eh.<br/><br/>
I could gush like an internet geek gushing on a website about some little bit of American pop sub-culture about this flick for like, at least another couple sentences but i think instead i'll just be all like, ""dude, go buy this movie and then sit yer ass down and watch it"" ya know what i'm sayin"

","I saw this film about five times now. And it is always a great pleasure. I recommend it every time and nearly everywhere, because that movie is outstanding. I know, it is not easy to follow the plot, because there are a lot of timeline´s to come clear with, but it is worth it. I like movies in which there are a lot of ideas (story and screenplay) guiding you to a final climax at the end of it all. In OUATIA you are told the story´s of a bunch of kids, becoming the mob. It is entertaining the whole time (yes, a little bit slow sometimes,okay) and it leads to the point where it´s obvious that all the lives are just wasted. No friendship and no love does exist in the life of these guys. The way that the movie tells you that, makes me love it. Yes, Noodles is only a character, and the character is a killer, smuggler and whatever, but beholding the wasted life of this man really makes sad! The film creates emotions, and that´s what movies and music are made for in my opinion. If you´d ask me - I would watch it! (Please excuse my bad knowledge of the english language)"

","Sergio Leone at his best. I first watched this movie in Italy where - as I later found out - only the full length version was proposed to the public.<br/><br/>The shorter version in English (~2 hours) which was proposed in the U.S. is much worse than the original movie, and I would stay away from it. It ruins way too many things in the original work, and would probably be a delusion for even the most loyal Leone fans."
"jorgetimoteo","Null","2","4","18 April 2000"," Of all the movies I have seen, I like this the best.
","For me, this is as close as anyone as ever come to make the perfect movie. It is sheer poetry in motion. Sergio Leone, the man who revolutionized the western genre with the Clint Eastwood trilogy, now gives us an absolute masterpiece. This movie features an Italian all-star trio (Leone-deNiro-Morricone) who have really excelled themselves in this one. The story tells us of young Noodles and his three friends, Maxie, Patsie, and Cockeye, who soon realize they have got to stick together, for protection as well as profit. This bond they formed as boys was to them as sacred as blood, and would affect each of them profoundly, as long as any of them lived. One of the things that struck me first about this movie was its music. Ennio Morricone has created a masterpiece inside another one. All of the tunes, but especially Cockeye's song, the one with the pan flute, are absolutely fabulous. It enthralls us from the first minute, and we are still whistling it long after the movie has ended. The actors and actresses are brilliant. The fact that the movie failed to reap a handful (or two) of Academy Awards really makes us shun such dubious criteria. I feel it was as big an injustice as Kafka never winning the literary Nobel prize. I have praised this movie as much as I could muster the words, and yet I know I have fallen short of its greatness. If you have not watched this movie yet, please do so. For your own benefit. If you have watched it already, then I reckon you will agree with me that this movie is just as good as they get. Bravo!"
"vince-41","9","2","4","6 December 1999"," Best film of the 80s
","If this film wasn't so long, it wouldn't be watchable. Simple story about love, death, betrayal, and redemption, has unmistakeable 70s feel, which was very rare in terrible years of 1980s for a film. Leone gives us something script doesn't: he makes it so slow paced, even simple scenes have some hidden meaning in them, we are allowed to  meditate over characters' routine actions, which makes the most trivial details unusual and enigmatic. The film is nostalgic by the time that never existed. Even if it didn't show anything we haven't seen before, and probably events in the movie couldn't inspire philosophical interpretation, thanks to Leone, after watching ""Once Upon a Time in America"" we have a feeling that we just witnessed something huge and wonderful, even though we are not sure what exactly."
"OldTimer-6","10","2","4","18 September 1999"," A brilliant film that demands several viewings.
","First of all, avoid the shortened version like the proverbial plague. The only one a serious moviegoer should invest his time watching is the full length film, which clocks in at 227 minutes.<br/><br/>Secondly, to attempt to summarize this film would be to do it an injustice. No matter how well intentioned, there is no way a capsule review could begin to properly illustrate how powerful, moving and ultimately surprising this movie really is. Robert de Niro's ""Noodles"" is quietly understated...yet, it is his story that we follow from start to finish. A truly outstanding performance from a master of the genre.<br/><br/>James Woods gives his character, Max, his usual intensity. Beyond this, he also fleshes out the individual so we feel we know him at many different levels. Still, the question ""do we REALLY know Max?"" constantly confronts the viewer throughout the film. His quick shifts from shrewd wisdom to angry confrontation rings true. The end result is that the story of these two criminal friends, covering the years from youth to old age, is believable every step of the way.<br/><br/>The other cast members are all up to the task. Far too many to name individually, suffice it to say that ""the gang"" and the adversaries are equally outstanding. Director Sergio Leone, who had already created several masterpieces (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly; A Fistful of Dollars; Once Upon a Time in the West) surpasses them all (in my opinion) with this opus.<br/><br/>Hint: Approximately the first half hour of the long version (again...do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money on the short one) makes no apparent sense. Or so it would seem, as we time-hop back and forth from era to era. DO NOT GIVE UP! When Noodles takes a look through a hole in the wall at a dancing girl, you can be assured that the story is finally beginning to coalesce. Everything you have seen prior to that is foreshadowing, and will make complete sense by the time you've reached the conclusion."

","If you have 4 hours to watch a great movie or set of movies, Alien/Aliens would be good, Godfather/Godfather II would be better, but Once Upon a Time in America (the original unedited version) would be the best.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece.  DeNiro and Woods lead a great cast and take the viewer on an incredible journey.  MAKE the time to sit and enjoy this classic."
"Paco-39","10","2","4","11 July 1999"," THE DARK SIDE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM
","This movie is really shocking, beggining with ENNIO'S MORRICONE MUSIC, I THINK AND MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WOULD AGREE, that this is the greatest music written for a film ever, pieces like AMAPOLA, that gives the MELANCHOLIC, sad feeling to the movie.<br/><br/>The Sergio Leone's crude epic-drama of a group of friends, that would do everything to get to power, in the 1910's Manhattan.<br/><br/>A history of betrayal, ambition, friendship, poverty, that cast of Hollywood's greatest: De Niro, Wood, Pesci, Burt Young, mixed with Sergio Leone's genius to direct, and make a excellent portrayal of the dark side of the american dream.<br/><br/>A very shocking, strong, powerful film, combined with Morrocone's music, make this film ONE OF THE UN-NOTICED GREAT FILMS OF ALL TIMES, ONLY COMPARED WITH GODFATHER, but the difference that ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is too DARK."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","12 August 2019"," Never really feels like the epic they were maybe going for, but still a pretty convincing movie
","""Once Upon a Time in America"" is of course as the title suggests an American (and Italian) movie from 1984. A bit of a coincidence I watched this now that Quentin Tarantino has a film with a similar title hitting cinemas, but we shall talk about that one later. This one here was the last really big project for director Sergio Leone as the man in charge behind the camera. He also worked on it as a writer when it came to adapting Harry Grey's novel, but this is no surprise because there were really many writers busy here. Again no surprise because the film comes pretty close to the 4-hour mark. Yes it is really long. Again (I kid you not) no surprise because most of Leone's films are very long and it's not the only one to make it past three hours. Still the man today is probably mostly known for his western movies and not really for this one, even if this is probably the film that garnered him the most awards recognition. It did not get in anywhere at the Oscars, but Leone scored his only Golden Globe nomination and Ennio Morricone also got in there for his soundtrack. At the BAFTAs it was even more successful with a win for Morricone and the costume design too. Leone himself scored another director nomination and also a bit surprising to me Tuesday Weld was nominated for her supporting performance. Oh well, away from awards now let us take a look at the film itself. It plays during three different times with many many years between them. Mostly these sequences are one at a piece for a long time and there aren't too many jumps in-between. Still it is not a chronological film at all. The best example is that the childhood segment may be the one that is first dealt with extensively, but we also have scenes from the protagonist's years as an adult and finally as an old man too. Said protagonist is called Noodles and played by Robert De Niro and his character is really in pretty much every scene of this long movie that certainly would also work as a miniseries. Still, the childhood part, obviously it is not De Niro himself who plays the character there. This film is from the year when I was born and De Niro was around the age of 40 when this was made. It is kinda interesting, maybe a bit funny too to see him with aging makeup now 35 years later when he is really as old, probably even older, as his character is in here. But it shows that they did a really good job here. Make-up, costumes, sets are all very convincing and same is true about the acting all around. Leone knew what he was doing that much is safe, even if people do not really think of this film nowadays when talking about him, but that is really probably only because of how defining he was for the italo western genre with his Eastwood collaborations. A film like this one here is one that still would be a worthy additon to anybody's body of work. I must say it felt a bit Scorsese to me at times. There aren't many scenes during which it felt Leone. One maybe was during the childhood parts when the two boys run into the other guy who criminally runs the neighborhood. There is one slow motion scene also accompanied by Morricone's soundtrack intensely that felt really very much like Leone during his western days. As for Morricone, he did a pretty good job here overall for sure. His soundtrack is not as much in your face as it is on other occasions, but he is always there when it counts and otherwise convincingly subtle as he should be considering how much of a master of his craft he is. I'm happy he eventually won an Oscar (fittingly for a Tarantino movie as I mentioned him earlier) and is also still alive, hopefully will be for a few more years.<br/><br/>Okay, now let us take a look at the plot and action. I already said De Niro and his character are always in it, but the supporting characters are all doing a fine job too. James Woods' portrayal here made me really curious about other works from him for sure, especially the final scene between the two was mesmerizing, probably the best the film had to offer and that sure means something as there were many good ones. It's so interesting to see how he tries to break through to Noodles emotionally, even if the hit part did not really make a whole lot of sense to me. But you can make an argument for that too. He constantly increased his impact. Criminally you could even say with the idea of robbing the federal reserve before he could become a tolerated criminal making a career as a politician and now he was about to lose it all with his investigation, so he wants somebody to take care of him taking the easy way out and somewhat dying a martyr. Really egoistic. I liked Noodles' response that they would not have done stuff like that back in the day, never accepted this kind of offer, and also the name how he addresses him. This film really gets considerably better towards the end. The scene with McGovern's character after the stage performance was very very good too. This Deborah character is heartbreaking anyway. She is Noodles' one and only true love, but he can never really get through to her. Her words early on because she will never love him because he is a poor street kid follow him his entire life resulting in this spectacular dinner scene where he clearly wanted to prove to her that she is the one for him, the only one, but again things go well, but not great despite all the efforts he takes. The result then is a really heartbreaking scene that is perhaps the only moment in this movie when you can really see Noodles as an antagonist and despise him, but what he does does not only break her, but also destroy all his chances to ever be with the one he loves if there were any at all (maybe there weren't and he realizes). Definitely the saddest moment of the film, or I should say sequence because of how long it is. You need to be strong to sit through it. Still, even if he commits a horrible crime, in that scene Noodles is also a bit of a victim. His connection with love, romance, sexuality call it whatever you want has been messed up from the start. The promiscuous chubby girl is still somewhat tolerable, but of course the bank employee (and later on Woods' character's wife) is really messed up how she enjoys having sex during this bank robbery, which may have planted a seed in Noodles' mind including the messed-up idea that rape is nothing entirely despicable. It all backfires for him. Love is not meant in this life for him it seems. There is a girl he likes and who also likes him apparently, but it's never a key part of the story and there is no deep elaboration on what happens after she is shot. But I think she liked him, probably even loved him as she asked her killers what they want to do to him and did not wonder what they had in mind doing to her. Still when he leaves New York for good right afterwards heading to Buffalo, it shows that she was somewhat the only reason for him to be there, so it's certainly sad things developed the way they did. There is still a nice framework somehow between the very early scene that has Noodles flee from the barber shop from the guys who want to kill him and the final scene when we see him again there having a much better time actually with a big smile on his lips, but these two scene are also the best example of how the film is not chronological at all. Anyway, I think it was a really good movie. Another scene that really broke my heart was when we see Noodles at the train station with Deborah closing the window on him while everybody is waving to their loved ones. The Deborah character was truly interesting anyway, also looking at the actresses who portrayed her during different stages. Who would have guessed the child actress is going to win an Oscar one day and even be more successful than the grown-up Deborah actress who was already an Oscar nominee at that point. The rest of the cast are interesting too. Joe Pesci sadly only has very little screen time, but still it is always nice to see him next to De Niro like in Goodfellas or Raging Bull, two films in which his parts are much bigger of course and created much more awards recognition too. I talked about some of my favorite moments and scenes and I think I will leave it at that for now. At times this is even a great movie, but among the best (let alone number 1) of the year 1984 it is not I would say. Still certainly a film that felt much shorter than it actually was, which is alays a compliment for this running time and also that I conclude my review by saying there is a good chance I may watch it again at some point. So should you. Thumbs up and positively recommended. Also for the wonderful version of Kate Smith's ""God Bless America"", which goes right on my MP3 player."

","Another glorification of the criminal lowlife aspect of society, and nothing more. Maybe the director wanted to glorify, or maybe he wanted to show the barbaric brutality of mobsters, or maybe he wanted to do both. That's the way this viewer felt, anyway, while watching. There are glorification scenes a'plenty, and then there's the rape scene in the back of the hired car where all beauty and piety and loveliness and pure love and righteousness are maligned in such a way that you really wish the driver of the vehicle puts an end to the perpetrator then and there, let the cards fall where they may with the criminal's syndicate lifelong friends. There are far better mobster films out there, most of them produced during the Noir era of Hollywood because the director's of that era hated crime and what these monkeys were doing to Hollywood and the rest of the world. Bugsy Siegel, who has a small role in this film, in real life tried to be a movie star but was rejected not because of his looks but because of his egregious lifestyle. I mean, 'Murder, Inc.' Really? What a loser. And on top of all that, this alleged ""masterpiece"" is filled with rape, under-aged sexual activity (how did Leone get permissions for these child actors to play such horrid parts?), and elongated scenes that would make a prostitute blush."
"CinemaClown","Null","5","16","14 October 2013"," A 4-hour Long Disappointment
","Reviewing this film is somewhat difficult because it's neither like the usual crime epics nor like any of the films that director Sergio Leone has made before, including his classic westerns. Running at nearly 4-hours of excessive runtime, Once Upon a Time in America failed terribly in living up to my expectations and turned out to be a major disappointment. The story begins brilliantly but then goes on for over 3 hours covering themes of friendship, greed, betrayal, love & loss in a painfully slow manner that was far less absorbing & more frustrating only to wrap itself up in the end with an ambiguous but fruitless conclusion.<br/><br/>While the slow pace did give a huge amount of extra time for character development, there came many moments in the story when I just wanted it to end. There wasn't a single character worth liking in the film, the performances by Robert De Niro & others were good but there was nothing great about them, visually the film is beautiful in parts & music by Ennio Morricone has seen much better days, to be honest. Maybe a revisit sometime in the future might change my opinion about it but as of now, Once Upon a Time in America feels like a punishment for the crime I didn't commit & isn't even close to Sergio Leone's other classics."

"jdkraus","3","4","12","27 July 2011"," I wanted to enjoy this film, but I can't...for so many reasons
","Without a doubt, Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time. And Robert De Niro is among Hollywood's finest actors. Though both worked together in this film ""Once Upon A Time In America"", it is awful. The idea of five childhood friends joining together to start an empire of crime is an interesting idea—which pulled me into viewing this nearly 4-hour feature. So, what makes this movie so bad? <br/><br/>Mostly, it is the direction of how the story unfolds. The film's primary focus is on David Aaronson, nicknamed Noodles. The movie jumps around a bit, starting in 1933 (when Noodles is an adult); then jumping 30 years to 1968 (when he is an old man), going back in the 1920s (when he is a kid) and so on. The theme that Leone tries to display to the viewer's is about a man filled with regret and remorse from the way his life turned out, as well as the fate of his friends. I like this. But Leone throws in so many scenes that aren't relevant to the plot. <br/><br/>One, is the numerous amounts of sex sequences. Within the first hour of the film, teenage boys are seen doing an obese teen prostitute. How is this pertinent to the movie? It isn't. Later on, there are two very graphic rape scenes. Immediately, this puts me off. What's worse is, is that Noodles commits these. They are very painful to watch and they have no purpose to story at all. Ten minutes right here could have been cut. Perhaps though, these instances are thrown in to show how despicable Noodles and gangsters really are.<br/><br/>They are despicable, yet other Hollywood features such as ""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"", and even ""Scarface"" somehow hold the magic of making thugs the people to care about. In ""Once Upon A Time In America"", there is no one to like or care for, except for the innocent bystanders that get murdered or horribly maimed through the duration of the film. This is what the movie lacks; a reason to sit through the film. Without a character to care about, what's the purpose in watching a film? I guess Leone wanted the viewers to see the ugly side of nature, and not so much of an epic story about loss and regret. In addition, there are other scenes that drag the film to the point of a bore fest. One is a three-minute scene of a kid tempted to eat a desert that he was going to original use to impress a girl. Another is an elongated sequence of a phone ringing. Another is a young gal wondering in a dark room to find a lamp to illuminate the set. Again, what's the point in these? Leone is a master of making scenes move by at a slow pace. This is good for his westerns when the good and bad guy square off for a final duel, but not for a kid wanting to eat a desert. Scenes like this divert from the story, making it dull and hard to pay attention to. Leone may have well have added a 5-minute scene of Noodles sitting on the toilet, grunting. In contrast, important scenes and characters are left merely implied. One that comes to mind is Joe Pesci's character. He's such a great actor, but he's only in 1 scene and disappears from radar completely, and you'd think he's the type of character you'd see again. Another is the whole bank job that the gang was going to pull off. It was a setup, but it would've been interesting to see how it unfolded, rather than merely told by a character in the feature. <br/><br/>The acting is not too bad; I was thoroughly impressed by the child actors. Unfortunately there is an awful miscast, Elizabeth McGovern as Noodles love interest. She looked bored through the whole film. Hearing her talk is like listening to nails on a chalkboard. Even Noodles makes the remark to her later in the film, ""You're a lousy actress."" I chuckled at that, catching a little inside joke there. <br/><br/>I may come off as seeming to hate this movie. Believe it or not, I don't. The cinematographer pulled off some sweeping shots of New York City. The sets and costumes are exquisite, and I love Ennio Morricone's score. I'll admit that at times, Morricone's score was over sentimental and bombastic in some key scenes. The gangster flick is a genre I enjoy, but ""Once Upon A Time In America"" is not qualified as a great one in my book. It's too bad, because this was Leone's last film, and I hoped this was going to be his best. If you like Sergio, stick with his old westerns."
"keanep619","6","4","12","30 July 2009"," Very over rated

Not even in the same league as good fellas, untouchables, godfather, Donnie bras co etc etc.<br/><br/>Not 100% sure on length but if i remember correctly it is in the region of 4 hours, and for a film to be of this length AND keep the audience interested takes a lot.

"freeze_123","4","4","12","11 January 2007"," Too long for comfort.
","An attempt by director Sergio Leone at making the a gangster epic falls flat on its face. The movie has a lot of things going for it. The sets, cinematography, costumes, music and acting are top notch. James Wood as Max is excellent, whereas Robert De Niro is his usual excellent self and Elizabeth McGovern looks ravishing. The script is excellent too.<br/><br/>The problems are few but they are glaring. First of all, the movie is stretched out and awfully long at 3 hours and 47 minutes. I won't compare this film with Godfather, but the director sure took some inspiration from it. Just like godfather it has scenes where nothing is being said and only the music is playing but unlike Godfather absolutely no action is taking place on the screen, whereas in Godfather more action takes place when nothing is being said. This makes the movie awfully boring at stretch and not even its beautiful music can save it from being yawned at. Secondly, some of the scenes are awfully juvenile and could have been handled with more maturity. Specially when they get the Insurance agent's wife to check them and see if she can feel the person she was with during the diamond heist (I don't want to write as to what was going on in the movie).<br/><br/>Only if they could cut out at least a good hour from the movie, it would be a masterful gangster drama."

","Once Upon a Time in the West is one of my favorite movies, so I was looking very much forward to see this one. De Niro's acting is impeccable in this prohibition time film and there are some really beautiful pictures, especially in the episodes showing the youth of the gang. As usual, Leone moves forward slowly, concentrating on details. The movie, by jumping back and forth between past and present, develops a complicated story you wonder how it is going to end and tension is slowly building up. But then the riddle is solved, and you sit back, wondering how the director could ever have tolerated such an ending. It is incoherent, incredulous, even absurd. I was completely disappointed when the movie ended."

","In a rainy boring night, I was looking some DVD´s in my living room, and by coincidence, I found Once Upon in America DVD. I´ve seen it many times, but yesterday I thought, today I will take 3 tiresome hours to evaluate this movie. In the beginning, something already doesn´t smelling good. De Niro looks meanless to me, even the young Noodles actor passed more vibration to me than him in this movie. Other characters, like Dominic, and the other boys (except the scene which Patsy eats the cake in the stairs, waiting Peg, that is wonderful) have no charism. I mean it, another mafia movies, you become friend of the criminals, in this movie, I sensed a completely lack of sense, a non-tight direction, a cold environment from the actors. Other great names, like James Woods, and even Joe Pesci, act in non-significative roles, in part, I think the screanplay was like a bad-made-puzzle, with weak explanations, bad tied, no consciousness between parts. It´s an long-movie complication, I agree. But this kind of try give a several ways to make it up and accomplish another goals, like create familiar characters, and make a lot of great drama scenes, what I missed in this movie. I unfortunately misscalculated the fame of this movie, seeing the ranking position in this site, but, in my opinion, it´s another movie to forget in my closet."

","Why am I seeing 10 stars for this film? They must be from men (and I am one) who have no respect for women. This insane POS does not offer one positive interaction with a person of the female sex. They are all reduced to sex objects, willing or otherwise. I am trying to wrap my mind around how Elizabeth McGovern (later of ""Downton Abbey"" fame) could have allowed herself to participate in a virtual on-screen rape by Robert DeNiro. And I love Bobby, but I lost all respect for him after this. Yes, it was the ""character"" -- but didn't Bobby pull back and say... uh... wait a minute, guys, we're not making torture porn here, are we?<br/><br/>Other women were prostitutes or nymphs. Even the woman who gave birth to Danny Aiello's child was treated like a sex slave. She gives birth to a boy and all of the sudden she, and her young daughters, are supposed to kowtow to Danny and the new boy king in his arms. <br/><br/>And Tuesday Weld!!! She allowed herself to be brutally raped on screen... for whose benefit? Was this going to advance her career? <br/><br/>I watched with my mouth open for the whole thing. I was disgusted, appalled, nauseated. The four pigs at the center of this should have been subjected to the same sickening, vicious, cruel treatment they subjected every woman in this film to. <br/><br/>I feel sorriest for Ennio Morricone, whose beautiful music was wasted on this sub-par ""soft"" torture porn trash heap. <br/><br/>Did working on this film give anybody a sense of joy? Did people burst into applause when they saw it in a theater? Did the women just laugh to themselves and say, ""Well, all in a day's work?"" Or did they cry themselves to sleep because they needed the money and this was a chance to further their careers? <br/><br/>I have no doubt that the horrible excuses for men portrayed in this film did exactly what they did. But... of what benefit was it to the viewing audience? In what way did this cruel insult offer an edifying experience? Or even an enjoyable one? <br/><br/>What a tragic comment on our beloved entertainment industry."

","This is my first review on IMDb. I feel so emotional about this movie that I need to write something to recommend this movie.<br/><br/>Frankly, this movie is a bit too long. For the first hour, I have no idea what the movie is talking about. But as the story unfolds, I am more and more attracted to the amazing gangster world. De Niro's acting is wonderful. With so few words, he manages to convey so much. As for the plot, the story is very unique in its design. It doesn't follow the time-line. Rather, it unfolds like memory, with a poetic beautiful touch. Another great aspect about this movie is the wonderful melody, composed by Ennio Morricone. It is indeed an indispensable part of the whole story.<br/><br/>For post-95 like myself, Once Upon a Time in America is unlike any movie commonly seen today. It takes time to get into the setting, but it's definitely worth the effort."

","I'm a great fan of Leone's work, and this is probably my favourite movies of his. It is a very modern Sergio Leone, without losing his style.It might be long, but worth every minute without ever dragging. There are hardly any movies that handle non-linear story telling better than this one. The beautiful cinematography and always fitting music emerges you in almost every decade of the first half of the 20th century. The great story is brought to life with a great cast, especially with an alway great Robert DeNiro. It has every aspect of a good Gangster movie. So take an evening and watch this movie. A must see for any movie fan."
"evandewangga97","10","3","8","22 December 2014"," Criminal Fairy Tale
","Just from the director, Sergio Leone, I expect it is a great movie. Honestly I don't like western-movie too much, but from ""Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)"", I started to appreciate this kind of epic- genre. And then, I wonder what it's like when Leone directs other genre, such as crime. So I decided to watch this long-running-movie. For the first impression, I really shocked by its duration, 229 minutes, the longest movie I've ever watched. But, sure there are some reasons why he made for more than three hours. Especially, it is a drama-movie, I really understand how the character of each figure must be strong.<br/><br/>I can smell the sweat of the hard-work from the opening of the movie. Such a humble opening for this thought-provoking film. My main idea of this movie is it drive the audience from the simplest and youngest crime to the complex act of the prohibition-era-Jewish- gangster. Begin with the funny yet straightforward scene of a kid's gang. Encounter with daily dark-kid-job, yes it's fun for the serious audience. What I see is the humanity of the first half part of the movie. Every character especially outlaws, have a background. Maybe a harsh and tough one, and it's all revealed in this movie. So the entire last part of movie is make sense, very clear.<br/><br/>That's what I called the strong characterization, one and half hour for the character building is very meaningful. Again I can feel, how Harry Grey wrote this novel for it. A plain humble novel I think. I haven't read it though, but I just feel it indeed. I also give two thumbs up for the dialog maker. Well-crafted dialog, no narration, just formidable chit chat in every scene. Thanks for those eight writers for this movie. Until the very end, with some twists and spoof, that's all make this movie nothing but superb.<br/><br/>For Leone himself, I can conclude that he usually gives the repeated soundtrack as his signature. Yeah, and harmonica again, although not every scene has harmonica player. I am personally not disturbed by its soundtrack. It's a part of developing the atmosphere, the dark- 30's-atmosphere. With all the warm-act, I just can get through the movie without getting bored. In addition, there are so many ""silent- scene"", yes when there is no dialog, just for strengthen the circumstances. That silent scene makes the movie took so long. But, for me, again, it's okay, it's a part of genuine masterpiece.<br/><br/>Not like my other reviews, I just write this from the technical aspects. Because I don't really know what the prohibition-era in America. I just know, it must be criticize some parts of broken American in the 1920's-1930's. It's nice though, a cool way to criticize the underworld of the superior nation. This overall technical reviews just to make other movie fans aware, that I highly recommend this movie. A very criminal-fairy-tale with terrific work in all aspects, I really love it."
"GeorgeRoots","10","3","8","5 September 2014"," An ""Epic"", In Every Sense Of The Word.
","Epic, violence, greed and love. Many themes that are present and explored in Sergio Leone's final epic ""Once Upon A Time In America"". I suppose I must explain the injustice of what happened to Leone's work. Ten years in the making, the film was originally suppose to be 4 hours and 30 minutes long. Due to creative differences and distributions, the European cut was 3 hours and 40 minutes. The American cut however, was a mere 2 hours long. The narrative was beyond broken and everything made no sense leaving Leone reportedly heartbroken, vowing never to make another film and would sadly pass away a few years later. Luckily for us, it's been reported someday that Leone's children and the movies composer Ennio Morricone, will collect all four and a half hours and have a definitive cut soon underway. Onto the review.<br/><br/>In essence, I find the story one I think all of us know somewhere deep in the back of our brain (which gives a weight to the proposed ""Opium"" dream theory). Kids growing up as best of friends get themselves involved in organised crime, and now all is left is to wait for the inevitable crash. It would be incredibly rude of me to sum up the movie as just that, because for those people who have watched the film know that the performances and friendship between Robert De Niro and James Woods's character is remarkable. The visual look of the ghetto's are grand, rustic and BIG on scale. The camera is shot so well you'd swear you were looking from the eyes of the children.<br/><br/>As well as looking extremely authentic, we are told a very well plotted narrative that spans into each friends 60+ years of living. We begin with an old David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro), smoking in a Chinese opium den as he reflects on his lifetime as a child and a young adult. So far we have seen that he is on the run in the present time, then almost immediately we jump to Noodles's early years making what he can of the depression and meeting a young Max (James Woods). As we meet the gang at a young age (Fantastic performances from these child actors), good times and tragedy are always frequent. Years later, Noodles and Max eventually meet again and my how times have changed.<br/><br/>Again, what I've just wrote in the last couple of paragraphs, doesn't even begin to go deep enough to explain what happens in the first act. I really do not wish to tell you what happens, because there is virtually no way to explain the grand scope of this film. It hardly feels like a movie but more of an experience, one of which would feel criminal if I told you anymore about it. But as I will constantly say, the casting and acting is fantastic. The camera work by Leone as always is flawless, and the score for this movie is so big on scale I swear it could rival Nino Rota's score for ""The Godfather"" (1972). <br/><br/>Final Verdict: The greatest gangster movie ever made. When people talk about Leone's work such as ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" (1966), they always refer to how strong the characters are. Please believe me when I say that these characters are some of the most strongest archetypes I have ever seen, and this film is Sergio Leone's Masterpiece. In the words of Roger Ebert, ""An epic poem of violence and greed"". Need we say more? 10/10."
"blackmamba99971","10","3","8","30 June 2014"," Outstanding Gem
","Sergio Leon's last film. One of the most under rated classics of all time. Robert De'Niro plays a hustler set in the roaring twenties to the dirty thirties where his gang does odd jobs for either bosses, or whoever asks for a price. Set in the gritty hood of Manhattan he and his posse become widely known as one the toughest gangs in New York. What surprised me was how Sergio used a director other than directing it himself. Since his own films were just as tough looking with outlaws.<br/><br/>But this film was not your usual mobster flick. All dialogue was set in a way where one could disseminate the plot. Although most gang films like The Godfather, or Goodfellows are loosely based on true fact, this was not. It had simpler character dialogue. Hardly any sense of awareness in each of the actors. Although that might have been Leon's intent. I especially liked the detail for every scene.<br/><br/>Hard wood panels, lustrous items such as glass, or brass highly polished. The sets gave off an antique quality I look for in mobster films such as this. Elizabeth Mcgovern was also highly polished. Her way of acting, and showing her convicting gaze captures the imagination. James woods also gave off an audacious performance as De'Niro's long time friend Max. Both give this movie the needed boost, and Sergio provided really well with his actor picks.<br/><br/>Lastly, are the scenes of Violence. In most mob movies the violence can be grotesque but graceful in its own particular way. Gun shoot outs to fist fights without reserve. Gratuitous blood shots, as well as the honest, and open sexual natures between actors. In many ways this could rival the top gang films in all aspects. Although Francis Ford Coppola is my favourite director for the classics such as Godfather, and Apocalypse Now, Sergio Leon has shown us his true way of creating an Ultimate Classic.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America is long, over three hours of film. But it is well worth it. Epics such as this movie needs to be told in this length or it doesn't work well with the audience. Cutting it down to just two or an hour and a half breaks away the most important ingredients in a film like this. The details are everything. Ghandi, Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, and so many others over three hours need to be told in its entirety or it won't work. I recommend this film for those 17 and above who love this genre. Excellent example of of the great Sergio Leon."
"jcbutthead86","10","3","8","12 June 2013"," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent Gangster Film And An Unforgettable Epic Masterpiece From Sergio Leone.
","Once Upon A Time In America is an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that is filled with excellent direction,great acting and a haunting and beautiful score. It's not only one of my favorite films and one of best Gangster films ever made,but,also one of the greatest films ever made and is another Sergio Leone Masterpiece.<br/><br/>Set in Lower Manhattan,New York,Once Upon A Time In America tells the story of the rise and fall of four Jewish Gangsters during the prohibition era and the friendship of gangsters and friends David 'Noodles' Aaronson(Robert De Niro)and Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz(James Woods) Over the course of five decades,from the 1910s to the 1960s Noodles and Max experience success,failure,death and betrayal.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America was Sergio Leone's final film before his death in 1989 and is a beautiful and haunting Masterpiece of cinema that was butchered by Warner Bros. When Once Upon A Time In America was released at the Cannes film festival the original version was an epic that ran 3 hrs and 49 minutes(229 minutes)and that version was critically acclaimed by critics and received a standing ovation at Cannes. However,when the film was released in America OUTIA was cut down buy Warner Bros to 2 hrs and 19 mintues(139 minutes)and was hated by critics. But thankfully,Leone's four hour version was released years later and seen as a Masterpiece and rightfully so it's just sad Leone didn't live longer to see his amazing film get the respect it deserves. Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films ever made an powerful and unforgettable epic Gangster film that ranks alongside other excellent Gangster films like The Godfather Trilogy,Goodfellas and Casino and other Gangster classics like Scarface and Carlito's Way. OUTIA is an epic in the truest since of the word an epic not only in scope but in length and everything is big and large whether it is the characters or things all around. What Sergio Leone did with the Western with his Man With No Name Trilogy and Once Upon A Time In The West he does with the Gangster film with OUTIA with Leone taking trademarks that are often related to Gangster films and making them bigger than life and telling the story with violence,brutality and sadness mixing beauty and harshness. Although a Gangster film,OUTIA at it's heart is a story about the friendship between Noodles and Max from the times when they were when were Teenagers to when they became adults and not only depicting their rise and fall as Gangsters but their rise and fall as friends and how they start to go against each other and things change. The relationship between Noodles and Max feels real and true never fake. Noodles and Max are characters that aren't always likable but you witness their tragic and complex relationship and at times feel bad for them. Along with being a Gangster film OUTIA is also a great Coming Of Age tale because the first half of the film shows viewers how Noodles and Max grew up and became friends and got to where they were as Gangsters. The Coming Of Age part of the film is told in a nice but bittersweet way showing the happy times that Noodles and Max had but also the sad parts that the two had when they were kids. Another thing that I love about this film is the flashback structure of the film and how it switches back from the past and the present showing them all from Noodles' point of view showing his guilt and nostalgia about the past and what's great about the flashback structure of the film is that the structure has a surreal feel to them it's as if were looking at a dream. The violence and sex scenes in the film will turn off some people because of the harshness and brutality of them but I think that the reason the violence and sex are disturbing and brutal is because Sergio Leone is showing us how it really was in the crime world in the 1920s and 1930s and is being true to that time period. hope viewers are not scared off by the running time of this film because OUATIA moves at a great pace and is one of the fastest four hours you will ever watch and the time will go by without a hitch. The ending of this film is powerful and one of the best endings in film history that will stay with you because of what happened and the ambiguity of the ending. An unforgettable ending.<br/><br/>The whole does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent in one of his most underrated performances as Noodles,with De Niro bringing sadness,depth and intensity to the performance. James Woods is brilliant and fiery as Max and has great scenes and chemistry with De Niro. Elizabeth McGovern is wonderful as Deborah,Noodles love interest. Joe Pesci is great is his small role as Frankie Manoldi,a Detroit crime boss. Burt Young also great as Joe,an associate of Frankie's. Tuesday Weld is phenomenal and beautiful as Carol,a hooker that's Max's girlfriend. Scott Tiler(Young Noodles),Rusty Jacobs(Max)and Jennifer Connelly(Young Deborah)do great jobs as De Niro,Woods' and McGovern's young counterparts. Treat Williams(James Conway),Danny Aiello(Chief Vincent Aiello),Darlene Fluegel(Eve)and James Russo(Bugsy)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Sergio Leone is brilliant and masterful,with Leone constantly moving the camera and using close-ups,great angles and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Amazing direction,Leone.<br/><br/>The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,beautiful and unforgettable and one of the best scores in film history. Morricone's score fits in well with each scene and matches the epic and tragic tone of the film. A powerful score by Morricone.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Gangster Films or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Once Upon A Time In America,a brilliant Gangster classic and a Masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"Sonic_Ocean","10","3","8","21 May 2013"," Expanding on the idea of showing the personal side of a gangster ala The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America tells a story that is completely different and ambitious
","I am usually hesitant to sit through long movies, because not only does it require me to find the time, I question whether the story will be worth enough to hold my attention for that long. As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting.<br/><br/>And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds.<br/><br/>Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story.<br/><br/>And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature.<br/><br/>And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil. If you loved The Godfather, then you will enjoy this movie. A tragic epic masterpiece that everyone must watch."

Adulation's for the writers.Still i feel De Niro was great but without the direction and vision of Sergio Leone this would have been incomplete.Not to forget James Woods who also gives a great performance.The ending just breaks you or rather portrays your own guilt in front of you.This is special feeling that you wont get.Don't think of a good feeling after watching this.As you will surely delve into bonds of friendship which you had long time ago.Surely this movie will leave you numb....hats off Sergio Leone and tribute to you....still i ponder the opium scene and the guilt....and i wonder......"

I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The rest of it though... hmmm...<br/><br/>There were a lot of extremely unnecessary scenes. Lots of scenes of kids doing a bunch of messed up stuff.

","I know some people consider this to be Leone's best movie. I must say I strongly disagree. The acting in the movie is solid, would you expect otherwise looking at the cast. The story, however, is another matter. The movie is based on a book, and it shows. Despite lasting more than 220 minutes the movie still leaves a lot of characters very underdeveloped. The fact that the story stretches over the entire lifetime of the characters also constitutes a problem. The different events in the characters' lives we are shown are not very well connected. We are unable to contextualize the events and therefore the characters' motivation is difficult to comprehend. In short, the story is fragmented. As for the ending, well I am not going to spoil the movie for anyone, but I will say that it is a bit far-fetched."

","Maybe it was the bizzare cross of De Niro, 30s era gangsters, and a butcherd Beatles tune that made this movie too off-center for me. Sergio Leone made great westerns, but I just don't think his style transferred too well to this medium. It lacked the gritty extreme realism of Lenone's westerns, but it also lacked the contemporary realism of a ganster movie. He made the American west mythic, but the American gangster dull. I love the director and cast but it just didn't work for me! I will try watching it again ... but I doubt it will help. Watch Once Upon A Time In The West if you ask me."
"lisacamillek-1","2","5","17","10 June 2008"," Masterpiece it may be, but unnecessarily misogynist and long.
","I don't know whether this film was 4 or even 5 hours long, but it was too much. It's very complex and hard to understand, which although makes it a real crime epic, with such a length of time, made Sergio Leone put in elements that were basically unnecessary to the plot of the film and shocking to the female audience. Two rape scenes that were not included in the book appear in the film. With that and many other elements of hatred and violence towards women suggest a very strong misogynist content. There is also the description of women in inappropriate manners (prostitution). The main character Noodles (played by De Niro) rapes a girl in a hold up, rapes his long time love of his life Deborah (Jennifer Connolly plays her younger self) after she rejects him and then betrays his long-time friends and goes in exile for several decades before he decides to return. All in all it does not make him a very likable character. The ending also, is left unexplained. A wide grin across Noodles's face in the last shot shows a few possibilities about how the entire film is built out to be. It is not badly portrayed as unfortunately some films are when it comes to adaptations on screen, either from a book or a true story. The fact that the contempt for the female race in this film even reaches out to infant children does not appeal to me. This film may have had a standing ovation when it was premiered, but when you're standing in a room with a television for three or four hours, you have to wonder, where exactly did those three hours go?"

But they also have a life: they try to get their first sexual experience, they try to survive in the street against the adults. I'd like to highlight specially the scene where Patsy eats the dessert instead of giving it to Penny: it reminded me that children sometimes remain that way until they have to grow. In this case, a yummy and sweet food was more likable to the kid, than a sexual experience.<br/><br/>The kids grow, they become men. Powerful men. But one of them will only be that way when he gets out from jail.<br/><br/>The men will finally lose everything, and the men will have to make a choice: life, or friends, what is it gonna be?

I can't think of any other movie that came close in gross out ability not even a Harvard documentary about tribes in Indonesia killing each other in ritual warfare I saw as a teen back in the 60s. <br/><br/>The movie is quite long and I saw just the beginning. Perhaps it redeems itself later. But that opening was too much for me to take."

"Desertman84","10","2","5","10 November 2011"," A Great Cinematic Experience And Masterpiece
","Once Upon a Time in America is an Italian epic crime film co-written and directed by Sergio Leone.It stars Robert De Niro and James Woods together with Elizabeth McGovern,William Forsythe,James Hayden,Tuesday Weld,Treat Williams,Joe Pesci,Burt Young and Brian Bloom. The film chronicles the story of the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. It explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society.Leone adapted the story from the novel The Hoods, written by Harry Grey, while filming Once Upon a Time in the West. From there, Leone began production of Once Upon a Time in America. <br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is done in non-linear order. While this plot states the film from the 20's to the 60's the film is largely told through flashbacks from the 60's.Spanning four decades, the film tells the story of David ""Noodles"" Aaronson and his Jewish pals, chronicling their childhoods on New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s, through their gangster careers in the 1930s, and culminating in Noodles' 1968 return to New York from self-imposed exile, at which time he learns the truth about the fate of his friends and again confronts the nightmare of his past. The acting, the re-creation of the time period, the cinematography, and the music are all superb. However, even more important is Leone's ability to make the film work on so many different levels: it's both a criticism of gangster-film mythology and a continuation of the director's exploration of the issues of time and history. Strange as it may seem, the violence and gore in the first half of the film turn into a sad elegy about wasted lives and lost love. <br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting.Also,it is filled with great performances from its cast especially Robert De Niro,Tuesday Weld and James Woods.Obviously,Sergio Leone created a cinema masterpiece that is a self-reflexive crime-gangster epic that glorifies its lifestyle.Also,it has many wonderful, memorable moments in the movie that it conveys a lifetime of experience as it unfolds.<br/><br/>Overall,Once Upon a Time in America is a cinema experience that one should have when viewing this undisputed masterpiece."
"mike-silin","Null","2","5","9 August 2011"," Love it or hate it, it brings fresh air to cinema
","I got frustrated watching this movie at first because the story time line kept moving around. It was hard to follow the plot, even though the events were pretty clear cut on screen.<br/><br/>The story follows 3 time lines, when he is a boy, when he is in his late 20s, and when he is in his 60s. It begins with him going into exile after his girl friend gets shot(not really a spoiler, happens in the first 5 minutes). The movie then flashes into the past, present, and future to create a seamless blend of events that go reiterate the main morals of the movie. Morals like not betraying your friends.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about this movie is that it was really entertaining. Things like-- did he really just do that? (He rapes a girl in one scene, we later find out the girl planned everything so she wouldn't be considered as the one that tipped him off). It also makes the main characters look pretty evil some times. Usually in today's society we don't encourage films about the bad guys. We just film the do good honest people and avoid controversy.<br/><br/>I enjoy this film, even watching it 30 years after release. De niro has always been one of my favorite actors. I especially like that the plot can be interpreted in a variety of ways. There doesn't seem to be one explanation for everything and there is multiple possibilities that make the viewer use their imagination to think about what happened."
"Steffi_P","7","2","5","5 March 2011"," ""Believe in yesterday""
","The old genres of classic Hollywood were bundles of convention and cliché, familiar in their tone and romantic in their recreation of an idea. And while Hollywood itself would change massively in the modern era, those movie stylings lingered on in the memories of those who had grown up with them. Hence it was just as likely to be European filmmakers who were documenting America's history on screen, albeit through the haze of genre-tinted spectacles. Once Upon a Time in America is celebrated Italian director Sergio Leone's tribute, not to prohibition-era America, but to the classic gangster genre which once claimed to portray it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking thing about Once Upon a Time in America is its wealth of detail and compelling atmosphere. The production design is really impressive, with sets to feast the eyes on and realistically thronging street scenes. Leone and his art director Carlo Simi have struck a balance between throwing in stuff that makes sense in context and stuff that conjures up a certain feeling in the scene. A good example is when Noodles flees the opium den and makes his way to Moe's, and the streets are strewn with streamers for a forlorn, after-party appearance. Many of the 1922 scenes feature billows of smoke rising up from vents, for that dreamy, wistful look. Sound design plays an important part here, the creaking of a lift creating a tense build-up to a shooting in the way that one of Ennio Morricone's dirges might have done in a Leone Western. Morricone's music is still a key presence of course, tying various thoughts together across the decades, for example the eerie honky-tonk Yiddish theme that plays to introduce Moe's place in the opening scenes and again in the first set of 1968 scenes.<br/><br/>The principle cast for this one are chosen from the front ranks of contemporary Hollywood talent. Robert De Niro was by this time the archetypal New York mobster, so clearly the obvious choice, even if he has to swap his trademark Italian American accent for a Bronx one. He is however a little more serene and meditative than his usual exuberant gangster acts, and the quiet dignity with which he portrays the older Noodles is especially good. James Woods provides excellent support. I love his spontaneous anger in kicking Tuesday weld out of the office after a few words from De Niro. Character actors Burt Young and Danny Aiello do the job of making a memorable impact during their brief appearances, Aiello in particular giving us some great comic relief. Tuesday weld is very good too. A handful of the other cast members are guilty of a little overacting, but I'm not in a vindictive enough mood to name names.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America may be a far cry from the surreal expanses and moustachioed bandidos of Leone's Westerns, but much of the director's visual style has survived intact. He's still just as in love with the gritty close-up as ever, bringing an unusual prominence to the mole on Robert De Niro's right cheek. For some of the actor's roles this would be covered by the make-up department, or at least the director would favour his left profile. Here however not only is De Niro's juvenile counterpart given a conspicuous mole for consistency, Leone even shows De Niro at three-quarter angles against a dark background, highlighting the mole in outline, for example when he looks at the photo of Deborah at Moe's. It's pertinent, adding an obvious flaw to those otherwise handsome features. And then of course there is Leone's painstaking slowness and protracted non-dialogue scenes, which are what make this the 230-minute behemoth that it is, since there's only really enough script here for a two-hour movie. As usual, Leone makes these unspoken moments a dance of tense mannerisms and darting eyes, which (just about) renders them watchable.<br/><br/>But perhaps it is Once Upon a Time in America's gargantuan sprawl that is its undoing. There is nothing wrong per se with a 3hr+ movie, nor is there necessarily a problem with slow, methodical pacing. The trouble is that this picture sacrifices narrative clarity for its stylisation. I don't mean the confusing timeline-hopping; that's nothing that a repeat viewing won't sort out. However there is clearly something missing and in spite of their length some segments of the movie seem horribly truncated. There ought to be at least one more 1922 scene that brings out the comradely warmth between the boys, and between Max and Noodles in particular. It's not enough that we see it – we as an audience have to feel it. Instead we seem to be hurrying from one key incident to another with no time for character development. And in 1933 Max and Noodles seem continually at odds – there is not enough evidence that their friendship is still strong despite their disagreements, and this means the final scenes in 1968 do not have weight they ought to. Some parts of the story seem to trail off into nothing, for example the reappearance of Joe Pesci at the end of the hospital sequence. Instead the screenwriters have focused on working little bits of symbolism into the dialogue and imagery (for example, ""the key to your clock"" and ""I'll do something with your time""), but have not worked nearly as hard on the emotional continuity. As a result Once Upon a Time in America is an interesting and occasionally entertaining collection of references to gangster movie history, but it is a failure as a work of cinema."
"ManBehindTheMask63","Null","2","5","7 February 2011"," A masterpiece!
","One of the greatest films ever made. This film should have swept the Oscars that year, but thanks to the studio, who did a hack job on the film, it was overlooked and many key scenes were cut. Creating an uneven and confusing film that lost much of it's impact and character development. But the DVD is one of the greatest crime saga I have ever seen. The cinematography is excellent and Leone's directing is uncompromising. There is a lot of blood and violence and there are several harsh rape scenes, but the film is a truly beautiful piece of cinema. De Nero is excellent and James Woods also turns in a powerhouse performance. To sit through a film that runs 4 1/2 hours isn't easy, but the time really flew by with this film. The ending was very ambiguous and reflective. A must rent for gangster/De Nero fans. The musical score is perfect too. Highly recommended."
"albertoveronese","10","2","5","25 November 2010"," Something to do with greatness
","Sergio Leone was the greatest filmmaker of all time; all his films are masterpieces, they have something to do with greatness and cinematic excellence, the best films ever made. Once Upon A Time In America covers the periods in the 20s and 30s as recalled from 1968. It's a poignant and dense movie in which the motion, the frame and soundtrack simultaneously strike in a beautiful counterpoint. The movie is an example of visual and aural storytelling beyond time and reality – it's an indivisible whole where time is not a linear flow into past, present, and future. Once Upon A Time ""in"" America is not a social historical analysis nor a scientific work, it's a tale, a fairy tale which defies description because it's a dream that Noodle (Robert De Niro) begins in 1938 and doesn't end in 1968. Sergio Leone believed in huge stadium like movie theater where people would come together and watch on a giant screen an epic tale of passion, love, friendship, betrayal, vengeance, faith and perseverance; he believed in four, six hours long films, he believed in the extraordinary visual composition and movements that movies can celebrate, he believed in the powerful vibrancy, depth and richness of wide format films, he understood and empathized the sense of insight that follow a discovery one make for oneself – it was a fulfillment of integrity and lyrical concern over a lifetime. I can't even try to imagine what we all lost with his too-soon passing, what his next film would have been – Leone was planning a Soviet co-production film on the Siege of Leningrad during World War II – an epic larger-than-life film project left uncompleted at the time of his death. His film-making skills were so good that it's quite a physical experience to see his movies... they offer pleasure on a lot of different levels, you don't really know where it comes from but it's a shock of joy and sadness, full of feeling, emotions so essential to our lives. Watching and studying Sergio Leone's films are likely to yield to a better visual culture."
"johnmschofield","10","2","5","27 December 2009"," This is another masterpiece from a master director
","It appears that when filming had been completed there was somewhere between 8 to 10 hours of footage and the director and the editor had to trim this to around six hours. The plan being to release the film as two three hour parts. Apparently the producers refused to do this and insisted that the film be cut more and this is where the 229 minute version was arrived at. It also seems that the director wanted the eventual cut to be at least 265 minutes to include 'essential' footage but this 'extra' had to be left on the cutting room floor. The reason I have put this narrative at the beginning of this review is to demonstrate that if anybody has any problem with the continuity or events not being linked clearly then it is for these reasons and not a lack of care and attention from those ultimately responsible in the making of this film. I choose to believe the above mainly because of the very nature of the film. It is an epic and therefore in my opinion be judged on the overall feel of the film when the person watching it has watched it all. I would not recommend anyone watch the even shorter version which is only 139 minutes. I have never seen it but I am told it is a shambles and should be avoided. The 229 minutes version is apparently the only one we the viewing public have access to (excluding the shambles) so please bear in mind the above when you do watch this film.<br/><br/>Having said all the above this film is well worth the time spent watching it and providing you watch it all and preferably in one sitting I think you will get a better idea of what the story is all about. The film still has everything most people would want from such a masterpiece. Considering the number of people that could have actually starred in this film its a wonder it was ever completed but the people who were in it contributed greatly to the end result. Not having been to America I can only assume that what one sees is a reasonable recreation of the times as they are portrayed and therefore the film should be enjoyed on the basis that it is telling a story that just happens to take longer to tell than most films. The way in which the story is told and the care and attention which is clearly there for all to see sets this film apart and in my opinion is one of the greatest films ever made."
"Nighthawk1","10","2","5","21 November 2009"," An impressive achievement and a work of cinematic genius
","Serves as a perfect example of how adept and proficient Sergio Leone was as a director. I thought this movie would be more like a sweeping epic gangster movie similar to The Godfather. In a way it is, but more often than not it isn't. The two movies frequently contrast and differ with each other. I'm not sure if it's even fair to compare the two because the two films are aiming to accomplish different agendas and both follow distinct paths. The ambiguity and various forms of symbolism presented throughout the film will likely leave people scratching their heads in a state of confusion. I don't think Leone ever meant the film to be cut and dry in any obvious way. He really wanted the viewer to come to their own conclusions as to what has taken place by the conclusion of the film. Leone wanted the audience to think deeply about it. This is truly a thought provoking. Once Upon a Time in America is intelligent, has an intricate narrative, a multiple-layered plot and is profound. The movie is without a doubt an impressive achievement and a work of cinematic genius."
"dave_wlogan","10","2","5","3 February 2009"," Genius
","This is a movie that I had heard about and was told that it was something special. To be honest I was a little skeptical. I've seen to many Robert De Niro films and can almost predict how hes gonna handle the role after seeing a few minutes of him in character. Im never exactly right but I'm usually pretty close. Ask my stepdad. But he did this in a way that I didn't expect. This performance is Immortal. And I don;t want to ruin it for anyone so I'll say no more on it.<br/><br/>Now the film itself is a film that could be great with the worst cast. But because each cast member gives a sublime performance, the film is all the better for it. I was especially impressed with James Hayden who I thought was the best actor during the ruthless scenes but you never thought he was overly ruthless as a character out of those scenes.<br/><br/>The film is like a long visual poem. Each segment is beautiful, sometimes haunting and seamless. The lighting captures the emotion perfectly, sometime appearing contradictory to the mood but that bolsters the audience's unease. Overall the camera-work is stunning.<br/><br/>Forget every great script you've read or heard in film. This one is terse, occasionally taciturn and highly entertaining.

","I just cannot understand how anyone could find this movie boring- it is a very intense portrayal of two men, DeNiro and Woods, who once were like brothers but ended up being enemies.<br/><br/>During the early part of the century, times were hard and rough things happened. Comparing that day to now is impossible, for standards were different and life was much harder and death was closer to many than it is today. Therefore, many of the risks taken by people were understandable, for making an honest living, especially during the Great Depression, was very difficult. In addition, in a male-dominated world, there were women's issues that were not talked about- young girls being prostituted, molestation, abuse, etc. Despite their brutality and shock value, it was a realistic portrayal and was not over the top.<br/><br/>I myself gave this movie 10/10 because despite its length, the sheer scope of the story and the characters drew me in and kept me interested throughout, unlike another Leone film, ""Duck, You Sucker"". Violence, lust, greed, longing, love, hate, abuse, youth, age, it was all there, and more. It is too bad that in a society in which we seek to find an ending in about an hour and a half, movies such as these are not more appreciated."
"jmbruce","10","2","5","20 May 2008"," A timeless classic that deserved far better than what it got!
","People have called ""Once Upon a Time in America"" a 'Jewish Godfather,' but it is so much more than Coppola's Oscar winning film. In fact, it is so much more than that; it is a pure Sergio Leone epic full of greed, wealth, love, deceit and betrayal. This would have swept the Oscars for 1984, been on the Best Films of All Time lists, and be an instant classic. Leone would win an Oscar for his comeback and become the biggest man in Hollywood. All this would have happened, had it not fallen victim to studio-forced editing. Roger Ebert praised the uncut original film that received a standing ovation at Cannes Film Festival and was released in its entirety in Europe, but he was disgusted with the 144 minute version that premiered in America. No wonder the film did not do well at the U.S box office, but it has since made more than its budget back in home video, DVD and TV airings. Sort of like The Shawshank Redemption (although that film made it's budget back but not enough to make a profit), but the sold fact that it was Leone who directed ''OUATIA'' makes the film talked about even today!<br/><br/>Aged gangster David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) returns to his old Brooklyn neighborhood in the late 1960s. In order to solve the mystery of who has been tracking him, he must look into his past to find the answers. Split up into two flashbacks of different time periods: the 1920s and the 1930s, which are regarded as the most famous parts of the film. We see Noodles and his gang as boys working for local hoods in the racketeering and extortion business, and they work their way up into the criminal underworld as adults. James Woods is Max, his best friend and partner in crime, and he is brilliant in portraying the character's ambition and lust for wealth. Several others include Treat Williams, Tuesday Weld and Larry Rapp. Joe Pesci is wonderful in his scenes, and the late James Hayden is perfect in the role of Patsy. Such a shame that he died less than a month shy of his 30th birthday; he had so much potential to become a legendary actor up there with De Niro and Pacino. Elizabeth McGovern is the stand-out as Deborah, the actress and opera singer who had a doomed romance with Noodles.<br/><br/>The young cast carries the picture for more than an hour of its four hour running time. Scott Tiler (Young Noodles) and Rusty Jacobs (Young Max) shine bright as the teenage counterparts of De Niro and Woods in the 1920s sequences of the film. Even Noah Moazezi is good in his minor role of Dominic, whose tragic fate shapes the boys' lives as adults. A twelve year old Jennifer Connelly can be seen as the young Deborah, for whom Noodles falls for.<br/><br/>It is sad that the studio butchered Leone's vision of life for a Jewish American growing up in the early 20th Century, and I know for a fact that he died depressed and upset over his troubled film career. However, he was still planning a comeback to the end: a Stalingrad film with De Niro that was scrapped when he died.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is a great classic for all De Niro and Leone fans, and it deserves to be up there in the Top 250!"

The expressions, the mannerisms, voice inflections are perfect. As you watch it over and over (the 4 hours version) more and more can be appreciated and new things just come clearer. The visions of young love (lust)through the wall cutout. The sadness of watching the young lad waiting for Pegola as he ate the whipped cream cupcake. This movie made me happy, sad, brought the proverbial lump to the throat especially when Bugsy kills the youngest of the gang, while feeling the hatred of Bugsy's payback from the hands of Noodles. Enough cannot be said about this film. <br/><br/>This movie is a personal favorite."

James Woods' performance was stellar, and Robert De Niro as always, is on top of his game. The Godfather is definitely the best of the genre. I would rank Once Upon A Time in America as the best gangster movie of all-time had the supporting cast been more visible. Though the supporting cast performances were right on, having some established Hollywood ""names"" might have helped. The Godfather offered a supporting cast that had more household names that the audience could ""connect"" with.

I wished Joe Pesci would have been worked into a bigger role because he is outstanding and hilarious in mob movies, but his minimal screen time and rather insignificant character role can be explained. He would doubtfully fit as any of the main 4, and beyond that are only a couple other key characters and he wouldn't work as any. Overlooking his small role, the overall quality of this film has me thinking it may be second to only GoodFellas in true mob/gangster epics."

","I first saw ""Once Upon a Time in America"" quite by accident, twenty years ago. I was visiting the US to attend business meetings. Late one night, after a long, long day, I returned to my hotel room and turned on the TV while I got ready for bed. There was this movie that seemed to have just begun. I sat on the bed for (what I thought would be) a moment to decide whether to keep it on. I started to take off my tie and shoes as I did. . . Nearly three hours later, I realized I had not got beyond that. I had become totally captivated by the violent tale that unfolded on the screen. I've never quite figured out what chord this movie struck within me. Perhaps the terrible waste and regret that arises from the virtually mindless, unbridled pursuit by Noodles and his gang, of their extraordinary appetite for pleasure and wealth? Why I would resonate so strongly with that, I have not tried to fathom."

To me the test of a good movie is are the characters believable? If you can answer yes then you can view the movie with real eyes and not critic eyes. Look at the characters in the movie who gave the movie weight such as Sally the girl whore who grow up to be a woman whore. Fat Moe a slob as a child and a slob as adult, these are real people we see every day and most of us know of these people.

"henrykrinkle3","10","2","5","2 November 2002"," poetry in motion cinema (possible spoilers included)
","To use the term masterpiece in describing this film would be cliche not to mention subjective. However, I will say that it rates as one of my favourites, second only to another Sergio Leone classic entitled Once Upon a Time in the West.<br/><br/>OUATIA is, on the surface, a gangster epic which spans three time periods of 20th century America in the life of it's lead character, Noodles (played by De Niro in adulthood). It follows his progression through childhood, young adulthood and into old age. Digging beneath the surface we see that really, it's a story about love and friendship. We are there in Noodles' youth when he falls in love - a pivotal moment which will affect him for the rest of his life - and when he forms close but fateful friendships. We are there when he is confronted by the dilemmas and emotional conflicts, which these divided loyalties bring. We are also there when he has to face the life-long prospect of both a love lost and a friendship betrayed with tragic consequences. The subsequent feelings of nostalgia and remorse are a burden, which rest heavy on the shoulders of our protagonist. His character is not portrayed as either heroic or necessarily villainous, just a man who has made choices in life. Choices he has to live with.<br/><br/>Much of the film is set in the character's past. This serves to expound his mental and emotional state in old age as we approach the film's finale. Most importantly, it creates an atmosphere of nostalgia and regret which permeates the whole film, underscored beautifully by Ennio Morricone.<br/><br/>Relatively speaking, the film is lengthy and the plot intricate with it's layers upon layers of flashbacks and flash-forwards. Naturally, some people will be put off on their first viewing, as the tendency is to try and make sense of everything going on - to rationalise and make linear the non-linear structure. Any attempts to do so will undoubtedly cause frustration because, just as in life, the film asks as many questions as it answers and leaves some loose ends untied. In reality, the temporal and geographical settings along with the plot are there to add context and framework. They may be the formalities you argue over at the end of the film but are there only as a backdrop to the main themes of love, friendship and regrets. These are the things that remain after everything else has long been forgotten, and it's the indescribably beautiful way in which these ideas are expressed in story-telling format, which creates a film that lives long in the memory.<br/><br/>Leone - as in all his films - gives great attention to seemingly small details without, in my opinion, being artsy, pretentious or excessively indulgent. When De Niro's character is stirring his cup of coffee, this becomes a focal point in the film for fully one whole minute, and why not? Leone's films are as much about everyday life as they are about friendship, American capitalism, revolutions, the Old West or any other grand themes you care to mention. The director is constantly reminding us that everyday actions are just as important. They are the 'stuff' of life and deserve just as much attention. It's only when the value of this point is lost that his films may appear to be slow-paced or dragged out.<br/><br/>And how does he attempt to convey the depth of human feeling. That which even the greatest of poets find difficult to express? Without trying too hard to articulate, Leone allows for the film's imagery and sounds to achieve that which might otherwise be missed in a thousand lines of dialogue. When the protagonist returns to his old hunting ground after 35 years of absence, we can only try to imagine the emotional pain he's been feeling throughout this time. When Fat Moe asks the question ""What have you been doing all these years?"" his reply is ""I've been going to bed early."" This tells us as much as we need to know about the previous 35 years. After all, how could you hope to articulate or quantify the great sense of loss he must have felt in all that time? To add anymore on the subject would undermine it completely and I think the director fully appreciated this. Instead, we draw our own conclusions from both the haunted look in De Niro's eyes and from Morricone's reverential orchestral score which is at times so mournful, but always sweepingly majestic.<br/><br/>The potential of film as a medium to leave you believing you have witnessed something truly profound is seldom fulfilled to the extent I believe it has been with this film. It could not have had nearly the same impact on me had it not received the input of both Leone and Morricone. Together, they have collaborated to produce a cinematic experience, which transcends far beyond the sum of their individual contributions. A partnership forged in film to rival the likes of that forged by Lennon and McCartney in music, at least in recent decades. Morricone's genius is a match for Leone's and sometimes leaves you wondering, which came first, the story or the music. There is no doubt they both inspired each other to reach unprecedented heights in their respective fields and I would strongly recommend to all readers who have persevered so far that you watch all the films they have worked together on.<br/><br/>9.9/10 (well..., nothing's perfect!)"
"willeniams","10","2","5","13 November 2000"," A brilliant and ambitious gangster epic. (WARNING:Plot points revealed!)
","In my opinion the third best gangster film (After Godfather and Goodfellas), but still fantastic all the same. It is extremely poetic in its flashbacks, Sergio Leone really captures the atmosphere of New York in the prohibition era. Preformances are all perfect, direction is unbeatable, how this didn't win any oscars or nominations even, is ludicrous, (Although that is the fault of the distributor for releasing a 'butchered' version of the film). Costumes, sets, everything clicks. Ennio Morricone's music is as outstanding as ever. My favourite parts: The first time cut signified by 'Yesterday'. THe second signified by the frisbee, and the egnimatic ending, in the rubbish truck. Its heavy going at 3 hours 40 mins, but its like eating a large meal. Hard but satisfying. One minor flaw: Sergio Leone's treatment of women, especially the charecter of Deborah."

It could be described as a gangster movie and it is but there is much more to it than that. It skips generations a few times so you need to give it your full attention.

","I think this movie would break IMDB's top 50 if all the viewers saw the REAL version of this movie - the 224 minute epic that was Sergio Leone's directorial swan song.  Ennio Morricone's music has always been at its apex when Leone was involved and it's the same right here - the music is stunningly moving and enhances the passage of time.  Frame by frame scenes, the quality of the film, the music, the acting (brilliant - with my main man Deniro ..aka GOD) and a volatile James Woods makes you feel like you've lived an entire life of someone when you see this movie.  Although The Godfather and the trilogy are my favorite movies of all time - this movie along with the GFather trilogy are perhaps the only ones who make the viewer well and truly feel like they've taken a lifelong journey - literally living a life. But this film gets credit for doing so with 3.5 hours - without any sequels.  A brilliant, sad, moving and enriching experience."

"tforbes-2","10","2","6","19 November 2018"," Not for casual viewing.
","""Once Upon A Time In America"" is not a film for casual viewing, and it may need more than one viewing to truly grasp its story telling. That said, the restored version really takes this film to an incredibly level, at least for me.<br/><br/>I was intrigued with the movie when I first saw it in its truncated version. Some of the scenes were a little too intense for me, such as Elizabeth McGovern's character getting raped, and they still are. But it also shows the brutality of gangster life, and in that sense it's maybe a little closer to reality than The Godfather. But like the Godfather movies, there's also a deep sense of tragedy.<br/><br/>And yet, when Robert DeNiro's character clearly declines to kill the character James Woods plays at the end of the movie, it makes me wonder who the real victor was at the end of the film. By 1968, Noodles was living in Buffalo, seemingly a changed man, while Max had become the wealthy Secretary Bailey, but it was Bailey who was finally taking the fall for all his wrongdoing. Noodles presumably would return alive.<br/><br/>My only quibbles with the film are that there wasn't enough care with historical accuracy. People in 1968 wearing 1982 fashions and hairstyles? Noodles driving a rental 1962 Pontiac? At least they got David Bailey's style right.<br/><br/>Don't expect Star Wars or some action flick. On the whole, a story very well worth watching!"

Set in the prohibition era ""Max"" (aka Robert) grows up as a street punk and later as a man, grows up to be a murdering gangster and the story turns into something much more greater than any story in history.

"soundoflight","5","2","6","5 June 2018"," You can't blame the cutting anymore...
","Is ""Once Upon a Time in America"" praised because of what it is, or because of who made it? I would argue that it is the latter, as Sergio Leone has been raised to a mythical status due to his unique directing talents and the success of the four western films he directed. Despite what Leone brought to this film (and his signature techniques are all at work here), that alone does not make a great film, and unfortunately ""Once Upon a Time in America"" suffers from several key shortcomings. <br/><br/>The main one of these shortcomings is simply the plot, which is too cumbersome, and once put through the wringer of the pacing and time-jumping, simply doesn't hold up as interesting enough to justify the 4 hour runtime of the extended version (the version Leone intended, apparently). By the end of the film I was deflated and bored, and the ending itself did nothing to change that. There was a gem of a good story in here - Leone knew that - but I don't think he succeeded in bringing it out. And many of the scenes seemed to be there only to provide shock value. Leone's earlier work was much ""tighter,"" where every shot seemed to matter.<br/><br/>The music and soundtrack are also a bit jarring. I think this was Leone's weak spot through most of his films. His repetition of musical themes in a film worked OK for his westerns, but in this film in particular, it becomes wearisome to hear the same cloying theme for the 50th time over 4 hours. I found myself distracted by the music and wishing it wasn't there behind the dialogue much of the time. <br/><br/>So despite some glimmers of brilliance, even the fully restored version of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" rings flat for me. Due to the years of delays in getting this film off the ground, he missed his window and the ""gangster"" genre was already tired when this film came out (and arguably it's even more tired today). And unlike his westerns, which were sort of meta-films as they came after the hay-day of the format. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" just feels like one of the pack."
"snorlax3111984","8","2","6","4 April 2017"," Pros And Cons Of The Unabridged Version of Once Upon A Time In America
","Pros: 1. This is one of those movies that you need to see more than once. The first viewing may confuse you with the shifts in time but the more you see it and the more closely you pay attention , you see the movie is well-constructed and it doesn't jump through time just to be artsy.<br/><br/>2. Bad child actors are at least twice as annoying as bad adult actors, so it's a relief that all the child actors are good, even if the boys didn't grow up to be Oscar-Winners like Jennifer Connelly. They can be believable as criminals while maintaining a certain level of innocence. On tough streets like that you had to do what you needed to survive.<br/><br/>3. De Niro And Pesci prove they don't need Scorsese to make a good movie, having Scorsese just really really helps (let's not forget that James Woods would work with De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese in ""Casino""). It's a shame Pesci wasn't in the movie as much as Sergio Leone originally intended but the work Pesci does in this movie is great.<br/><br/>4. Very glad Burt Young found time in between Rocky III and Rocky IV to be in this movie. His story about insurance is hilarious and definitely sounds like something Paulie would say in an R-Rated Rocky movie. Like Pesci, it's shame Burt Young is in the movie so briefly but at least Burt Young has a definite end and doesn't just disappear from the movie like Pesci.<br/><br/>5. The music is phenomenal. Certain musical themes are consistently reused and they never get old. The instrumental version of Yesterday is sadly appropriate for a movie in which the good times were clearly in the past. It helps that the scenes with Elderly noodles are in 1968 when the Beatles were still active though well on their way to breaking up. <br/><br/>6. Like The Corleone Family in The Godfather, I always get a kick out of seeing the main characters get the better of their opponents, whether it's a corrupt cop, a hoodlum who would kill a child or a strike-busting cop. I especially love how they use the strike-busting cop's newborn son to get the cop under their thumbs in a way without putting the baby in danger.<br/><br/>7. For the most part, this film does a great job of avoiding any accusations of being a Godfather rip-off. There's just a few moments that vaguely remind of The Godfather. For instance, the kids blackmailing a cop (who was often very hard on them) for having sex with a minor reminds me of the condescending senator in Godfather Part II who ended up under the Corleone's thumb after finding himself in bed with a dead prostitute.<br/><br/>8. I liked the scene where the kid chooses a Charlotte Russe with whipped cream over sex with Peggy. A woman's much sweeter than wine but not as sweet as good candy.<br/><br/>9. Despite nearly running 4 hours, this film is never boring and scenes never feel unnecessary. <br/><br/>10. Best Line: Dominick: Noodles, I slipped<br/><br/>Cons: 1. Rape is never a pro. The worst thing is that Noodles never really gets a comeuppance or apologizes for his actions. Though perhaps he went to the train station the next day attempting to apologize to Deborah. Carol seems delighted to meet her attackers again. While Deborah isn't happy to meet Noodles again, she doesn't tell him to get out of her sight or even mention the rape (perhaps she just put it behind her after 30 years).<br/><br/>2. I would have liked to see more of the Eve character. We don't even see her meeting Noodles, she's just there in Florida all of a sudden. It's never really indicated whether Noodles really cared about her of if she was just a substitute for Deborah. Would Noodles cheat on Eve with Deborah if he could? It seems Eve's only true purpose in the movie is to be killed so we can see how badly the bad guys want Noodles. Even if the story had been told chronologically and she didn't die in her first scene, I doubt her death would have much impact.<br/><br/>3. The relationship between Noodles and Deborah as kids is a tad confusing. She's usually very rude to him (not that you could blame her for being rude to a peeping tom) then this one moment she's tender before she does back to being rude. <br/><br/>4. Elderly Noodles tells Max he's crazy and Max responds ""You said that to me once before"". Noodles actually said it twice before: at the Florida beach and in New York shortly after Noodles makes the phone call that (he thinks) betrays Max.<br/><br/>5. In the poster for Deborah's Cleopatra play, it mentions that age could not wither her beauty. How could age affect Cleopatra? She committed suicide at age 39. Cleopatra didn't give age a chance to affect her beauty"

","Some day in the future, the history of Cinema will be written when it will cease to be an art form, having served its purpose and seen its highs and lows. On that day, Once Upon a time in America will once again be remembered as a glorious milestone in the annals of art. An epic whose dimensions still remain to be fathomed, it will remain one of the greatest films to have ever been made and the crowning glory in the career of Sergei Leone, whose legacy can be summed up as the maker of this one film, which he considered his masterpiece and which ultimately took his life when the greed of the producers and lack of institutional support led to it's unfortunate mutilation, being cut down from its original four hours run time to a detestable 140 minutes, the substance long gone and a pale shadow left behind. But history has been kind to it and the original vision of Leone has been restored and appreciated universally.<br/><br/>Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, the story revolves around four Jewish kids in Brooklyn during the early days of Prohibition who get involved in the underground liquor trade early in their lives. Among these are two dear friends Max and Noodles, played by James Woods and Robert De Niro. The film charts their successes and failures against the larger canvas of American society, trying to come to grasp with a new century and its contradictions. Four hours is a long time but you need that kind of time if you want to narrate an epic like this, because an epic is about time and its strange justice. Without time, you won't be doing an epic, you'll be narrating events without those subtle intervals of apparent silence which links facts and transforms tales to epics. Covering a period of around seventy years, the film takes us through the tumultuous period of struggle in the lives of Max and Noodles, their rise to the top of the underground trade and their fall. Their are many characters whose lives revolves around these two, including Deborah, the love of Noodles played by a young Jennifer Connelly. Deborah's Theme. a signature piece of music composed by Ennio Morricone should count as one of the most enchanting pieces of melancholy ever carved out. After the death of three of the four friends due to a misunderstanding in the prime of their youth, Robert De Niro is left alone to face the life long guilt of having caused their deaths and he leaves the city. Three decades go by with him living with his loneliness when he is invited to a mysterious party. The masterful editing makes use of brilliant back and forth between the past and the future, juxtaposing the now old Noodles with his pain and his deep past which alone provided the few moments of happiness. He has changed with time, accepted its decisions and learned to live with himself when it surfaces that his whole life has been the story of a betrayal, a betrayal by his closest friend Max who never died in that accident three decades ago, who took away his love and banished him forever to a life of agony and loneliness. One of the great scenes of this film has Noodles returning to Deborah after 35 years, asking her if she made the right decision to leave him. Her life has been no less lonely amid-st the glamour and success of being an actress and the mistress of Max. The camera cuts to a closeup of the now aged Deborah removing her makeup, revealing the ruins of time etched in her eyes, her melancholy probably redeemed only by her love for Noodles who she never thought would appear again. Two lives destroyed by a betrayal. Max is now Secretary Bailey with whom Time has now caught up and he is about to lose all his fortune and success. He wants a settling of accounts between him and Noodles and asks De Niro to kill him for having done such injustice. But time has erased Noodles's memories. He has made peace with his version of history, and the truth does not matter anymore. Perhaps his refusal to face truth is his revenge as Max is left alone to face himself without the redeeming revenge of Noodles. <br/><br/>Its a film that has a lot to say about love, revenge, betrayal and the strange role that time plays in our lives by restructuring memories in such ways that justice is no more a question of right and wrong but rather only a matter of man being punished and redeemed from within. It's inside us that justice has to be found, whether anyone else knows it or not. Man himself is his judge and Once Upon a time in America will forever remain a testament to this lofty vision of this strange species called Man."

","This is a review of the 4-hour director's cut. If you have not seen it, please do so. <br/><br/>I'm not going to go into a detailed recreation of the film. I just want to focus on what I felt was disappointing about it. I could heap loads of praise onto Leone for his cinematography, the Morricone score, even most of the acting. But those things are often discussed, and are primary reasons this film has received its overrated status.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum, you have the people who detest this film simply for its content. Specifically the rape scene in the car. They feel the need to give the film 0 stars because they disagree with an interpretation of the director's intent which they've come up with on their own. Now there's a certain amount of fairness to that, art is supposed to be interpreted and Leone agreed with this. But to simply watch the movie, be reviled by the rape but kind of okay with the rest, and then give the movie no credit whatsoever - that's also unacceptable. If you disagree on a fundamental level with what's happening on screen, then don't watch it. But then where would A Clockwork Orange be? So anyway, you could say those same words to me at the end of this - ""If you disagree, don't watch"" - but the thing is, I loved watching this movie for the first 2 hours, even knowing how incredibly disappointing it would be at the end. I watched it twice in two days. That's 8 hours. So, I'm a fan. Which is why I'm writing this.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone originally wanted to release this as two separate movies. If that would have happened, time between the release of the first half and second half might have possibly caused the audience to simply forget how loving Max (James Woods) was with his gang/best friends. From their childhood meeting until the very night that Max fakes his own death, steals all their money, and HAS THEM KILLED, he shows nothing - NOTHING - beside respect and love for them. And this is my main problem with glowing 10-star reviews of this movie - they are overlooking this huge, massive blow to the credibility of the story.<br/><br/>It's not one of those things where you can just be like ""well, you just don't understand what's happening"" - because nothing happens. Literally, the whole story up to that spot is pointing in a singular direction, and then it all changes course over a matter of a few minutes. And don't give me the whole ""Max's dad was insane"" thing... it was never written into the story in a way that was convincing or even important. You can argue just how important the times were when Max hits Noodles because he calls him crazy but that's an impulsive move, not an incredibly calculated one like what we are to told he masterminds on the fateful night. Also, if you believe that the film after the opium den is NOT a hallucination/opioid dream (I do believe it is), then you see how Max definitely is not in an insane asylum by the time he's even much older than his dad was when he was committed.<br/><br/>Max was in love with Noodles. Some say that this repressed homosexuality caused his socio- and psychopathic behavior. I think that's a long shot too. Why have every person who has ever fully accepted him as their brother killed? Max is the one who insisted that they always split the money they made evenly, now all of a sudden he wants it all for himself and is going to take it in THE MOST BRUTAL WAY POSSIBLE? It's simply too much to ask of me as a viewer.<br/><br/>People may disagree with me, but these are the reasons I am giving this movie 6 stars instead of 8,9 or even 10 if the third act trouble had been properly resolved. Honestly, even the four-hour cut I watched twice is, well, kind of a mess. And it's even more disappointing, because the first two hours are quite good."

","Childhood memories was beautiful once upon a time. As four brothers, they never abandoned each other. Noodle even sacrificed few years for revenge for his friends. Such a moving story. But if it just end like that it would not be a good movie. Why it is the best? Because it not only showed the best part of human virtue, it also showed the rotten one. Max, the big brother, dominated everything. For avarice, money and power, he killed all of his friends, the one that helped and accompanied him since he was young. This is life. With friendship, we can enjoy the best ever. We can share bitterness and happiness with them. However, betray also exist. It might make us sad but it is just what life like, ups and downs. Even though I watched it few months ago, the pictures were still clearly in my mind. The most impressive part is noodle I slipped.

"videorama-759-859391","10","2","6","9 November 2013"," The greatest mafia film you're ever likely to see
","Something has led me to believe that Sergio Leone, must be the envy of a lot of gangster film directors for bringing this once in a lifetime mafia classic to the screen, something I would of loved to experience, up there with Scarface. Every scene in this is magical as it is precious, like each fragment of a second or each piece of a finely tuned instrument. The acting is once in a lifetime spectacular, from a wonderfully chosen cast, and it's smaller players (Joe Pesci, James Russo, even Danny Aiello) The story moves back and forth through three generations of a forged friendship between four successful gangsters, plus one, shot way too young, where one of the four gangsters paid for it, while avenging his shot mate, by knifing the enemy (Russo) We move ahead in time where the avenging Noodles (Deniro) gets out and rejoins Max (Woods) and his two other mates, one being the great character actor (William Forsythe) his trademark facial, a lazy eye. The movie starts off in a few violently confronting scenes, the first one, having you hooked from the start, involving one of Deniro's floosies, who's way of death is practically mapped out for her. The next scene has the brother of a girl, Deniro's always had the hots for, being used a punching bag. Violence isn't frequent, only used when necessary, but when it happens, IT HAPPENS. I'm really not gonna tell you much more here. The film is a flawless masterpiece on many levels, photography, music score, remarkable period settings, (the New York bridge for one) etc. About every scene is treasured. I know two people who say this is their favorite movie. It may not be mine, but it's up there. This great treasured jewel of a film, you would never believe was made by the same guy responsible for those spaghetti (Clint) westerns. Leone must be having a great laugh now, for creating something so unique, it will never come this way again, and it happened in the good old year of 1985. For those, who haven't seen this film, here's my question to you: Why?"

Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. <br/><br/>Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling.

"JasparLamarCrabb","10","2","6","22 October 2012"," A masterpiece
","The 229 minute version of Sergio Leone's epic is a masterpieceÂ…so rich, so much character development (it's appalling to even remotely like Robert De Niro's Noodles as he's a degenerate/sociopath/rapist). A movie anchored by such a character is rare & Leone pulls it off in casting De Niro in a brilliant performance. James Woods gives his most sustained great performance, different from his usual bursts of yelling and nostril flailing. There is so much going on in this film it's impossible to take it all in in one viewing. It's operatic to be sure as well as a straightforward gangster film as well as an expose of how a person can become utterly corrupt chasing the American dream. The imposing supporting cast is dynamite with both Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth McGovern standing out. Weld has NEVER done anything like her nymphomaniac femme fatale, she soundly dwarfs the evil she mustered in PRETTY POISON. McGovern, who, after such a grand start, has not really had a film career of substance is shockingly good. Treat Williams, Danny Aiello and Burt Young create indelible characters despite limited screen time and the young actors playing the leads as children are outstanding (and nearly perfect younger lookalikes)."
"epat","9","2","6","8 May 2012"," Great period piece. Why'd they go & spoil it at the end?
","Sat down recently & re-watched Once Upon a Time in America, the whole nearly-4-hour epic. I soon found myself thinking what a great film it was & trying to figure out why I'd come away disappointed the first time I saw it years ago. But as the denouement came round, I remembered it was the ending that spoiled it for me.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a 30-ish ""Noodles"" (Robert de Niro) on the run, hiding out & smoking opium in a Chinese den while gangsters hunt for him in the Chinese theater that fronts it. We fade to a 50-ish Noodles arriving back in NY, where he apparently hasn't set foot in 20 years or so. Then we go into the long flashback that comprises the bulk of the film. We see him as a kid with his gang & witness his first encounter with his soon-to-be best friend, Max, & follow their exploits as they all grow up to become major gangsters during prohibition, Eventually, the rest of the gang gets set up & wiped out, Noodles hides out in the opium den and then discovers the gang's communal money cache has been cleaned out, forcing him to leave town empty-handed.<br/><br/>Then we're back in the present, where the now middle-aged Noodles looks up some surviving acquaintances & eventually catches up with Max (James Woods), who's now (under an assumed name) a pseudo-respectable businessman & politician. He's about to go down for white-collar crimes that have caught up with him tho & he invites Noodles (""the only one I can accept it from"") to be the one who kills him. But even tho he now knows Max was the one who ratted out their gang - their lifelong pals - & got them all killed, Noodles declines to shoot him. Unsatisfactory outcome, I'd say, but alright, I reluctantly accept it, that's Noodles' choice & he's a changed man & all. In any case, the movie should have stopped there.<br/><br/>But no. When Noodles leaves Max's mansion & starts to walk away, a large menacing truck starts its engine, turns on its blinding lights & starts slowly following him, making you wonder if he's about to be whacked. Then you see Max outside his gate, the truck passes him & suddenly he's no longer there. When the truck passes Noodles, we see it's a garbage truck & we're given a good long look into the back where two big macerator screws are ripping everything up & shoving it into the container.<br/><br/>This whole long slow sequence is clearly meant to be significant as hell, but I don't get it. Are we supposed to believe Max tossed himself into the truck? Or that somebody was waiting to whack him & toss him in when he so conveniently stepped outside? Or did he just go back inside & this whole truck thing is just a red herring? Or hey, maybe it's pure symbolism, man, don't you get it? Like, he's relegated to the garbage can of history. Uh-huh.<br/><br/>While we're still pondering that, we're gratuitously returned to the opium den where Noodles was hiding out at the beginning of the film. He's the same age he was back then, so evidently we're back to that point in time. What the hell's that all about? What a pointless confused ending for such an otherwise brilliant movie."
"Ali_John_Catterall","10","2","6","22 November 2009"," Gunsmoke and mirrors
","To call Sergio Leone's opium-scented labyrinthine gangster epic 'a bit of a downer' would be both an understatement and an injustice to this remarkable, cinematic tone-poem, relating how organised crime played a role in shaping Modern America. It's true, this is a very long, very sad film encompassing child murder, prostitution, graphic rape, terrible betrayal, and the weary recollections of a pathetic, broken old man. It's also unmistakably, tremendously alive, and alert to the possibilities of narrative (non-linear) and form (pure artistry in every frame). Often, it makes The Godfather look like an episode of The Bill. And, at its close, contains a shot at something like redemption. Though, like the opium den to which Robert De Niro's mobster retreats, that too may all just be smoke and mirrors."
"ctg0724","6","2","6","30 June 2007"," Huh?
","I think I'm good at understanding movies, but this one really messes with me. And it's not even that kind of movie. Everything is supposed to make sense at the end.<br/><br/>So many things didn't make sense to me. Why was the mafia after Noodles the night Prohibition fell? Why did Joe Pesci's character show up at the hospital? Who was the person that was supposed to be the body of Max? Why did Max end up with Deborah? Was the young guy supposed to be Noodles's son? I don't know, I guess I was just expecting the story to be closer to being like the Godfather. I know it's a stupid thing to say since this was its own movie but still, it was so not what I thought it was going to be.<br/><br/>Still, it wasn't necessarily a bad movie. The environment for the time settings was great. James Woods matched Robert DeNiro in perfect performances. Cinematography pretty good.<br/><br/>Growing up with Tarantino, Rodriguez, and Nolan, next to Orson Wells I'd say Sergio Leone is the true inventor of non chronological film. I will have to watch Once Upon A Time In The West now."

","Ok i admit i'm not the most objective in that i think a superfluous amount of gangster/crime movies have been made. However i can recognise the inherent qualities of godfather 1+2, scarface and goodfellers, qualities that are in no way present in this film. The biggest problem is the lack of a coherent plot and as far as i can tell the ending is pretty meaningless. The time jump toward the end (Where James Woods and Deniro's characters are old with the worst make up ever to illustrate this fact)led me to a conclusion that is out of touch with the direction the movie was originally going. A twist in a movie is fine but it must make some semblance of sense within the parameters set my the intro and middle of a movie.<br/><br/>I was not drawn in by the characters or the plot which inevitably leaves a viewer bored.

First it was 10 stars and then it was 7 and now it's 5. The movie isn't good on a rewatch and the pacing is incredibly slow with some scenes stay way past their welcome.

"peeedeee-94281","5","1","2","16 November 2019"," Just Okay, Fans of the Gangster Genre Probably Won't Like It
","I watched the theatrical cut many years ago on TV. I think I enjoyed it, but I don't recall it being so memorable to the point that I needed to get an updated version on DVD or Blu Ray.
So I recently watched this almost 4 hour original director's cut version, and I must say that it was kind of dull.
There were some parts that were good. Seeing how things started off as kids was interesting enough. Then there was the second era when Noodles gets out of jail and they really start amping up their activities. But then the movie just seems to go nowhere. Also, we get this mafia character played by Joe Pesci who seems like he's going to be a big part of this film, but then he just disappears. Okay, we seem him once more later. I was under the impression these friends were working for some big mob types, hence their connections and money. But as the movie goes on, it just seems like they're still a bunch of hooligans trying to figure out what they want to do.
And then there were the random or overly long scenes, like the whole Danny Aiello sequence, or those long moments between the adult Noodles and Deborah where we see absolutely no chemistry between them. Just dragged on and on.
The final act, to me, just didn't make any sense either. How did Noodles not even know Max was still alive?!!! Come on, the guy was a Senator for crying out loud. He didn't even try to change his appearance by wearing a mustache. Noodles would have known about him from seeing him in the paper or TV, especially with such a scandal brewing. Was Noodles living on a desert island all these years? They never explain that either. I just thought he was in Buffalo, which is where he bought his bus ticket to.
Ultimately, it feels like this movie was one long setup for a twist that didn't even feel believable. It has a lot of good moments, but overall, could definitely use some serious trimming. I'll have to search for the studio edit version to see if that actually helped it out. Just an okay film, and too slow moving to really be part of the same genre as films like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino etc...Maybe a bit more like A Bronx Tale? Just not as well told."

"bullett-3","9","1","2","28 December 1999"," A gangster movie thats really a life long love story.
","A true classic.  Recently I had the ocassion to see the entire movie for the third time. The first time I loved it.  It told a story of how a young gangster, jailed, beaten, betrayed, and inevitably grown old, could simple accept the fate that befalls him and find an inner peace from it all. I quickly realized this film was not really about criminals in America at all.  It was about love lost,  friendships betrayed,  the hard reality of business and the even harder reality of ""making it"" in America. The second time I saw the film my wife fell asleep.  You see the movie is not about murder, or gangsterism, or explosions.  She could not allow the movie to evolve. She(like too many moviegoers) needed instant gratification. She needed a certain number of murders, deaths, and explosions in the first half hour to keep her attention.  Leone does not give us that here.  He gives a storyline that jumps back and forth in time over a period of about 30 years.  This style needs time to unfold. By the time I finished watching the film for the third time I realized just what a complex, rich film Leone had made.  I saw things I had not noticed before, and was left with the same questions as before. Life does not resolve all issues. Leone does not resolve them here. The characters are still left confused, at a loss, and unfullfilled even after 30 years and a four hour movie. Such is life,  and not just for gangsters. The character played by DeNiro is the one who at the end seemingly has obtained the most peace,  although he is also the one who has suffered the most.  He's betrayed, banished, and lost his life's love. He appears to be impoverished.  But he enacts no revenge.  He does not come home and mow down everyone who has betrayed him.  In fact he seems to not even acknowledge that his old loves are still alive. Or does he? His demeanor at the end....is that one of indifference or is he just following the old wisdom......""Revenge is a dish best served cold"".  We never find out. Although revenge is unquestionable handed out. Right?  Or was that just another disappearing act by the Woods character?  We never find out. And what has Noodles been doing for thirty years? And what happened to the million dollars?  And did Max trick Noodles into the first betrayal, or was that simple something Max could do on his own?  And most important of all...did the McGovern character really love Max all these years, as he loved her, or did she just play him,  and then betray him..... In the end it does not matter..... Not all lifes questions are answered.  No one here rides off into the sunset. The characters, with all their shortcomings just accept the fates,  and attempt to derive some peace out of it all. DeNiro, Woods, McGovern, all play their parts perfectly. They age appropriately. The only negative I could find about this movie is the final 10 minutes.  What happened?  Did they write themselves into corner and had no way out? And why have DeNiro back in the opium den...........30 years younger again?  It lent nothing to the movie. All in all however a wonderfull movie, which I will see a fourth time.  With a slightly less convoluted script, and a better ending, this movie would have been a nine.  As it is its an EIGHT AND ONE HALF."

Really wrecked an otherwise good movie. The live or ambient music, such as the live music at the end of prohibition was perfect. Exactly right. It's that syrupy melody that gets me right in the ear drum. The rape scene between Dinero and Elizabeth McGovern was disturbing. I kept expecting the shot would cut away.

","This film has its visually beautiful moments, poignant scenes, and revealing dialogue -- very few, scattered one per ten minutes of viewing. It also has mindless gore, unrealistic rape, and laughable motivation -- lots of them. Read another review for details.<br/><br/>So, why was this film made rather than a much better one?<br/><br/>In ""High Noon,"" the tenuous social institutions can't stand up to a few bad guys; the institutions are weak, though not evil. Ditto for ""Who Shot Liberty Valence."" We resort to individual violence as a last resort against evil. <br/><br/>That's not the case here. Institutions are strong, just evil. Cops are on the take, protect scabs, ignore crime, while bosses hire gangsters to machine-gun union organizers, politicians organize business and union fronts for crime. It's everyone for themselves. There is no morality, just the strong and the weak. The time in ""Once Upon a Time in America"" runs from the start of Prohibition to end of the sixties, so this is most of 20th century America, including a period where they had some of the strongest, most responsive institutions in world history.<br/><br/>It is not America itself that is of interest here -- 35 years of history are skipped over without a mention and another 12 years get only passing reference. There is a perception of something about America, something about those American westerns and gangster movies of someone's childhood otherwise spent under oppressive European institutions, something freeing about amorality and lack of social control, something justifying disobedience and adolescent rebellion. I am reminded of ""Love Actually"" and the character certain that if he gets to America girls will love his British accent and fall into bed with him. In the film, they do. And in this film, America is supposed to swoon over the Italian schoolboy daydreaming his American Gangster life."
"disinterested_spectator","10","2","7","8 February 2015"," Life Is an Opium Dream
","Early in ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" Noodles remembers how he used to stand on a toilet and peek through a crack to watch Debra dancing in the storeroom where there were sacks of flour. The dust from the flour creates a haze, giving the scene a dreamlike quality. She dances to ""Amapola,"" a song comparing a pretty girl to a poppy, the flower from which opium is derived. Together these elements form a constellation of themes running through this movie: Debra/dream/love/opium.<br/><br/>Debra knows that Noodles is watching her, and she surprises him by opening the door, calling him a roach, and saying, ""That record's just like Ex-Lax. Every time I put it on, you have to go to the bathroom."" It is to be noted that she does not enter the bathroom. Later in the movie, Noodles goes into another bathroom and sits down on the toilet, unlocking the door when he realizes Peggy is coming, so that he can expose himself to her. Unlike Debra, Peggy walks right in, and Noodles spreads his legs. He gets up from the toilet and starts making sexual advances. She says she is about poop in her pants, after which she plops down on the toilet he just got up from, telling him to get out. In fact, throughout the movie there are innumerable references to garbage, excrement, and anal sex. Taken together, all this leads to an opposing constellation of themes: Noodles/reality/sex/filth.<br/><br/>As the movie jumps back and forth in time, it always seems to heading toward the end of Prohibition. When Noodles and Max first become friends, Prohibition has only recently been the law of the land. Their friendship comes to an end just before the repeal of Prohibition becomes effective, when Noodles believes he has caused the death of Max.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Noodles' love for Debra begins around the same time, in the early days of Prohibition, and his dream of marrying her comes to an end when he brutally rapes her. The next day, he sees her depart on a train. He looks at a newspaper, the headline of which announces the end of Prohibition. This is regarded by some critics as a goof, because in subsequent scenes, reference is made to the fact that Prohibition has not ended yet, though it soon will.<br/><br/>However, a scene occurring many years later, in 1968, makes it clear that this connection to the end of Prohibition is not intended to be understood realistically. Noodles finds out that Max is still alive. As he is leaving Max's mansion, there is the mysterious scene with the garbage truck, followed by what appears to be a bunch of revelers in a car made in the 1920s, as we hear the song ""God Bless America."" The sounds they make and the background music being played are identical to what we heard at the beginning of the movie, as Eve prepared to enter her apartment. They are the sounds of people celebrating the end of Prohibition. In other words, even in 1968, it still seems to be the end of Prohibition. That is because what happens in 1968 is actually just a dream, a dream that is taking place at the end of Prohibition. One problem with this theory, however, is that Noodles would not know about 1968 technology, like television.<br/><br/>In any event, Prohibition is the period during which Max and Noodles were great friends, and when Noodles' love for Debra was still something pure and beautiful. The end of Prohibition is the end of both his friendship with Max and his hopes of marrying Debra, and that is why it takes on such significance in this movie.<br/><br/>After Noodles rapes Debra, he tries to forget what he did by spending time in an opium den. This is referred to, but not seen. We do see two scenes of him in the opium den, however, both of them being after he thinks he has killed Max. The first time is at the beginning of the movie, where we see him leaving; the second time is at the end of the movie, where we see him entering. Bookending the movie in this way, with the leaving being seen in the beginning and the arriving at the end, we are encouraged to see the movie as Noodles' opium dream. As his dream takes place at the end of Prohibition, the scenes set in the future are not real, but only part of his wish-fulfilling dream. In that dream, he denies the reality of Max's death, and imagines that it was really Max who betrayed him. Furthermore, by having Debra be Max's lover, and the mother of Max's child, his dream makes it appear that she betrayed Noodles, in a sense, thereby alleviating his guilt over having raped her.<br/><br/>When Noodles raped Debra, he dragged her out of the dream/love/opium constellation into his own world of reality/sex/filth, because he was angry that she was leaving him, instead of marrying him, as he had always hoped. In a similar way, when he convinces himself in his dream that it was really Max who betrayed him, he gets his revenge by dreaming that Max jumps into a garbage truck, where he is ground up and turned into garbage himself.<br/><br/>In the final scene, which is in the opium den, we see Noodles get his first drag on the opium pipe. The expression that suddenly appears on his face is one of happiness, but it is only the false kind of happiness that opium provides, a temporary illusion that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. By extension, life itself is just so much filth, and what little happiness we find is like that produced by opium."
"moviefiend!","6","2","7","29 August 2010"," Overrated...
","I've seen better gangster movies. The artistic style of the director drags some scenes along waaaayyy too long. At times it seems as though you're watching a daytime soap opera. The rape scene wasn't just hard to watch because of the content. It was hard to watch because after about 30 seconds I'm thinking to myself, ""enough already, we get it!"" The other issue I had with this one was the flashforwards and flashbacks intertwined with DeNiro's character. At times it was hard initially to recognize which time period the film had shifted into from one scene to the next. This is especially true at the end of the movie when one female character appears to not have aged a day. <br/><br/>It's not worth your time to watch the director's cut.

","I saw this film when it first came out and it did seem like a masterpiece, powerful often shocking and different to any other film that was made in the early to mid eighties.However watching the film the other day i could only notice its flaws and it didn't seem such a classic. 1,It seems far too long,pointless scenes with lots of talking are really dragged out and you wonder why? 2,Nearly all of the female characters have really shocking low morals to the point where their not believable and you feel its just where the film is trying to add sex to spice things up.And the only female who has any decency gets raped. 3,None of the characters are likable,so you don't really care what happens to them. 4,The music doesn't seem to fit the scenes and is played far too much to the point where it becomes annoying. 5,Deborah as a child had brown eyes then as an adult she develops blue eyes.And none of the other grownup members of the gang look anything like the teenagers they were supposed to be. I know this all sounds very nit-picky as on the whole it is a very well made film,the settings are good,the costumes are great and so is most of the acting.From a historical point of view its very interesting as it shows you how people lived back in the early 30's during the prohibition and depression years.But on the whole i don't feel its the classic i once thought it was."

","Once upon a time in America has left me somewhat confused.<br/><br/>On the one hand it has all the elements of a great film, an atmosphere comparable to that of the Godfather, a first class cast, set in one of the most filmed about era of our century (prohibition) and it described a tried friendship through the decades a friendship we would all dream to have so strong and solid untouched and unspoiled by time and temptation.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the pace, the way the timeline swifted to past and present along with the ""ending"" left me with a somewhat sore feeling.<br/><br/>Perhaps by watching it again I might appreciate it more, but the first impression is above average."

","Once Upon a Time in America is the perfect example of a Hollywood film that you hate to love. An obedient film lover will make a list of many reasons why this movie is great. Why it should be on your list of movies to watch and why it should be considered an important work of cinema can be debated and defended time and time again. Still, many will agree that the movie falls short in many ways to be considered a classic. Fans and critics will both agree that Once Upon a Time in American will easily confuse its audience without hardly any trouble. A period piece that jumps around from decade to decade will alone make the time-line confusing to any audience. Throw in character motivation and you have a roller coaster of confusion and endless questioning. With a blockbuster cast of some of the most talented names in Hollywood, and a legendary film maker, it's hard to acknowledge that the end result would be anything less that great. With Once Upon a Time in America, it is just that. Many will support the imperfectness that the movie is by showcasing the several different edited versions and why the final version came to being. Then again, whether or not each version tells a different story, the overall structure of the story still remains. No matter if we have 3 hour or 6 hour version, we are still left with empty characters from the very beginning. With all its faults and mystery that both versions have, the plot, the theme and many of its characters have holes. The potential Once Upon a Time in America had with its reach as a cinematic triumph, falls short from anything spectacular. What could have been one of the best 'American' films, falls among the many mobster flicks which does not do this movie justice. Although the cons do outweigh the pros, the movie holds up with many moments of beauty."

","A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan over thirty years later, where he once again must confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.<br/><br/>The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut 4 hours & 11 minutes running time.<br/><br/>Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.<br/><br/>What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is an absolute joy to behold. This is one of the best De Niro performances.While an unlikeable character, Noodles is a very interesting study of a broken life. He is matched every step of the way by an exceptional James Woods as Max. Woods has said that this is his favourite performance of his. The younger cast members, including a 12 year-old Jennifer Connelly, are especially effective during the flashback sequences.<br/><br/>The combination of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone is epic and the mix of actors are outstanding. Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting."

","I am doubtful about this movie. <br/><br/>It is certainly a classic; it is at times beautiful,moving and insightful- but I felt it was somehow unequal. A sequence of great scenes and a rigorous construction; but also a number of plot elements and twists I don't know how to feel about. <br/><br/>Just off the top of my head- <br/><br/>How come Bugsy just randomly starts shooting in broad daylight, with the cops just one block away? Is he stupid? You don't do things like that. <br/><br/>How is it that after some ten years Noodles comes out of prison to immediately rejoin his gang as if nothing happened? Sure, it's possible, but a lot of things change in that time- especially if you're a teenager; I don't know, it was just too natural. <br/><br/>What line of business are the guys actually in? They seem to do hits, robberies but also booze-traffic and are involved with the union too. Yet at the same time they just work for themselves, no bosses, no gang. You don't get to do that kind of things; unions are not doing business with four thugs who haven't got their backs covered; you don't get to just buy and sell stuff like alcohol during the Prohibition or drugs nowadays; you don't get to gun down Mafia members and then walk around as if nothing happened. It's a rather common thing even with the best crime movies that the script is not quite sure about what the heroes do- they're just 'gangsters', and that should include all.(ex. in The Departed, you have Jack Nicholson selling military information to the Chinese & also driving drugs around himself in the trunk of his car & also collecting protection money from the local shop; so what is he? Big Boss, supposedly, and yet acts as a foot soldier sometimes...)."

","Now what are the main assets of daddy Leone's gangster epic? The mere beauty of so much in this movie—frames, faces, encounters, scenes, lines, places, tears, the vertiginous spiral of the misdeeds, rapes, then the fatigue and the exhaustion of a tamed oldster; the raw vitality; in a single breath—the awesome photography, engrossing music and golden performances from an impossibly fine cast, as only such gangster epics are set to gather; the crude and violent sexuality; the forceful epic sweep; the sharp naturalism and the frankness, the brutality and the richness and depth of the factual and psychological material; and a Neanderthalian as a leading character, De Niro in a persona he won't put down anymore—the unsubtle, ignominious low—life and street—wise beast . Well here are then at least six such assets that make Leone's epic such a mind—bending movie and experience; I mean this is the only Leone movie—and one of the few American movies—to be EXPERIENCED.<br/><br/>Intentionally, De Niro's character spends the almost entire movie as a soulless, insensitive, two—dimensional, heinous and mean thug. He's not glamorized—he's not glamorized as Scorsese will glamorize basically the same raw and two—dimensional persona in CASINO. Leone films a gallery of crudely self—assertive beasts; De Niro's character spends all his youth and mature age being the same street—wise egoist jerk, unable of a drip of humanity. As in the best of Balzac, the change comes in circumstances UN-narrated and perhaps prosaic, outside the narration, in a discontinuity of the narration, and perhaps it isn't a bettering or an improvement but simply the crushing exhaustion brought by life. Noodles is not a hero; he's a thug, an animal, mindless brute—the root of everything De Niro will go on being in movies—Cady and the others .

","Once again, after waiting about a year, I watched the Director's cut of this movie. I've watched it about six times over the past 20 years. And once again I have no idea why I like it so much. It is so disjointed and filled with so many unresolved sub-plots, undeveloped characters and ludicrous situations that it should be classified as abstract, even non-objective art. If it weren't for Morricone's wonderful music, I would not have watched it a second time, much less a sixth. <br/><br/>I'm not an unwashed Philistine, with no culture or taste, but I'm damned if I know why this film is regarded so highly. And why I will most likely watch it again in the future. <br/><br/>It has some indefinable charisma. The music,the photography and the scattered storyline somehow come together and create an entrancing, compelling movie that really, in the long run, goes nowhere. I gave it a 9. I held back the last number because the movie still leaves me frustrated at the end."

","This film is amazing because it takes you through a whole gamet of emotions. It is also one of the very few movies you can watch and re watch again and again. <br/><br/>Yawn - At times it is excruciatingly slow. Everything from De Niro's walking pace to the unfolding of little episodes of drama is unravelled extremely precisely and slowly. With most directors you get a quick close up of an actors face and then a cut back to the drama. With Leone each close up is a self portrait with the camera fixed on the face and recording even the subtlest gesture or expression. I'm not knocking this but it is occasionally demanding especially to a modern audience used to fast technology and instant messages. Fortunately the wonderful score relieves the boredom. <br/><br/>Gasp - Gasp at the absolutely beautiful cinematography. The street scenes are really brought to life by the width and depth of the shot and further enhanced by that majestic, sweeping score. Gasp at some of the many standout stylistic touches that Leone includes, which include the high pull back shot of a room full of babies crying accompanied by that exhilarating score and the the head on shot of the boy running in slow mo towards the camera with the pan flute cranked up, so unbelievably stylish. <br/><br/>Sigh - at the general confusion of a narrative which is about as linear and straightforward as a triangular road with large holes in it. The out of sequence time-frame means you're pulled in one direction and then another and leaves you afterwards with the feeling that the ""Usual Suspects"" was a simple tale which your hard of hearing Granny could understand in a late night viewing. I mean one minute you've got an ever changing suitcase the next you've got a frisbee being thrown. I'm surprised that Leone didn't then cut to a dog barking in an open field as a metaphor for confusion and randomness. <br/><br/>Repeat - Its amazing that despite the muddy plot line and slowness of the unfolding drama you become almost addicted to it and go back for repeated viewings. There are 4 main reasons I feel for this: <br/><br/>The beautiful poignant score The charismatic performance of James Woods Those stylish, amazing standout shots Unravelling the mystery that is OUATIA."
"ackstasis","9","1","3","27 June 2007"," ""I like the stink of the streets. It cleans out my lungs.""
","The director's final film, Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a spectacular sprawling epic of the lives of a group of Jewish Prohibition-era gangsters, witnessed through the memory of one member, Noodles (Robert De Niro), many decades afterward. Grand in both conception and execution, the film brilliantly combines flawless acting, a poetic script, stunning cinematography and a memorable musical score from long-time Leone-collaborator, Ennio Morricone. Despite weighing in at a hefty 229 minutes (Leone had originally envisioned a 6-hour epic), the film never fails to hold the audience's interest, flashing backwards and forwards between three eras in Noodle's life in an almost dream-like fashion, offering a compelling and comprehensive glimpse into his years as a gangster.<br/><br/>If you're planning on watching this film, it is absolutely imperative  at least for your first viewing  that you track down the 4-hour version, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984 and was seen throughout most of Europe. For its American release, the film was infamously massacred into a heavily-cut, fully-chronological 139-minute version, which became a marked critical and commercial flop and failed to garner a single Oscar nomination. Fortunately, the European version has gained greater prominence over the years, and is now quite easily obtained on DVD.<br/><br/>The film is mostly inspired by an autobiographical novel, 'The Hoods,' written by a gangster-turned-informant under the pseudonym Harry Grey. Leone has wanted to adapt the novel since the 1960s, but had long been unable to secure the rights. Interweaving three chapters of the characters' lives  1921, 1933 and 1968  the film focuses primarily on two main characters: the quiet, reflective David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (played by Scott Tiler as a child, and Robert De Niro as an adult) and the very ambitious, quick-tempered Max Bercovicz (Rusty Jacobs as a child, James Woods as an adult). Also significant are the other younger members of the gang: Patsy (Brian Bloom, James Hayden), Cockeye (Adrian Curran, William Forsythe) and Dominic (Noah Moazezi), as well as Noodles' long time love interest, Deborah (Jennifer Connelly as a child, and Elizabeth McGovern as an adult). In 1968, after thirty-five years in hiding, Noodles returns to New York City to confront his past and the death of his long-time acquaintances, for whose death he blames himself.<br/><br/>The acting in 'Once Upon A Time in America' is absolutely stellar, with highly-dependable leading men De Niro and Woods delivering brilliant performances as life-long friends in a constantly changing personal and professional relationship. The success of the film also hinged largely on the skills of the younger actors, who would be forced to carry lengthy sequences of the narrative on their own. Perhaps surprisingly, they each give assured performances that are very much equal to that of the acting veterans, with particular praise going to Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs and Jennifer Connelly (the now-famous actress who, at just fourteen years of age, was making her cinematic debut). Morricone's low-key but very effective soundtrack, largely employing the use of a pan flute, is soft and reflective, very suited to the sombre tone of the film.<br/><br/>At nearly four hours in length, 'Once Upon a Time in America' is not a film that you can just sit down and watch at any time. It requires a little bit of patience and dedication, efforts that will not go unrewarded. When it was released  much to the director's disgust  critics touted the film as ""a Jewish 'Godfather.'"" Perhaps this was not what Leone particularly had in mind, but many parallels can be drawn between the themes and subject matter of these films, and it is highly likely that fans of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces will also thoroughly enjoy this film."

","what a self-indulgent, self-pitying hero for a three-and-a-half-hour movie - Robert de Niro as Noodles grown up goes around, thinking, oh, what has America come to, crime isn't enchanted the way it was when i was a kid. and the movie goes with him - it's a shrine to his feelings and his lost childhood. it's the first two 'Godfather' movies turned into kitsch, or 'The Great Gatsby' without Nick, told from, say, Daisy's point of view. there are lost of questions that a cynical viewer could ask himself and smirk at, like, what has Noodles been doing for 20-odd years? just farting around, thinking about his lost childhood? but you don't ask those questions while your watching, or, you do but your still blown away by it. it's a great movie movie, full of brilliant set-pieces. my favorite is the one where Noodles rapes Deborah (inexplicably, at least to me) in the back of a moving car, and then the driver, disgusted, stops the car and makes Noodles get out and drives away, and Noodles is stranded in a wealthy, wealthy neighbourhood at dawn, and it's deserted and the dew is on the grass. mmmm. there's something about this mixture of kids and the first half of the 20th century and crime and sex and opium and lost friendship and mystery and sadness and failure that really touches my imagination, in the same way that Doctorow's 'Billy Bathgate' did. this movie is the opposite of realistic. Pauline kael used the word 'billowing' to describe it, and that's the perfect word for all Sergio Leone movies - at some level, they're all ridiculous, but they're beautifully made and structured and very distinctive. the Ennio Morricone score is the best movie score i have ever heard, and it fits the movie perfectly. there's one big flaw i think: teeny little jennifer connelly, incredibly beautiful even as a little girl, as young Deborah, doesn't seem like a trained actress, her line readings have a hollow, amateurish sound, but she has such a vivid presence anyway that Elizabeth McGovern as the adult Deborah is really disappointing. you want McGovern to live up to Connelly, not the other way around. they don't match at all. and ps i know i sound like Pauline kael. it's a curse."

","""Once upon a time in America"" is one of those movies you remember for a long time after watching. The story is very interesting. It is based on the phenomenon ""friendship"" presenting the good beginning, the excellent and funny growing and finally the inglorious ending, in the world of political and financial profits.<br/><br/>Its special directing makes it further more complicated. The exchanging of scenes that are not consecutive in time, the going through one scene to another with that special way that only great directors as Sergio Leone know, the starting and ending with the same scene,with spectator's knowledge being the only difference, are some of the reasons I am fascinated! It is a film that makes the spectator use his/her mind. However some chapters move on a very slow rhythm that may become mortal.<br/><br/>I think that the title fits the story. Noodles needs to go some years back, to remember what happened ""once upon a time"", to realize who is the betrayed and who is the betrayer. ""Once upon a time"" he had friends, that he doesn't have now."
"derrickvanschie","Null","1","3","18 October 2004"," A tale about America: a model of a corrupt society
","In addition to the comments made on this site about this great film I would like to state something about one aspect of it. <br/><br/>Last Friday I watched the movie (the long European version) for the third time in about 10 years and this time I was struck mostly by Leone's very grim vision on American society. <br/><br/>Besides the very profound study of all its main characters there is an equally dark insight on society as a whole, and the title being as it is one can only assume that Leone wants to say something about how he sees the United States. <br/><br/>This storyline particularly surfaces in the part concerning the union's dispute in which Noodles' gang take side with union leader Jimmy O'Donnell and another gang are employed (the Italian Mob?) by the police and the powers that be. It's not that Noodles and Max are very concerned with the underprivileged workers but simply chose the option that helps improve their own position. <br/><br/>After the dispute is settled in their favor the option is given to Noodles and Max to go legal, Noodles doesn't want it: He sees himself as a crook and doesn't like the hypocrisy of the people who have the real power. He doesn't want to be part of that. For Max joining the elite is his true ambition. He knows that Noodles doesn't want to follow him so he uses his maniacal genius to set up up his reincarnation as a 'bona fide' politician. The insane plan of robbing the Federal Bank (which Noodles wants to obstruct to save Max's life) is just a smoke screen. <br/><br/>Leone wants to show us that in the higher parts of American society the line between good and bad is very thin, if not nonexistent. There are just people who have power and people who don't but aspire it. How that power is obtained doesn't matter as long as you keep your dirty deeds out of the public eye.<br/><br/>Of course it does not only concern America, It can be implied to many, if not most civilizations and nations in history, not least Leone's own country of birth, Italy. <br/><br/>But the fact that Max -or Secretary Bailey as he is then known- chooses to dispose of himself by jumping in a huge garbage truck called Mack marked with typically American decorations can only be seen as a symbolic act: Of course this truck is not actually real and neither is the genius cross fade between it's taillights and the incoming headlights of the 30's style convertible filled with partying people, but that's the beauty of film! It can only be regarded as a personal statement by the writers.<br/><br/>and director."

","Everyone is trying to compare this movie to 'goodfellas' and 'the godfather' because they are all gangster movies.  It seems that people fail to realize that these are vastly different movies.  ""Goodfellas"" excelled at its excellent direction and cinematography; ""godfather"" with its awesome performances and a great script.  However, neither one of these movies offer as much thermatic impact over its audience like ""america"".  I guess lots of movie audience will be scared away from the rich themes of friendship, betrayal, love, regret that are displayed in multilayers in ""america"". The movie forces its audience to immerse deep with its main characters and do some soul searching after reviewing.  I watched the movie about 8-10 times in the last 12 years and simply could not forget noodles and max.<br/><br/>Great story, great direction, tremendous acting from De Niro, Woods, to the young actors like Scot Tiler and Rusty Jacobs. The cinematography is wonderful, and art direction/set desing is awesome.  Throw in the best soundtrack of all time and you get a rare masterpiece right here.  This is a movie that I will rank along with 'passions of joan arc', 'bicycle thief', 'decalogue', 'casablanca', 'andrew rublev', 'berlin alexander square', '400 blows', 'tokyo story' and 'seven samurai' as one of the best movies of all time.

","This is a 6 hour epic that was cut down to 4 hours for it's initial release and then butchered down to 2 hours and 15 minutes for it's showing in the U.S.  Fortunately, I caught the 4 hour version on HBO and ran off to buy it. The plot-line (and I won't go into it in depth) involves four friends from the slums of Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th century who rise to become big-time Jewish gangsters.  Like Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, these are violent, wicked men, propelled by their lusty desires and big appetites - yet honest and loyal to themselves and true to their own arcane code, and yes, their deep love for each other. The story jumps forwards and backwards like a piece of cloth being run through a sewing machine - like ""Catch-22"" you never know when the present really is. Try to comprehend it all and you'll be lost - see it as an opium dream, and it begins to make sense.  I only wish Leone were still alive to restore the film to the length he might have envisioned.  Then perhaps we'd know what Treat Williams, Tuesday Weld and Joey Pesci were supposed to be doing there.  The sets are magnificent, the music haunting.  De Niro is in fine fettle in a role that the late John Garfield was born to play and James Woods as his life-long best friend holds his own in scenes where they square off mano-a-mano.  And don't overlook that endlessly ringing phone that makes your teeth itch, a motif Leone used in both ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.""  Overcome by its own greatness, like ""Apocalypse Now,"" or Michaelangelo's ""St Matthew,"" this film can be viewed as a magnificent failure."

","Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (3 hour and 49 minute version) is a beautifully paced art piece. The film jumps between time periods, masterfully blending three different zeitgeists. The detail placed in this film is brilliant. The story takes its' time to get where it needed to be. While the film is long, it feels as if there's more than one movie within this film. Leone makes the film feel like a trilogy or bilogy of sorts, when he tells different stories from multiple eras. The set/environments of the film are very stylish. The set and environment expand and become more vibrant with the story overtime. Leone successfully transitions us from a period of immigrants in New York in the early 1900s, to the prohibition era, to a more modern period. The film tells a different story of America for a specific group. As these characters grow, so does the country and its' conflict. The characters within this film are very relatable, in the sense that their lives represent our elevation or descent into our later years. Despite their deplorable actions, the characters are all charismatic and engaging. The dialogue between characters is natural. The acting in this film is great. The younger cast and their older counterparts transition these characters in a cohesive manner. It's as if you're actually watching the younger cast grow into their older selves. Robert De Niro and James Woods do a fantastic job in their roles. Their acting is phenomenal. The cinematography is great, with shots that feel as if they were ripped from a Picasso painting or a Michelangelo sculpture. The shots in this film are masterful, with few exceptions. The storytelling keeps you engaged for the most part. The only exception is after the intermission. After the intermission, the film feels a little boring and fruitless at times. It could have been done in a manner of ease, however it feels crammed in with the rest of the film. The film is very long (depending on what version you watch). However, it's a great film. Overall, Once Upon a Time in America is a classic mob movie that encompasses an artistic vision with timeless storytelling."

","I am aware that those who rave over Once Upon a Time in America will find my gentle reproach a clear sign of the ignorance of philistines. But let us be perfectly frank: many of the scenes are larded with fat which could easily have been cut, increasing the pace and even leaving space to set up the surprise ending rather than dropping it in like (the filmmaker´s cardinal sin) a deus ex machina.<br/><br/>The scenes of the youngsters in New York City evoke immediate memories of The Godfather, part 2, but that comparison did not help but harmed this viewer´s reception of Leone´s alleged chef d´oeuvre, because similar scenes in Coppola´s work are so much better plotted and paced. The true accomplishment of this work is to persuade viewers to sympathize and identify with murderers and rapists--pretty impressive that we find ourselves not hating but liking the main characters at the end. Both Robert DeNiro and James Woods gave excellent performances.<br/><br/>I do not have a problem with extra-long films, if there is a reason for their length (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now...). As far as I am concerned, the surest sign that Once Upon a Time in America is not a bona fide masterpiece is that I had to watch it over three nights to get through it. Good, but not great."

"Bored_Dragon","10","1","4","24 October 2018"," ""The pleasure is all mine""
","This was originally conceived as a six-hours long movie in two parts, but the producers forced Leone to reduce its length. There are several versions of this film and it is interesting that the same critic who declared two and a half hours long version as the worst film of the year, a few years later declared the version of three hours and forty-nine minutes as the best movie of the '80s. No one saw the original version of six hours, and at nine o'clock last evening I finally sat to watch the directors cut of little over four hours. I finished it at five in the morning. I paused it a few times to let the impressions settle, rewound many scenes several times to make sure that I understood them well, or that I did not miss a single detail, or simply because I wanted to see them again. And when the movie was over, I had that feeling that usually occurs after the last episode of your favorite series that you've been following for years.<br/><br/>The film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel ""The Hoods"" by Harry Grey, a former gangster, and it describes the path of a group of Jewish mobsters, since childhood in the streets of New York in the early twenties, through the rise in Prohibition, to the epilogue in the late sixties. The camera and directing are, expectedly, fantastic, and many of the scenes and details in the film are Leone's homage to gangster films from the first half of the twentieth century, but the story itself was nothing special to me. All the time while watching, I thought I'd rate it a seven or eight. But now, when it's over, I miss it. The film has a moderate pace, and the events are carefully weighed that at no time do they look movie-like, so that the story is very realistic and life-like. And the characters ... The characters are so well written and played that they feel real, and you will experience them as people you know and as if you are at every moment with them, somewhere just outside the reach of the camera. This is not surprising when you take into account that almost all the major roles are entrusted to Oscar-winning actors or those who have at least been nominated for this award.<br/><br/>Two leading roles are played by Robert De Niro, who has two Oscars behind him, five nominations and over a hundred roles, and James Woods, with two nominations and over one hundred forty roles. There are also Elizabeth McGovern and Tuesday Weld, with one nomination each, Burt Young with one nomination and over one hundred sixty roles, Oscar-winning legend Joe Pesci, a man born to play villain William Forsythe with over one hundred forty roles, Mario Brega who played in all Leone's films, and many other famous faces.<br/><br/>Leone's swan song is at the same time the first feature film of Jennifer Connelly, which was a stepping stone for the successful career of this Oscar-winning actress. Apart from acting skill, Jennifer is, especially to the male part of the audience, also known by the sexy body that she does not hesitate to show on the big screen. At the audition for the role of Deborah, Jennifer was less than twelve years old, and when the film was released in theaters she was fourteen. Although the credits state the name of the double who replaces Jennifer in the nude scene, some sources say that the scene was filmed with minor Jennifer, and that the name of the double is a scam to avoid legal consequences. It's a scene where Deborah gets undressed after exercising ballet (the ballet scene is inspired by Edgar Dega's paintings) and in which we see her only from behind, so I can not say anything with certainty, but it didn't seem like a double to me.<br/><br/>And of course, we must not forget the greatest surprise this movie brings - the music was done by, you won't believe this, Ennio Morricone.<br/><br/>10/10"
"zardoz-13","10","1","4","26 July 2018"," The Jewish Version of ""The Godfather""
","Sergio Leone's most ambitious film took decades for the ""Fistful of Dollars"" director to make, and he endured many struggles, not the least of which was the terrible re-editing of the film for American audiences. Leone's director's cut with flashbacks galore, told with a kind of surrealism that may be difficult for audiences to watch, develops the action. For example, the opening section of the film shows our hero hiding out in a Chinese opium den while a mysterious telephone rings for what seems forever before it is answered. The initial American cut took the film's complex narrative and reorganized events so that the story unfolded in chronological order. This flawed version ran 139 minutes and lacks the epic quality of the European cut. Whereas Leone's much longer version--clocking in at 229 minutes--jumped around and exhibited little fidelity to chronological order. Basically, the film charts the rise and fall of a quartet of Jewish gangsters who grew up in New York City and got involved in the liquor trade during Prohibition. These kids developed a way to salvage barrels of booze that had to be dumped into the East River when the law descended upon the bootleggers. David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro), Max Bercovicz (James Woods), Philip ""Cockeye"" Stein (William Forsythe) and Patrick ""Patsy"" Goldberg (James Hayden) rise to become major players in Prohibition. Sergio Leone wasn't interesting in simply making an urban version of ""Once Upon a Time In the West."" Indeed, he wanted to follow these characters across decades into the 1960s. Naturally, the film is beautiful, and the action adheres to the tropes of crime chronicles. Interestingly enough, the European cut opens with three gunmen--like those in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly""--searching for Noodles because they have a contract on him. Essentially, the film defies synopsis, but it is a work of art to watch, despite lots of nudity. Hardcore Leone fans will feast on this sprawling yarn with its elegantly orchestrated gunfights."

","Sergio Leone is a brilliant director, first and foremost. He has a way with each camera shot. He finds tension and wonderful moments in the most simplistic of moments. He's a genius. Once Upon a Time in America has some of the same delineation as Once Upon a Time in the West, yet it's missing a lot of the magic that makes Once Upon a Time in the West the great film it is. <br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is a very good film, but not a great one. The ending is splendid, it makes one think Noodles was dreaming the whole thing, however if that were true then the ending would be when Noodles woke up at the Chinese opium den. However, Noodles dreaming would mean that he didn't find the money and that he got it 35 years later, and that doesn't make sense as he woke up, went to Fat Moe's, got the key, found out no money, so on and so forth. <br/><br/>No I think him smiling at the end of the film is his way of saying in two ways that now he gets all the mula to himself and also that he's now rid of this burden of loyalty to friends that he feels like he lost a connection with long ago. From the beginning of the film, Deborah(wonderfully played by Jennifer Connelly and Elizabeth McGovern)states that she loves him but she can never be with him because he's a two bit punk(something to the likes of that). <br/><br/>How very true. Noodles puts his hand in the pact they make to share the money even though his lack of enthusiasm shows he wants it all. He had a connections with his friends when he was younger, but after prison you feel the connection is long gone and only there out of loyalty from the history they've had with each other. In the end, Noodles is a loner, is a selfish two bit thug, and he hates himself, the only thing that might make him happy is being with his one true love and when she shatter's that dream, he seems to become numb for good. He then ends up raping the only girl he ever loved because he's certain he'll never see her again and that kills him, but also he just has a self loathing that is calm and well executed through DeNiro's performance. It's almost as if Noodles as a kid was Larry Darrell before the war(Larry Darrell is a character from the Razor's Edge), but after Noodles gets out of prison he is a different man, disconnected, just like Larry Darrell is a different man when he comes back from the war. <br/><br/>After 35 years Max has believed he has made Noodles suffer by taking all the money, taking his woman and taking it all. Max believes he has made Noodles suffer after all these years. But again, Noodles comes back, calm, disconnected. He's not mad because he was relieved of that burden, he was relieved of being rid of that old life, to where he got to have a new life for 35 years. Noodles was still miserable, of course he still missed them as us humans do with any loved ones, but that had become innate, his numbness and misery within himself. Max is heart broken that it has no effect on Noodles because Max truly loved Noodles. And Noodles had a love and caring for all his friends, but not the way Max did for Noodles. It was a love story among friends, and how that friendship changed after prison(But how it was still always different even from childhood, just changed more after prison). In the end it hurt Max, and he ultimately did himself in regardless. <br/><br/>Some terrific acting, a beautiful music score, music, sound, with some great action and brutal fight scenes, the works. If these elements were missing this film would be a 5 at best, but because of the actors and Leone's unique genius as a director this is a very good film and worth the watch. Brilliant scenes all around too, from the phone ringing segueing into another scene to where Noodles watches Max go to the garbage truck as it then segues into young kids riding in cars. Lot of brilliant stuff, but again, lacks the magic of it's more fine predecessor Once Upon a Time in the West."

","This is truly one of the great epic crime dramas in cinema history. This movie is the cream of the crop when it comes to writing, acting, and overall storytelling. Even with its long runtime, it engages you from the very beginning. Should we expect anything different from guys like Robert De Niro and Sergio Leone? Nope, but nonetheless its a cinematic achievement. It really builds one of the great friendships that I can remember in movies. James Woods and De Niro have impeccable chemistry and make us believe they really are friends. Major props go to the younger cast as well.<br/><br/>One of the best parts about this movie is that it takes place in different time periods, and by the way the filming and cinematography makes you believe you are with them in that time. I really liked how they didn't tell it necessarily in chronological order. You see old De Niro, you see 30's De Niro and you see young young De Niro. It gives you more than a glimpse into his life at each point in time. The younger cast of the friends turned gangsters were great because they not only had great chemistry but they looked and acted just like there older selves. That's very hard to do in movies. I mean seriously the kids looked just like their older selves did. Jennifer Connelly anyone? It was great to see these characters go through their trials and tribulations as young adults together and see how if affected them in the future. The music was a major bright spot in the film as well. The score by Morricone captured the friendship and sometimes heartbreak between the group of friends. There are so many positives to this movie that I cant write enough.<br/><br/>The length is just a minor problem but really its forgiven with how great the script is. But my one problem was the sometimes uncomfortable feeling that I had while watching this. There are scenes that really make you despise these characters and then you are all of a sudden suppose to feel for them in the end? That is one huge problem with doing villain movies, it becomes very hard to root for them in the end. I'm not saying these characters are villains, but the disgust that I had with some of them didn't make me have any sympathy when something would eventually go wrong for them.<br/><br/>But a great watch that is filled with fantastic performances all around. And when you realize it's not even necessarily a gangster movie as it is a movie about gangsters who are great friends and are faced with difficult decisions in life.<br/><br/>9.3/10"

","If you can think of the entire film as being broken shards of Noodles' broken brain, I think much of the ambiguity can be explained.<br/><br/>I think everything we see in the film originates from an unseen Noodles (as unseen narrator?) from the future (beyond 1968.) The best scene in the film is at the end when Noodles refuses to acknowledge that Senator Bailey is in fact Max. It feels like the entire film's purpose is to support this intensely profound and emotional moment.<br/><br/>The garbage truck is a stopgap for the lack of knowledge that old, old Noodles has about Max's fate. He never found out what became of him, but knows inevitably he will have been chewed up by death.<br/><br/>The scene at the end with the old cars and the young people (and God Bless America): I see this as Noodles reflecting how the misleading American Dream has been born anew. It's another unreliable memory from old, old Noodles' fractured brain.<br/><br/>Noodles is in fact a casualty of the American Dream, of Max's avarice.<br/><br/>The rape of Deborah is a telling scene. It tells us that Noodles doesn't truly love Deborah. Noodle's true love in life is his friend Max."

","Sergio Leone was a fantastic film director. Not everything he did was perfect , far from it , but you cant deny that he had a directing style all of his own. Usually his films contained lots of close up portrait shots, a haunting and memorable soundtrack and usually his movies were very long. Once upon a time in America was the last film Sergio Leone ever directed and without doubt was one of his finest.<br/><br/>When he was a boy, Noodles and his friends would roll drunks and make trouble in their Jewish immigrant neighbourhood. His life changed, however, when he met Max . Together the two of them and their gang began planning more complex jobs and successfully making money. As they grow up learning about crime together, they also learn about life and love.<br/><br/>Their friendship is interrupted when Noodles is sent to jail as an adolescent, but although he is a young man when he is freed, Max is there to collect him. He discovers that his partners have been busy in his absence, taking advantage of the money to be made illegally during prohibition, and for some time he joins in with their business. But prohibition isn't going to last forever, and when it ends Noodles is concerned that Max's next job is a step too far.<br/><br/>I have heard it said by some people that Once upon a time in America is the greatest gangster movie of all time. In my opinion this is way of the mark. It may have been the best up until 1984 ( Godfather fans will disagree) but six years later Martin Scorsese paired up Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci once again to make not only the perfect gangster movie but the greatest movie ever made - Goodfellas<br/><br/>In some ways this film is very Scorsese like. It reminded me a lot of ""Mean Streets"". Robert De Niro is fantastic as Noodles as is James Woods as Max "" don't call me crazy"" Bailey. Neither of which turn out to be very nice people. I would have like to have seen the Joe Pesci Character a lot more but he just disappears from the movie without explanation. <br/><br/>The timeline drifts quite a bit and it does get a little confusing in the latter part of the film especially due to the extremely poor make up job done on Elizabeth McGovern who played Deborah Gelly . At one stage she is supposed to be the same age as Noodles expect he looks 60 and she still looks 21 . Another problem is the length of the film 3 hours 49 minutes . I'm sorry but that's just too long for a film. Apparently there is a version that is just 144 minutes made for the American Audience but it is cut in chronological order that makes very little sense.<br/><br/>I found this to be a very sexually charged movie. Some scenes are quite graphic and i am surprised they got past the censor back in the eighties. The rape scene and the peeping scenes are two that i wont forget in a hurry. <br/><br/>As with all Sergio Leone films i loved the soundtrack. Those haunting panpipes sound like they have come straight from one of his spaghetti westerns. the cinematography also looks fantastic. Especially the scenes set during twenties and thirties. <br/><br/>This is an epic film about , innocence, trust, passion, honor, Friendship , betrayal, and guilt and was a fitting finale to the career of a great director. <br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","4","10 February 2009"," A quality gangster movie
","Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" was ruined for American audiences at the time of its release due to heavy editing at the studio's insistence. It wasn't until years later that the film was seen in its original form and it now has a sizable following.<br/><br/>The story, which is based on a novel by Harry Grey titled ""The Hoods"", follows a group of gangsters from their days as young punks to their demise in a botched liquor run. All of this is told in flashback as the one remaining member of the crew returns to his old neighborhood to take care of some unfinished business.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the film is nearly four hours long, so those with short attention spans need not apply. That being said, those hours go by fairly quickly and, if anything, it seems like there are parts that could have used elaboration. However, this is probably just a result of Leone trying to do too much.<br/><br/>The cast is well-assembled with Robert De Niro in the central role and James Woods in the next most prominent role. The rest of the cast is pretty solid though some of the supporting characters are underdeveloped. The only performance that I thought wasn't on par with the rest was Elizabeth McGovern as De Niro's love interest.<br/><br/>Leone's direction is expertly handled, giving the film a polished, yet realistic, look. The editor deserves credit as well since he does an admirable job of keeping the narrative flowing, even when switching between three different time periods. Ennio Morricone's score is good for the most part but the motifs get a bit repetitive by the end. Also, there are a few questionable choices, such as the use of the Beatles' ""Yesterday"" and the pan-flute playing of Zamfir.<br/><br/>Even considering the film's faults, I think that it has to be considered a classic gangster movie. While the current IMDb rating is, in my opinion, overly generous (as is the case for a number of Leone's films) I wouldn't begrudge it a spot somewhere in the top 250."

The story of a poor kid growing up on the downside of advantage who takes the road to perdition not because he chooses wrong but because any road out of there would have been equally doomed to fail morally, achieves epic proportions when it transcends the genre to become a dissection of modern human society, a story about growing up, a gangster tale, a love story and an initiation trip on the downward spiral of memory lane direction purgatory. <br/><br/>The story follows Noodle's reflections, from childhood to old age, revealing piece by piece what can be viewed as a failed life, or an immoral one, but really is a tale of broken dreams and promises to self and others, success and downside of it, fate, love and friendship, but most of all it shows the great difference between the view in and the view out of life."

","I wanted to see this for a long time, and finally bought the 2003 2-disc DVD director's cut recently. It's definitely one of De Niro's best, and I thought the cast generally were pretty good too. The locations are sumptuous and beautifully lit, and you are really drawn into the 1920's/30's. Less satisfying for me were the 60's segments, not because they were less visually convincing, but because I don't think they were completely coherent. The shot where De Niro is walking along the street with the money and obviously nervous suddenly morphs back to the 30's, and there's no apparent reason for this little sequence other than that jump-back. I also found it hard to believe that De Niro could not recognise James Woods as an older man - he hadn't changed that much and they were supposed to be best friends! The other weak point was that Elizabeth McGovern still looked far too young in the dressing room sequence, and she seemed remarkably happy to see Noodles, despite the fact that their previous encounter was when he raped her (albeit 30 years previously). The jumping forward/back in time was cleverly handled, but I can't help thinking that a chronological flow might be less distracting. Anyway, enough negativity. This is still a great film (definitely in the top 10 of modern gangster movies), and really involves you in the life of the key protagonists. A special mention for Joe Pesci too, who had really only a cameo, but was as excellent as ever."

[And yes, I saw & own the 3 hr. + version.] There is of course, the notoriously annoying phone scene, where a phantom phone rings, and even when a character picks up a phone, it is not _the_ phone which has now been ringing for the past five minutes and quells the middle scenes which are important to putting together the entire jigsaw of a movie that Leone dumped on us.  There are numerous transgressions committed by Leone that were completely unnecessary.  For example, there is a long shot of Noodles walking across the street.  The movie is so long, that it did not need this added one minute of something that we've already seen and could have easily been accounted for with the addition of a small ellipse- it adds nothing to the movie, and we are forced to endure another minute of Leone's overindulgent splendor.  Part of what makes the film work is the strange, disjointed continuity.  Time shifts from Noodles as a young man to Noodles in his old age with a simple jump cut.  This, although interesting at first, is also rather annoying.<br/><br/>The positive sides are numerous: the haunting score by Morricone floats throughout, binding each interwoven sequence together with a sense of tragedy, amidst the beautiful set decoration that in my opinion, is not paralleled amongst similar period pieces.  The shock of young Dominic's cold murder and the retaliation that follows is truly amazing and stands as a testament to the brutality of the times.  The movie wraps around you, especially in the ""friendship"" parts of the movie, with the early children, where you get a real glimpse into the native nature of each character, and the tightening friendships that illuminate the protagonists, especially Noodles and Max.

","One of the most underrated movies of all time. This is simply a masterpiece. It took Sergio Leone, the greatest director ever lived, 10 years to make this movie. It is his magnum opus, and closes his history of America starting with A Fistful of Dollars. After this movie you simply don't have to watch any more movies, it says it all. Best performance of Robert De Niro ever. Watch for Joe Pesci, in a hilarious scene about the 'cock insurance'. Impeccable score of Ennio Morricone, and as always impeccable props, amazing locations, and for me the scene where the young boy dies, might have been the reason why Leone wanted to make this movie. I am still trying to figure out how Leone made that kid real, iconic, moving, and endearing and how he ingrained him on our memory... He actually becomes the impetus for the rest of the story."

Amazing casting, wonderful screenplay, great storytelling, and the cherry on top would be maestro's work, Enio Moricone. Even loved the ""Yesterday"" and what it implied.
I didn't like the actings in the first 6 minutes of movie, and in general the sound mix and edit wasn't as good as the movie itself.
It's a trilogy, starting in the early 30's and ending in the late 60's.
Whatever had to be told, is vastly explained with meticulous detailing. Some may find it hard to understand the opening 20 minutes of the movies, but I think implications are strong enough to connect the dots and sort out the storyline, although not that obvious.
Makeups, clothes and set design in this movie are just examples of masterpieces. I gave it 8/10 simply for the long narrative, poor sound edit (respectively) and mediocre actings of anyones but the chief roles.

","The script is non-linear and it is these ""breaks"" in history, now in the past, now in the present, that do not make the film so tiring. Even because there was an interesting work and inspired by the cuts from one time to another, which are not dry - it is as if, in a magic pass, an event of the past reflected in the future, and vice versa. In a moment we see the old bitter Noodles pulling a plaque from a wall into a pantry so that, in the next instant, we see the little Noodles spying on a beautiful girl through the hole of the same room.<br/><br/>The outcome of the film is a case in itself. Some people find the final twist somewhat improbable, worthy of Mexican novels. I was already startled in a good way, even by the attitude taken by Noodles, able to redeem it, in part. Anyway, all the way to this end is worth being appreciated as the final legacy of Leone's memorable career. In times of explosions and shootings that pop up every ten minutes in the cinema, nothing better than stop to contemplate a movie that is not in any hurry."

","The first time I saw this film was opening day in 1984. I liked his Clint westerns from the mid 60's and always love a good gangster film. All of us left the theatre 139 mins. later less than satisfied. Unfortunately we had no idea we had watched a completely butchered version of the film that jumped around too much and made little sense. We quickly forgot the experience and watched much more satisfying films for the rest of the summer popcorn infused flicks of the 1980's.
Years later the complete version finally surfaced with little fanfare. This film is one of those that gets better every time you watch it, ""if"" one takes the time to sit down and really watch and absorb it."

","I have to admit, I had to read some of the Q&A dialog on this board to fully understand what James Woods' character Max pulled off to get to the end of the story. I must have gotten distracted somewhere and probably could have figured it out on my own with another viewing, but who has that kind of time on their hands? That's the main reason I give the film just shy of a '10' rating, it was just confusing enough to miss one of the main points I should gotten myself.<br/><br/>Otherwise an outstanding film experience. For a gangster movie I don't put it in the same league as ""The Godfather"", maybe not even ""Godfather II"", and for my money I liked ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Road to Perdition"" a lot better, but this was well done. I guess you don't have to go almost four hours to be considered epic, and this picture did that. I'll give Sergio Leone credit though, I've seen a bunch of his spaghetti-Westerns so it was a treat to see him tackle a not quite similar genre to tantalizing effect.<br/><br/>With the director's cut film, I liked the non-linear treatment, but again, with the over long format it wasn't easy reassembling the correct chronology of events trying to make sense of the story. DeNiro and Woods were outstanding as always, though Elizabeth McGovern has a tendency to grate on me in other films, and she did here somewhat as well. That doesn't mean she wasn't good in the role of Deborah, I guess it's a personal preference or lack thereof. It struck me rather curiously that Danny Aiello was given a character using his own name, and wouldn't you know it, the young Deborah who looked to me a little like Jennifer Connelly turned out to be Jennifer Connelly.<br/><br/>I think what I'll do is get back to this film at some point, just not right away. Back to back I've just watched ""Seven Samurai"" and this one, so maybe it's time to take in a couple shorts."
"User_With_No_Name","5","1","5","2 June 2008"," I really wanted to like this movie...
","I wanted to like this one, I really and truly did. I had high expectations after seeing the mainly glowing reviews.<br/><br/>To preface, I'm a movie lover of many types, and I love a good crime drama. (Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino, Carlito's Way, etc). I don't generally find movies as being too ""long"" either; Extended LOTR movies, Godfather 1/2, Heat, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, whatever... Length and plot development does not scare nor bother me.<br/><br/>Anyways, with Once Upon a Time, I feel like I've just wasted 4 hours of my life. I found the plot rather predictable and boring for the most part, it had it's moments, but they were few. I don't find it to be a ""rip-off"" of the Godfather either, just a much lesser movie of the same genre. I found the ""twist"" near the end to be, sadly, rather comical.<br/><br/>The acting? Apart from DeNiro, the main characters gave weak performances. Woods was just plain annoying (though I'll admit to never liking him much elsewhere) and McGovern was terrible. A lot of it just felt forced. Aeillo and Pesci were good, albeit in a small roles.<br/><br/>I will give credit where it is due though. The cinematography was very good, Leone is a master at it. The sense of where you were and what time period you were in was also fairly convincing.<br/><br/>To clarify, yes, I watched the (supposedly better) 4 hr version, not the hacked theatrical release. This gets 5.5/10 from me. I gave it an IMDb 5 since it truly doesn't deserve a 6 in my opinion. Sorry Sergio."
"david__T","6","1","5","14 April 2008"," Has its moments, but highly overrated...
","Whilst this film does have a fairly interesting story to tell (although not as interesting as Goodfellas) there are far too many things wrong here for the film to be hailed as a masterpiece as some people are doing...<br/><br/>First there is the length. At 4 hours long, this takes patience beyond tolerable levels. Whilst films like Dances With Wolves & 2001: A Space Odyssey consistently give the viewer many great things to look at & listen to even when the story isn't moving, this film is far too pedestrian with none of that polish. Obviously the Director has used the run time to fully indulge himself - and some shots do work quite well - but we don't get anything approaching the beautiful docking scene in 2001 to justify the long run time. Obviously the studio tried to hack the film down to 139 minutes (which was even less successful), but a more sequential film would have been shorter - which leads nicely on to...<br/><br/>The jumps through time. These didn't add to the experience much for me - and judging by many reviews, just served to confuse a lot of people; just watch Pulp Fiction to see how this should be done. Also this unnecessarily complicated the plot...<br/><br/>If even the people giving this film good reviews are saying that it needs to be watched 2 or 3 times to fully understand what is going on, then how can that be a good thing? Films like the Sixth Sense which take on a new light when watched again (after you find out certain key points) are far different from films that you have to watch twice just to understand them. This film could be 2 points higher as a result of better editing & a tighter grip on the story. I for one sometimes get annoyed when I listen to directors saying that they chopped things out for pacing or purely just to reduce the run time - especially in films like Terminator 2 or Leon which are better in their Directors Cut guise. However this film could have benefited from that process.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was good, as was the casting - the younger versions of the main characters even looked similar to their older counterparts. The Direction, Cinematography and Music have their merits (these saved me from rating the film an average 5/10) and there is much to enjoy in spells, but as a whole, I think the film lacks enough visual punch & originality to outdo the Godfather et al. Gangster movie? Yes, but this is no Goodfellas."

","I really don't know what to make of this movie. I am a staunch Sergio Leone fan, his spaghetti westerns and his once upon a time movies. But this movie is kind of a mixed bag for me. Like GODFATHER III, this is a case of a great story, but at the end of the movie, you're left asking that famous immortal question...""WHAT?"" This is a great journey that in the end, goes nowhere. I have no problem with a long story, or with the jumping back and forth in time, or with the many plot lines. It's just that at the end, this great story began to collapse under its own weight and we got an ending that didn't make any sense. And I don't buy into the theory that this was all an opium-induced dream. If that were the case, this whole damn story would be totally pointless, just a waste of time. I doubt very seriously that Leone would cheap shot his audience like that. It would be taking an awful long time to say, in effect, ""I was only kidding, folks."" A joke is a joke, but for that much effort? Eh...<br/><br/>Like I said, it told a great story, but it doesn't seem to have an ending.

","After seeing all the greatest gangster movies (Goodfellas, Casino, Scarface, Godfather Trilogy, Donnie Brasco, etc) I have to say that this is the most realistic and ambitious movie that's representing the genre. It may not be the best, as I'm a huge fan of the Godfather films, but definitely one of the best in all of film history.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone collaborates again with Sergio Leone and the music score is truly magnificent. Leone uses his own directing style which contains a lot of close-ups and long silent moments during the scenes. The flow of the film is pretty slow, which is conventional to Leone, but i prefer it like that because the plot is quite confusing at times. The first 30 minutes of the film is all big complex but it eventually develops into a great plot. Leone has made OUATIA the most realistic gangster film if you ask me. It doesn't try to make things flashy and beautiful. This film scarcely has a happy scene.<br/><br/>The story is about a group of Jewish friends in Brooklyn who start to create their own crime empire in the 20s. Although, the movie concentrates mainly on the life of 'Noodles' (De Niro). We can follow the glory years of the group during the prohibition and the eventual fall."

","First off, I don't write reviews... Secondly I don't agree in general with 1/10 or 10/10 as either extreme is effectively unattainable in my opinion (what is a ""10/10"" in the 50's if released in 2k is NOT ""10/10"" - to be explained later)...<br/><br/>I picked out this movie (extended version)one night from a blockbuster, and seem to have vaguely recalled hearing about it. So I popped it in, started watching it, and was soon thereafter asleep.<br/><br/>So the next day I looked up the reviews on here, and to my surprise this thing (that quickly put me to sleep) was on the top 250!!! I was shocked. People were comparing it to The Godfather and Goodfellas... OMG...<br/><br/>So I sat down a few nights later and decided to re-visit this thing which I thought could not be anywhere near as good as people were saying... To my surprise, things go a lot better after a while... the story just started off too slow.<br/><br/>The story was interesting (once it got going), and ultimately the overall story was good.<br/><br/>Some of the cinematography was quite good, some was painfully awful... it was as though there were different people controlling/editing the shots at different times.<br/><br/>I don't know what was in the original version and the extended cut, however there was too much sex related scenes for my likings. I think sex has its place in movies, it just that this movie had a little too much (or too long), with some scenes on the boarder of turning into a porno. And when I'm watching a gangster/mafia movie, I don't want it to kick into a little porno action, I want to see the stereotypical gangster related things  drug trafficking, extortion, gambling, murder blah blah blah... not, common baby, lets see if you can tell which one of us mobsters had their way with you a while ago by a careful assessment of our 'weapons' while we look on grinning stupidly. Just didn't seem appropriate.<br/><br/>I think the acting was top notch - I can't think of a single actor/actress that did a bad job; the flaws are more in the direction the movie was shot/edited.<br/><br/>I think if this movie was released in say 1960, it would have gotten an 8/10 from me... but this was 1984, Nineteen EIGHTY-FOUR... post godfather... I find that movies over time end up raising the bar for other movies, and that sloppy cinematography or acting or direction becomes less tolerated - because movie makers should know by now that everything has to be firing on all cylinders to be a top movie (relatively speaking of course).<br/><br/>It should have been better.<br/><br/>X"

I just didn't buy it.  For all the running time, it felt a bit under-developed.  The incidents that drive the story are a mixed bag; some clever, some funny, some silly.  The vast scope and production values are in the service of a story that can't justify them.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a fan of James Woods, but he was good here. <br/><br/>

"Docterry","Null","1","5","29 June 2003"," A classic that's maybe admired more than it deserves.
","This film proves that you can sometimes have too much of a great thing. First and foremost is Morricone's stunning score.  It's some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. However, that doesn't mean it's always appropriate for every single sequence. There's simply too much incongruous underscoring in this film. The few moments when the main theme isn't blasting in full orchestral glory it's whistled or played on the flute. If Leone wanted to make homage to the film scoring of old Hollywood then Morricone needed to add some variations on his theme and some stings that directly address the action.<br/><br/>Leone is famous for his close-ups.  The direction is wonderful when it melds with the story. Leone wanted a fragmented, dreamlike essence and taking things slow and being atmospheric is fine but there has to be some discrimination. Every scene is filled with such operatic grandeur that each story thread becomes convoluted and drowned in bathos.<br/><br/>`Once Upon A Time In America' was edited, rather infamously, for its American release.  It was presented in a linear fashion and was vastly criticized for not making sense.  I'm not sure how much sense the full version makes but telling this story in chronological order would be a huge mistake. It would take so much of the underlying meaning and mystery away. I don't know how Leone could have allowed it at the time.<br/><br/>I miss the old epic style of filmmaking. I miss the time when Hollywood at least pretended they were interested in the product not just the profit. The phrase, the `art business', is an oxymoron anyway.  Movie producers today make no qualms about their tunnel vision. Artistic quality is measured in how much was spent on the CGI effects.  All movies today use the `Hit and Run' technique.  They open big, say on a holiday weekend, with tons of advertising and before the bad word of mouth gets around they hope to recoup the investment.<br/><br/>Anyway, the new `Once Upon A Time In America' Special Edition DVD in Widescreen is a real present for fans of the movie. The digital transfer is amazing. The picture looks so crisp and new. The locations are sharply defined and extras whose faces were previously blurred are now like new characters.<br/><br/>I've always liked this movie. I can't help it. I admire its romanticism but now that I'm older I can see that it's flawed. It doesn't achieve a proper mix. You need some subtlety and emotional detachment. This film's no Godfather, by any means. It's also uncomfortably misogynistic at times. Yet, you can't ignore the passion that went into making it.  `Once Upon A Time In America' is passionate perhaps to embarrassment."

"Aylmer","7","1","6","30 July 2019"," Beautiful, exhausting, emotional, existential and frustrating gangster epic
","My opinion of this film has changed a lot over the past 25 years. When I first saw it as a teenager, I was interested but confused and bored for most of the running time for being too talky. Later in my snobby cinephile phase of 20's, I found it to be one of the most extraordinary and mystical films I'd seen outside of early Herzog and Vittorio De Sica. The bad ""old age"" makeup always bothered me though and took me right out of the movie. Nowadays I find it a greatly flawed film which aimed too high for what its script ultimately achieved.<br/><br/>Almost everything technically comes off amazingly polished considering that this was basically a bigger-budgeted Italian crime movie as they'd gotten so good at during the 1970's. Sergio Leone handles every frame with an OCD level of craftsmanship and the production design and cinematography are as good as you'll ever find. Robert De Niro, James Woods, and many of the supporters bring their A-game. Personally I would have loved to have seen more of Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams, Frank Gio, Danny Aiello, Richard Bright, etc. but their roles all come and go extremely quickly and often with no resolution. It's a shame, but this film is not really interested in portraying a conventional kind of narrative. Instead it plays more like a very languid, slow-paced dream for better or worse, including its share of impressive pathos and frustrating red herrings.<br/><br/>While portions of the film have a humorous tone such as the baby-swap scam and some of the shenanigans of the flashback child actors, it's overall an extremely sad experience most explicitly conveyed by the graphic rape scene and extremely cynical presentations of relationships and sexuality. The women gravitate toward the men who treat them the worst and lifelong friendships dissolve at the drop of a hat once political expediency demands otherwise. What little violence there is feels extremely gritty and punches hard, but almost all of it comes early in the film and practically nothing of note happens the final half hour.<br/><br/>Overall I just feel like too much is missing from this film to be a fulfilling experience and possibly if was all left on the cutting room floor. Who was Frank Gio's character working for? What happened with the union? Why all the emphasis on the main gang being Jewish when it doesn't seem to affect anything later in the film? Why the trash compactor truck? I would recommend this to film buffs as it's much more well-polished than something like GANGS OF NEW YORK. However it's not nearly as exciting or as enlightening of a view of the criminal underworld as any of Scorsese's, Coppola's, or Brian De Palma's forays into similar territory. It avoids a lot of the organized crime movie cliches but to a such point where I wonder if the narrative would have worked even better outside of the genre.<br/><br/>As fan of eurocult and B-movies, I have to say it's still a delight catching glimpses of the likes of Salvatore Billa, Bruno Bilotta, Olga Karlotos, Mario Brega, etc. sharing the screen with American crime cinema actors in a major film. A lot of the New York exterior sets found their way into several Italian post apocalyptic films in the early 80's including RUSH, A MAN CALLED RAGE, ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX, and 2019: AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK."

","First off let's just say Sergio Leone was a incredible director throughout his long successful directing career he has made many great films such as The good The bad and The ugly and also a fistful of dollars !!! BUT this picture is just flat out Amazing.
The music is spectacular and composed by Leone's life long friend Ennio Morrcione a oscar award winning composer ! And the actors really delivered a breathtaking performance . James woods showed such raw and great talent throughout the film as Max and when you combine a young Robert deniro with a director and acting cast of this type you will be left amazed like I was . I love how Leone took some ideas from all different films and added it to this one which went on to be his last before he passed away . He used flashback scenes to tell a story about a Jewish gang through the probation era and how young poor street thugs became successful Criminals also showed how in that life of crime friends and family mean nothing and being DEAD or being BETRAYED is the only way. I was lil upset on how Lil of a role Joe Pesci played in this film Fresh off a great performance with fellow castmate Robert deniro In RAGING BULL.
I couldn't believe how long the movie was and expected it to be long and boring I WAS sadly mistaking every minute of it is amazing and you really have to pay attention to every single detail or you might miss something . IT was truly amazing story telling this movie has everything from romance to murder it will change you're way on how you look at movies and gangsters it's a great ride from start to finish. The dialogue is very clever the conversations seem very realistic and legit .
They just don't make movies like this anymore
It's a shame it didn't get any oscars or the respect it deserves !! Because the of the 144 min version ! This movie should be seen in one way and one way only the 4 hour LEONE version not the short edited one .
Other than that ENJOY cause you will be watching a top ten movie of all time in my opinion and the best film from the 80's in this genre . If you think I'm crazy just ask Quentin Tarantino"

","Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 Italian-American epic crime drama film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society.<br/><br/>It was the final film of Leone's career and the first feature film he had directed in thirteen years. The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and Ennio Morricone provided the film score. It is the final installment in Leone's Once Upon a Time Trilogy, preceded by Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time... the Revolution.<br/><br/>Leone originally intended for the film to be released as two three-hour films but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to a single 229- minute film. The film's American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes, and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement. The shortened version was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly criticized the changes that were made. The original ""European cut"" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest gangster films of all time."

","Once Upon a Time in America was never a favorite, due to pacing primarily and the ending, in particular. I liked Henry Fonda's character better as a villain in Once Upon a Time in the West. However, I have to say, James Wood's Max character was better written, on review. This guy killed his buddies, stole their money and faked his own death. Now on seeing it again, I realize what the ending was showing. Max intended to betray Noodles (De Niro) one more time. He set Noodles up with a slow reveal, showing him the truth bit by bit, so that Noodles would be murderous and kill him before the feds locked him up or his cronies killed him. That seemed like justice and I used to think the film should have ended there. However, the scene with the garbage truck at the end shows that Max was going to ""whack"" Noodles posthumously. So even in death, that creep wanted to betray him again. What a hateful person. Didn't get that on previous viewings. The rape scene was also telling. Noodles never loved Deborah, he loved the idea of her. She had feelings for him and enjoyed playing hard to get with him. Instead of respecting her and attempting to connect, he tried to use brute force, first with money (at the fancy dinner) and then literally. Being in love with your idea of someone isn't the same as being in love. This was three movies in one."

But overall, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" ​​it is a great movie, a hot story to see, and full of stylistic features, in addition to being a work of Sergio Leone, author of the spectacular trilogy of dollars."

","Watching 3 CD movie feel like watching more than a 500 - page book, your heart will say, ""how long ah"", which has been reluctant to go to touch, ""once upon a time in America"" is such a movie to me, have already heard its name, early listen to how many people told me that this is a great movie, but I heard that to 4 hours to sew on still hasn't happened to see. Finally, spent an afternoon to see this film, at the same time, because of its beautiful music, it can be said that after listening to this film, this year just passed the second year of my life in my heart unexpectedly also surging an old man like the vicissitudes of life.<br/><br/>My favorite actor, Robert. DE niro's appearance in the film is one of my favorite parts of the movie. His character's name is really funny, ""Noodles"". Although ""nods"" sounds nice if it is transliterated as ""nuds"", it is still a bit funny to think about the original meaning of ""Noodles"". But the noodle story isn't funny. Like many movies that span a person's life or most of his life, the gangster story is set against a backdrop of juvenile frivolity, middle-aged pride and old age. This is a retrospective movie, the old noodles are touched again and again, so as to recall the past days and the past grievances. Such movies often give people a sense of vicissitudes, especially accompanied by the music of vicissitudes, which makes people easy to lean on the chair and sink into the sofa. What's more, this movie is not like ""cinema paradiso"" like a period of time to recall after leaving a warm tail, but also let me after watching the heart of a ""this is a good movie"" after a burst of melancholy.<br/><br/>From the point of view of the story alone, the story of this movie is more conventional but still fascinating. Four hours is not a long time for me, but I am deeply attracted by the fate of noodles and friends. What impresses me most is still the time when noodles and friends were street boys, who were young and frivolous, precocious but somewhat naive, who could set fire to a newsstand without paying protection money, and who, as usual, were fascinated by a girl. There are a lot of deep, evocative details. Article such as face to face can finally get it and kiss an angel Deborah narrative, he chose to follow outside Max's summon, perhaps understandable as a street to stimulate the call of life, in the end, Deborah to noodle shop doors are closed, also seems to be to the door of a door to another life close to him, the noodles has thoroughly took to the streets, onto the gang life. Another child, waiting outside the door with a cake intended to please his ""lover"", first eats some cream, then succumbing to the temptation to eat the whole cake, and then panicking when the ""lover"" shows up. The last good thing he did was to touch the stack of banknotes. After that, the young boy ""slipped"" and the American dream was shattered. Angry noodles revenge ""slip"" of the child, was put in prison, here, the streets of their young time is over, and seems to be from the moment they also doomed life direction, frivolous and beautiful youth time has to go to, then they are grown up, waiting for their is killing, murky adult story.<br/><br/>The door that had been closed to him as a teenager was an eternal pain in his heart. His vulnerability was here. He seemed to be the backbone of a domineering gang. So, he had been gentle to Deborah when he was about to leave the girl of his dreams in his youth, he even attacked her in despair, and then fell into empty remorse. At that moment, his American dream seemed to be broken. Max is also a film focusing on shaping figure, he had a deep friendship and noodles, but he has been like his name ""Max"" to maximize their own interests by hook or by crook, he is ambitious, even cheat a friend, his dream seems to be true, but soon disillusioned, even feel alive is a kind of burden, his dream is broken.<br/><br/>Although full of scenes in the movie the bloody scene, full of broken dreams again and again, but the final feud mood seems to be breaking, for in the past, they meet, though not a smile, also forget the boon sorrow, and many of these films, in the end, in a pleasant and vicissitudes of life in the music, images of youth again, let a person deeply touched. In the end, everything calmed down except for the laughter of noodles in the opium den.<br/><br/>It's a deep film, it's not called once upon a time in gangland or once upon a time in noodles but once upon a time in America, which is really very apposite, it's a gangland story set against an American past, and I don't think it has what many people would call an ""epic effect,"" but there's a lot to be said for the choices of the different people in the film. The music of the film is worth mentioning. The music of different styles under different plots adds a lot of color to the film. After watching the film and listening to the original sound of the film, I think of the door of Deborah's shop again. Which door did you miss?"

However, the story presents only a few conflicts in the main time frame of between when Noodles getting out of jail and when the bank job failed. I really like the acting overall which is very good. Robert DeNiro as always played out his character smoothly, expressing his deep suppressed anxiety very well. James Woods gives the movie a character with the contradicting polar of Noodles, expressing out the anger well. We get to see Joe Pesci and even an earlier career job for Jennifer Connelly here which is very nice."

","Leone helms a virtuous epic film in the crime / drama genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, editing, cinematography, score and acting. There are many famous artists involved in this film and they deliver superlative and realistic performances. De Niro and Woods in particular are superb. The plot revolves around a former gangster, Noodles, who returns to New York after disappearing four decades earlier to start a new life and for other reasons. The plot initially hints as to why Noodles left New York, but after his return we learn the entire story as seen through his own flashbacks. We see Noodles and his friends growing up in a Jewish slum in New York's Lower East Side. Noodles, a natural leader, rises to bootlegger and ultimately a Mafia boss. This does not come without violence, betrayal and remorse. The film does a magnificent job examining all of the characters and what makes them tick. The plot is gripping, intense, violent, gritty, bloody, duplicitous and has a cathartic ending. This is a sprawling story and thus turns into a lengthy and entertaining film which Leone is known for to begin with. It is a masterful work of art, memorable, timeless and a classic. This film takes a different path, as far as the storyline, than most traditional gangster films which is refreshing. This viewer has revisited this film many times and in my opinion it is bravura in it's genre and holds it's own with the other celebrated gangster / mob films."

","Bravo! Everyone connected with this movie should take a long well-deserved bow. Most excellent entertainment across the board bar none. All my favorite actors are at their peak plus the supporting players came through as well. If that is not enough, treat yourself to one of the best scores you will ever hear too. The music when applied to certain scenes just tugs and pulls on you until you give in and you are glad that you did too. There are different versions out there to experience. I found the blue-ray 251 minute version which Leone had a hand in and it made good sense. I have seen the other versions and I couldn't quite figure out what was going on even after I was captivated. Imagine that if it held you when chopped up it will spellbind you when complete. It does! Let us not forget that the story itself of gangsters, murders, robberies prostitution etc. can never be glorified and encouraged as a way of life in real life. Quite the opposite. It is a life misspent even it is exciting and dangerous to live in a perverted way. It reminds me of The Godfather movie where we fall in love with Don Corleone but lets be clear he was a bad man. What comes through here in this movie is the magic of growing up, having friends, doing things together, first loves and adventures. What hurts is seeing all those things fail or not complete themselves. This movie gives you both and then some. You have to stop and think about what Tuco said in the Good, Bad & Ugly to his brother. In this town, in order to survive, one becomes a priest or a bandit. Same with this movie only minus the priest part. These kids growing up on the streets have nothing worthwhile to look forward to accept trouble that brings excitement or jail. In between they hope for money, food, a better life and that it gets easier not harder. Street life is like that. You get to glimpse very well this no where type of existence courtesy of expert directing here. It would take someone who knew about this type of growing up to present correctly and more importantly with deep feeling and genuineness. This movies delivers that and more. Haunting, reflective, deep, pain, sorrow and mystery rolled up altogether using peoples lives to make the points. That's why the viewer can relate so well. It could have been and in many cases was...your life too. Recommend a meal while watching with a tasty drink and a decent snack. Make sure you have enough for three plus hours. I have seen this at least three times. I am not through either....."

It's out of any standard rule: long times, confused flash back instants, long telephone rings, obsession, friendship, love, sex, money, death, instinct. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks of the movie story. Ennio Morricone found amazing sounds in their simplicity. And what is incredible is that this long story could be only an illusion, a dream: in fact the film starts smoking and finishes smoking. I personally miss Sergio Leone. Masterpiece."
"dworldeater","8","1","8","15 September 2016"," Great mob epic and last film from the legendary Sergio Leone
","Sergio Leone's last film Once Upon A Time In America is a very well crafted gangster epic that looks and sounds great with excellent acting and direction. The film is somewhat in the same vein as The Godfather, but with more unexpected twists and turns and of course shot in Sergio Leone's distinct style. The film was supposed to be 6 hours long in Sergio's original cut, over 10 hours of footage was shot, the version that I have viewed clocks in at around 4 hours and is the closest version available to the directors cut. While some of this footage could have made the film more comprehensible, what is left is cohesive and much of what is missing is left to the viewers interpretation. Which is good, I think. Anyway, the film centers around the life of Noodles and his friends and business associates, who were street hoods as youths in NYC's lower east side and later bootlegger gangsters during the prohibition era. The cast is excellent with Robert De Niro, James Woods, William Forsythe and great looks and excellent performances from Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth Mc Govern. Joe Pesci and Burt Young have memorable cameos as well. Another thing that sets this apart from most other films in the genre is that these mobsters are not Italian or Irish, but Jewish. Once Upon A Time In America is a great film and is recommended viewing if you have seen The Godfather films, but are open to something a little more offbeat, but still very much high quality then you should give this film a go."
"obro","10","1","8","21 July 2015"," A Triumph of Epic Proportion
","With a run time of 3 hours and 49 minutes this film certainly is epic, and it needs to be as Sergio Leone depicts the entire life of a New York gangster in what is his greatest triumph.<br/><br/>There is a worry with making a film this long, it can become bloated and may even seem quite pretentious. Leone pulls it off perfectly however. I watched the film in one sitting, which I strongly recommend to first time viewers, and not at any point did I lose interest. The long run time allowed Leone to really flesh out the story and the characters to an incredible level of detail. This allows audiences to become involved in the narrative and so attention is kept entirely on the film as the tale develops. Sergio Leone's direction is sublime which also aids in captivating the audience. He created a film that is visually stunning by filming in locations throughout New York city, and despite the movie not being in chronological order it still flows seamlessly.<br/><br/>Many films suffer from having underdeveloped characters but with Once Upon a Time in America this is an impossibility as we nearly witness the protagonist's entire life and so the audience can really get to know and understand the character. It is excellent to see him progress from a boy filled with energy and ambition to an old man who is heavy with remorse and is haunted by ghosts of his past.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever created. It is often forgotten when one thinks of the best gangster movies but it has one of the most compelling and perfect stories ever put to screen and the brilliant script is performed effortlessly by such actors as Robert De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci and a young Jennifer Connelly. It is stylish and sleek and will leave a lasting impression on you."

","I have seen many movies, good and bad. One thing for certain, Once Upon a Time in America is more than good. It is amazing, a true milestone in the crime drama genre. The cinematography, images, scenery and locations are all superb and quite sweeping, while Ennio Morricone's score ranks up there with his very best. While the film clocks in at nearly four hours long, it never feels boring to me while the pace is quite elegiac everything else just compels you. I will admit, this is another film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone's direction is also superb, the story is always compelling and rich and the dialogue is very thought-provoking. The characters are wonderful if different. Unlike The Godfather(not a bad thing by the way), Once Upon a Time in America doesn't make you feel sympathy for its characters, these characters are actually quite nasty people but the way they are written and acted makes them compelling too. The two rape scenes are very shocking and perhaps brutal, but again that's no flaw in any way, because this slant on crime and the like is quite realistic if you put it in perspective.<br/><br/>The acting is another strong asset. Robert DeNiro and James Woods, both are great actors, and both give brilliant performances. So overall, extraordinary, not only of its genre but of film full-stop. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","Once Upon a Time in America (the director's cut) is one of the greatest films to ever be created and grace our reality. Sergio Leone, the man behind 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West', gave us 'Once Upon a Time in America', his last feature before he passed away in 1989. He left us a legacy as ambitious as his films, and his movies are his own love-letters to Westerns, crime films and basically life itself (at least this film).<br/><br/>A story about Jewish gangsters, Leone's final masterpiece is a harrowing, wide-scoped story that is told from the perspective of David ""Noodles"" Aaronson spanning from the 1920s to 1968. It's an impacting journey and you feel the regret Noodles carries with him from his past: through things that are revealed in HIS present, we learn a little more about his past that we didn't see coming. The film jumps all across different points in time, something cinema can tell so much better than any other medium, when done right like it is here.<br/><br/>Even though the film is great, the story behind the making of it was far from outstanding: Warner Brothers made a mandatory cut to the US version of the film (it was cut from nearly 4 hours to 2), and as a result it flopped in America and left Leone 'heart-broken' prompting him to never make another movie for the remainder of his life. Despite this though, the European cut was a great success and critics like Roger Ebert cited that version as the best film of 1984. It was a success in retrospective, but at the time it was a struggle for Leone."

","Sergio Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogies are possibly the greatest ""westerns"" ever made (his lyrical ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" has great stuff but doesn't quite match the earlier versions because of the clichés). And Ennio Morricone's music for all four movies were instant classics.<br/><br/>Leone's movie raised a question: after ""The Godfather"" (I & II) what more needed to be said? Well, being Italian, Leone found a source to use Jewish gangsters. That's a switch.<br/><br/>His powerhouse case included James Woods, Robert DeNiro, Elizabeth McGovern and . . . oh, way down on the list, a very pretty young Jennifer Connelly. I saw the shortened version of this flick long before she was a major star. She looks great.<br/><br/>Major spoiler ahead.<br/><br/>And that's the problem. In one scene she moons the camera (it's probably a body double, but may inspire perverts everywhere); in another scene, when a man changes the diapers for his son, he finds out his ""son"" was switched for a daughter. The camera sees everything. It's disgusting, showing naked babies.<br/><br/>Lest you think my objects to ""Once Upon a Time in America"" are merely prurient, I also found the longer version of the movie dull, despite its resorting to violence.<br/><br/>Though I'm a voracious reader, I usually eschew biographies as they deal so much up front with the subjects' childhood. ""So?"" you might say. But the first third (it feels like a century) of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is taken up with the story of Woods, DeNiro and the other little creeps as children, and it seems to go on forever! Leone is a good enough director to give us lots of visual tricks that keep us mostly happy, but I found the entire section with children dull and think it might have been integrated even better.<br/><br/>Leone deals with ""heroes"" only in the technical sense. The ""heroic"" antics of Eastwood and Bronson in his earlier movies do not necessarily make them the good guys, despite the ironic title ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" (one of the best titles ever, btw). The leads in ""Once Upon a Time in America"" are even more flawed, being rapists as well as robbers and murderers.<br/><br/>In fact, given the prevalence of prostitution, rape, child exploitation and the rest, sex as a normal and loving act never seems to enter anyone's heads. Perhaps Leone and his writing team don't want his depraved thugs to have any positive characteristics at all.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly as the little girl who tries to put the kid playing the younger DeNiro comes off best, as well as the almost clownish version of the 1920 song ""Amapola (Pretty Little Poppy)"" that may be slightly anachronistic by a few years in its first context, but which brings a smile every time it's played."
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","13","22 September 2016"," Mature and reflective film-making
","A human drama masquerading as a gangster story, this, the last and perhaps most epic film of Sergio Leone's career, is a story that takes three and a half hours to play out. During the running time we are subjected to a lengthy, complex, and utterly compelling drama that charts the rise and fall of love, friendship, and betrayal in the life of Noodles, a Jewish gangster as played by Robert De Niro. Only true fans of the cinematic experience need apply, who have the patience to sit through many slow scenes and watch the story play out on its own without any rush or contrivances. Once you realise that every moment that plays out on screen is important in the life of the central protagonist you'll realise what a good film this; there is no excess baggage, no extraneous characters, just realism and heartfelt drama. The whole gangster aspect of the story and the setting is just a backdrop for emotions and relationships to play out. Despite the lack of action (fans of Leone's westerns will find the shoot-outs and fights in short supply here) there are many shocking moments in the movie, many involving sexual violence of one kind or another which is tough to watch but still compelling.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the cast is wonderful, and packed with the usual suspects doing their thing. De Niro excels and has the best old-age makeup I've ever seen, James Woods is on the edge as usual, and Elizabeth McGovern is Deborah, an intense object of desire for De Niro. Did anyone ever think that the reason she hasn't aged at all at the end of the film is because we're seeing reality through De Niro's eyes, and in his eyes she is still as young and beautiful as she ever was? Anyway, plenty of familiar faces pack out the rest of the cast, from Treat Williams, Joe Pesci, and Burt Young to Danny Aiello as the hilarious police chief. William Forsythe, Darlanne Fluegel, the list is endless and also includes Jennifer Connelly in her first acting performance.<br/><br/>Leone's cinematography is as great as ever and he has a lot of fun crafting some classic moments. The never-ending ringing telephone is a great element to the story and I never realised I could be captivated by the sight of a man stirring a cup of coffee. But there you go. It wouldn't be half the film it without Ennio Morricone's typically evocative score which in many ways surpasses that of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST with its character themes and solemn, tragic, yet beautiful music. Many elements run throughout the story, many involving the flawed character of De Niro, and without rushing the story gradually evolves in jigsaw-like segments with fall together for the nostalgic conclusion. This is a film that demands close attention throughout to capture all the little nuances and unfolds into a sometimes amazing film as a whole."

Quietly answered: ""I just go to bed every morning."" It's hard to say a word, full of vicissitudes. His temples were covered with white hair. He was no longer a gangster on the street, and he was no longer a gangster in the sky. He was just a calm, stumbling old man. He had nothing but memories ...<br/><br/>His life was about several brothers who were born and died, and a beautiful girl; about friendship and dreams, about youth and love, and about loyalty and betrayal. In those years, when a person was silently displaced and traveled far away, what was he holding in his heart? Is it the betrayal of the ringing phone reminder after years? Is it a girl who is ignorant of the angelic dance peeping through the teenager's doorway?
Years later, he finally realized that he had been guilty for 35 years, which was originally pure loyalty and friendship; the brother he devoted to and maintained for life had deceived him for 35 years.<br/><br/>There is nothing new under the sun, and the key to good movies lies in the way they tell stories. The yellowish color of the film seems to be covered with a layer of mist, so that each lens is like an old yellowed picture; the high and distant pan flute is awkward. The music and the plot blended together to complement each other, and several transitions were made to happen. In the four-hour movie, the plot is clear when you see the second pass.

"gab-14712","10","0","5","27 April 2020"," An Emotional, Thoughtful Masterpiece!
","In my humble opinion, Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America might be one of the greatest gangster films ever made, if not the best one. People unfairly compare this movie to The Godfather, but each film is a masterpiece in its own different way. People even say this movie is one of the best films of all time. I would give credibility to those people because I wholeheartedly agree. This film, Leone's director cut at least, is in my top 100 list. One of the many reasons why this film is amazing is because is a deep, thematic film. Leone created a film about the American Dream. How it will lure you in with its promises and then betray you just as quickly. Sounds familiar, right? The film is also about friendship, loyalty, greed, love, and violence.<br/><br/>The situation surrounding the film's release is a sad story. The film is incredibly long at 3 hours and 49 minutes, but Leone made sure each minute mattered in telling his story. It does require patience and focus, but you will be proud of it once the credits roll. The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Festival to rapturous praise. It received a 20-minute standing ovation. The original version had a focused story with flashbacks and flash-forwards. Scenes from the 1920's, 1930's, and 1960's were interwoven with each other, but it all made sense. This is what the critics loved. This is what the European cinemas showed. America betrayed Leone and his vision. Fearing the length and the violence, they edited a good ninety minutes from the film and rearranged the movie to organize it chronologically. Leone's film was butchered. Many critics called the edited version the worst film of 1984 and a travesty. Leone was apparently so heartbroken, he would go on to never make a film again. It's really sad but at least his original version is out here for everyone to see. Do NOT see the edited version. See the one that Leone envisioned us all to see.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Noodles (Robert De Niro). He grew up in a tough Jewish neighborhood in the Lower East Side in the 1920's. His best friend was Max (James Woods). In the early 1930's, Prohibition was in full effect across the United States. Max has some business propositions for Noodles. They involve themselves in violence, greed, lust, and with the local gangsters. Noodles falls in love with Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern; younger Deborah played by Jennifer Connelly). In the 1960's, Noodles arrives as an elderly man figuring out everything that happened and what went wrong during his life in New York City. The movie is really about loyalties being tested and being betrayed by the American Dream.<br/><br/>The film delivers a plethora of amazing performances. With this cast, is it hard to deny that statement? Robert De Niro excels in these kinds of films, so it is a given he would be excellent here. I sympathized with his character even if his character made some horrible decisions, including how he treats his women. I also liked his chemistry with James Woods. Woods is not my favorite actor, but he delivers a very moving performance. Elizabeth McGovern is great, and Jennifer Connelly was a real find! Joe Pesci is great in a small supporting role as local gangster Frankie. Everyone is on top of their game with this film.<br/><br/>The film is emotional. and it can hit you hard with emotion. You might think that the film's music is a reason why you would feel emotional. With that mindset, I would say you have an excellent taste in music. Ennio Morricone is a film legend who created many memorable film scores, including this one. His theme, ""Deborah's Theme,"" is a tearjerker. It's one of the more beautiful musical pieces you'll hear in any movie. It's a shame he was not nominated for an Oscar due to technicality issues.<br/><br/>Sergio Leone is a director who is often underlooked and deemed too artsy. He was the man who brought the likes of Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson to the public eye. He was never really appreciated here in the states even after his Fistful of Dollars trilogy. That, in part, may have been the reason why this film was in the pre-production phase since the 1960's. In the end, Leone finally made this film. A triumphal directorial effort that remains his very best.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is a very unique film that explores the lives of Jewish gangsters from childhood to old age. I also like how there is ambiguity here. Is this movie actually an opium-fueled dream by Noodles? Opium is known to give vivid dreams as one of its potential side effects. Regardless of what you make think, Leone made a movie where scene matters in the grand scope of things. If you are a patient cinephile or moviegoer, the rewards are endless. Be prepared for plenty of violence, nut I really loved this emotional, thoughtful masterpiece.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"The_Real_Oilman","10","0","4","26 April 2020"," ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA (1984) review.
","Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is hands down one of, if not the greatest crime movie of all time. But how does one achieve the title of the greatest of its genre especially in the crime genre, which if filled with classics like The Godfather movies and GoodFellas?<br/><br/>ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is by far the most emotional crime movie I have ever seen and that is because of its extremely well-written story and complex characters. Noodles and Max particularly stand out not only because they are essentially the main characters of the film but because of how complex they are. We see their entire lives through this movie and how they go from kids trying to rule the streets to mafia men who are on top of the world and then old men who are but a shell of what they used to be. Their characters are the embodiment of what's amazing about this film, which is also boosted by the stellar performances from Robert De Niro and James Woods. And they are not the only great characters in this film. The character of Deborah is also amazing for how much she changes throughout the course of her life.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this film as emotional as it is the score by Ennio Morricone. Without it this movie wouldn't be nearly as emotional and that's because of how well it conveys emotion. It's similar to what Howard Shore did with THE LORD OF THE RINGS where it builds the emotion through the music that is playing. And the main score for ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is particularly incredible because of what it represents. It is sad yet beautiful and it conveys a lot of themes of the film like progression of the American society and the reality of how everyone is getting old and their lives are slowly fading away that these characters have to face.<br/><br/>Another thing that amplifies the themes in this film is its cinematography. It has incredible scale and it not only looks incredible but it also shows how fast the civilization has advanced throughout the years and it also has absolutely stunning use of colour.<br/><br/>The pacing in this film is arguably the greatest out of any movie I have seen. It is a slow-burn yet it never once drags. It is genuinely amazing how this could be possible with such a runtime but yet here we are. Leone made every scene in this film feels relevant to the plot and given how long this film is this is an achievement in of itself.<br/><br/>There is just no crime film quite as powerful and deep as ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA. There just really isn't. I would highly recommend this film to everyone that is a fan of the genre and slowly paced films. This film is not for everyone but if you can appreciate the film for what it is you will be able to witness the peak moment from the career of the father of westerns."

","For the classics in this classic, many people will read it again and again, and I am no exception, because it is so beautiful. Looking back, I suddenly saw the man who had watched the imported film in the dim shadow hall at the foot of Snake Mountain. In a day's time, I read the full four-hour edition twice in a row, and every time I saw it, I could see new details and new discoveries and feelings.<br/><br/>This is a great movie that I can't talk about for days and nights. I will just talk about them and them in my eyes.<br/><br/>Noodles, a gangster that is not like a gangster, loves reading when he is alone when he is a teenager, and thinks when he is quiet, but thinking has nothing to do with money and reputation. Noodles are ordinary people with love, just like his name ""Noodles"". They are ordinary but practical, warm, soft and reliable. He loves brothers, Deborah, friends around him, the soft love of noodles and the incompatibility of a bloody and violent real environment in which he is in a strong contrast, and also makes him in the gang world There has always been tangled, contradictory, silent, unhappy. He couldn't put aside everything he cares about and truly be himself. His contradictions, weaknesses and worries, and his goalless and principleless personality doomed his tragic fate.<br/><br/>From the time of sexual germination, the noodles were deeply obsessed with and fell in love with her friend Fatmo's sister Deborah. When the dear brother Dominic was killed, he did not hesitate to rush up and revenge for his brother. The word ""yi"" took the lead, and he did not look back, completely regardless of his own safety. However, the same word ""yi"" also made him in Among the only beloved women and brothers in his life, the brother was the first choice, and he put his thick emotions deeply in his heart. At this time, he is weak again. He will never declare loudly to everyone, ""Peggy, you are mine"" like his brother Paihe. His character determines his destiny, and he will never invade his individual repeatedly at Max. Emotions, bottom line, principles, make any meaningful resistance or confrontation. In this way, he stepped into Max 's quagmire step by step with his brother 's contemplation for Max, and finally, before the person who did not meet Max The eyes are shining, they bring their own leadership temperament, they are brave and conscientious, they can take the little brothers to eat together, and they can read books and fall in love.<br/><br/>In the last and only official date with Deborah, the noodles finally boldly showed their love for Deborah that they had not spoken for more than ten years. This is when Deborah went to the angel in the eyes of noodles. The goddess Deborah is so indecent, beautiful, vanity, and cold. She admits that she has always loved noodles. When she was a child, she did do things that seduce noodles because she was involuntarily. However, she also thought more clearly from beginning to end. , Her love for noodles is just a ridiculous instinct, she can not accept the existence of this instinctive desire. At the dining table, her words and words are both relentlessly pulling the distance between the two, highlighting the difference between the two, implying that she has knowledge, knowledge, pursuit and ideals, he is ignorant, vulgar, low-spirited, and chaotic. When I danced, I loved the noodles for more than ten years. I finally waited for the affectionate hug that I finally waited. I did n't feel it. I raised my head like a wood and opened my eyes. The soul was not attached. From here, anyone can see that she does n't love at all. In her arms, she does not have any attachments and feelings. Not only does she not love noodles, but also herself. The attitude towards the lingering time that is gone forever, and the noodles that have gone green, showed her ruthlessness and indifference, but the poor noodles stuck his face on the face of the only woman he loved in his life. To the indifferent and stiff face next to my ear, completely intoxicated in his love, we can probably see that this woman will not really fall in love for a lifetime? She is like a cold diamond, gorgeous, noble, but hard and cold. She proudly thinks that she and noodles are not the same kind of people in the same world at all. How could I fall in love with such a vacant boy? She was as cold as a surgical operation, excluding noodles from her life, and she announced that she was going to Hollywood to develop, leaving this non-influential person.<br/><br/>Before breaking up, in order to show that she had no return to the noodles and loved her comfort and compensation for more than ten years, she took the initiative to kiss the sad and silent noodles around her, which made the noodles suddenly wake up. Time is like a wheel flying forward. Before a few years of love, love will soon be separated. The last parting will go for twelve years, and this time, maybe it will be a farewell. He ca n't just let Deborah go. He has the last hint of hope, fantasizing. Deborah may still have a little love and reluctance for him. Love or not love, the body is the most authentic and honest, how can noodles not understand, even if you are determined to leave, you can always make a break and commemorate this love in the most direct way, but the noodle dream It was completely smashed, and if there is any trace of emotion for this man who has been obsessed with himself since he was a teenager, if he has a little bit of love for the man who claims to be the only one he likes, at the time of separation, in the noodle Under the request of sorrow, she will not be so determined, until there is no slight hesitation and emotion from beginning to end. At this moment, noodles have to finally accept this cruel fact. She really does not love, not only does not Love, plus hatred, she hated this humble servant who bowed at her feet, even violated her, defiled her, the door opened, the noodles climbed down like a hollow shell of the soul, completely desperate, he knew, In this way, he ended all the intersections and possibilities of the two of his life, and it was completely over. Since then, the noodles have fallen in love with opium, and their eyes have lost their light, Mu Na is sad and more silent.<br/><br/>At the station where Deborah left, Noodle secretly stared at Deborah again. I read it several times, thinking that from Deborah 's point of view, she should be able to see the noodles coming, but she was still expressionless. , And handed down the curtains of the car window, decisively cut everything with noodles.<br/><br/>Thirty-five years later, Noodle and Deborah had another meeting. This time, the noodles sat in the theater to watch Deborah 's performance for the first time. In the dream, the goddess is still the goddess, and he is old. In the dressing room, the two met for the first time after 35 years. At the beginning, Deborah was still on the surface, showing that she did n't care about the noodles. She maintained a sense of distance. Extremely unfriendly, but just as the conversation between the two continued to advance, Debola became more and more flustered in the noodles one by one, and the movement of constantly cleaning her face to remove makeup was getting faster and more chaotic, she She kept rubbing and rubbing, but she couldn't wipe it clean, her face was a mess, just like her heart, it was a mess. The mask is entangled with the face, and the truth and the false are also mixed together, a little messy, but it does not matter, be careful, be careful, you will be able to distinguish clearly. In the end, Deborah finally collapsed. She simply gave up the masking action and used her embarrassed face to tell the noodle a little bit of warmth in her heart, and persuaded the noodle to leave. However, the noodles are no longer the original noodles. After 35 years of precipitation, he will not give up when he comes back this time. Deborah uncontrollably exposed her hysterics and anger before the scandal. This proud and vanity Women want to show their success and nobility everywhere, but how can you be with that hypocritical and vicious Max? That is the lover you have been trying to abandon noodles? Do you feel embarrassed to be a ungrateful betrayal of a betrayed brother, a cold-blooded shameless man who treats women like playthings? Do you think noodles come to see your joke? Finally, Deborah, who removed her mask, was no longer the goddess of noodles. ""Friends and wives can't lie."" The common betrayal between her and Max is terrible and unforgivable. At this time, the noodles 35 years later, the best The choice is not hate, but to keep the distance politely and restraintly, what do you do with me? Put it down completely. Next, he also faced Max who tried to be redeemed with the same attitude.<br/><br/>Simply talk about Max, he is a perverted villain, I saw him from the first glance, I didn't like him for no reason, his whole body carried a sultry atmosphere, the first glance at the above article, I couldn't help saying Taking noodles as their own, and imposing narcissistic self-righteousness on the noodles, a point of view is that noodles cannot live without him. The worst part is that he has never really regarded noodles as friends and brothers, possessiveness is abnormal, in short, shameless, he and noodles and their brothers are like the story of the farmer and the wolf. In the end, he didn't end well, just like the noodles once said, ""How do they treat them now, and how will they deal with you and me in the future"" into the evil cycle, no one can escape. His evil went deep into the bone marrow, and he did n't let go of the noodles until he died. He knew exactly where the noodles went and how sad he blamed himself, but he ignored the whole thirty-five years. Chess piece, if he needs to leave him, let him go, if he needs to come back, he should come back, and before he dies he must pull noodles and be buried for him. His mistress is simply ridiculous. F"

","Without giving spoilers away. This movie's whole plot is so fitting for this site. Everything is a matter of perspective and point of view.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie very young my dad was watching it at 11pm on TV it was edited, he loved it and bought the dvd and eventually I ended up getting the Blu-ray directors cut to see what I was missing. At 4hrs 11mins this is the best movie I've ever seen. I've watched it once a year at least, and everytime the story of loyalty, friendship, love, hate, betrayal, its all here.<br/><br/>unfortunately it's underrated badly, due to what I think is modern day lack of concentration. People haven't got the attention span nor the intelligence to sit and concentrate on a 4 hour movie, listening to dialogue. The same people I've seen say this was bad also said Godfather parts 1 and 2 were boring!! This movie needs concentration, so if you are someone who can't let go of their social media for 10 mins like most these days don't bother. If you can then watch it uninterrupted for 4hrs and 11mins I guarantee everytime you watch it, your opinion on the story, the plot, the ending will change each time. As I started with this movie's main point in my eyes is all based on a matter of perspective, in this case the story changes with noodles or max's perspective. As noodles says 'its just the way I see things' I hope more and more people can watch this and enjoy it as much as I do it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Godfather. Definitely my number 1 film and should be anyones top 5"

","I caught Once Upon a Time in America last night on TCM for its premier showing. In the 36 years since its original release I've seen it several times, from the shortened version of 2 hours plus, to the extended 3 hour - 29 minute version released in 2012. I also remember seeing one version --- just one time --- clocking in at something like 4 or 5 hours! Bottomline. The 2012 version seems to be the best one.<br/><br/>While never a big fan of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, I was willing to give this gangster tale a chance. At first, it fell flat. I didn't like the film. It had a disjointed appearance that effected its overall storytelling aspects. Which in turn left it with a boring quality. Well, its still a bit boring at times, but it offers a unique movie viewing experience. A few things to consider. Leone leaned more towards the visual aspects of film making and less towards the spoken word. Remember too, Leone's parents worked mainly during the silent era of film making, when the visual vision, trumped dialog 100% of the time. So, maybe they had a bigger influence on him then people realize.<br/><br/>While Sergio Leone was an assistant and second unit director on many films, he only directed 7 full length feature films in his career. Once Upon A Time in America may not be in the same class with the Godfather films or Goodfellas, but it is a good representation of what life was like in the Jewish gangs during the prohibition era. Leone is not John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock or Orson Wells, however. He is considered one of the most influential film makers of the second half of the 20th century.<br/><br/>I give Once Upon A Time in America, a 7.5 rating."

The movie has a strong appeal specially at the beginning, giving a psicologycal output of the characters and their social background. It creates the field to understand their crimes beyond the classic mafia film and it feels like a nice twist. Yet, suddenly the movie departs dramatically from this point onwards with a slow rhythm, and dialogues began to feel steril and the characters void. It feels as if it's a fantasy film rather than a crime drama. At the end, where it seems as if the senator suicided jumping on a trash trunk... I yelled! Its fak, he is having a bad trip! He is still in the opium parlour and then boom there he was, another day with a big smile after the trip with that annoying phone ringing for 5 minutes.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","0","2","16 November 2019"," An overly long Sergio Leone epic.
","Nobody doubts Sergio Leone's talent as a director. While he's best known for his Spaghetti Westerns, he did make a few films like Once Upon a Time in America (1984). One does wonder if Leone was given free rein with this film, as it was probably an hour longer than it needed to be and included a lot of situations that could have been cut out, or at least trimmed down. If anything, it's clear directors like Quentin Tarantino were influenced by movies like this, considering some of the similarities between it and Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood (2019).<br/><br/>I will admit that most of the scenes in this fractured timeline of a story were necessary. Something that was shown early in the film would inevitably come into play near the end. However, I don't think this excuses the numerous (and gratuitous) sex scenes included in this film. With a run time of almost four hours (including an intermission to boot), at what point does the audience understand what's happening while the movie continues beating a dead horse. Granted, when a film like this is basically three separate movies with these characters at three different times in their life, it can mostly justify being this long.<br/><br/>While Once Upon a Time in America is a distinct piece of Americana (read: Jewish mobsters in New York), I can't help but recognize its notoriety due to its actors. With big players like Robert DeNiro, James Woods, and Jennifer Connelly involved, it's no wonder why it remains one of Sergio Leone's best films. Of course, I still consider his ""Dollars Trilogy"" to be better, if for no other reason than for the setting and cinematography. However, there were plenty of film techniques (like the numerous crane shots) that make Once Upon a Time in America a master class in how to shoot a film.<br/><br/>An overly long Sergio Leone epic, I give Once Upon a Time in America 3.5 stars out of 5."
"view_and_review","7","0","7","7 November 2019"," Are We Supposed To Ignore What Happened?
","I think I should give myself a good rating for being able to watch a nearly four hour movie. It was good, but nothing that couldn't be covered in let's say two or two and a half hours.<br/><br/>It's a long tale focusing mainly on the character Noodles (Robert De Niro). We're taken through three distinct points in his life and his rather topsy turvy relationship with his running mate Max (James Woods). The two of them led a rugged pack of friends that graduated from petty crimes to big time licks.<br/><br/>It was an interesting tale yet nothing spectacular. It's hard to ignore the fact that the main character is a two time rapist.<br/><br/>The first woman, Carol (Tuesday Weld), actually enjoyed the sexual assault. This is not me misinterpreting the sexual encounter through male eyes, this is me seeing the woman truly enjoying being raped and wanting to rendezvous with Noodles again when they later met. It could be said that her enjoyment of that sexual encounter led Noodles to strike again. Perhaps, he internalized that experience as ""this is how women like to be treated.""<br/><br/>Which leads to his second rape. This time it was Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern), a woman he ""cared"" about and she did not enjoy any part of it. If the first rape could be dismissed as an aggressive act of giving a woman what she wanted, the second rape absolutely could not be. Yes, Deborah kissed him, but she also vigorously and demonstratively rebuffed Noodles' aggressive advances. There was no ambiguity there. She wanted no part of that sexual encounter.<br/><br/>Even with those two heinous acts, it's like they show you that but don't want those acts to define him. He is more than those two rapes. Sure, OK. But much like I'm sure Deborah never forgot it, I couldn't forget it. And how many rapists and killers are out there that have done very humanitarian things beyond their crimes?<br/><br/>I am reviewing the entire movie though. The movie is more than just those two acts of rape, even though I had a hard time moving past them. The movie as a whole is better than average, but nothing spectacular."

All great films should make you think and this is no exception, it's all about 'what might have been' and revisiting the past (who doesn't do that?)
Beautifully shot and atmospheric if you want a 'shoot em up' gangster movie this isn't it. If you want to feel transported to a different era and sample the frailties of the human being then this might possibly be the best film ever made."

Mr bailey asks him if this is his way of getting back at him. Noodles then say "" no it is just the way I see things ""referring to their old friendship and not seeing the present new reality. It is almost a choice to face the pain or ignore it by submerging into a different dream. To escape the painful reality. Just as are drugs. A choice to escape.<br/><br/>That is why the final scene is one of him doing drugs or escaping into a different reality to avoid pain. The smile is the representation of escape and ignoring realities of life by being stoned.<br/><br/>He leaves the house and then he watches Mr Bailey come out and disappear behind the truck. He may have killed himself / or perhaps he did not.

He has escaped that reality and his old friend disappearance is as trivial to him as the partying people.<br/><br/>But the choice of seeing things differently is also a representation of something else. Or just the intrinsic part of people. How and who we are as individuals. How we react to things in life. Where that betrayal of a lifetime was easily done by Max, noodles cannot accept it in anyway.

So this viewing satisfied my curiosity. Of note it is the last feature film of the noted director Sergio Leone.<br/><br/>The movie is long but that never becomes a factor in watching it, because every scene is so interesting. The late and great critic Ebert wrote of it, ""Is the film too long? Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that it takes real concentration to understand Leone's story construction, in which everything may or may not be an opium dream, a nightmare, a memory, or a flashback, and that we have to keep track of characters and relationships over fifty years. No, in the sense that the movie is compulsively and continuously watchable and that the audience did not stir or grow restless as the epic unfolded.""<br/><br/>It is a story about a group of Jewish teenagers in New York and how their lives developed and played out over 60+ years. The earlier scenes are during early 1920s when Prohibition was in full force, other scenes are during 1933 when Prohibition was repealed, some in the 1960s, and the latest ones in the early 1980s, the period this movie was actually filmed.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro, around 40, is David 'Noodles' Aaronson and his bestie is James Woods, around 35, as Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz.

You have to guess based on the vehicles you see, the age certain characters look, what kind of music is playing, etc. So when it is all over you are not really sure what all you saw and what exactly the stories are. <br/><br/>Still it is easy to see why this movie is highly rated.

"bscrivener-50810","7","0","2","28 May 2016"," A realistic gangster story of epic proportions- but slow paced and exposition heavy.
","Set during the Prohibition era, Once Upon A Time In America follows the story of David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro) firstly growing up on Lower East Side of Manhatten, committing petty crimes such as minor thefts and robberies to later becoming a prominent mobster in adult life. The film explores themes such as lust, betrayal, greed, love and friendship all while portraying the rise of syndicate gangs and the Mafia in American society. Once Upon A Time In America undoubtedly tells an magnificent and realistic story of epic proportions, but this in a way is the films undoing, at a run time of 229 minutes the film seems to drag on far too long and develops at a slower pace than it needed to. Being Sergio Leone's final film, it originally came under a mixed response with two different versions of the film released in theatres the Original European Version and the American Cut. However, has since gone on to be labelled as one of the greatest gangster films of all time. Despite being a different genre of film from Leone's normal work, many of his signature traits such as long shots, visual expression and the iconic Ennio Morricone Spaghetti western soundtrack are noticeable and definitely positive points for the film. I also found mainly the second act and latter part of the first act to be more faster paced and interesting moments in the film as Noodles transitions from childhood to adult hood. Also the final scenes complete the motion picture brilliantly with a conclusive and pleasing ending. However, going back to my previous point that the film is far longer than it needed to be, this is evident mainly in the films first act with some scenes feeling far too slow and some even slightly irrelevant to the films progressive plot. The film is told through flashbacks from 1968 and starts being told from a in media res prospective, filling us in with important details and exposition as the film progresses, this works well and is mainly the only reason I remained fully focused and engaged. The Film also features a disappointing lack of action for a gangster flick and even at a 229 minutes, an important robbery scene was unfortunately cut out that a lot of the film focused on and seemingly built too, therefore it all seeming a waste. Another point to note is it attempts to hit you hard with emotions at times but these fall flat (with the exception of a few during the first act) because of the characters being violent, dangerous and brutal, meaning we don't connect with them very well on this level. Once Upon A Time In America features a beautiful soundtrack, signature Leone traits and tells an epic story which for the most part is engaging. However it's lack of action and drawn out scenes of exposition and dialogue mean it seems to trudge at a snails pace and doesn't always keep you gripped. 7/10"

"maiorinvs","9","0","5","3 December 2013"," The wrong authors
","The credit says: Music Ennio Morricone. That's not true for the song ""Amapola"" (played in the film), which was composed in 1924 by Spanish musician José María La Calle García, born in Cádiz, Southern Spain in 1860, who later simplified his name and surnames into Joseph LaCalle, for he established in the USA after having emigrated very young to Cuba (Spain at the time). Morricone was not even born when ""Amapola"" -so popular in Spain, then, now and ever- was composed. Another ""error"", this one very well known, is attributing the song ""The violet seller"" (Spanish original ""La Violetera"") to Charles Chaplin in the film ""City lights"". The composer was the Spaniard José Padilla Sánchez or, in short, maestro Padilla (El Relicario, Valencia), who suited Chaplin after seeing the credits of the film. The trial took place in Paris and was won by Padilla."
"Red-Barracuda","8","0","2","18 October 2013"," A great film but, dare I say it...a bit over-long
","With this film Sergio Leone, the spaghetti western genius, made his gangster film. It was a project long in the making and it took many years to finally make the screen. The result is an epic film that covers four decades in the lives of a gang of Jewish hoodlums from Ney York's Lower East Side. It's told in a fractured time structure specifically covering the years 1922, 1933 and 1968. In the earliest period the characters are boys, entering the world of crime, in the middle section they are at the height of their powers as gangsters in the prohibition era, while in the latter year the story climaxes when they are old men. It isn't told chronologically though. There are flash-backs and flash-forwards; and in this way the film can deal with themes of memories, guilt and redemption much better, while it is able to conceal plot twists far more effectively. The story is essentially about the relationship between Noodles and Max, childhood friends who grew up to be gangsters. Noodles returns to New York in '68 after being in self-imposed exile for 35 years. He seemingly sold out his friends and is haunted by this memory but he soon realises on arrival that events in his past were not as they seemed.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in America is less celebratory of the gangster lifestyle than most other films in its genre. Most others show the criminals in their pomp and glory, so that the audience can understand why they lead the life they do. But here, we don't see too much of that. Mostly it's in actuality about the wasted lives of gangsters. The regrets they have about their previous ways and how it destroys them. This is compounded by the fact that there are really no likable characters in it at all. The central character Noodles, who is the emotional core of the film, is shown to be a killer and a rapist. So as the film progresses it is somewhat difficult feeling too sorry for his plight. It's quite a brave move for the movie to have such unsympathetic leads. Robert De Niro and James Woods offer up excellent portrayals of these damaged men though and we do believe in them, even if it is hard to like them. But, as a contrast to the violence and grimness of the story it looks very grand. The period is recreated with fine detail and the cinematography enhances this. It is a very lavish looking film indeed.<br/><br/>I do have one issue though and that's its length. At three hours and forty minutes this is an excessively long film. Some people say that it needs to be this length to tell its story properly. I disagree. If Coppola or Scorsese had wanted they could have fleshed The Godfather or Goodfellas out to the same length with extra detail and character development. Anybody could really. It does not necessarily make a film better by simply adding more in. Three hours seems more than enough for the story of Once Upon a Time in America and a bit of editing could easily have made it tighter and more concise without losing anything of significant consequence. The shorter, less exhausting, time-span would improve it. I don't like saying it but at twenty minutes shy of four hours Leone was being a little self-indulgent.<br/><br/>But time issues aside, this is still one of the gangster films from the upper bracket of the genre."
"cat_ranchero","8","0","3","23 February 2013"," Epic!...
","I first have to say I loved the story; it's epic and no mistaking; very long, but never boring. Leone manages to keep it interesting despite quite a slow pace to the proceedings and quite a complex plot. Although I usually like the film music of Ennio Morricone, on this rare occasion I found the music a little too sentimental; particularly the pan pipe refrain. I loved the visual style of the film; it is almost like one of those old Leone spaghetti westerns in places; unmistakably his work! Despite all its good points though I found I did have to mark it down slightly just because it is so very long! At over three and a half hours (nearly four), it really does test even the most ardent film fan. I read that it was released in three separate parts in Russia! Over all though, I did very much enjoy it despite the length and the somewhat overly- sentimental musical score. Definitely worth a look (if you can spare the four hours or so).<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED <br/><br/>My score: 8.2/10.<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","4","20 April 2012"," About as epic as a gangster movie can get
","First of all, see the director's cut, because it's much more truthful to the original vision of Sergio Leone. Second of all, if you're a fan of gangster movies, this movie is a must see one. It's right up there with The Godfather trilogy in terms of sheer scope, majesty and brilliance of storytelling. And yet the movies are very different. The Godfather is more about the mafia and old crime families whereas this movie is much more from rags to riches kind of story. And it is one that has influenced its genre greatly. Scorsese's Goodfellas for example owns a lot of its basic story, style and characters to this piece.<br/><br/>Although in my opinion Goodfellas tells its story a bit better. Once Upon a Time in America is told in non-chronological fashion with many early scenes getting their background and explanation near the end of the film. The director's cut is the one where this non-chronological order is maintained as it was 'fixed' for the initial release in many places. I can understand the reasoning behind that decision as the movie is kind of hard to follow unless you pay a lot of attention or are willing to watch it twice, but it really takes something away from the vision if you mess with the director's initial ideas, so see the director's cut even if it requires a bit more from you as a viewer.<br/><br/>That being said, the story has some ambiguity to it, which either works for you or not. For me, it kind of did. The movie has that epic feel to it, depending more on its themes, the atmosphere and the actors to relay its message of fighting your way through heavy odds, disregarding the rules of the society and making up your own rules, depending on your brothers and bowing down to no one. Classical gangster movie themes, but this film really solidifies them into their pure form.<br/><br/>Special mentions should also go to the cast and the score, which were both beyond measure. Robert De Niro, Ennio Morricone, Joe Pesci, James Woods... How can you go wrong with people like that. They really took this movie and made it their own with perfectly delivered lines, atmospheric and highly memorable pieces of music and sheer talent.<br/><br/>Still, I can't say that this movie deserves a higher grade than what I gave it. Its individual pieces are all about perfect, but the way that the story is told and the length of the film drag it down just the tiniest bit. I can respect the artistic vision behind those both aspects and I can clearly see why some regard this as their favourite movie of all time, but I personally prefer Goodfellas. It's a great movie, but not the greatest."

","It's been said that when one watches a ""spaghetti"" western (one of the ""Man with no name"" films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good."

It's a monument.<br/><br/>I believe that the rating on IMDb is very close to what it should be, but the one area of credit that is deserved and should be reconsidered are the child actors. Their names should appear at least in the top third of all the listed actors for this film. They have to establish and carry this film into the greater sphere where it fulfills itself.<br/><br/>Granted, the top tier of actors are the top tier, but Joe Pesci's role, or Danny Aiello's role is minor in comparison to the young actors. And if the list of actors followed the coherence of ""top tier"" first, Jennifer Connelly would be at the top along with Pesci and/or Burt Young... and for that matter, if Burt Young is listed early-on, so should James Russo.<br/><br/>So - this isn't a review so much as a reminder to anyone that appreciates this film to remember the work of the young actors."

"mjneu59","8","0","3","21 December 2010"," a sprawling mess of a masterpiece
","Sergio Leone's opulent, operatic fairy tale of Jewish gangsters in New York City wants to be the 'Citizen Kane' of organized crime movies, tracing the roots of gang loyalty and corruption from childhood to old age in a complex leapfrogging structure spanning more than half a century. The full length, belatedly released, restores to the film the astonishing scope and depth of feeling left on the cutting room floor before its initial opening, and boasts several excellent performances, led by Robert De Niro as the erstwhile street punk who betrays his friends in order to save them. The ambiguous script is still a textbook lesson in narrative overkill, with half a dozen writers contributing episode after incident after colorful digression, and the accumulative effect of the film's three-and-a-half hour running time is finally more exhausting than exhilarating. It's certainly the late director's richest (and, in many ways, most accomplished) feature, mixing equal parts elegance and crudity, not unlike a long, beautifully written poem peppered with gutter expletives."

","I knew it was a gangster film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You die, and that was good enough for me, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sergio Leone (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Basically it is a episodic style tale focusing on the lives of a small group of Jewisg gangsters living in New York City, the story spans over forty years. Told in mostly flashbacks and flash-forwards, it mainly looks at small-time crook David 'Noodles' Aaronson (Robert De Niro) and his partners in crime, Maximilian 'Max' Bercovicz (James Woods), Philip 'Cockeye' Stein (William Forsythe) and Patrick 'Patsy' Goldberg (James Hayden). It sees them grow up as youths in the rough Jewish neighbourhood of the Lower East Side of New York in the 1920s, the early 1920s Prohibition, and the late 1960s with an elderly Noodles returning to look into his past. I didn't fully understand all of the plot, especially with the mixture of flashing backwards and forwards in time, but you are intrigued to see what situations Noodles and the gang are going to get themselves into. Also starring Elizabeth McGovern as Deborah Gelly, Treat Williams as James Conway O'Donnell, BAFTA nominated Tuesday Weld as Carol, Burt Young as Joe, Joe Pesci as Frankie Manoldi, Danny Aiello as Police Chief Vincent Aiello and Jennifer Connelly as Young Deborah. As I said, I didn't really get the plot, I just enjoyed the actors being rough and in a few scenes quite quiet, the violence and gun play, and some good music by Ennio Morricone. It was apparently a big flop when it was brought out in cinemas, but these days they like to call it a masterpiece, I suppose in certain scenes I'd agree with that, it is about three hours twenty seven minutes long, but it is certainly a different kind of epic crime drams to see. It won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design and Best Score for Ennio Morricone, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Robert De Niro was number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!"
"hall895","7","0","1","30 September 2008"," It takes a long time to tell this story
","Yes, the film is too long. No, the film should not have been cut down and butchered beyond all recognition as was the case with its original American theatrical release. Somewhere in between there must be a happy medium. But given the choice between the two extremes it is certainly much better that we are able to see the film as director Sergio Leone intended for it to be seen. Leone's vision for how the story should unfold is what makes the film unique. At times it can be a frustrating film to watch with its exceptionally deliberate pacing. There are certainly times while watching the film where you wish Leone would pick up the pace and move things along. But upon reflection, after seeing the whole film in its entirety, only then can you really appreciate what Leone has done. It's a terrific story and it's a story which is told in a simply brilliant manner. Yes, the film drags at times. Yes, there certainly could have been some cuts here and there to make the running time more manageable. But in the end there is no denying that the film works. It's by no means perfect. There are notable lulls and lesser moments scattered throughout. But the film as a whole ends up being greater than the sum of its parts. And you really cannot understand that until you settle in for the long journey and watch the whole thing.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a group of five young Jewish gangsters from New York City over a span of five decades or so. As you might imagine these characters lead violent lives and certainly not all of them are destined to survive this decades-long journey. But the way this story is presented we know the ultimate fates of some of these characters very early on in the film. That is because Leone presents his story in a non-linear fashion, cutting back and forth between three distinct eras. It is left to the audience, and one key character, to piece things together and it is really impossible to do so until the story has completely unfolded. Scenes which seem unimportant and superfluous take on an entirely different meaning when you see where the story eventually goes. Robert De Niro plays Noodles (because what's a gangster without a nickname?) and it is Noodles who is at the center of the film, tying the various eras together. A younger actor portrays the character in the film's earliest 1920s era when the gangsters are really just young boys. De Niro takes over the role for the other two eras, during the gangsters' 1930s prime and in 1968 when Noodles is pulled back into a world he thought he had left decades ago. De Niro owns the screen, his performance is perfect as he portrays the young 1930s tough and the older man of 1968 trying to unravel a very complex personal mystery. And De Niro is supported by a large group of excellent actors who bring each of the story's eras to brilliant life. James Woods as Noodles' closest friend in the gang and Elizabeth McGovern as the woman Noodles loves but is probably never destined to have give the two most notable performances aside from De Niro but really the entire cast is spot-on. From the young child actors portraying the gang in its earliest incarnation to Woods and McGovern and many other familiar faces who pop up throughout everyone involved seems to fit their role perfectly. It's a wonderful cast which does a magnificent job bringing a terrific story to life.<br/><br/>So yes this is a film with a great story. And yes the cast is terrific. And yes the way Leone frames his story adds a brilliant touch. But there is the still the nagging thought that a little brisker pace would have helped. It's not even that entire scenes had to be cut as you realize in the end that every scene really does have its place. Its that Leone at times seems to linger on scenes where the important information the audience and characters need has already been relayed. And there are scenes where too much time is spent setting up the important event which is about to happen rather than simply getting to that important event. A few minor cuts here and there might well have lessened the frustration one senses as the film hits the occasional lull. It's a film with so many great moments but you wish Leone could have gotten in and out of those great moments a little quicker. But all in all this is a film which is certainly a long journey but definitely a satisfying one."

","Quite simply the best film I've ever seen. De Niro's best ever performance with a surprisingly good performance from James Woods and most of the supporting adult cast. Some of the acting by the younger cast members is a bit wooden and even annoying in places but the sweeping cinematography more than makes up for this minor annoyance. With a staggeringly good soundtrack and brilliant story line, this film is essential viewing for anyone and everyone who considers themselves a true film aficionado. One word of warning though. If you do plan on seeing this film, give yourself a whole afternoon because this a VERY long film. Having said that, for what this film comprises, it's the perfect length. Enjoy!"

","With great anticipation I watched the 229-minute DVD director's cut of Once Upon A Time In America. The original release version was supposedly butchered beyond recognition, but I was frustrated to find this one itself had so many problems, because it is often beautiful. What could've been a masterpiece on The Godfather Part II level misses for reasons I cannot fully understand, and it's sad.<br/><br/>It is possible that much of it went over my head, but right now it appears that director Sergio Leone, or his cutter and assembler, unaccountably lost account of or forgot to include crucial narrative information in a way I have never seen happen before in a major production.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: At the beginning, a woman is shot by Burt Young and another thug after going to look for Noodles (Robert DeNiro), who's in hiding from them. A few seconds before she notices some bullet holes on or near Noodles' bed. The bullet holes are never explained, and I think this woman was Noodles' girlfriend seen much later in a 1933 flashback (Darlanne Fluegel?). However, we are never really introduced to her; she just shows up those two times with no back story, and this seems confusing and abrupt. The motivation of Burt Young, et al going after them to begin with was vague; it was obviously because of a rip-off but was not shown or explained coherently. There's some build-up to an ambitious robbery that's supposed to be very dangerous, with much forewarning from Tuesday Weld (who is excellent), but we never see this event come down. Yet Leone spends interminable minutes on a boy toying with a pastry. Also there seems to be some material missing about Treat Williams' union official's relationship with organized crime and how this led to James Woods' plight at the movie's conclusion. Finally, what was the point of not bothering to age the actors? Elizabeth McGovern is supposed to look different from 1933 to 1968, but there was no effort to show 30 plus years of aging. De Niro gets some gray in his hair; that's it. I suppose I'm missing some symbolism. I was very unhappy with the rape scene, not only due to the revolting imagery but also because since there was no prior hint of such potential behavior in the development of the DeNiro character, it was shockingly unexpected.<br/><br/>I nod to OUTIA for its breathtaking production design, good cast, good performances and pacing. But for the frustrating lapses, I express puzzlement, unless, as some have suggested, the 1968 portion is all a dream. I'm not used to the way some European directors work, and don't have the time or patience for repeat viewings to tease out all the hidden information here (if it is here at all) as such films require, so I thank other posters for their insights. For now, much of this movie is too abstruse for me.<br/><br/>I still like this picture much better than any other Sergio Leone production I've seen, as I have always been alienated by his supposedly ironic but mostly just arch deconstruction of the Western, in which meaningful dialogue, character development, and exposition is ditched in favor of long, enigmatic minutes of actors' faces close-up as they stare at each other, with strangely grandiose, glorious music swelling up in the background. Call me reactionary, but I regard his contribution to the Western genre to be a largely a load of stylistic, self-absorbed poppycock."

","This movie has a haunting quality that makes it literally unforgettable. I've seen it twice now; once several years ago on television in a heavily edited version, and recently in the full director's cut, nearly four hour version.<br/><br/>It's a flawed, difficult movie, that's often hard to follow, but it will reward the viewer's patience eventually with a compelling, perhaps even tragic story. It's not quite like any other movie I can recall; certainly not a conventional gangster movie. There's something terribly poignant about seeing Robert DeNiro as the aging gangster who has returned after years in exile to find out what happened to his childhood friends. His performance is beautifully complemented by Ennio Morricone's lovely score. The child actors are very convincing in their roles and the sense of various periods and changing times is well captured by the art direction and cinematography. It is an unusual kind of role for James Woods, whose character remains an enigma to the end.<br/><br/>It's true that this movie is not for everyone, but those viewers with the patience to stay with it will find it a fascinating experience that lingers long after the end of the film."

He also did this film and Once Upon a Time in the West.<br/><br/>This is an outstanding gangster film with Woods and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. There are several versions, and the director's cut is the best for the intended non-linear style. The studio released the movie in chronological order, but that is not what Leone intended.<br/><br/>The score is an integral part of this film that sets the mood and acts without dialog in many instances.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for those wimps that did not go to Grindhouse.

","Having read and thoroughly enjoyed ""The Hoods"" when it came out in paperback during the early 1950's, I liked the film, even though the TV version is somewhat confusing and difficult for me to follow. I only wish that, to maximize authenticity, the early street scenes had been filmed in New York City rather than in Canada; to anyone who's spent a lot of time on Manhattan's Lower East side, they obviously weren't. In the 1920's and 1930's, for example, it's highly unlikely that a restaurant in that teeming, working class neighborhood would be as spacious as the one depicted; moreover, the local streets were far less wide and open than those in the film."

","I suppose this should go to a bulletin board - but given some of the reviews I've seen, I think this needs to be emphasized again.<br/><br/>I am not going to rate this film - or even comment on it, directly. Leone's fans will understand as I go on.<br/><br/>As we all should know (but it is quite clear from reviews that many do not know) Leone planned a film some 250 minutes long; the original version of this film ran 239 minutes; it was then cut down to about 120 minutes (hey, that's nearly half the movie!) and it was restored - well, unfortunately, that's part of the story.<br/><br/>This film appeared on broadcast television twice in - supposedly - two different forms, the 120 minute version and a ""restored"" version, which later showed up on cable TV.<br/><br/>Well, I saw them both, and I originally saw the 120 min. theatrical version, and all three versions were the same. The supposed ""restored version"" that got shown the second time on broadcast TV had exactly 45 minutes more - of commercials. (To be fair, I think there was actually 5 minutes more of film.) Does anybody else remember that? shown on two or three nights? Yeah, - more commercials (I believe it was on ABC). Worse yet, the TV version hit the VHS rental stores as the ""restored"" version first - and some rental stores still rent it out as such.<br/><br/>The ""original"" American release of this film is wretched. Characters in the 2nd half of the film talk as if they were introduced in the 1st half, only we never saw them. Events are alluded to that never occurred. And the chronologically linear presentations of the sequences actually makes the story difficult to follow since the transitions from scene to scene are abrupt and unprepared for.<br/><br/>I don't know when I gave up hoping to find and see the original film. Eventually, I know I'll bump into it. But, until then....<br/><br/>My remarks here are for those who think they may have seen a ""restored"" version, but didn't.<br/><br/>No, actually, my remarks are for those claiming to have any right to present this movie to the public. The original American release version should be destroyed; the original TV broadcast version should be destroyed; the ""restored"" TV broadcast version should be destroyed; the ""restored' VHS version should be destroyed.<br/><br/>Get the director's cut done and - burn all previous versions!"
"kenjha","8","0","3","30 April 2006"," Fine Finale for Leone
","Epic story about the rise and fall of four gangsters over the course of over forty years. The film has a somewhat complex structure as it switches back and forth between three eras (1920's, 30's, 60's). Despite its extreme length, it manages to sustain interest thanks to Leone's masterful direction and excellent period detail, reminiscent of The Godfather Part II. The film is at its best in showing the early years in New York City, beautifully evoking a bygone era. The child actors, including a young Jennifer Connelly, are very good. The script leaves some loose ends (who the men are chasing DeNiro at the beginning is never explained, the Pesci character abruptly disappears) but is still satisfying. Morricone provides another fine score. A fitting swan song for the stylish Leone."
"Polaris_DiB","7","0","3","10 April 2006"," Deep story that's still easy to follow.
","Crime dramas seem second only to epics in terms of relative length and pondering. For a genre that follows the lives of people who could die at any instant, crime dramas seem to relish the long takes of an actor drinking some (usually illegal) alcoholic substance, pause, smoke a cigarette, take a deep breath, stare at the camera for a while, and then deliver his response to the slowly seething other character. I think this is why I like Miller's Crossing so much... it has the general ideas and conceits of a crime drama of this nature, but it can pull it off in less than two hours.<br/><br/>Well, okay, so let's start over. This is Once upon a Time in America, a crime drama about a man named Noodles who makes his way through the underground starting in the streets of New York and making it big during the Prohibition, eventually to find himself stuck in a quandary over his loyalty to his friends and his desire to keep them all out of trouble. In untypical genre fashion, we follow the movie through a series of flashbacks as Noodle is suddenly dug out of hiding 30+ years later by a mysterious force that seems determined to bring him back to whatever it is he's escaping from. Both parallel stories, his current life and his past life, are revealed simultaneously, each providing clues to the other's motivation. Leone ties the two together with some of the best editing techniques on film, and thus we get a deep enough story that's still easy to follow.<br/><br/>In typical antihero fashion, we will watch our character Noodles as he makes it and breaks it, alienating friends and lovers and eventually spiraling downward from his comfort zone. GoodFellas? Godfather? The same basic structure is there, and let us focus a moment on the ""America"" part of the title. If anything extra can be gleaned from the three hours and forty five minutes of this film, it comes mostly from the short conversation with the socialist. ""What, you think you'll change anything? All they'll do is rape you in the a** and keep on doing it."" We're never really presented Noodle's character as poor or not-very-well off, even in the younger stages of his career, but we understand--""The Underground"", as it were, is simply a parable for American economics, of course. To follow the American Dream is at heart capitalistic, and capitalism is based on exploitation. That is why Noodles can't get the girl of his dreams even though they both love each other. That is why Noodle's era must eventually end to be replaced with a new one. That is why Noodle's eventual catharsis results basically in retirement, retirement not only from his source of income but from the memories of where that income came from.<br/><br/>All of this is illustrated and structured around nice long zooming shots inward towards an actors face as he or she... acts. With silence, with movement, with dialog and keeping still. The characters are believable of course, but that's because we've been raised on a diet of them. What, besides the idea of the American Dream as it relates to the criminal world, keeps compelling us to sit for nearly four hours to watch Al or Robert slap hysterical women around, cavort with dangerous friends, and face down killers with a subtle scowl that suggests pure control and power over the situation? Whatever it is, this is a buffet of it. Just take the Intermission's suggestion and pause it a moment for a break, or you might digest too much and explode.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

The screenplay is greatly written, the dialogue is fantastic, and most of all Ennio Morricone's score is terrific. For the first two hours, the movie was excellent. Everything was going great and there was such great scenes and great storytelling. The problem I had was the next two hours of the film, which I thought was pretty flat. There were a couple memorable scenes, but I thought that most scenes of the second part were boring and could've been a lot better. Overall, this is a good 4 hour movie that leaves Sergio Leone on a great note for many fans, but this could've been a perfect 10 for me if the second part of the film wasn't flat, since the first two hours of the film were fantastic.

","Once Upon a Time in America tells the story of Noodles (De Niro), a Jewish gangster, who returns to New York in the 1960's and reminisces about his childhood and the events which led to the deaths of his friends and his subsequent flight from the city.<br/><br/>The film has a number of twists and turns and sometimes it is difficult to keep up with the story. However, stick with it and you will be rewarded by an evocative recreation of the period.<br/><br/>The main characters are Noodles and his best friend Max (Woods) who grow up together in the early 20th Century carrying out mostly petty crimes until a tragic confrontation with a neighbourhood rival. A few years later, it is Prohibition era in the US and the friends have moved on to become feared gangsters involved in violent crime and organised labour disputes.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gives a restrained performance as Noodles as a man haunted by who he is and what he has done; he is not a hero and his actions mean we should not view him as a sympathetic character, yet he is in contrast to the domineering Max (a slick performance by James Woods).<br/><br/>This film is by no means standard Hollywood fare - its long and meandering with a number of side stories which don't seem to go anywhere and you'll need to watch it more than once to try and work out what it's all about. Plus the women in the cast fit neatly into Madonna (Deborah) or whore (Carol) categories and don't get much to do apart from become victims.

","Once upon a Time in America is a better than average character-driven epic with its strength actually going to the child actor portion of the film. To note, I watched the 229min version which admittedly at times plodded a little bit. Nonetheless I enjoyed the younger boys in their trouble-making and growing up very much. It was a good evolution of mishievousness changing into crime and mayhem. The relationships between the lead boys and then later Woods and Deniro helped pillar the movie. The violence was at times more than needed unfortunately (or fortunately if you like that kind of thing) - note an overlong rape seen which dragged on in poor taste. Music also became repetitive. Nonetheless the setting and characters were well developed and realized, definitely worth a rental especially if you like crime/gangster movies."

","Once Upon A Time In America is a violent gangster film without being brutish. It is at once full of action and reflective. Leone's masterpiece carries an air of mystery about itself and ends without giving that mystery away...at least not openly.<br/><br/>Yet, this movie is never trite.  What Leone created so wonderfully is a rich tapestry of the classic immigrant story. His characters struggle to carve a place for themselves in a new world (the world is always new to a kid; and in the 1910's and 1920's it was new to almost everyone else, as well). All of the characters, even the minor ones, seem to be in constant strife, fighting first to survive and then to thrive in the rich land of America. On one level, this movie is definitely a rags to incredible riches and power story. However, once survival is assured, one cannot always turn off the drive to succeed.<br/><br/>Of course, the avenue to success taken by the young lads is one of crime. Yet, their loyalty to each other is almost honorable. One would swear it was truly born of brotherhood, even to the point each sacrificing themeselves for the other.<br/><br/>But, no, these are not good people struggling with a bad lot in life. These are criminals who are willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead, including killing people. These are bad people who are very real, only they are not heartless. The violence in their lives is cast more as necessity and part of what has to be done, rather than a goal in itself.<br/><br/>What Leone succeeds at doing is making them interesting, truly interesting. The photography, the music and the pacing of the film all work to highlight the dance of friendship between Noodles and Max. For good or bad, when they agree and when they fall out in opposition, they are friends to the core. And, if there is any lesson to learn, it is that friendship, or the absence of it, means more to how one defines one's own life than disagreements and betrayals of that friendship.<br/><br/>And so, friendship is in fact the ultimate theme of Once Upon A Time In America and is what makes it more than a mere ganster film. De Niro and Woods are, indeed, two of the best gansters you will ever find. They are real and gritty and good and bad, all rolled up in one. But friendship and its counterpart, betrayal, are the stars."

","Once a Time in America is the kind of movie that you have to see to believe, or see to make your own opinion and be immune to others. Definitely not your kind of movie if your idea of artistic cinema is ""The Fast and the Furious"" or if you think ""360-degree-panning slow-mo action"" is the way to go! First, there are two versions of this movie: the US theatrical release and the version Sergio Leone envisioned, being the film length and editing the main differences between the two. The version that i suggest you see, is the Director's cut, running almost 4 hours. The movie is beautiful, from beginning to end; it approaches the mob genre in a most distinct manner, being the ties between the gangsters and childhood friends the basic theme of the story. Leone explores the possibilities of story telling using a non-linear approach, going back and forth in time, from the 1920's.. to the 1960's.. and then the 40's.. as we progress in the life of 'Noodles' (DeNiro). I found this technique to be somewhat confusing at first, but then it serves its purpose as it gives a more profound and romantic touch to the film. It is beautiful, like no other gangster movies is, haunting... with Morricone's score, that stays away from his cliched 80's sounding themes, (specially that one from ""The Untouchables"") and profound. I'm not surprised it only made like 5 million dollars in the box office, given how butchered and mutilated this movie got in order to be shown on the big screen. Rent it or buy it.. its beautiful work of art."

","Leone changed the the American Western because he loved it.  In ""Once Upon a Time in America"" he embraces the American gangster film and changes it too-- don't listen to those who say it is too long.  This is a gangster film as Opera-- all the themes, all the violence, all the anti-heroes, all the Old New York blown up into Leone's panoramic vision of America.  It's a wonderful homage to American gangster films and a recreation of their myths. In ""Once Upon a Time in America"" Leone comes to America to celebrate its problems, myths, and impact upon world culture.  After ""Scarface (1983) and the ""Godfather"" films, ""once Upon a Time in America"" is the great postmodern gangster saga.<br/><br/>Viva Leone!"

","When we talk about crime movies the first movie that comes upon our minds is (The Godfather) or other famous crime movies. Unfortunately we don't mention Once Upon A Time In America. Although it contains a few mistakes and unrealistic events that hindered and prevented this movie to be a masterpiece,but people you forget and overlooked other elements in this movie that allure anyone to watch it. First of all the cast is uncanny. I mean the way Robert Deniro, James Woods, Elizabeth Mcgovern, Tuesday Weld and the other actors acted in this movie was outrageous, all of them worked together in consonance and offered us this work (Specially Robert Deniro). Speaking about the actors and their performance,I would like to spotlight on Deniro and James Woods. I have seen plenty of movies for Deniro and Woods, but they were never as perfect as they were in Once Upon A Time In America. The role matched with them. Also the movie's soundtrack, which was composed by the crafty musician Ennio Morricone was glamorous. Most of all the story of Once Upon A Time In America... although it is a fairy tale, but it is really fascinating and extraordinary, it is the story of friends, who as boys have made a pact to share their fortunes, their loves and their lives. As men they shared a dream to rise together from poverty to power. They built an empire of greed,violence and betrayal. It began as a dream, it grew as en empire and it ended as a mystery that refused to die. Finally I would like to add something. Most of the people who watched Once Upon A Time In America didn't appreciate Sergio Leone's directing and said that it was melodramatic and mistakable. Sergio Leone knew every look, every moment before he shot it. He is an actor, he could act Once Upon A Time In America from start to finish (220 minutes) playing all the different parts and be convincing.<br/><br/>That's how brilliant he was."

","I just watched the DVD special edition last nite, and was amazed by this movie in many ways. The cinematography was sublime. I loved the way this movie was shot - the detail of the scenes shot in the train station, and at the dinner between De Niro & Elizabeth McGovern. Really harks back to the way movies used to be filmed, á la casablanca etc. But it just had an incredible look to it. The score, for the most part, worked, as did the cast. (Not a big James Woods fan Im afraid)<br/><br/>Where my problem lies is with the plot. Many parts made little to no sense, such that on first viewing a lot of questions were left open to the viewer. Not about the morality or point the film was trying to make. Just purely about what on earth was going on! (perhaps a 2nd or 3rd viewing will clear up a lot). And a lot of the characters I thought were badly written, under utilised or just completely unbelievable. A similar criticism can be said for the dialogue.<br/><br/>Having said that, there's a lot of moments that just work in this film, regardless, and I suppose a lot of that is down to the Director. I can see myself watching the film a number of times again and hopefully enjoying it more each time!<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Once Upon a Time in America is performed well by De Niro and Woods, scripted better by Grey and the rest of the writers, and directed best by Sergio Leone. It is the journey of a man going back to face his past. When Noodles (De Niro) steps off the train and back onto the streets of his former stomping grounds, he is forced to remember his childhood as a trouble maker, and his earlier adult life as a gangster. Told in a series of flashbacks we are introduced soon to Max (Woods), Cockeye, and Patsy.<br/><br/>This epic focuses on friendship, and betrayal. Noodles is the level headed of the group, while Max is fairly quiet, yet a hot head. Woods and De Niro give outstanding performances as two friends who slowly drift apart, yet try to stay close. It is very obvious that they are headed in opposite directions. Noodles wants to settle down and live life, while Max wants to keep working. Greed plays a major role in coming between the two. Max has one last offer. A suicide mission. Noodles knows the risk they would be taking but Max doesn't care figuring if he dies, he'd die rich and go down fighting. There are excellent camera shots and angles. Especially between Max and Noodles. Brilliant eye contact that was so real and sincere. In Max and Noodle's final showdown I couldn't help but feel for them both. I am not much of a crier during movies, but I did in this. You get so attatched to the characters, and their on-screen chemisrty is amazing, you would think you were watching two brothers. Excellent portrayal of life in the underground world of organized crime. Sergio Leone did a supurb job on this epic chroincle."

","Before I saw 'OUATIA' I had read other people's thoughts of it. This was suppose to be Sergio Leone´s masterpiece. I wasn't much impressed when I had seen the first hour or two. I found the second part to be the best one. But I want to see the beginning of it again.<br/><br/>This is in many aspects a good and lavished film done with style and full accuracy, but for me it isn't as good as the Western movies by Leone that I have seen - Per un pugno di dollari (1964), Per qualche dollaro in più (1965), Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966), C'era una volta il West (1968), Giù la testa (1971) and Il Mio nome è Nessuno (1973).<br/><br/>If you compare ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with Leone´s earlier movies, it misses something important. The charisma, the charm and the warmth of his characters. You never get involved as much in this main characters as you can do with those in his older works. Here you don't care as much about them, because Leone never let you get the chance to come close to them. When it comes to Robert de Niro, I don't care how good actor he is suppose to be. Since his performance in ""Taxi Driver"", you never get the chance to get involved with the characters he plays. At least in the movies I have seen. Classic Leone characters for me will for ever be Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger) and John Mallory (James Coburn) in ""Giù la testa"", The Man with no name (Clint Eastwood), Cheyenne (Jason Robards), The Man (Charles Bronson), Frank (Henry Fonda) and Jill (Claudia Cardinale) in ""C'era una volta il west"", Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) in ""Il Mio nome è Nessuno"" and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee van Cleef) in ""Per qualche dollaro in più"". But I doubt that either Noodles or Max will join that gang. For me, Leone's main characters is seldom one dimensional or uncomplicated as the case is with this film. The difference is that this characters misses the spirit as other Leone characters use to have.<br/><br/>I say it once more: I don't like mobster movies. And somehow the modern mobster-movies seldom gets to be something more than just imitations of ""The Godfather"". And they are often overlong. If you haven't seen any Leone movies but have decide to change that, don't start with this one. And ""OUATIA"" is almost pretentious, almost. There are several connections between this and Leone´s earlier work, so if you are the type who look close, you can see that this is a Leone-film.<br/><br/>Rating: 7+ of 10."

If you can bring poetry to the screen, this film has done exactly that.  To call it a masterpiece is an understatement this film is pure artistry in motion.

Yes, this movie moves slowly. So do most of Leone's movies. So, for that matter, did the much-acclaimed Road to Perdition. The difference between this one and that is that Once Upon a Time is at least colorful. This is a dreamy gangster epic that should be appreciated on its own terms. Gangsters are a type, and virtually every movie about them trades on that type. So what? The story here is little different than the story that lies behind all gangster flicks: Bad guys doing bad things, usually as simply and brutally as possible. Some treatments are multi-generational. Some are cynical. Some are hard-boiled (see The Long Good Friday). This one is sentimental and accented perfectly by Morricone's syrupy score. Sit back and relax and enjoy it less as the most artful example of its genre and than a satisfying piece of entertainment. Not Leone's best (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West get the nod) but assuming you're not really in the mood for Hard Boiled or Run, Lola, Run, you should get pleasure from this movie."

","Of all of Sergio Leone's films this one has to be the best plot, you couldn't class the film as another gangster movie but a triumph for all involved would be more appropriate.  The structure of the film at times makes it hard to watch as it flashes back and forth from the 1920's to the 1960's, but the plot remains compelling throughout. The direction of the film is slow, deliberate and intense. Leone's cinematic flair is clearly in view and visually the film is quite amazing, but he also doesn't hold back in his depiction of violence, some of which would have to go down among the most shocking scenes ever filmed. DeNiro is as ever excellent and Woods plays his psychotic friend in his own familiar reliable way. This has to be one of the few movies of the 1980's that kept the classic hallmarks of maverick filmmaking; we have everything and more needed for a cinema masterpiece, in my opinion only equalled by Raging Bull or The Godfather trilogy. Once Upon A time In America is certainly a movie that every film student would need to study, in fact most modern day `directors' would need to study an artist like Leone, and try to determine were they went wrong."

Because there are some things that just don't come together.<br/><br/>It starts of slow, with Robert De Niro revisiting his childhood home in New York.  I suppose he hasn't seen it in a while, and everything has changed. But instantly you are taken with the score.  I believe the score of the film to be one of the best in history.  I was really taken with it.  The scenes when Robert De Niro and his pals are kids is perfect.  I would give those scenes alone a 10.  When we first see him spying on (the very young) Jennifer Connelly while she is dancing (and that beautiful score plays), the second time I saw this movie it made my eyes tear up.  Just out of pure brilliance and knowledge of what was going to happen in the future with the young kids. <br/><br/>But when the cast gets older the movie starts to fall apart.  It still has that heartbreaking score that pulls at your strings, but sometimes things happened so fast you got lost.  And the only way you can tell if it's a flashback or not is by the color of Robert De Niro's hair.  But sometimes he wears a hat and you get incredibly confused.  I did however enjoy how New York was seen throughout the years in the movie.<br/><br/>The kid who plays young Robert De Niro has a mole so fake, it's obvious. Besides that he does good.  As does the real De Niro.  Jennifer Connelly could have used an acting lesson and out of the whole cast who would have known she would be the next to win an Oscar?  Besides Jo Pesci, who was in it for about one minute and he didn't even stand up.  But he got billing far before Connelly who had a bigger part and was in it for a bit longer.  And kudos to the casting agent on whoever cast the older version of Connelly, it took me a while to realize it wasn't the real Connelly. <br/><br/>
No kudos to the makeup artist.  The kid with the fake mole and the fact that older Jennifer Connelly didn't have one wrinkle on her face when she was about 60 is just insane.<br/><br/>This was not quite a masterpiece... but so very close.

Leone turned it down.  The real challenge was his own homage to gangster films twelve years later.<br/><br/>Circa 1968: Leone had considered adapting the novel ""The Hoods"" into what eventually became this 1984 film about (largely) lower eastside Jewish gangsters (My suspicion is that the 'Dominic' character was supposed to be Italian or, maybe, Irish).<br/><br/>It is up to the viewer to determine whether Leone was influenced more from the cine-success of Coppola/Puzo's ""The Godfather"" or, coincidentally, Leone had this gem in mind all along.  At times, while watching 'America, I was reminded of ""The Godfather,"" but Leone's take is more about the absence of marriage and family; two powerful forces which typify the more successful 1972 Mafia film, and its two sequels.<br/><br/>Which came first, the chicken or the egg?"

","I've only seen the 'long' version of this movie, and I barely get it. I can't imagine what sort of mess the 'short' version is. This movie is almost impossible to talk about. It has a bizarre atmosphere and doesn't make its points in anything resembling 'normal' movie logic. This is of course to its credit, as its effect is mind-boggling but also strangely moving.<br/><br/>This tale of Jewish gangsters growing up together in the Lower East Side is structured and paced in such a way that the viewer is almost constantly caught off guard. Even in the familiarity of the gangster motif, the nostalgic renderings of the early days of the gang, the film is light years from a movie like ""The Godfather"" which is very straightforward and decidedly concillitory. This film seems to be be illustrating a world that is without philosophy. <br/><br/>That, or its philosophy is rooted in a perversion of the American Dream. These guys have it all, they built themselves up through their own ingenuity to become successful, but their methods are ostensibly opposed to the accepted American Way. After nearly 4 hours, I still don't really know what to make of any of the characters, but that in itself seems to be the film's center of fascination, for me anyway."

","I've seen 'A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS', 'FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE' and'THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY' at least 3 times each. The more I watched them the more I admired the Leone/Morricone duet. I stumbled upon 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA' a few days ago and decided to buy it..or buy THEM actually, for the movie is divided into two parts of two hours each. At first, I couldn't find Leone's touch in the film: I mean there are no extreme long shots intercut with extreme close-ups, there are no sharp Lee Van Cleef features, there is no Clint Eastwood squint...and no Morricone's creative sound effects. I felt disappointed...then  I thought:""hey, that film is somewhat like Citizen Kane, where events aren't told in choronological order. Plus Leone and Morricone have done it together again, so I'll give that long film a shot"". And the movie indeed turned out to be great: DeNiro's acting is superb, the makeup is perfect, the cast is 'homogeneous', the plot elements are as complex as in any spaghetti western, the violence is intense..and the music..well Morricone's score in this film is as haunting as any of the scores he had worked on...a sad, melancholic song, and  every time it is played the characters' emotions are externalized..a tune that emphasizes the role of memories in a person's life...I would say that film is very realistic, especially when it comes to sex...and ambition. Personal ambition comes before friendship and love, yet these very bonds of friendship and love last a lifetime. I can't think of what else to add, except that you should give that film a chance..watch it until its end, and please..do not fast forward if a scene appears too long to you. You'd be missing out on a lot of emotion and creativity."
"de_niro_2001","Null","0","2","4 August 2000"," The Most Violent Film I Have Liked
","I'm a great fan of Sergio Leone and thought this an absolutely marvellous film. It is very violent and normally I don't like violent films. In fact, each time it has been shown on Channel 4 it has been preceded by the disclaimer that it contains from the outset strong language and scenes of violence which may cause offence. But it stays with you. Ennio Morricone has produced a very haunting score. The photography is marvellous and you can also see elements of Leone's westerns in it. He also used a few actors who were also in his westerns. The gangster who lifts the hats off the guys sleeping in the opium den early on in the film is played by Mario Brega who was in all three of the Dollars films and is best remembered as Sergeant Wallace in The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Not all of the film was made in New York. Leone used a location near Venice to represent Miami, the railway station was actually in Paris and the alleyway where James Russo and his gang punch up young Max and Noodles was in Rome (that scene is relatively nonviolent compared to some others in the film). Many of the New York street scenes were filmed in Montreal. On a lighter note some of the scenes in the Jewish parts of the Lower East Side in the early 1920s had me thinking ""The Godfather Part II meets Fiddler On The Roof"". Altogether a very good if rather violent film."

"Sonatine97","9","0","1","21 July 2000"," 224 minutes of pure pleasure, passion, drama, violence & humanity!
","What a great shame for the film industry to see one of the great directors of our time pass away so prematurely -Leone gave us so much pleasure with his films that only now can we really appreciate his true cinematic style & characterisation skills and realise that not many other directors alive can emulate his good work.<br/><br/>But at least he gave us yet another classic before he passed away. Once Upon a Time in America is yet another typical Leone operatic masterpiece. 224 minutes of Italian artistry that has to be marveled at, unlike some distributors who didn't have the patience to sit through 4 hours of art, but instead excised about 120 minutes out of it and then foisted it upon a rather confused audience - is it any wonder it didn't do well at the box office so brutely edited!<br/><br/>Critics & perhaps some audiences just don't seem to have the time, the patience, or dare I say it the depth of intelligence to really unravel the mind of a master like Leone. He didn't compromise his craft just for the sake of box office takings, awards & plaudits; he didn't comprise his own view of a complex story like this one just to make it easy on a contemporary audience whose attention span these days is less than 5 minutes before surfing other channels.<br/><br/>""America"" isn't a film to be seen & understood in one sitting; there is simply too much going on; the flashback are set out to confuse first time round, characters appear old, then young, then old again without any real explanation but thats the way Leone unravels a story of friendship & betrayal over a painful 35 year period.<br/><br/>This flashback sequence had its origins from his earlier film, Once Upon a Time in the West (my personal favourite), and now he exploited it to a much greater extent in this film, which only adds to the drama and the weightiness of his story.<br/><br/>It takes good actors to make Leone's imaginative mind become physical, so it was superb casting getting De Niro & Woods to play the main pivotal parts. De Niro, as well all know, shines in intelligent movies like this; his character is given so much to do & carries so much responsibility, guilt and hurt that De Niro seems to positively enjoy playing the part.<br/><br/>And there's the very under rated James Woods. One of my favourite actors (see Salvador to understand why). If you want an actor to play a character with great intensity then I don't think there's anyone (including De Niro) except Woods who could carry it off successfully.<br/><br/>Coupled with some fine supporting acting from Pechi & Weld, along with the usual excellent cinematography & Morricone's usual stunning score, we have a truly crafted & intelligent movie that has to be seen again and again...just like a jigsaw puzzle, each viewing adding to the complete picture.<br/><br/>I personally don't rate it as high as ""West"" but it comes pretty close. Another interesting trademark to note from both films is the way he uses the camera above a bed looking down through netting at Cardineli (West) and also at De Niro (America). Both of them seemingly at peace. Nice touch!<br/><br/>****/******"

","The Characterisations are so moving,so genuine,that it is almost impossible to believe this is a ficticious story. The music score by Morricone deserves to be among his best... I would venture to suggest it is his best. if the criterion for a great film is to move an audience to the deepest emotion... to really care for ""what happens next"" then this film is a masterpiece of the genre. To even write about it,to visualise it in one's memory is an invitation to ""goose bumps""!"

","Here we see a truly great film and one, which you may have read previously, did not receive its' full recognition upon release. The aspects which set this film apart from others is the way how the emphasis is laid more upon what you see than what the characters say-classic poses and stares from all the leading characters, beautifully choreographed sequences, and the way in which Hell's Kitchen is portrayed is simply unimproveable. I don't think I have ever left a movie feeling so sad. De Niro's performance -simply outstanding and his best yet. James Woods-severely underrated as an actor and pulls off a tour de force performance here. Also the most beautiful soundtrack ever written-recommend purchasing-Morricone is a saint."

","The first time that I saw this film was a few months ago on TNT. And it was a film that I will never forget. It was touching and very sad. It almost brung a tear to my eye. This was considered to be Sergio Leone's best film of all time. But sadly it was his final. It was a tale of five Jewish kids form New York during the Prohibition Era. And they promised in their hearts that they would die for each other. But as adults. they did. I don't know why this film didn't even earn a Oscar nomination. It could have for Sergio Leone's brilliant direction and Ennio Morricone's music. I must say, this is the most powerful film that I have ever witnessed in my life. After I watched this film, I would have never forgotten a film so mesmerizing. When this film came out, it was at 2 hours and 19 minutes. But when it was released on home video. It came out in a almost complete version of 3 hours and 47 minutes. Rumor has it that there is a European version that runs eight hours. I hope that I will see this film again and I hope that there is a director's cut of it. This is not like any other crime movie like The Godfather or Goodfellas. This is the ultimate mobster film. Probably the most violent scene was the scene where Noodles fails to rape Debra. If you haven't seen this film, then SEE IT! It is worth four hours of your time. It is a must-see movie. I gave it a five out of five because it was a powerful and superb movie."
"Eviljomr","Null","0","1","10 December 1999"," possibly my favorite gangster film
","I have a hard time deciding whether I like The Godfather I and II or this film better.  I do lean a little toward this one though.  I look at this film as a kind of cult alternative to the Godfathers.  It's directed by Sergio Leone, best known for his ""spaghetti westerns"" with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef.  From what I've read, Leone had this film in mind since the mid-60's, but the studio wanted another western, so the brilliant Once Upon a Time in the West was made, then the flawed but very interesting Mexican revolution epic A Fistful of Dynamite, and then Leone produced, co-wrote, and directed a few scenes (uncredited, Tonino Valerii was credited as director) of the lesser-known-than-it-should-be Western Comedy My Name Is Nobody.  I think the way Leone directs his first (and unfortunately last) gangster film is interesting to contrast with those of Francis Ford Copolla and Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>The film has the feeling of a guilt-ridden, drug-fueled nightmare; few films have been able to capture this feeling so effectively.  The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli which creates a very dreamlike rather than realistic look, and the excellent haunting score by the great Ennio Morricone (a grade school classmate of Leone and his regular composer from A Fistful of Dollars on, interestingly enough, the score was composed a whole seven years before filming began) contribute a lot to this feeling.  Morricone would later borrow from himself a little when composing the score for Brian DePalma's film The Untouchables.  The first time I saw this film, it stayed with me for days.  The structuring of the film is very unique too, jumping from the 1930s to the 60s back to the 20s, none feels like ""the present"", they all swirl together.<br/><br/>A very unique film, don't let the almost-four-hours running time scare you off, I've watched it several times, and it doesn't feel like almost four hours.  The film is structured so elegantly, I can't imagine cutting a minute.  (definately only watch the 226 minute version, the original theatrical release was re-edited and shortened signifigantly, which, needless to say, was quite damaging).  Of course, when I watch it on video, I do feel the need for the occasional intermission. I would be thrilled at the opportunity to see this film in a theater, but it would definately strain my bladder.  This definately isn't a film for those who think of movies as disposable fast food entertainment, and think 90 minutes is an ideal running time for all films.  90 minutes may be just the right amount of time for some films to tell their story (of course, some only require about 10 minutes), but not this one."

"allyjack","8","0","2","3 September 1999"," Often dazzling symphony of memory
","The movie is at its most dazzling when orchestrating space and time into a symphony of memory and emotion - it has such panache that you rather lose your rationality, so that even the playing of a distinctly corny version of 	Yesterday	 on the first appearance of the aged De Niro seems poignant. In its middle section, the movie settles into a more conventional telling of a gangster melodrama, with a central plot that considering the time involved in the telling may seem a little thin - just the conventional trajectory of young hoods thrown into the big time and then coming to a bad end; the ending allows broader allusions, but they're a little odd and obscure. The characterizations aren't the show here - it's the finesse with which Leone manages to make every scene seem noble and weighty - especially when he's sketching across the passage of years. The movie's strengths and weaknesses are encapsulated in its treatment of women - narrative tools, but thriving amid the ventilating grandeur of Leone's ambition; McGovern (ridiculously but resonantly unchanged after 30 years) is not just a continuing object of desire but also a symbol of his past weakness and folly."

The chemistry between these 2 greats is remarkable.  Ennio Morricone's score is as memorable as The Godfather's musical score, and it stays with you for a long time.  The film is ultra violent and at times very disturbing.  Even an unexpected rape scene is included.  Nevertheless, this movie is flawless.

","According to Jack Nicholson the late Stanley Kubrick ""gave new meaning to the word meticulous"".  If that is true then Leone must have redefined the concept of profundity.  It is very easy to eulogise about the narrative structure of this epic masterpiece but that would be at the expense of noting the simple things.  De Niro's subtle and expressive stares into the past particularly noticable during the 1968 sequences when he returns after his lengthy absence are aweinspiring.  Within that shot Leone illustrates - through De Niro's gaze - the effect of all that he has been through in the 35 years since his departure.  To have conveyed a feeling such as this once in a film is a great thing indeed but to produce this feeling twice is nothing short of phenomenal.  Noodles responds to Fat Moe's query about what he has been doing for the last 3 decades: ""Going to bed early"".  Here the gaps in Noodles story are filled with one simple exchange so whilst the grandeur and majesty of the story should not be overlooked there are equally great things which proliferate the film but are much less noticeable."
