"MR_Heraclius","10","52","58","5 February 2020"," Dumb and Dumber
","In my opinion the greatest comedy ever made! Daniels and Carrey work magic together in this film that more than 20 years later is finally considered a classic. When it first came out it was labeled as complete garbage and toilet humour. But to those people I say it is the best garbage and toilet humour you could ask for. What do you expect to see when the title of the film is ''Dumb and Dumber''. The quick back and forth between the two lead actors and not so subtle chirping often goes unnoticed because your'e laughing so hard from the previous scene.the jokes and dialogue are so good and Carey and Daniels deliver them with such authenticity. It's because of this reason that I am able to watch this movie countless times and still be entertained, as I listen to funny remarks that I missed on the previous 100 viewings. What's truly great about this film is that even people who say they hate it will always without fail crack a laugh or two when re-watching it. They just don't want to admit that they find this nonsense to be funny...but it is. More than 20 years later and I still have not seen a buddy comedy that comes close to matching it."
"cornhol675","10","322","400","1 February 2006"," Will most likely continue to be the funniest movie of all time.
","Dumb and Dumber is a stupid movie, but what some people don't understand is that is what it is supposed to be! It's about two completely pathetic, dumb, and hopeless guys who do nothing but make complete fools of themselves. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give the greatest comedic performances and form the best duo that has ever graced a screen. Every scene, every sentence they speak, and every body movement is pure genius. The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too ""intelligent"" for a ""dumb movie"" like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances. To those of you who do not like this movie please give it another try and watch Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the roles that they were meant to play."
"iggyivan","10","78","95","2 November 2006"," ""Dumb and Dumber"" is really ""Funny and Funnier""
","This movie goes from joke to joke constantly and never misses a beat. I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it, and the tenth time I saw it, and the hundredth time I saw it. This movie never gets old. There is not one single dull moment. The movie takes off and never lets up, not even enough to let you breathe. There is something absolutely mesmerizing and hilarious about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' performances as the lovable idiots Lloyd Christmas( Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels).<br/><br/>The movie starts out in Providence, Rhode Island with two guys who are down on their luck. They've just lost their jobs, are late on the gas bill(again), and make the best of a bad situation by returning a briefcase they've recovered to its rightful owner, an attractive woman named Mary (Lauren Holly). And Lloyd(Carrey), has fallen madly in love with Mary after driving her to the airport. It just so happens that Mary lives all the way across the country, in Aspen, Colorado (or is it California?) Sure its crazy and stupid, but they've got nothing to lose, so they take off in their 84' sheepdog. And let's face it, if we were them, we'd go too.<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber was not pretentious, the actors never made you feel like they were in on the joke. No, they played it with a straight face the whole way through, and that's really the best way to do comedy. Even when they aren't speaking, their body language alone is enough to elicit huge laughs. The reactions and facial expressions are perfect.<br/><br/>The film wasn't warmly received by a lot of critics, but only because they couldn't lower their snouts long enough to realize that this was not another movie about dumb guys, but really a film about earnest guys. And they are pathetically funny just being themselves. They play stupid games in the car to pass the time, and sing aloud to keep from getting bored, and have crazy dreams of one day opening up a worm store.<br/><br/>The movie plays out with a high spirit and feel good attitude that can't be matched. And the soundtrack is perfect; it really sets the tone and never feels out of place.<br/><br/>Really, truly, without a doubt, the best comedy ever made. I will treasure this movie forever, and even when I watch it the 101st time, I know it'll make me laugh... and laugh... and laugh till it hurts.<br/><br/>The film is well paced and has a spontaneous nature that lacks in most comedies. Behind all the stupidness, there is a real glow of brilliance. The fact is, more than all the goofiness and crazy antics, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a film full of smarts, and that's what we end up admiring the most."

"MovieAddict2016","10","39","49","11 February 2006"," I laughed, I cried, and I think my IQ dropped. I love this movie!
","The Marx Brothers. Laurel and Hardy. Abbott and Costello. Jerry Lewis. Every generation has their dose of silliness. The 1990s had Jim Carrey. And along with him came the phenomenal hit ""Dumb and Dumber,"" a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness.<br/><br/>Our tale begins when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson (the gorgeous Lauren Holly, who Carrey eventually married and then divorced) to an airport. He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine, and after he has dropped her off, he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport. Rushing inside, he grabs the briefcase, only to find someone closing the gate to her plane. ""It's okay, I'm a limo driver!"" he yells to a ticket checker, rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it, falling onto the cement runway below.<br/><br/>After retreating to his apartment, he convinces his pal Harry (Jeff Daniels) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary. Harry, the smarter one (or is that dumb-less one?), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off. Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her. Now with hitment on their tail, Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc.<br/><br/>Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this. Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing. Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala, and stand at a bar in bright, tasteless suits. The way they stand, talk, and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies, two idiots without a clue.<br/><br/>The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers, Peter and Bobby. You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious ""There's Something About Mary."" But truth be told, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is even better than ""Mary."" Whereas ""Mary"" was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a true comedic gem, and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste, something ""Mary"" crosses over and never turns back to.<br/><br/>Is this movie ""dumb""? Yes, absolutely. Will it offend you? Perhaps if you're a snob. And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here.<br/><br/>I don't think it matters. This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully. In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as ""Me, Myself & Irene"") - the difference here is that ""Dumb and Dumber"" manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.<br/><br/>In the end, this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s ""stupid-comedy"" counterparts."
"Pookyiscute","10","70","94","28 December 2005"," Funniest Farrley's Brother movie you will ever see...
","It's hard to find a Farrley's Brother which isn't funny, and this is even harder to classify as, 'not funny'...because it is the funniest!<br/><br/>Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels team up as the not just odd, but strange, weird and mentally disabled couple. <br/><br/>After losing both of their jobs on the same day, Lloyd (Carrey), who retrieved a bag which a woman he drove to the airport leaves in the terminal, encourages his friend Harry to come with him to Aspen where the girl flew to. They think that the gas company is after them since they didn't pay their bill, but is actually the kidnappers of Mary (Holly)'s husband, who were supposed to pick up the money where she left it in the airport terminal.<br/><br/>From their start in Rhode Island, until they arrive in Aspen, the kidnappers follow Harry (Daniels)and Lloyd, along the road. The script is the most well-written comedy I think ever, because every thing that they do in the movie, leads to something new and funny that ends up happening to them later on.<br/><br/>Their are more than a few funny scenes, and the dialogue is always right-on.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Farrley Brothers' movies, or anyone who likes Jim Carrey. It's a hilarious comedy and the two stars were perfectly casted, especially Jim Carrey, of course.<br/><br/>And now, an excerpt from the film, <br/><br/>""Skies, huh?"" ""That's right."" ""They yers?"" ""Yup."" ""Both of them?"""
"lambiepie-2","8","98","135","17 May 2003"," A movie that lives up to its title
","When this first came out in 1994, wild horses couldn't drag me to the theater to see it. Why? Preconceived notions. Thank goodness for Cable TV, or I never would have seen this film. I like it, it makes me laugh.<br/><br/>This is not a masterpiece. This is not an academy award winning film, not a film of strategic plots, this is as sophomoric as it gets  -- and that's fine with me. Sometimes, ya gotta escape. This'll do it.<br/><br/>The title says it all. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are perfect for their roles, every time I watch this film uncut, I am laughing. I was always thinking, ""How dumb can you get?"" And in the next frame it gets dumber.<br/><br/>This is one of those films you just have fun with. Either you like this kind of humor or you don't. But the world is in such turmoil, this is a welcomed, stupid, silly, break that hits just the right spot. I find it ""stupid-funny"" beyond belief."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","135","195","3 September 2000"," By far Jim Carrey's funniest movie, Dumb & Dumber delivers the best laughs to come to the silver screen in years.
","From beginning to end, Dumb & Dumber is sheer hilarity. There is not a slow moment in the adventures of Harry and LLoyd, two great but incredibly unintelligent friends who decide to move to Aspen, Colorado to get out of their dead-end lives in Providence, Rhode Island. Jim Carrey delivers a side-splitting performance as Lloyd, the lovestruck limo driver who first suggested the trip to Aspen (""We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF!!""), mostly so that he can find Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the woman he fell in love with after he drove her to the airport in Providence.<br/><br/>Lloyd's and Harry's adventures on their trip are absolutely hilarious to watch, especially their run-ins with the criminals who are chasing them, trying to get the briefcase that Harry and Lloyd do not know is full of ransom cash. One of the best things about this film is that it never strays too far from reality. There is never anything presented that could not possibly happen in real life. Also, the original and strikingly funny comedy that was written for the film is great! I can't remember ever laughing this hard at a movie.<br/><br/>Dumb & Dumber takes a good story, adds some tear-inducing comedy, some endlessly hilarious dialogue (""I guess they're right, old people, though slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose. Don't you go dyin' on me!""), and needlessly good direction and molds one of the funniest films ever. Good for all ages, Dumb & Dumber is sheer unadulterated comedy and is destined to become a classic."
"El Celis","9","76","115","14 August 1998"," a barrel of laughs! (and more...)
","Destined to become a classic in its genre, DUMB & DUMBER reaches its objective of making people laugh off their seats, in a film that crowns Carrey as the modern Lewis & gives Daniels a great chance to show us his lighter side.     This is the kind of movie you want to see 100 times, with pranks & puns so silly you love to hate! high moments are Daniel`s bout with the toilet, the parakeet incident, and Jim Carrey`s love declaration to a schoolboy. If U R not silly and have no sense of humor, and basically are not alive , don`t watch this movie...otherwise, rent the video, order some pizza & beer and prepare for 1999: Dumb & Dumber (The early years)       Two fingers up"

","The Farrelly Brothers' 1994 road-comedy about buddies Carrey and Daniels (who make a surprisingly perfect duo of morons) travelling from Providence to Aspen and the troubles their dimwittedness brings them. Met with lukewarm reviews upon its release, but those who grew up with it will appreciate it for the classic that it is. No matter how many times you've seen it, there are still new jokes to uncover because you didn't realize it before (""She sent me a John Deere letter"") or that you missed because you were still laughing about something else. Believe it or not, Daniels is just as funny as (or maybe even funnier than) Carrey! Accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

","It's hard to believe this was out over a decade ago, but it was another in a long line (past few decades) of crude comedies....BUT one of the better ones regarding some laugh-out-loud funny scenes.<br/><br/>The ""classic"" of the funny scenes, at least to most men including me, is poor Jeff Daniels on the toilet. No need to go into details! As crazy as Jim Carrey got in some of his earlier movies (Ace Ventura, Liar, Liar, etc) he's actually lower-key than in some of the other stupid-guy roles he played, one reason because he's doesn't shout in here. I didn't find the female lead in here, Lauren Holley, to be appealing but that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>In modern-day slapstick, it means one basic thing: gross out your audience, so that's what is attempted here. When it works, it's very funny, such as that bathroom scene.. One thing for sure: the language makes this an R-rated film, not PG-13. Speaking of jokes, that PG-13 rating has become a joke.<br/><br/>Anyway, you should get a lot of laughs out this: at least I suspect males will more than females....and that's all it was meant for - laughs, and nothing else - so don't trash the film because it wasn't ""intelligent"" enough for you."
"Howlin Wolf","8","46","76","28 November 2001"," I liked it, others may not...
","... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?) or whether the characters would realistically say them.  No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.<br/><br/>   Like I said, don't go into this looking for a plot, because there isn't really anything other than the most basic premise to satisfy the distributors.  I personally found it refreshing that the movie asked no requirement of me other than that I be able to laugh.  This I did, loudly and frequently.<br/><br/>   A final note on who I consider to be the main star of the show.  It ain't Carrey.  Jim, of course, does what we expect him to do.  However, it is Daniels - in an achingly funny turn - who surprises, and in doing so effortlessly steals the movie from under the nose of the rubberfaced loon standing beside him.  It may have something to do with the fact that Harry is (marginally) the more subtle of the two characters."
"moviecritichank-7","10","14","20","4 August 2009"," The Funniest movie of All-Time!
","Dumb and Dumber is the funniest movie ever for the following reasons: two pals lose their jobs, but Lloyd (Jim Carrey) finds a briefcase that belongs to a wealthy woman (Lauren Holly) that lives in Aspen,Colorado and he and his best friend Harry (Jeff Daniels) must travel cross-country to return it to her. Along the way they encounter kidnappers, a state trooper, and many more hilarious moments from this comedy that you must see for yourself. I first saw this on TBS when they aired it last year and I laughed harder than ever. I loved it when Lloyd says ""Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world? ""aaaaaaaaaaaaaagh. One of the funniest quotes from the movie. If you don't like obnoxious and dumb humor, then this isn't the movie for you. But, if you love dumb humor, are a big fan of slapstick comedies, want to laugh your butt off, or if you just like Jim Carrey's movies, then this is for you. My rating for Dumb and Dumber:10/10!"

Like when Mary told Harry that she didn't want to bore him with her problems, and how he said ""Thanks"", instead of being a caring, considering person who pressed on for details. Or, when LLoyd told the old woman who was *going* to help him out: ""Senior citizens, although slow, and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose. I'll be right back.

","Certainly one of the funniest films of its time, ""Dumb and Dumber"" stars Jim Carrey as Lloyd and Jeff Daniels as Harry, two clueless fools who are friends. The story starts with both men losing their jobs, then becoming involved, unknowingly, in a high-stakes criminal matter.<br/><br/>Carrey fills the scenes with his usual rubber-faced antics and impressions. Daniels is up to the challenge, portraying the one who is likely the ""dumber"" of the two. Laughs are plentiful, usually involving physical humor, visual humor, or the stupidity of characters.<br/><br/>Lauren Holly plays Mary, the object of Lloyd's obsessions. (Holly and Carrey would later marry.)<br/><br/>Much of the action involves a road trip, the setting for many other comedies. It doesn't disappoint. When they share the ride with a hitman, the results are hilarious.<br/><br/>How dumb are these two? If you compare them to Steve Martin's ""The Jerk"", they are more juvenile. If you compare them to The Three Stooges, they are in the same ballpark, but they rely less on pratfalls and are less manic. <br/><br/>If you are looking for laughs, this film definitely delivers."

"schroederagustavo","9","5","7","28 January 2019"," An Unrelenting Stupidity
","Dumb and Dumber is a classic. There's no denying that and I will argue with anyone that says otherwise. It's just one of those movies that regardless of what the ""top critics"" said back then (although it did have some good critical reception. Mixed reviews, I believe), it's still a dumb comedy with unbelievably talented actors and stand-out performances. The jokes are dumb, the premise is so stupid, but you rarely see this level of ""Let's just go for it, man."" Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, legendary comedic performances here. All in all, Dumb and Dumber is one of those classic movies that will never lose steam.<br/><br/>Most of the jokes in the movie are hit or miss, for sure. The thing is that there's a joke pretty much every minute. And while they are stupid, I really can't think of a joke that doesn't have a build-up and a proper pay-off (Yes, even the fart jokes). There's just so many classic lines in here, super memorable lines in this movie: ""I don't know Lloyd the French are a___holes."" ""Pretty Bird"" ""Do you realize what you've done?"" Like I said, the performances here are outragously stupid and commited. This is Jim Carrey at his best, no doubt about that. There's a lot of body language and facial expressions going on here, all the time that add so much to the comedic spice of the film.<br/><br/>The scene after Lloyd get"
"Gameboy2007","8","8","13","16 January 2008"," Easily a cult classic. A movie that does an excellent job at what it's suppose to do, bring a lot of laughter.
","This movie by no means is known as one of the greatest movies ever. After all, it's not suppose to be taken seriously to begin with. It's called ""Dumb and Dumber"" for a reason. However, to this day, this movie is still one of the most beloved comedies in decades. It still has a cult following. This movie is so damn funny, that I can't even explain it. The movie does a superb job at what it's suppose to do. It's not perfect, which is why I didn't give it a perfect score. It has a flew flaws that some movie critics would pick at. However, it's nothing compared to all the good.<br/><br/>The storyline to the movie is both ridiculous and hilarious. It takes you on a tour of the lives of Harry and Lloyd; two guys in Rhode Island who are going nowhere in life. Once Lloyd finds the love of his life, he obsesses over her and even gets involved further in her life then he should have. She leaves an empty suit case at the airport and the content in it is very valuable. Lloyd grabs it and thinks she forgot it and wants to give it back to her but it's too late, she flew all the way to Aspen. So, Lloyd wants to go on a road trip with his buddy Harry and drive all the way to Aspen to return it to her. Little do they know that kidnappers and the FBI are after them. On their way they encounter several crazy and memorable characters. Seabass the tough redneck, Mental a somewhat stupid hit man and many more.<br/><br/>The acting is very hilarious and well done. Jim Carrey does a great job at Lloyd who is so damn stupid and hilarious, it's hard not to like him. This character is one of Carrey's best. Jeff Daniels does and equally good job as Harry who is less dumb then Lloyd but still gets into plenty of trouble. The story overall is a road ride in the eyes of two likable idiots who are oblivious to everything and yet, they still manage to get out of trouble without even trying. The dialog in the movie is very funny and memorable. Several scenes are equally as memorable. Lloyd's fantasy dream for instance with his so called love Mary, Harry's explosive diarrhea, The cop drinking the pee out of the beer bottles, the Seabass scenes, the blind kid ""pretty bird"" scene, ""the Don't worry, I'm a Limo driver"" scene and several more. There were very few moments in this movie where I wasn't laughing.<br/><br/>Overall this movie may not be perfect because the humor will not appeal to everyone. Some people may be too serious for this movie and if so, you're lose, go watch ""Titanic."" All I know is it's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and to this day, I still watch it. I never get tried of it. It will be very hard for people with a sense of humor not to find this movie funny."
"stalcup","9","7","11","12 June 2007"," Hilarious
","The thing that separates this ""stupid movie"" from other, inferior ""stupid movies"" like Zoolander and Anchorman is that the movie never takes the stupidity seriously. This is realism of a sort: In general, incompetent fools do not excel in life, and they don't excel in here. The guy does not end up with the girl, the protagonists don't end up successful or particularly happy except in their friendship.<br/><br/>This gives the comedy so much more impact. If everyone and the world are believable, ridiculous antics really stick out. My favorite scene in this movie, for example, is Harry and Lloyd's interaction with a very serious, tough thug. The thug's realistically confused and shocked response to their pure idiocy makes the idiocy itself far more potent and gut-wrenchingly hilarious.<br/><br/>The plot, while not particularly deep, acts as a sort of clever satire on most comedy-adventures. As I said, the heroes actually end up any better off than they started, but their blissful ignorance makes it hard for you to feel sad for them.<br/><br/>There are two distinct reasons that this comedy stands the test of multiple views, though. One is the physical, comedic performances of Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey as Harry and Lloyd. So brilliantly over-the-top and obnoxious, you'll be laughing almost non-stop if you just pay attention to the way the two stars act. The other is how creatively stupid Harry and Lloyd are. It's clear someone of great intelligence wrote this ""stupid"" script; the jokes are clever and come at a nonstop pace.<br/><br/>There are the requisite bodily function jokes, but they don't really drag the movie down very much, as they are sparse and generally funny. Overall, I recommend this movie for all fans of comedy. And I question the wisdom and sanity of anyone who doesn't consider themselves a fan of comedy.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I was forced to watch this movie on an overseas flight, when I would have much rather have been sleeping. Instead, the other passengers laughing at ""jokes"" on the screen kept me up, so I resigned myself to watching it.<br/><br/>I won't sugar coat this: I hated this movie. You know when people are telling jokes, but some jerk keeps blurting out the punchlines halfway through each joke? It really ruins the point of the joke. That's exactly how I felt watching this movie. Every punchline to EVERY joke is telegraphed so far in advance as to suck the humor out of every one of them. <br/><br/>The stars are two very talented comedians, but the lack of spontaneity and creativity of the comedy totally wastes them her.<br/><br/>So, if you want feel smarter than not only the title characters, but the writers and director of this film, watch this movie. If you want a genuine laugh, watch something else."

"zkonedog","10","5","8","12 March 2017"," When Jim Carrey Was The King Of Comedy
","To be honest, I don't exactly know how to review a film like ""Dumb and Dumber"", but suffice it to say that the entire film rests on the shoulders of one man: Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Though so many crazy things happen over the course of this movie, the basic plot has two friends, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Carrey), driving across the country to return a ""lost"" briefcase to a woman they met at an airport. While on first viewing you will appreciate the wild and wacky antics that Harry and Lloyd get themselves into (and everyone has their favorites, such as the bathroom scene, Seabass, or Big Gulps), upon multiple viewings you will realize that the true genius of the film is in the subtleties of Jim Carrey's magnificent acting.<br/><br/>Though Daniels provides a great ""straight man"" that the film sorely needed, Carrey really steals the show with his physical comedy and facial expressions. In nearly EVERY SCENE, one could laugh themselves silly just watching the facial expressions (the whiz in the bottle scene) and body motions (""I'll hang by the bar...and put out the vibe!"") of Carrey. Basically, Carrey took the intense, prat-falling stage show he was know for around the comedy circuits, toned it down a bit, and created the most hilarious character ever depicted on film.<br/><br/>Of course, what really makes ""Dumb and Dumber"" stand the test of time is the ""watchability"" factor. There are few movies that will make me drop pretty much anything I am doing and watch them, but this film is EXACTLY that. It could be on every night of the week (and darn near sometimes is on TBS!) and I would still laugh just as hard at the same old jokes and scenarios!<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that after viewing this hilarious film, you ""will like it ahh-lott"". If not, you're pretty much just ""one pathetic loser...no offense""."

","I like really smart, or brilliantly stoopid. I think brilliantly stupid is harder to pull of and they did it! The potty humor, snow ball fight, mini bike, etc, etc, etc were just awesome! I almost needed to wear a diaper I laughed so hard while watching this.<br/><br/>Although I don't like all Jim Carry movies, I think he is enormously talented, and Jeff Daniels was the perfect match for him in this inept comedy! I watched Dumb and Dummerer for about 5 minutes and couldn't continue. It was too painful, and I felt really bad for the actors who tried to fill the shoes of Jim and Jeff in the first installment. There are no two that could have pulled it off. Just as Jacky Mason or anyone could ever replace Rodney in Caddyshack."
"ajdagreat","Null","8","15","23 August 2001"," painfully funny
","When you're laughing so hard that you start to cry at this movie, when you're thinking about how bad you feel for laughing at this dumb stuff, when you admit to your friends that you liked this movie - hey, don't feel bad! This is funny stuff!! I really liked this movie. Sure, it's no classic (nor is it likely to become one), but if you want a good comedy with some good dialogue and sight gags that make your sides split, this is a good movie to rent.<br/><br/>The ONE thing that I think this movie might have needed (and this is not a criticism, just something that could've made it even better) is a straight man to go along with Carrey and Daniels on their trip. Think about it - the scenes with Carrey and Daniels playing pranks on the kidnapper with gas are the funniest scenes of the movie, so if there was a third straight man the whole time, it would be even funnier! The result is that at times, one of the stars seems much dumber than the other, and at other times, vice versa. For example, Daniels is the smart one when Carrey can't read the newspaper, but Carrey is the smart one when he advises Daniels (who has just spilled salt) to throw salt over his shoulder for good luck, but Daniels throws the entire saltshaker. Just a suggestion, this was a very funny movie without the straight man anyway.<br/><br/>I've never had so much fun laughing at a couple of brain-dead, perverse idiots. Definitely worth a purchase."

","Dumb and Dumber would not be one of those movies destined to fit in the classics. Surely AFI would not want to put this one in the high-caliber humor hits in the history of movies. Still, Dumb and Dumber is one of the funnest comedies of the last 20 years. We meet Lloyd (Jim Carey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). Both are inept, moronic imbeciles who plan to own a pet store called ""I Got Worms."" Good luck not only on raising the money, but even more on getting the loan. In any case, both have their odd jobs to get them through. Lloyd's life changes when he drives a woman, Mary (Lauren Holly), to the airport in his limousine, and she forgets her luggage. He decides to take it to her in Aspen, Colorado with the help of Harry. However, the luggage is actually ransom money for her husband. Harry and Lloyd have no idea, but they could really use the money since they have so little. They eventually discover it trying to find Mary, and on their tail are the kidnappers. It reminded me of a Three Stooges, Marx Brothers, or Abbot and Costello movie. However, with these guys, there is no straight man, nor any intelligence. This paves the way for idiotic miscarriages of common sense. Simply put, the audience will laugh because we can be assured that our intelligence is superior. This one also started the gross-out comedy. Looking back, the gross-outs in this one were not over-the-top. They were simple and much more plausible situations. Again, we can laugh because it is not us. There are no breakout performances, nor deft screen writing. Another strength for the movie is that it could work for kids as well as adults. Both ages can have fun with this movie--which is what I often watch on a snow day. Finally, let it be known that truth in stranger than fiction. I knew a guy in graduate school named Mike. In college I knew a guy named Jim. Put them together, you have Dumb and Dumber. However, I think they would have been smart enough to get on the bus at the end."
"ekayepiao","9","4","6","23 March 2019"," It's not your typical comedy
","This movie is a full-package. It's a mix of comedy, action, and drama (I guess haha). From the concept, the actors, and everything!! Jim Carrey is such a legend and portrayed Lloyd so well. Jeff Daniels portrayed Harry so good as well, they're both such great comedians. I didn't expect that twist where even though they're super dumb but things still went well! Can you believe you will drive a long way just to return a briefcase of your passenger?! That's just unbelievable. The movie was so well-written, the jokes were gold, the acting was superb! It also shows real and true friendship. Imagine doing all of that dumb stuff for your bestfriend. Also, even though Lloyd and Harry went through a lot, went to lots of trouble, had fights, they still kept their friendship strong. The way the movie was shown was just so surreal, from the conceptualizing, writing, acting, and cinematography. I know, its been more than two decades since this movie was released but its still really funny and great! To end this review, I know this is crazy but I learned a pretty good lesson from this movie. Even though your dumb, I guess you still have worth and you can still do stuff!"
"Horror-yo","10","4","6","12 October 2018"," A True ""Pure Comedy""
","In an industry that puts out films that follow a strict guideline, that is the industry of Hollywood generally and comedies being no exception, there's a place that very few mainstream comedies can go to that feels right at home, one that doesn't take itself seriously at all, that genuinely lets loose entirely, and which spontaneous momentum isn't being contrived by rigid structure and academic rule. It's very, very dumb...but not so dumb it's just only dumb. It's dumb in a way that's efficient, and there's a very thin line between being just plain mindless random processed stupidity with no actual spirit behind the humor... and controlled chaos. This one is certainly the latter. It isn't trying hard, it isn't awkward. It's smooth and genuine, it's real, and has resonated as a cult classic because of that true genuine nature.<br/><br/>From that very first scene with Jim Carrey at the back of the limo, to the very last bit of footage, it's pure nonstop action and gags and utter silliness with a purpose and liveliness. It never wanders into facile randomness, or never settles for riding its own self-complacency, every scene is fresh and original. Brand new. There's no time to get bored with the humor on display, it keeps coming back with a new angle, a new powerfully idiotic bang.<br/><br/>It manages to actually tell a story, compelling on its own in fact, while being a gag reel all the way through, which is no easy feat technically.<br/><br/>The directing, sound, and editing are superb in creating just the right conditions for the film to be resoundingly moronic and most efficient. It doesn't try hard; instead it knows exactly what it's doing.<br/><br/>Finally: as in the title I call this a ""pure comedy"", because the entire focus of the whole picture is to make people laugh, entertain wildly through the craft of comedy, while most mainstream comedies are merely ""comedies"" in form but use that format in order to be a pleasant watch but really have a romantic or drama or moralistic motive and outcome in the end. Dumb and Dumber is comedy through and through, again, from that very first scene in the limo to that very last bit of film, the sole purpose is to make people laugh hard. There's no ""hidden agenda"" so to speak, it's comedy for the sake of comedy, and arguably, that's all comedy should ever be. A true, 'Pure Comedy', supremely inspired, carefully written, with an excellent spirit and momentum to it, and perfectly conducted from beginning to end."

But it still works and the dumb elements didn't really get to the point where it's more annoying than it actually being funny. Jim Carrey gags are getting old now, but I could tell why it was such a hit back in the 90's. This has got to be one of the best duo to be in a comedy flick. If you like immature and yet at least somewhat amusing comedy, this one is most definitely worth a watch. While watching this for the 3rd time after a long period of not seeing it. I got a few chuckles out of it, but didn't find it all that funny. But I give credit for the comedic value when it first came out. I mean that laxative joke has been used over and over again after this movie. I am not sure if they are the pioneers of that joke, but they sure made it a hit in comedy flick to come afterwards.

","Did you ever get the feeling that sometimes an actor is so full of himself that he forgets the movie and kind of goes off on his own tangent, never to return?<br/><br/>That's what I got from ""Dumb and Dumber"", which basically features Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, two men who are good actors and have been in some of may favorite movies, acting like complete idiots and somehow never getting institutionalized for their actions.<br/><br/>I know, I know....  There are people who love this movie and think that Carrey can do no wrong and since bodily function humor is the soup du jour (so to speak), ""Dumb"" is their cup of tea (so to speak again).<br/><br/>But in spite of some very inspired moments (an escalating fight in the snow between Daniels and Holly, the fantasy restaurant fight, the unfortunate demise of the hitman, the parakeet), there are more moments of just downright stupidity than anything else.  <br/><br/>And the scenes with the cop (you know the one) and the out-of-order toilet just are put there, I think, to make ones jaw drop at how far movies will go nowadays.  There's no real humor in what's going on and, in spite of their big following as ""the biggest laugh scenes of all time"", they kind of fall flat.  They happen then they're gone.<br/><br/>As far as Carrey and Daniels, they basically just play two guys who act stupid and fail to use common sense.  No character traits, just stupidity. But as they say, give the people what they want....<br/><br/>As we speak, there is a sequel in the works by the guys that created ""South Park"".  Well, I guess they won't have to worry about losing the original's sophistication.<br/><br/>Two stars.  I almost forgot Carrey's and Holly's kiss.  Now THAT'S funny."

","Yes, I like this one a lot more than Something About Mary, which was pretty good, but this one was so much more funny to me.  Mary had great moments, but there were also quite a few slow stretches...these are, however, common in all the Farrelly brother movies.  Not this one though.  This is there only comedy where there virtually are no slow stretches...it is one gag after another, never slowing up for a moment at all.  Carrey and Daniels are great with each other, they have good chemistry...it is to bad the sequel will feature neither of them, which means the sequel will probably suck. The movie is simple enough to follow, as two men of lower intelligence embark on a quest to return a briefcase to a woman.  This woman, though, left the briefcase on purpose as it contained a ransom.  So the two dummies now have killers on their trail and run into a lot of other misadventures on their quest to return the case.  All in all, a very funny flick that is funny all the way through."

Perhaps we need a new category to denote films unsuitable for anyone over 21 with an IQ over 100.

"guyfromjerzee","5","12","29","17 January 2007"," Overrated
","I never thought this was one of the funniest comedies ever, but I found the movie a lot funnier when I was a kid. The Farrelly Brothers are talented writer/directors who have made several funny flicks like ""Kingpin,"" ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Stuck on You."" Though ""Dumb and Dumber"" is probably second to ""Mary"" as far as popularity goes, I think it's one of their lesser flicks. The Farrellys are partially to blame, but I place most of the blame on Jim Carrey. Whoever decided this moron should be paid $25 million a movie should be shot in the head. Jeff Daniels, though less experienced in comedy, gives a much performance in my opinion. Unlike Carrey, he doesn't use the over-the-top, anything-for-a-laugh approach. Instead, he's more concerned with being true to the character. Why does Carrey have to do some goofy eye movement or vocal intonation with every line of dialogue he utters? I always say that the rule of comedy is to act normal in ridiculous situations. In Carrey's case, he prefers to act ridiculous in ridiculous situations. How anyone over the age of 10 can laugh uproariously at a fool like him is beyond me. The film contains its share of funny gags (like the famous toilet scene), but most of them are disgusting or stupid or a mixture of both. One of the most annoying scenes is one where Carrey and Daniels both eat these hot chili peppers. Their mouths start burning, so they squirt ketchup and mustard all over the place, trying to get some into their mouths. And of course, there are other gag-inducing moments, like a man hocking a loogie into someone's burger. I suggest that if you're over the age of 10 and not a sucker for Carrey's incessant mugging, you stay away from this flick. It's simply another overrated comedy."
"duda1187","2","12","29","10 July 2006"," Jim has had much better movies, such as Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls
","This movie to me, is very bad. I commented on Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls which is a lot better than this movie. I only compare these two movies because it is a heated argument in my school between a few of my friends. All the comedy in Dumb and Dumber is said as if it is stand-up material. So it's very simple to like a movie like this because they are basically telling you what is funny. I think you should have to think more to find the comedy in a movie. If they just tell you what is funny then to me it doesn't seem to be as funny. A line such as ""why are you going to the airport?...flying somewhere?"" is an example of what i mean by telling you the funny parts. With much of the movie like this i consider it obvious comedy, meaning they put 500 of these together and call it a movie. It could also be classified as stupid comedy because both Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels play retard roles basically, anyone can laugh at a retard, and they drive some sort of a dog. And then people say that Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls Jim also plays a retard. But i highly disagree with this, there are no parts in Ace Venture: Where Nature calls where he gets his tongue stuck on a pole or anything as dumb as Dumb and Dumber. He may make hilarious faces such as when the hot girl starts walking towards him at the campfire in the tribe dance. But my main point is Dumb and Dumber is dumb after 5 minutes, and gets dumber throughout the entire movie."

","Despite its title, 'Dumb And Dumber (1994)' is a surprisingly smart comedy that does admittedly have its fair share of 'stupid' and toilet-based humour but is by no means a 'no-brains' experience. It certainly took a lot of thought and a lot of craft, not least of all to convincingly create core characters as lovably and utterly 'dumb' yet unwittingly lucky without them being as consistently grating as the 'most annoying sound in the world'. Its the height of the Farrelly brothers' career, before they descended into crassness for the sake of crudity, and proves that they were able to produce some pretty highbrow lowbrow entertainment, perhaps despite their reputation. It also represents somewhat of a high point in both Carrey and Daniels' careers, proving that neither were unwilling to take a risk that could've resulted in them looking literally and figuratively foolish, though it is by no means either of their best work.

I'd recommend ""Liar, Liar"". It's a whole hell of a lot better in every way shape and form than this movie."

Watch this one only for the chuckles. If you watch it for any other reason, you're watching the wrong movie.<br/><br/>One of Carrey's better performances. His earlier works are far better, comedically, than are his later works.

","I realize I'm in the minority by not being a gushing fan of potty humor and a lot of scatological and very graphic sound effects, but DUMB AND DUMBER is definitely a movie that clicked with its targeted audience. And I can't ignore the fact that JIM CARREY and JEFF DANIELS have the ability to mug with the best of them, both showing lots of dexterity with comic material that they play to the hilt.<br/><br/>But the film is a series of sight and sound gags more than a tightly constructed plot and it's just a matter of time before the Beavis and Butt-head type of guys driving cross country to return a valuable suitcase to its pretty owner (LAUREN HOLLY) would drive any normal person insane with their stupidity.<br/><br/>The joke with the state trooper is probably the low point of all the tasteless humor, but here too, I'm sure I'm in the minority. Seems to be the highlight for others inclined to view potty humor as nothing more than harmless fun.<br/><br/>If this sort of low comedy appeals to you, it's a funfest of crude jokes and imbecilic humor. It's either a comic masterpiece or a dud of titanic proportions, depending on your point of view.<br/><br/>Carrey won a ""Razzie"" award as worst new star--although I don't agree with that designation at all. He's obviously a hyperactive, manic personality who can give Robin Williams a run for his money--and Daniels, too, is a talented chap.

How anyone can give this movie a rating of anything other than a 10/10, is beyond me. I've never met a person in my life who didn't like... no, who didn't Absolutely LOVE this film.<br/><br/>If there was ever a missing link in your life, this IS it. With as many lines as you can recite (often the full dialogue from beginning to end) It's easily one of the most memorable, and fan-favourite films, that movie go-ers of all kinds can and will appreciate, for years to come.<br/><br/>We see a Jim Carey at the height of his career before complete and utter disrespect, sent him down a spiral of events that led him to take more serious roles; for people to take him seriously as an actor. Yet the bitter irony that this film doesen't get the recognition it deserves, it enough to say that Jim Carrey is easily one of the most blacklisted, underrated actors in ""hollywood"". His performance in this film was more than worthy of an Oscar nomination. That is, if anyone actually takes the ""Oscars"" seriously.<br/><br/>It's because of this, that this movie will never be put upon the pedestal it so sorely deserves to be atop. Right up there with the all-time greats such as: The Godfather, Schindler's List, The Lord of The Rings Trilogy, for example.<br/><br/>This is the type of film that, even if you HATE comedies, you would still Love this film. It IS just that damn good. This film is pure gold from beginning to end. From the perfectly fitted and timed soundtrack, which will have you laughing all on its own. To the amazing character portrayal's, by everyone (including Cam Neely).<br/><br/>A true 10 out of 10! And even then, that doesen't do this film justice. For a lifetime of laughter and jokes ahead. And daily references which will never cease, bringing you years of laughter long after the movie is over. If you haven't seen it yet, you 've probably heard by now, all that you're missing.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, if you haven't seen it. watch it.

"ElMaruecan82","7","2","3","8 April 2020"," I laughed a lot ... I face-palmed a lot more...
","At least the title is honest. ""Dumb and Dumber"" says what it says about the film, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) are grown-ups with the brains of sixth graders and are so incomparably stupid that there's no need to scratch your head to determine who's supposed to be dumber. Still, I'm partial to Harry being the lesser one because unlike Carrey, Daniels adds a subtle level of likability while Carrey is channelling the obnoxiousness of his Ace Ventura and the troll-attitude of the Mask. However, that Harry seems the most sensitive doesn't say much, he didn't invent hot water either.<br/><br/>What the title also indicates is that there's no need to look for a plot, just plug yourself in the mind of an immature teenager and let the magic of stupid laughs operate. It takes time until we're embarked in that cross-country road trip to Aspen, and their stupidity gets more tolerable. So we get the usual halts in shabby motels, gas stations, altercations with blasÃ© waitresses and hunky truck drivers, a stolen briefcase that reveals its secret at the right moment, later, we have a trip in one of Aspen's finest hotel, a dead owl, and one of the delights of the film is the way the bad guys (especially Mike Starr as Mental) believe they must be pros because no one can be that dumb.<br/><br/>What the Farrelly brothers do is take very familiar material and use it as a clothesline to hang on it the dumbest stuff they could find. It's not much a plot than a pot where every improvisation is thrown into, an excuse for the lamest possible gag, reminding you of that kid who went as far as asking the prettiest girl in class to pull his finger and make his buddies laugh (even if it meant losing any possible chance with girls). It takes some guts to be that dumb and an extra level to base an entire movie premise on two irremediably stupid characters but that was a risk the brothers (in their film debut) were willing to take.<br/><br/>Maybe it was a safe calculation after all, if you've got the best comedian of his generation who already proved to be bankable, how about letting him going in total control and see where it goes and if 60% of the gags must work, then throw as many gags as you can. They say quality matters more than quantity but not when you have that quantity : Harry and his mountain sheperd clad dog, Lloyd playing a lousy casanova as a limo driver, urinations on beer bottles, pranks involving mustard on burgers, fart jokes, toilet jokes, Bruce Lee imitations and so forth.<br/><br/>There are so also many moments of gratuitous and unbearable noises that I felt like Mental being trapped between Harry and Lloyd, and started wondering who was the bad guy. These moments, as funny as they were, made me genuinely appreciate the quieter parts where they seemed to pull themselves together and stop acting like prankish children. But these moments never lasted long and I think it's fair to say that there's not one minute going in the film without at least three gags and three stupid things done, and at the very least, you get a grimace from Carrey's rubber-made face.<br/><br/>But then again, Harry and Lloyd reach such heights of manic stupidity that I started to appreciate Jeff Daniels a little more not because I prefer him, but because Carrey is such an induspated talent who had nothing to prove after his ""Mask"" and ""Ace Ventura"" that it's a remarkable achievement to steal his thunder. Some of the funniest moments involve Daniels and I don't think he got the credit he deserves. And that might be the reason he tried to bring some sensitivity to the plot, as if it was the only way to compete with Carrey, being stupid in a touching way. And let's face it, the film is designed as a platform to let the machine Carrey go in total free style mode with as much imprvosation as he can afford but being touching wasn't his strongest suit, not yet, wait for ""Liar, Liar"" and ""The Truman Show"", for that.<br/><br/>Indeed, it was still 1994 and Carrey's acting needed more polishing or better scripts. The problem with the 'stupid' angle is that it's so overplayed that I found myself facepalming more than laughing, chuckling more than laughing and some bits are so hilarious that other appear as totally uninspired. I wasn't too sure that Lauren Holly needed her skirt to be lifted by Jim Carrey. I'm not sure that the second appearance of Sea Bass was the Karmic comeback we expected. I'm not sure the urination gag had the best outcome. And I think the ending with the top models left me cringing more than laughing. The film relied too much on Carrey being carried away and Daniels following him that it didn't suspect that a little less could have been a little more, that a few reliefs were needed and that some of the best gags didn't involve any of the dumb and the dumber one.<br/><br/>Ebert said he almost got hospitalized with the dead bird gag, I felt the same with the phone booth 'falcon' punch."

One day, Llyod was taking a woman, Mary (played by Lauren Holly) to the airport, and she left behind a suitcase full of money. It is now up to Harry and Llyod to travel to Aspen, Colorado to return the suitcase of money to Mary, little do they know the suitcase is connected to a hostage.<br/><br/>The big reason why I don't like this movie as much as everyone else is because I'm not into the immature adult humor. When I was 12 years old, I used to love Beavis & Butt-Head. But as I got older, I grew out of it. This movie is a lot like Beavis & Butt-Head, where two stupid guys cause trouble and make fools out of themselves. However, the immaturity in this movie isn't extreme or over the top. To me, there's more funny and clever moments than immature stuff.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels did a great job together. They had pretty good dialouge and played off each other really well, and Lauren Holly was great as the love interest of the two bafoons. The story was also pretty good and pacing went fairly fast.<br/><br/>Overall, Dumb & Dumber is a film I don't love, but I do get some enjoyment out of it."

The quick back and forth between the two lead actors and not so subtle chirping often goes unnoticed because your'e laughing so hard from the previous scene.the jokes and dialogue are so good and Carey and Daniels deliver them with such authenticity.

I grew up watching Jim Carrey films. But I left out the other comic genius in Dumb & Dumber. Jeff Daniels is the less stupid one of the two. Which most people may appreciate, but I don't. I much prefer Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas. Yes, that's his name.<br/><br/>I hate to say what i'm about to say. But Dumb & Dumber is actually a classic. Most critics and people don't give Jim Carrey enough credit. I feel sorry for Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler, because until Funny People, Sandler always got bashed. I hope Jim Carrey soon does a movie like that, because Jim Carrey deserves more credit. I give him enough credit, but most other people think he's stupid. Jim Carrey isn't foul mouthed comedy which Appatow does, Jim Carrey is like Seinfeld.

Harry is taking care of dogs. When Lloyd takes a woman named Mary Swanson to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls in love with her. When Mary purposely leaves a suitcase on the ground, Lloyd runs in and takes it. It turns out that Mary left it there so then these two criminals could take it.

","Jim Carrey can be an acquired taste. His style of physical, face-pulling humour does not suit every film in which he has applied it.<br/><br/>Dumb And Dumber is not one of those - the humour here is ideally suited to Carrey's style.<br/><br/>The revelation, though, is Jeff Daniels. This may well have been the movie Carrey was building up to since the first Ace Ventura movie and, to that extent, is no great surprise on his CV. For Daniels, however, this movie is completely out of left field, and he is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>It is tempting to go on and explain why this is so, but there is a much better solution - go and watch the movie! If you're prepared to spend time with a couple of intensely stupid, but essentially good hearted, men, neither of whom realises how stupid they are, behaving incredibly stupidly (but very very funnily), then you'll get what I mean far better than if I try to explain it."

","This is a film where I watched it and thought of how brilliant the writers had to be to create two such stupid characters.

One day, Jim Carrey's character meets a beautiful woman(Lauren Holley) while driving her to the airport(he is a chauffeur). Holley leaves a briefcase at the airport and Jim Carrey is determined to get it back to her. He convinces Jeff Daniels to travel with him to Aspen, Colorado, to bring the briefcase back to Holley.<br/><br/>What is terrific about this film is that unlike some other inferior buddy comedies, the two main characters are distinguishable from each other. Jim Carrey is the really ""dumb"" character, while Daniels plays the more practical ""dumb"" buddy and something of a straight character. The jokes and slapstick comedy in this film are second to none and what really allows this film to work is the fact that neither of these two guys have any idea how ridiculous their behavior is. This is truly a great comedy and has several real laugh out loud moments."

Lloyd's best friend and companion is Harry Dunn, played by Jeff Daniels, in which like Lloyd, Harry is a loser in his own way. The scruffy hair buddy drives dogs on the way to the dog shows for which his van is detail of one like a dog with giant ears on the side. Both friends lose their jobs until Harry sees that Lloyd is carrying an unknown briefcase that belonged to Mary from the airport in which the two of them embark in a journey where mishaps and misery are engaged to those that get near Harry and Lloyd together.<br/><br/>The film is a high mark for Jim Carrey who already succeeded box office gold with Ace Venture: Pet Detective at the time, but instead of butt jokes it's all about the pranks and gags from the comic. Jeff Daniels took me by surprise where instead of playing a normal guy in such films as Speed and Arachnophobia, he shows that he can place his acting chops into comedy.

","The Farrelly brothers (Peter and Bobby Farrelly) have successfully made a career of making crude comedies (often raising controversy with them), but it all started in 1994 with ""Dumb & Dumber"", a movie of this kind starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. I saw a good chunk of this movie years ago, when it came on TV one time, and can't remember exactly what I thought of it. It wasn't until fairly recently that I first saw the whole thing, and this time, I definitely found a good majority of the gags funny (some of them priceless), enough for me to have no problem watching it again, and once again having some great laughs! <br/><br/>Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two very dimwitted individuals who live in Providence, Rhode Island. Lloyd is a taxi driver, and one day, he drives a young woman from Aspen, Colorado named Mary Swanson to the airport, immediately developing a crush on her. As Mary leaves for the flight, Lloyd sees that she has left a suitcase behind. Thinking she left it there accidentally, he attempts to get it back to her before the plane takes off, but is too late. After he and Harry lose their jobs on the same day, he convinces his friend to come on a long road trip to Aspen to return Mary's suitcase to her. However, what these two idiots don't realize is that Mary left that suitcase behind for a reason, and during their trip, they also don't realize that two criminals are following them! <br/><br/>The Farrellys are known to make extremely silly, sick, raunchy movies, filled with toilet humour, slapstick, and sex jokes. ""Dumb & Dumber"" shows that it was like that from the beginning. The filth in this movie (along with the other movies from the Farrelly brothers) is obviously hated by some people, and those people should definitely avoid this movie at all costs! However, although the kind of humour that comes from the minds of the Farrelly brothers and other demented minds in the comedy business isn't for everyone, some people like it a lot. While ""Dumb & Dumber"" may not be an absolutely perfect film for those who have a sick sense of humour (like me), and like the kind of crude jokes that the Farrellys love to use, I would say it's well worth a look."

My parents knew I wasn't old enough to understand what was going on, I do however, still have vague memories of a few scenes from the theater. Ironically, this became my favorite comedy as. a youngster. Jim Carrey was my hero, and I must have watched Dumb and Dumber 100 times growing up. This may lead one to not trust my review of the film due to bias, however, with the many films that I grew up with, I am able to judge them based on everyone elses reactions to them, even if I still love them, I can understand why they are liked or disliked, or have not stood the test of time. With this film, it is every bit the film that I watched when I was a kid, rewatched as a teen and adult, and more. I can quote every line, I know every turn, and I still laugh out loud every time I watch it. Not only that, but I still catch things to this day, nearly 30 years after the release, that I have never noticed before. That to me, is the mark of a masterpiece.
That is exactly what this film is. A masterpiece. It has real depth, real emotion, real connections, real relationships, and its a comedy! The chemistry between Carrey and Daniels is off the charts. This is one of those rare films that lightning struck and everything was in the right place at the right time. The title of the film is Dumb and Dumber. Everything in the film revolves around two dumber than dirt characters, yet what makes this film a classic, is that it is incredibly smart.

I don't even really like peak Carrey's comedies like ""Ace Ventura"" or ""The Mask"", but here, he was reigned in and ""unleashed"" in enough doses to make the movie better for it and not just his sideshow.<br/><br/>And that's because the script allows it, with incessant jokes and gags, while naturally developing the story at the same time, filling the gaps with scenes with heart that counter balance the darker ones. Because the humor comes from how these two idiots see the world and how poorly they interpret what is happening to them, even situations that mostly help to advance the plot are made in a really hilarious way. Yes there is a plot, even if thin.<br/><br/>One more thing. For a movie from 1994, is quite surprising how it's not that offensive, without recurring to cheap sexist and racist jokes all the time, like the more lazy or inept writers often do (see, Adam Sandler movies)."

","Harry and Lloyd of ""Dumb and Dumber"" are two now-iconic characters so inane, they're unaware of the gravities of their own surroundings. They're also brilliant character sketches, and for those exact same reasons.<br/><br/>If you let go of your self-perceived intelligence long enough to give in to this film's wonderfully moronic gag-drivenness, you'll find ""Dumb and Dumber"" to be one of the great side-splitters from this era's brand of specific comedy. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels create a duo of imbeciles whose thick-headedness saves them from the same predicaments it also got them into. And it takes pure genius to conceive of something that stupid.<br/><br/>At it heart, ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a classic buddy film, and a comedy pairing for the ages. - WATCHED IT?

","I really got a kick out of the original version of this film. Just a dumb movie about two really dumb guys. You have to take it for what it is. However, I had the original version on VHS tape, so when i found the newer unrated version on DVD I bought it. Unfortunately , the unrated version really doesn't ad to the movie, it takes away from it. There are extra scenes which really aren't funny at all. There is a scene in the hotel with Harry and Lloyd in the heart shaped tub. In the original version it was funny. In the unrated version, it wasn't. Lloyd is listening through the wall to a couple obviously having sex in the next room. He then jokes that if Harry had breasts, he would 'do him' as well. He then goes on in a rather cruel fashion, saying things about Harry then calling him a 'homo'. The response from Harry is very awkward - like ""I'm your friend,, why are you talking to me like that.?"" Not funny at all. Sometime the original cut is the best for a reason. These 'added scenes' do not make a better movie. Still loved the original though."

","I remember how famous this movie used to be back when I was a young child. I remember many of my older cousins gathering to watch this flick, and I tried to laugh with them, but I couldn't understand most jokes-- not that this is an adult comedy, but I was absurdly young. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play two goofy and naive characters that cross the country to give back a suitcase full of money to its original owner. But until they arrive in Aspen, which is where the suitcase's owner lives, they get into a lot of trouble and luckily get away with all of them. They always do something unintentional and with no fraud, ending up killing a man-- which is a very funny scene. It's been a while since I stopped laughing at comedies, considering them to be unfunny most of times, but in ""Dumb & Dumber"" I had sincere laughter all the while. Congratulations for the production team and mainly to Carrey, who is the main funny attribute to this eternal film."

","Being a Jim Carrey fan myself, after having seeing this movie during it's theatrical release, I thought, he could've done a better movie than Dumb and Dumber.  In this one, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play these inept and incredibly stupid best friends who come across a suitcase and set out to Colorado to give it back to a woman (Lauren Holly) whom Lloyd eventually falls for.  And they get entangled in a kidnapping plot.<br/><br/>   I didn't like this movie because it was way too vulgar and lowbrow.  The worst part of all was when Lloyd spikes Harold's drink with a liquid laxative and later on Harold gets stuck in the bathroom for obvious reasons that are too ribald for me to explain.  This whole movie was a disgrace and an insult to such an advanced, talented, and charismatic comedian that Jim Carrey is.  <br/><br/>   To add insult to injury: This movie, when it was out in theaters became the number one movie in America and the favorite Jim Carrey movie amongst fans.  Even my friends and co-workers thought this movie was funny.  I understand why someone would like this movie, and that's okay with me.  But I suggest some better Jim Carrey movies like Ace Ventura parts 1 & 2, Cable Guy, Batman Forever, Man on the Moon, Me, Myself, and Irene, and The Truman Show.  This movie is totally brainless, if you don't like vulgarity then my best advice is to skip it!  I give Dumb and Dumber 1 star."

The plot itself is simple to follow, but I didn't find the story to be exciting as it lacks suspense and action - just full of plain stupidity and mishaps.<br/><br/>There are lots of really mindless moments and crude gags that may make you chuckle, but I've seen a lot more funnier and entertaining comedies than this.<br/><br/>Grade D-"
"KnightsofNi11","5","3","7","29 June 2012"," Really stupid, pretty hilarious, terrible ending
","There aren't a lot of movies dumber than Dumb and Dumber. I say that because the movie is purposefully dumb, but also just dumb dumb. It's the directorial debut of the Farrelly brothers who have gone on to create such comedic masterpieces as Stuck on You and Shallow Hal. Really, when you're going into a Farrelly brother movie you know what to expect. It's going to be stupid, but it might be good for a laugh or two. You can't expect much and you shouldn't plan on having the time of your life watching any of their movies.<br/><br/>But I digress. Dumb and Dumber is the film that began their career and it stars Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels and Lloyd and Harry, respectively. They're two idiot best friends who drive across the country to return a briefcase to somebody that Lloyd met while working as a limo driver. They get themselves into a lot of trouble as soon as they pick up that briefcase, however, and end up getting a lot more than they bargained for during their misadventures across America.<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber is a comedy that is well aware of its own stupidity, and that's where it garners all of its laughs from, being completely brain dead. It's littered with poop and fart jokes, with a few intelligent quips thrown in here and there. It's story is all over the place and is incredibly convoluted for such a simple buddy comedy movie.<br/><br/>Honestly, the script here doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are very funny together. They throw in a lot of their own humor and make the characters of Lloyd and Harry worthwhile. After reading a little bit I learned that some of the film's funniest moments were improvised by Carrey and Daniels which is ironically hilarious, but it makes the film itself that much worse.<br/><br/>But, again, I can't be too harsh on this film. It's just another stupid comedy that has nothing more to offer than, as I said before, a laugh or two. In fact, I actually sort of enjoyed Dumb and Dumber. This brand of comedy isn't my thing but the movie entertained. However, it has the most pathetically thrown together and ridiculously abrupt ending I've ever seen in a comedy, and this really left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I was actually close to saying this was a pretty good film, but after it's awful ending I'm going to have to go with pretty bad instead."

Make no mistake for those of us that simply want a good laugh aloud riotous comedy, this fits the bill.<br/><br/>Hilarious, side splitting fun.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Avoid the sequel."
"Hollywood_Yoda","7","2","4","16 October 2018"," Great Comedy
","Back in the 1990s, there was something called talent, and Jim Carrey had it for a while. Jeff Daniels had talent already, but wanted to try comedy, as he'd been in mostly dramas up to this point. But the two of them together made a great comedy duo. And the direction from Peter and Bobby Farrelly made Dumb and Dumber the hit that it is.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this film, you're in for a treat and you'll laugh a lot. The antics and hijinks are hilarious. Essentially, Dumb and Dumber is a road movie, as Harry and Lloyd venture cross country in their van, a 1984 Sheep Dog! The costars and cameos make the film even better, with Victoria Rowell from Diagnosis Murder being the best and most memorable.<br/><br/>If you have the chance, see this film and make sure you see the extended version."

"astrowhiz","10","2","4","9 January 2016"," My fave comedy film
","One of the greatest comedies ever made in my opinion. It's often described as a stupid movie, but I don't think it is. It can be very silly, but at its heart it's a movie about friendship and unrequited love.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey puts in an amazing performance that's quite nuanced in its physicality. He's always very aware of where each point of his body is located, what what his face is doing. That might seem like a strange thing to say but an expression or stance or way of performing an action can make a big difference to a scene. There's a particular scene after he gets mugged by an old lady where he bursts through the door and crumples to the ground in agony. It's a small thing but I can't imagine any other actor performing the scene in that way, and there's plenty of other scenes where Carrey's unique physicality shines through.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels is suitably goofy in his role, and probably gets the biggest laugh with the toilet scene, which is crude and silly but very funny.<br/><br/>I don't think Carrey or the Farrelly Brothers ever recaptured the greatness of this movie unfortunately."
"ppakgate","10","2","4","22 June 2015"," The funniest movie I have ever seen
","Is this movie ""dumb""? Sure. Mindless entertainment? Definitely. Some days you just want to sit down, watch a mindless movie, and laugh your butt off...and this is the best movie to do that too. I've seen it probably over 20 times now (First saw it in theaters when I was 9 years old) and it's kept me laughing ever since. From the slapstick humor, to the subtle humor, it has you laughing from the start to the end. These days funny movies are overly sexual, violet, or dark...but Dumb and Dumber remains funny without crossing any lines.<br/><br/>On another note, Dumb and Dumber to (2014) was pretty funny and didn't disappoint, however, it was unable to recapture the magic of the original."
"CinematicInceptions","7","2","4","19 February 2015"," Done pretty well with constant laughs and a surprisingly high IQ.
","Dumb and Dumber is one of many road trip comedies, but it meanders from the standards that came before it. No cars were wrecked in the making of this film, unlike Tommy Boy, and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. In fact, it might not even qualify as a road trip comedy since at least thirty-five minutes of it are spent at the destination of Aspen, Colorado. It has kind of a story to it, but primarily it just takes some everyday situations and puts them into comedy format.<br/><br/>The movie introduces another dynamic comedy duo to join the ranks. You can tell that Harry and Lloyd are good friends, but they also have distinct personalities. This is highlighted by the balance of screen time that they have together and separate. Lloyd is a little bit goofier and more adventurous than the somewhat irritable and nervous Harry. Both parts receive good, arguably spectacular, performances. Despite how the film is titled, the two are not as stupid as one might think. They show that they are resourceful in a number of situations, though there does seem to be some part of their brains that have something missing. Their stupidity is almost paradoxical, because they know how to drive and make some kind of money, but there's just certain things that they don't really get like ""Christmas as in the holiday?""- ""No Christmas as in tree."" <br/><br/>There are various minor characters that drive the plot along. These consist of the scattered cops, the guy and girl that chase Harry and Lloyd, and Mary Swanson. The plot is nothing special, but it's also not the main focus of the movie and can be absorbed in a variety of ways and at a variety of levels. The whole story behind the suitcase is kind of funny in itself because it's such a serious thing, but it get's inadvertently messed up by the unsuspecting and innocent Harry and Lloyd. Each part is acted pretty well, though you could make a case against the quality of the script.<br/><br/>There is a pretty good balance of verbal and situational comedy. I got more of a bang of the verbal comedy, which primarily came before arriving in Aspen. A lot of the situational humor comes from the minor characters overestimating Harry and Lloyd's intelligence and getting outwitted, sometimes unintentionally. The humor isn't outrageously crude or raunchy, though it is rated PG-13 for a reason.<br/><br/>If you enjoy Jim Carrey movies, this fits the bill, and he gives a performance that is on par with his other work. It's pretty good if you like slapstick, though the overall feel doesn't quite spell slapstick. I guess you could say it's kind of in it's own genre. But watch it for laughs and if you don't like it, there's no fault in that- apart from maybe being a little too smart for this movie. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

","Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest films ever made, and is truly my favorite comedy film. While soon after the initial release of the film, the audience and critic response wasn't very good at all. Having been played on television for roughly fifteen years now, the fan base and the overall grade of the film has drastically went upwards. I remember in the 1990s often seeing this film on television and watching it many many times. There was no watching it too much. The film flows so naturally and in my opinion there is never a dull scene, not a single one. The following is my review of Dumb and Dumber.<br/><br/>The film was written by Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly, and Bennett Yellin. The Farrelly Brothers are also known for other hilarious films such as There's Something About Mary, and Me, Myself & Irene. This story follows two friends Harry(Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd(Jim Carrey) as they travel across country from Rhode Island to Aspen, Colorado where Lloyd returns a briefcase that a customer left in Lloyd's limousine he was driving. The silly happenings that occur on the way to Aspen are downright hilarious. This movie has so many quotable lines, that it was difficult to pick my favorite for the summary of my review. As I said in my first paragraph, this film flows smoothly, never a dull moment, never a moment when you ask yourself ""where are the laughs at?"". This film is non stop comedy and just an overall amazing joyride to watch. I sat down to watch the film again because they are finally making a true sequel to this amazing film. I've watched this film so many times over the years(easily 300 times if I had to put a number on it) and I can honestly say I still never get bored with this film. After 20 years that says a great deal about a film if it can have that effect on you. The Farrelly Brothers delivered a fabulous comedy on their first outing, and a film I will never forget.<br/><br/>The film was also directed by The Farrelly Brothers. This was the Farrelly Brothers first outing directing a film, they had written some things in the past, but never directed. This duo was unstoppable in the 1990s, with not only this film but several others as well. The film was not very easy to get off the ground, and it actually took a few years because studios thought the script was garbage and that it would never sell. New Line Cinema came along and gave the film a chance, although still worried about the idea. The studio gave the directors a list of 25 actors who they wanted to see cast as Harry and Lloyd, but all of the actors said no. Finally, they went to Jim Carrey to ask about the role of Lloyd, and he did accept the role, but it wasn't until after his wildly popular Ace Ventura film was released, thus giving him much more money. They wanted someone a little less unknown for the other role of Harry and someone who could play nicely off of Carrey. In came Jeff Daniels, who is such a fantastic actor. Daniels was worried abut Carrey stealing the show, but then after reading the script realized that Harry is just as important as Lloyd if not more so. The rest is history, and we are left with two amazing performances from Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey. They did in fact get along so much together, and made the film that much better. It is even said that Carrey ad libbed a great deal of his famous lines. For young first time directors to allow their cast to do this and have fun with the roles made the film that much better. The Farrelly Brothers set out to deliver fans some great laughs, and in the end turned out one of the greatest comedies ever made. Not many first time directors can say that.<br/><br/>The soundtrack on this film is so amazing as well. Times have of coursed changed in the 20 years since the film first was released, but looking back hearing those great songs from artists like Apache Indian, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, The Proclaimers, Echobelly, and of course Crash Test Dummies is such a joy. The soundtrack added so much to this comedy classic, and should not be overlooked.<br/><br/>In closing, Dumb and Dumber set out to deliver some laughs, but little did the Farrelly Brother know that their first feature length film would become so widely popular and known as a true comedy classic. Fans who want to get back to roots of real comedy instead of the phony comedy being pushed today, this is a fantastic film to start with. The comedy is witty and subtle, which even makes you stop and think at times. The joy this film will bring you is nearly unparalleled in this comedy genre. With the newest and first real sequel to the original Dumb and Dumber film set to release within hours of me writing this review, it is a must to see this classic film before going out to watch the sequel.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Dumb & Dumber is a brilliant movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding comedic cast. The movie is without a doubt one of my favourite comedy films of all time, I have watched it on many, many occasions and it still has me in stitches whenever I rewatch it. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are both fantastic at playing idiots, they go through a lot of effort in both performance and appearance, Carrey even letting his bad buck tooth show off and, Jeff Daniels not grooming his hair once while filming to make their characters look more deranged. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with many memorable quotes and is the feature film debut for the Farelly brothers. Despite the fact that they have gone on to do great films such as There's Something About Mary and Stuck On You, this is still their finest work, for me. <br/><br/>Hilarious from start to finish with even a little sentimentality, I would highly recommend Dumb & Dumber to anyone looking for a great comedy. <br/><br/>After a woman accidentally leaves her briefcase at the airport, idiotic best friends Llyod and Harry set off to find her, making one mistake after another along the way. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jim Carrey"

","With this being a comedy about two rock-stupid guys, I think the Farrelly brothers did a great job at writing out the characters in this movie. Of course, Harry and Lloyd are the stars of this movie, and especially with Lloyd, they're perfect as ""idiots"" in this movie. Like a movie with good character development, Lloyd and Harry have very distinct personalities, and this really makes the movie such a ball to watch. Harry is the least dumb of the two, and has a slightly bigger conscience than Lloyd (though he's capable of doing low things). Lloyd is not only the dumbest of the two, but has a pretty dark personality, since he sells Harry's dead parakeet, Petey, to a blind kid before embarking on their journey to Aspen. Harry and Lloyd are excellent counterparts to Beavis and Butthead. The Farrelly brothers executed the humor very well in this movie. Among the most notable achievements in this area is the fact that they pull off ""gross-out"" humor that's actually funny. I find this a very tricky feat since so much humor of this ilk is done only to gross people out rather than laugh.<br/><br/>Mark Irwin's cinematography for this movie is quite superb. The shots of the mountains in Aspen, the somewhat run-down areas in Providence, and other locales in this movie look really good, which strangely go together well with the humor. Carrey's delivery always surpasses just funny or just professional and is subtle maniacal in perfection. There aren't many movies that can make your ribs hurt from laughing, and it takes a certain subtlety in the comedy to push you over the edge into hysterics, but that is exactly what you have in Dumb and Dumber. There were some parts that I had to rewind and watch again half a dozen times just to salvage the subtlety of Carrey's hilarious delivery. Carrey is certainly the focal point of the movie. The plot and his character's side-kick are really just props that Carrey uses to bring about painful laughter in anyone watching, (and I'm sure he is responsible for thousands of people choking on their drink whilst watching this movie). Carrey's partner in comedy is Jeff Daniels, and he matches Carry nearly scene for scene. The two together are fantastically funny. There are too many scenes to mention where they had me bend over laughing. The jokes come about every second minute, so if one does not get your funny bone, another zinger is on its way. There is so much to laugh at in this movie that your stomach muscles will get a good workout! <br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
"robsta23","7","0","0","9 August 2015"," Simple Plot, Good Fun
","Especially from the title, going into this movie you have to expect a comedy that isn't smart, but isn't necessarily THAT stupid either. Obviously, a lot of the comedy comes from the two titular characters being dumb, acting like five-year-olds, but this doesn't take away from Carrey and Daniels' integrity - it takes talent to pull these characters off in a way that makes you enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's so simple, yet little of the comedy within the movie revolves around the plot, but rather in episodes of Harry and Lloyd's stupidity. Lloyd and Harry lose their jobs, but Lloyd recovers a suitcase which Mary Swanson ""left behind"" at the airport as she departed for Aspen. It turns out this suitcase holds ransom for her husband, and two hit men follow Lloyd as he and Harry travel to Aspen to recover the ransom, thinking the two of them are masterminds (a big laugh).<br/><br/>To give you an idea about the comedy in this film here are some examples - Lloyd knows ""the most annoying sound in the world,"" Harry has to ask if BOTH skis belong to a woman he meets, a police officer drinks from a beer bottle which Lloyd has urinated in, and the list goes on like that.<br/><br/>If you allow yourself to not expect greatness from this film, you will probably find yourself enjoying it. It is a good comedy that features one of Jim Carrey's best characters to date.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"

You would think that as an adult that humor would no longer appeal to me. True. Many times it doesn't.

Think of Loyd igniting his flatulence, or the traffic cop drinking urine from beer bottles.

","Until I saw Dumb and Dumber I thought of Jim Carrey as blatantly obnoxious. Cable Guy,Ace Ventura,Truman Show-Yuck! I watched this movie with my kids as a favor to them long after the film had left the theatres. I think I've seen it around seven times now and have to say that Carrey has joined the ranks of the great comedians. Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy,Peter Sellers,Jerry Lewis,Don Knotts,Cary Grant these and many more knew the secret of making us laugh. They each had a niche in the broad genre we call comedy.Hi-brow,low-brow,ineptitude,slapstick, farce,black humor, we like it all for one reason. It makes us laugh. I can remember tears coming down my cheeks when I watched Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush. That same thing has happened in not nearly enough other comedies I've seen over the years. It's happened every time I've watched Dumb and Dumber. What a great way to end the first century of film-making. D and D will endure like all the great comedies before. Dumb and Dumber is well written and well acted. I can't say that I condone the spirit of crassness that defines so much of our present culture. I think we've suffered as a culture for giving in to cheap laughs too often. There are definitely elements of that in Dumb and Dumber but it transcends even those. There are moments of sheer brilliance both in writing and performance. The timing of many of the gags was also a major driving force. What you end up with is a film that at some point or another has to make even the most jaded film-goer laugh out loud at least once. 6.2 is an insult to this film. Look deeper.

The jokes are low-brow and tasteless (it manages to squeeze in not one, but two urination sight gags) and the story is a bit of flimsy about a kidnaping gone awry.<br/><br/>The only thing that could redeem such an offensive picture is if it was funny.  Thankfully, all us low-brow fans can sit back and laugh, because Dumb and Dumber is hysterical.  It's not for everyone -- this is no Kind Hearts and Coronets -- but if you like a good laxative joke (and who doesn't?), Dumb and Dumber delivers.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is Lloyd Christmas, a limo driver who tries to pick up girls by climbing into the backseat at stop signs and pretending to be the passenger. His pal is Harry (Jeff Daniels), a dog groomer who spent his life savings converting his van into a furry pooch.  When they both get fired the same day, they decide to drive the pooch west from Rhode Island to Colorado (never mind why).<br/><br/>What comes next are a couple thousand miles of jokes about pee-pee, poo-poo, varieties of phlegm, ulcers, rat poison, vicious assault, hideous fashion and the decimation of 1/7th of an endangered species by champagne cork.<br/><br/>Nonetheless for all their stupid, tasteless crudeness (and the movie never lets up) there is a sweet spirit at the core.  Lloyd leaves Providence for love; Harry comes along for friendship and loyalty.  A more cynical script would have sunk the story, but the optimism and good vibes that propel these two across the country keep things and a fun level."

Even the new 'Me, Myself, and Irene' doesn't even come close to generating as many on-the-floor-laughings as I experienced with Dumb and Dumber.

If you can't decide whether or not to watch this film, trust me- just watch the first 30 seconds. You'll be hooked straight away. No probs.

","Jim Carrey has a natural talent of making you laugh. 'Dumb and Dumber' ranks as high as 'Liar Liar' in his side-splitting comedies. From the first scene where he invites Ms Swanson for a hug after driving her to the airport as her limo-driver (""..after all we have been through"") to the absolute last scene (""..my friend is kind of slow..... the town is 3 miles *THAT* way"")...this movie is all the way FUN."

Lloyd and Harry aren't exactly stupid people, I just wonder how any one could have culture so messed up in their own minds. The part when they're ""laid back country folks"" and Lloyd says..<br/><br/>""They've got the Monkeys on the jukebox, they were a major influence on the Beatles.""<br/><br/>Not every idiot like that would make the connection between the Beatles and Monkeys....let alone get it backwards...<br/><br/>The crowning moment and line that is so glorious in Dumb and Dumber.....<br/><br/>Harry---""I was thinking the Rockies would be a little rockier than this.""<br/><br/>Lloyd---""That's what I was thinking.

","Dumb and Dumber is without a doubt one of the funniest films of all time, and definitely Jim Carrey's best performance yet.  There are plenty of obscene jokes at a first glance, but there is a lot of visual and subtle humour crammed into 100-odd minutes as well.  The plot is simple but effective, paving way for lots of humour.

","Seeing Dumb and Dumber in in London of the Spring of 1995, has to be the best cinematic experience I have ever had. The story; two friends, marvelously portraited by Carrey and Daniels, make their way to return a suitcase to Carrey's love interest. Their ambivalent friendship is projected ingeniously, by excellent timing of jokes and completely absurd story development. D & D contains more boyish irrationality and less of the cheap under-the-belt humour found in ""There's Something About Mary"", also by the Farrelly brothers.

","First, let me make this abundantly clear.  ""Dumb and Dumber"" is a movie for guys.  That is, this is a really really bad date movie.  Girls just won't find it funny, in fact, they'll mostly just find it sick and tasteless. That's because it is sick and tasteless.  Then again, so is all really good guy humor.  Another reason not to see it with a girl is that you'll end up feeling guilty for laughing at it, simply because the girl is there.<br/><br/>I'm a guy.  Still, I am a bit ashamed to say the honest truth:  I love ""Dumb and Dumber.""  And I don't mean that I kinda-sorta-maybe-a-little-bit liked it.  I thought it was hilarious from start to finish.<br/><br/>For starters, it's dumb.  That much is obvious from the title at least. I'll try to get beyond that, even though it isn't easy with a movie like this.<br/><br/>""Dumb and Dumber"" stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as complete idiots.  I'm not saying this to be mean or politically incorrect, but to be truthful. They're just dumb.  However, I also encourage you to rent ""Gettysburg"" and ""The Truman Show.""  Here are the same guys in intelligent roles, and they're still good.  This is the proof of great acting!  The fact that these intelligent men can act like idiots puts both of them on my top ten list of actors.<br/><br/>Where do I go from there?  Well, the comedy is typical bathroom comedy, with bodily function jokes, sex jokes, and then more of both of the above.  Is it really funny?  You betcha.<br/><br/>So, what am I really saying here?  Just this:  Guys, get a bunch of your guy friends together, get a pizza and a huge bottle of Coke.  Sit around for a while telling dirty jokes and stuffing your face, and then watch ""Dumb and Dumber.""  Be proud of your guy-ness, of your immaturity, of your testosterone!

","""Dumb and Dumber"" no doubt hits the mark on great humor. Most comedies have funny parts but aren't consistent all the way through. ""D&D"" however keeps the laughs coming. I started off giggling, but finished with tears in my eyes and pain in my stomach from laughing too hard. Few movies have done that to me. I have a feeling some people are too ""proper"" to laugh at the ""bathroom humor"" of this movie. If they'd only let themselves go and enjoy it, instead of turning their nose up at things that we ALL have done from time to time, then the film is great.

Well, I guess it's you love it or you hate it, with the Farrely brothers, because the ratings are quite polarized (lotsa 10's and lotsa 1's). And I love it, of course. Jim Carrey can be over the top sometimes (eg Ace Ventura 2), but he's just excellent in Dumb & Dumber. Favorite parts: the 'sweater' scene, when Lloyd's fantasizing about him and Mary, where he's telling this lame joke and *everyone* is laughing and having fun...and the cop bit.

","Before I saw this movie, I regarded Jim Carrey as the most overpaid, overhyped goofball in Hollywood.  After I saw this movie, I had very different thoughts about him.  He plays his role as a simpleminded, innocent schmuck in his movie to perfection.  Plus, he isn't a shouting screeching moron as in the Ace Ventura films or Cable Guy or a ""serious"" person as in Liar Liar or The Truman Show. Being a huge fan of ""older"" comedy movies (pre-1990s) a lot of the funny films today just don't compare to the ones of the past but this film is a HUGE exception.  With the year 2000 breathing down our necks, I think it's safe for me to give this movie the ""Best Comedy Of The 90's"" award. On a final note, this movie kinda makes you feel all good inside as well.  Think about it:  two dumb morons who are plagued by bad luck all throughout their life just say ""screw this"" and drive across the country to Aspen to give a beautiful girl back her briefcase while encountering many perils along the way.  Once in Aspen, the perils and the fortunes just keep piling up.  The movie does have a sad ending in a way but hey, they're making a sequel so there's no need to pity Lloyd and Harry too much.

","This film does what it sets out to do, tickle your bone, the funny bone that is. It's a great comedy from the makers of ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Kingpin"". The thing about comedies from the Farrely brothers is that I can watch them numerous times and still think they're funny, it's the genius comedy that's in them that makes me watch again. Jim Carrey plays Lloyd<br/><br/>Christmas who meets Lauren Holly's Character Mary Swanson when driving her to the airport. In the airport he watches as she leaves her briefcase in the airport, he goes and picks it up and runs. He meets up with Harry at their place and they decide to bring the briefcase back to Mary in Colorado, the adventure begins. All road trip flicks are cool as hell and this is no exception, I think Jeff Daniels steals the show as Harry, Lloyd's dumb friend. I recommend this flick to anyone who wants to chill, drink with a bunch of their friends and have fun. Cool flicks to go with it are ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Kingpin."""

I never knew that such a semi-serious actor like Jeff Daniels could be so stupid, and it amazed me on how well he played the part. This movie is so ridiculously unintelligent and unrealistic, but that is exactly what makes it so hilarious. I laughed more during this movie than I usually laugh in a month. My side hurt terribly at the end and I couldn't get it to stop.<br/><br/>One of the scenes that really got my attention was quite possibly the stupidest scene of the film, at that would be the resteraunt scene that Lloyd imagines. This particular scene (along with the ones that followed) was so stupid that it made me feel like I didn't know why I was watching this ""trash"", but it was amazingly funny. Another scene that grabs me is the burger/pepper scene, particularly at the end when Lloyd uses the phrase ""check, please"" (that line was so perfectly placed that I still laugh when I think about it).<br/><br/>This movie amused me more than any other movie. It is literally the most hilarious film I have ever seen, but I wouldn't recommend it to the easily offended type.

Same as when Jim Carrey was driving Lauren Holly in the beginning and then he wasn't paying attention and all the cars in his way were just exploding! Then he turns around and sees that nothings wrong! There's a lot more but these 2 are the ones I can think of the most. There is without a doubt ...MY FAVORITE AND ALSO THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"SMLA11","10","3","8","11 May 2002"," Laugh Out Loud Comedy
","This movie is probably the best comedy movie ever.  Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are hilarious and I enjoyed every second they were onsceen.  Jim Carrey is officially the funniest man of all time.  His character was very well written.  Jeff Daniel was hilarious as well and I have to admit I would never had expected him to be this good.  I have seen him do much more serious roles like in Speed and Arachnophobia.  He is great playing Harry. Him and Jeff Daniels are a great onscreen duo.  They rank up as one of the best along with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was great from the beginning til the end.  Whoever is a fan of Jim carrey and Jeff Daniels or just likes comedy movies, I DEFINITELY suggest this. Rating 10 out of 10."
"TxMike","Null","3","8","3 July 2001"," Not a good movie, 'technically', but one of my all-time favorite comedies.
","I avoided ""Dumb and Dumber"" at its theatrical release because I 'knew' a film of this name could not possibly be good. Boy was I wrong. I've seen it now 3 or 4 times, most recently last night, and for me it never gets old. In the vein of good farces like ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Something About Mary"", this one manages to strike a good balance, carefully walking the line between belly laughs and actual gross-out.<br/><br/>Like the scene where Lloyd (Jim Carrey) puts laxative in the coffee of Harry (Jeff Daniels)and, arriving at Mary's (Lauren Holly) house we start to hear abdominal gurgles. Frantic, Harry finds the bathroom, pulls down his pants, sits -- when we hear Mary say, ""Don't use the toilet, it doesn't flush."" Then we see Harry, pants down to his ankles, taking apart the back of the toilet to try and make it work.<br/><br/>Or the scene where they are skiing and Harry, like a kid, touches his tongue to the frosty metal support. And later, as his tongue stretches, as mary pulls his head away. Or the last scene, where Lloyd and Harry direct the bus of bikini girls to the next town, instead of volunteering for the job of ""rubbing oil all over their bodies.""<br/><br/>And, of course, the whole idea of trading their hound mobile for a small scooter because it 'makes 70 miles per gallon', then riding to Aspen, in the snow, over passes, and arriving with ice growing from their noses, as Lloyd gets off in Aspen, Harry is stuck to his back. Trying to throw Mary's briefcase into a lake, it opens, they see all the money, then spend it all on a $285,000 car, a hotel suite, fancy clothes, all the while leaving ""IOUs"" in the suitcase so they could pay her back eventually.<br/><br/>Lauren Holly is a fine actress, but also one of the most strikingly beautiful. Here she was about 30 during filming, and at the absolute height of her beauty. No wonder Carrey married her, unfortunately it didn't last. Jeff Daniels is, to me, an even better comic than Jim Carrey, who is mostly ""over the top"" in his acting. Daniels is a more subtle, and funnier, comic. <br/><br/>No message in this film, just good fun and laughs. The actual story doesn't matter. My wife cannot stand ""Dumb and Dumber"". I guess it helps to be a bit wacky too.<br/><br/>Sept 2017 update: Still fresh after all these years."

","Oh goodness ""Dumb & Dumber"" is one of those films that is just crazed out of its mind. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels star as two dimwits who go cross-country to Aspen, Colorado to find a beautiful woman (Lauren Holly) who left a briefcase full of money in an East Coast airport to pay kidnappers to get her husband back. Of course, Carrey does not know this and thinks she left the briefcase by accident so he takes the money unwittingly. Carrey also has an obsession with Holly to complicate manners. Throughout Carrey and Daniels dominate the action and the strangest coincidences occur as the bad guys think that Carrey and Daniels are after them and the good guys try to figure out the duo's connection with the kidnappers. In short this is one of those films that is just outstanding and serves its demented purpose to the paramount. 4 stars out of 5."
"adrianswingler","1","7","27","15 June 2017"," Celebrating the Sorry State of American Anti-intellectualism
","The movie wasn't funny. It made me angry. So, why such polarized reviews? I think it's a statement about the state of affairs in the US.<br/><br/>The US has always been full of bone-deep anti-intellectuals. Anyone with an education is suspect. We've got a joke of a President because a certain segment were fed up with people with educations telling them to be more respectful of everyone and get over out-dated behaviors. But this goes further. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of the kind of societal failure that whips out of a parking lot in front of you, forcing you to brake heavily to avoid an accident, then drives painfully slow. That's the kind of person that finds this movie funny. The kind of person that will never achieve anything...except they can keep you from getting something done!<br/><br/>So, what's wrong with a movie for people like that? Well, like the aforementioned crowd that worships the orange one, it's cruel! It's not just that aggressive anti-intellectualism is cool, so is being rude and cruel. ""What's wrong with pulling the wings off flies, you pointy headed intellectual!"" Yeah. It's on that level.<br/><br/>Does that whole phenomenon anger you as well? Well, that's the one useful thing about this movie. Those people like to lie about their feelings and keep their ugliness behind closed doors with their buddies. This movie is a good way to ferret them out. And you can see the denial/projection in the reviews. ""Something wrong with you"". Just what I said. So, when reviews say, ""If you don't find this funny, there's something wrong with you"", it's just like all the other things that 1/3 minority is angry about. Someone not being like them. Someone knowing something that they never will. Someone acting like humans aren't naturally cruel and insensitive.<br/><br/>Isn't that hilarious?!? <br/><br/>And if you think there can't be enough people like that to account for the positive reviews, just look at the reviews for any of Tarantino's travesties of cinema. Mindless tribalism and video game ethics rampant."

","Hot off ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""The Mask"", Jim Carrey affirmed that 1994 was his year with ""Dumb & Dumber"". As the hilariously stupid Lloyd Christmas, he lets it all out. Jeff Daniels is equally funny as the equally brainless Harry Dunne. On a quest to return a suitcase to Lloyd's passenger Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the two imbeciles have a series of crazy adventures.<br/><br/>I will say that the diarrhea scene was unnecessary, but the rest of the movie was a hoot, especially ski lift scene. Among other things, the Farrelly brothers truly made their mark with this movie, paving the way for ""There's Something About Mary"". A classic."
"jboothmillard","9","3","9","11 March 2005"," Dumb and Dumber
","Growing up, this was probably the funniest comedy I had ever seen at the time, and still today it is one of the funniest, no matter how many times I watch it, from directing brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal, The Heartbreak Kid). Basically in Providence, Rhode Island, Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) works as a limousine driver, and his best friend and roommate Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) works as an operator for a mobile pet grooming service called ""Mutt Cutts"", they are the friendly and lovable, but together probably the stupidest people ever. One day Lloyd drives Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) to the airport, she is travelling back home to Aspen, he instantly falls in love with her, but then he watches her leave a briefcase in the terminal, before kidnappers Joe ""Mental"" Mentalino (Mike Starr) and J.P. Shay (Karen Duffy) can collect it Lloyd retrieves it and tries to return it, without success. Lloyd is unaware the briefcase contains ransom money for the return of Mary's husband Bobby (Brad Lockerman), he is fired from his job, as is Harry for delivering dogs late and accidentally dirty to a show, Mental and Shay have followed them, the duo mistake them for debt collectors and escape out the window, when they later return Harry's parakeet has been decapitated, upset by everything Lloyd suggests they should get away to Aspen. Harry knows Lloyd wants to return the briefcase to Mary and at first opposes the idea, but knowing Lloyd wants to find happiness agrees, and they set off the next day in Harry's dog looking van, Mental and Shay find out their plan and follow them. The kidnappers catch up to the pair, Mental poses as a hitchhiker to be picked up, while Shay follows, they stop for lunch, Lloyd and Harry prank Mental with chili peppers in his burger, and trying to help him give his medication for his ulcer they unintentionally poison him with the pills he planned to use on them. The pair continue towards Colardo, but Lloyd takes a wrong turn and ends up driving through Nebraska, Harry realises the error and is angered, eventually giving up on the journey and deciding to walk home, but Lloyd returns after trading the van for a moped and persuades him to go on to Aspen. The two arrive in Aspen but are unable to locate Mary, at night they stand by a fire to keep warm, and in a scuffle over gloves Harry throws and breaks open the briefcase, discovering the money, they ""borrow"" it to get a luxury hotel, clothes and a Lamborghini Diablo. In the newspaper they find out Mary and her family are hosting a gala, they prepare to attend, Lloyd is too nervous to talk to Mary, so gets Harry to bring her over, but through the influence of Mary's mother Helen (Teri Garr) reluctantly agrees to go skiing with her the next day, lying to Lloyd he has a date with her. The next day Harry spends the day on the slopes with Mary, but Lloyd finds out he lied to him, knowing Harry is seeing Mary again that night he gets revenge, he spikes Harry's coffee with laxative, Harry unintentionally ends up crapping in a broken toilet, while Lloyd arrives at the house, telling Mary he has her briefcase. Lloyd takes Mary to the hotel and shows her the briefcase, and tries to confess his love for her, but she rejects him, then Swanson family friend Nicholas Andre (Charles Rocket) shows up with a gun, he is the mastermind to Bobby's kidnapping, he is angry to discover most of the money has been spent and replaced with IOUs, he takes Lloyd and Mary hostage, and Harry when he returns. Before Nicholas can kill them, the FBI raid the suite, he and Shay are arrested, and Bobby is returned and reunited with Mary, to Lloyd's jealousy. The next day Lloyd and Harry are walking home, all their items have been confiscated and their moped broke down, when a bus full of beautiful bikini dressed women stop they unknowingly decline the chance to be oil boys for their competitions, Harry ironically tells Lloyd they will get their ""break"" one day, and the film ends with them having a game of tag as they continue to walk home. Also starring Victoria Rowell as Athletic Beauty, Joe Baker as Barnard, Hank Brandt as Karl Swanson and Cam Neely as Sea Bass. Carrey with his chipped tooth (real with his cap removed for the film) gets his many moments to use his facial and bodily hilarity, especially in a hilarious dream sequence, Daniels is equally great being comedic and getting his great moments, especially the hilarious toilet scene, together they are a pair of morons. This film at the time got mixed reviews, but you surely cannot help but disengage and enjoy, the kidnap format is only slight and allows you to laugh much more at the great slapstick, sight gags and toilet humour during a chaotic road trip, a fantastic comedy. It was number 17 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!"
"StevePulaski","6","2","5","7 March 2011"," Fun for a while
","Dumb and Dumber is one of those films I watched when I was a kid. I watched it up until Lloyd was daydreaming at the wheel of the car about his dreamgirl, Mary and then shut it off. I liked it up until the state of events about the bumbling crooks, the suitcase full of money, etc. I didn't want the film to be about that. I wanted it to be about two idiots getting into trouble. Not all this serious crap going on.<br/><br/>Now that it's been about eight years since I've seen it, I appreciate the film a bit more now. The first forty five minutes of the film are very entertaining and very funny. I laughed a lot in that time frame. Then once the film gets more and more about the crooks, and less about the antics of the two goofball leads I started to care less and less about the outcome.<br/><br/>The plot: Lloyd (Carrey) and Harry (Daniels) are two slackers who are trying to save enough money to go into business selling worm related novelties and ""worm-farms."" Lloyd is a limo driver, and Harry is a dog-groomer. One day, while taxiing a beautiful women to the airport (Holly), Lloyd noticed she leaves a suitcase on the ground (purposely). The suitcase was left for two henchman to have. Lloyd swoops in and retrieves the case much to the dismay of the henchman who now believe Lloyd works for someone who is planning to disrupt their plan.<br/><br/>Lloyd and Harry aren't aware that they are prey to two dangerous henchman, so they now go on a trip from Rhode Island to Aspen to give the beautiful women her suitcase back. Which obviously leads to slapsticky antics by both of the leads.<br/><br/>The jokes are hit or miss, but there are scenes like at the diner and when the guys get pulled over that I can help but laugh at. They are right up my alley those kind of scenes. My favorite line in the film is when Harry and Lloyd go to Nebraska instead of Aspen. Both are expecting to see The Rocky Mountains, but seeing Nebraska is flat as a board Jim Carrey states ""John Denver is full of s**t, man!"" Had me laughing out loud for minutes. Both Carrey and Daniels give surprisingly great performances. I say surprisingly because I'm rather not too fond of Jim Carrey because in many of his films he seems to be off his own medicine, or just running around like a dumbass for ninety minutes. In this film he does a rather humorous role, and is actually a pleasure to have on screen.<br/><br/>I would give this film a better review it had been about the two trying to start their own business. I'm rather not too fond of the film's plot because I don't care about the goofs trying to flee from thugs. The whole joke is that they don't know they're prey, and are pretty much going with the flow on the whole trip. If the film would've played like a better comedy instead of throwing this ho-hum plot at us maybe I would've appreciated it more.<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber is good slapstick material, but it doesn't compete to slapstick gold like Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Black Sheep is one of my favorite films, and has one of my favorite actors in it too, Chris Farley obviously. Dumb and Dumber was said to put The Farrelly Brothers on the map. This was followed by films like Me, Myself & Irene and There's Something About Mary. Who would've thought that a movie about two dopes would've gave two brothers a successful career. That is so dumb, fo' real.<br/><br/>Starring: Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and Lauren Holly. Directed by: Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly."

I won't even watch their films. That said, I think Dumb & Dumber is one of the funniest, laugh-out- loud movies of all time! Yet it wasn't even recognized by the AFI on their ludicrous List of 100 Greatest Comedies. They listed Laurel & Hardy at #99. What a bunch of snobs! Getting back to D&D, Jim Carrey is at his best. Jeff Daniels actually keeps pace with the frenetic Mr. Carrey. He wondered if this would be a bad career move. This performance compared with his previous role in ""Gettysburg"" just shows his range as an actor. They're on opposite ends of the spectrum and both are equally great in their genres. I'll admit that a few of the ""gross out"" jokes are a bit much, but all in all this movie is hilarious! Yes, it's stupid and dumb but what do you want in a comedy...Shakespeare?

","Dumb and Dumber (1994): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, Lauren Holly, Charles Rocket, Mike Starr: Farrelly Brothers debut comedy suggesting the reality of coincidence. Jim Carrey plays limo driver Lloyd Christmas who picks up Mary Swanson and is instantly infatuated. She leaves her briefcase in an airport terminal where he nabs it before two villains do. He and his friend Harry Dunne take it to Aspen where she claimed to be going. Not a bad start for directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly who detail this road comedy with many hilarious moments including Jim Carrey going martial arts against an enraged cook, or Lauren Holly receiving a snowball to the face that was much bigger than her head, or Jeff Daniels making an urgent call to the washroom after drinking coffee spiked with laxative. Great comic performances by Carrey as the love struck Lloyd, and Jeff Daniels as the dog loving Dunne. Lauren Holly is a wonderful romantic foil whom isn't the typical damsel. Unfortunately the villains are typical and cardboard but Charles Rocket does his best as the menacing leader. Some humour is adult nature including one involving a parakeet, or a urine joke involving a roadside cop. Another bad moment involves someone being shot at the unintentional sudden urge of another person. Otherwise this mindless comedy stresses friendship and other questionable antics. Score: 8 Â½ / 10"

Standout performances by both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. The chemistry between these two is unmatched, and the chemistry is simply the icing on the cake for this movie. The performances by both Carrey & Daniels is so natural, silly, hilarious & memorable it is as if these two simply pulled a weeks worth of self-documented video tape of their journeys and experiences and made it into a movie. Though far-fetched from a typical road trip, the casualness and comfort of the performances these two immerse yourself in make you feel as though these two could easily be your quarky neighbors you have always wondered about. One of the only movies I have personally watched over a dozen times, and knowing I'm not alone, I know the vast majority of the one-liners and jokes throughout this whole movie. Numerous classic scenes that have been imitated and improvised over the years by thousands of teenagers, adolescences and adults.

While it's certainly a bit crude and then some in parts, it's not so much so that most women will be very offended, especially since men are typically the butt of the jokes.

I think that's what anyone contemplating watching Dumb and Dumber needs to do in order to appreciate it.<br/><br/>Okay, so Jim Carey is the star (Lloyd) and he and his equally-clueless best mate Harry set off on a road trip across America in order to return what he thinks is a missing briefcase to its rightful owner. So, basically it's a 'road movie.' Now, by definition road movies are pretty 'low on plot.' The 'story' is simply the two dumb guys moving from one daft setting to the next. Yes, it is low on story. But it is pretty damn funny. And isn't that the main thing? It was made at the height of Jim Carey's fame, therefore he was somehow still fresh. If you're looking for low-brow humour then you'll find what you're looking for here. Yes, it won't tax you mentally and, by the time the credits roll, you may actually be thinking with a few less IQ points.

Too dumb to take a ride on the Hawaiian Tropic Bikini Bus and be the girl's suntan oil-us-up party guys! Also one of the funniest and dumbest films you will ever see, but not for the faint-of-heart and certainly enjoyed most by young adolescent males. I will probably wait for cable for the new sequel, and like and dislike it just as much. It rates a dirty ""8"" because, at it's best, it is hilarious. A guilty pleasure but not for children."

","Dumb & Dumber is a movie I pop in and see about two or three times a year. It never gets old and it still holds up to this day. <br/><br/>Dumber & Dumber also happens to be in my top five comedies. Ever. It's well titled film and for the film's purpose, it succeeds. It's a stupid movie and it knows it is, and that's why it's so great. <br/><br/>First of all the two leads are charming, despite their child-like nature and lack of common sense. Jim Carrey, as Jeff Daniels once put it, is a tornado of comedic wit and timing. Speaking of Jeff Daniels, his character Harry is very good contrast to Jim Carrey's character Lloyd. Carrey is energetic and it's a performance full of power, while Daniels is a bit more mellow and a teeny tiny bit smarter than Lloyd, just a little bit and plays off Carrey, which works well because he's not competing with his performance against Jim, he's just following along. They play off each other very well, and it's just damn funny. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty basic and simple, but it's the situations they get into that are real gold. Granted I haven't seen every movie out there or every comedy movie ever made, but with that being said, there are only a couple of films that have made me laugh with tears coming out of my eyes, and there are, not just one, or two but three moments that do exactly that, one of them is the infamous scene toilet scene. <br/><br/>The film slightly drags near the ending and gets a bit dull, but the supporting cast is good, including Lauren Holly who plays Mary Sawnson, the love interest of both Lloyd and Harry, mainly Lloyd who considered her the love of his life after he drives her to the airport as his job as a limo driver. She is the reason why the dimwits decide to take a road trip to see her after she purposefully leaves her briefcase at the airport. Mike Starr is also a bright spot and has humorous moments with Carrey and Daniels. <br/><br/>I firmly believe this film is a comedic gem and absolutely deserves to in the Hall of Fame of all time great comedies or at least be mentioned or in the conversation. For film to be this stupid, but to also be so funny with all the gags clicking and everything firing in right cylinders, it is impossible to resist. It's one of Jim Carrey's best film's as well as Jeff Daniels. <br/><br/>8.5/10"
"zardoz-13","8","1","2","14 November 2014"," The Farce Is With Lloyd & Harry
","As the Farrelly Brothers' freshman foray into lowest common denominator comedy, ""Dumb and Dumber"" lives up to its dim-witted title. The humor is strictly of the adolescent, simple-minded, scatological variety, with pratfalls galore. Nevertheless, you'll your sphincter will dilate because you'll laugh so hard at this farcical inanity that you'll have a bowel movement. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels topline as the eponymous morons on a road-trip from Rhode Island to Colorado to deliver an abandoned attaché case crammed with loot that cute heroine Lauren Holly left deliberately behind at the airport on her way to Aspen. When goofy limo driver Carrey does a good deed by latching onto the luggage that the girl of his dreams tried to hand off inconspicuously at the airport terminal, hi-jinks ensue with our harebrained heroes struggling to get the luggage back to her. What our clueless cretins don't comprehend is that she deliberately abandoned the luggage stuffed with $100-thousand dollars to ransom her abducted husband. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey of the ""Ace Ventura"" movies) drives a limbo at the outset out and doesn't know the difference between a babe from Austria, much less Australia, and surmises that she is from New Jersey. This woebegone wiseacre is pals with a dog groomer who has converted his ride into the biggest sight gag in the movie. Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels of ""Gettysburg"") shares the same dream with Lloyd about embarking as entrepreneurs in the business of worm farming. ""I've got worms,"" Lloyd gleefully informs his horrified limo customer, Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), about his aspirations. Meantime, two thoroughly reprehensible thugs trail them across country. Joe Mentalino (Mike Starr of ""Clockers"") and J.P. Shay (Karen Duffy of ""Reality Bites"") are the ruffians in pursuit. Joe suffers from an ulcer, and he lacks a shred of sympathy. After Shay and he break into Harry's apartment to retrieve the valise, Joe twists the head off Harry's pet parakeet Petey. Nevertheless, our heroes manage to eliminate them without realizing the hellacious trouble that they are in. Joe decides to masquerade as a man whose car has broken down on the highway so he can hitch a ride with them. He goes more than he bargained for in the process. The scene at restaurant later on concludes with his demise as the consequence of a prank that Lloyd and Harry play on him. The sight gags are terrific, especially the headlights and Harry's mutt truck, with Carrey and Daniels doing their best 'two stooges' act, and the Farrellys doling out irreverent as well as uneven politically-incorrect humor. The scene when Harry urinates on Lloyd while they are cruising up to Aspen in freezing weather is amusing because like everything else in ""Dumb and Dumber"" is about incongruity. Our heroes make Forrest Gump look like Albert Einstein. The prequel that followed not long afterward was amusing but it flopped. A belated but side-splitting sequel surfaced 20 years later, with Carrey and Daniels reprising their roles respectively as Lloyd and Harry. The labored gag when Lloyd has to relieved himself with nowhere else to go than a collection of beer bottles and a cop stops them and decides to sample one of their open container is funny, too. To their credit neither actor behave like everything that they are doing is amusing, and Carrey took the cap off one of his front teeth for comic effect. Mind you, this isn't the Farrelly Brothers' best work, but you can see the seeds of their future."

","Well what can I say this film had me in tears of laughter every time I see it on the TV screen. It's got madcap charcthers,silly plot,over the top humor AND its got enough laughs for the entire family. So what is it about well two men played by Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey are two dim- witted guys who have to go to Aspen to give back a suitcase belonging to a woman called Mary played by Lauren Holly,with whom Loyd(Carrey)is in love with,little does he know that she is a married woman who's husband went missing and she needs the money that's inside the suitcase to get him back. Along the way the two men end up meeting a mafia guy who has a stomach ulcer,a guy who spat on Harry's burger at the diner(Daniels is Harry btw),a cop who thought Harry and Loyd were drinking whiskey that's really urine,a cop who's undercover as a woman who got dumped,the list goes on and on. But for what its worth Dumb and Dumber maybe the best comedy of all time and quite frankly the ONLY ONE on this PLANET that makes me laugh out loud. Now the comedies that we have today suck BIG TIME and the jokes aren't even funny,in fact there overused now and the actors that are in the comedies now like Robert Downey Jr in Due Date,Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Franchise,heck even the other comedies from this decade don't live up to this film at all.<br/><br/>All I have to say is roll on Dumb And Dumber II and hopefully it will be as funny as the original. <br/><br/>Im giving this a 10/10 it may not suit some but if your looking for some madcap comedy and loves Jim Carrey's old school movies then check it out."

"joshua-halstead","7","1","2","19 November 2012"," Fitting Title
","Dumb and Dumber serves it title well. Before Jim Carrey began starring in dramedies such as ""Yes Man"" and ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"" he was known exclusively for his ridiculously over-the-top stupid humor which was made known first in ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective."" While immature antics tend to grow old quickly, the duo of Carrey and Daniels is immensely funny, and somewhat original. Admittedly the shenanigans and irreverent humor is at times quite annoying, but it is redeemed by nearly perfect satires, and well-rounded one-liners. Though it remains very mild language wise for the most part, these is nearly pervasive crude and sexual humor, some of which are highly inappropriate. Between pervasive crude and sexual humor, scenes with nudity, some dang close to graphic nudity, the primary focus of sex and farts, and tons of stupid humor. If you are in to that sort of thing it is great. The movie is hysterically funny, but way over the top. It's a stupid, dirty classic."
"Desertman84","10","1","2","2 October 2012"," A Movie That Lives Up To Its Name
","Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles in this genially low- brow comedy which can also be classified as a celebration of stupidity in this film entitled,Dumb And Dumber.The story is about the not-so- dynamic duo of Lloyd and Harry, dunderheads who come into the possession of a briefcase containing ransom money that is intended for Mob- connected kidnappers. Lauren Holly costars as the woman who lost the briefcase, and with whom Carrey falls in love with.It was written and directed by the Farrelly brothers.<br/><br/>Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place.The guys also have a certain problem holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson,who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight. Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog, and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. <br/><br/>This is a relentlessly stupid comedy elevated by its main actors. Jim Carrey goes bonkers and Jeff Daniels carries himself admirably in an against-type performance.The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.Finally,it is definitely a movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors."

","I'm surprised this didn't win any Oscars. The acting is amazing and the comedy is funny to the extreme. Daniels and Carrey are incredibly stupid that your IQ may drop while watching this; but you won't care because you'll be laughing yourself silly. Carrey plays a limo driver who is astonished at seeing Lauren Holly when he's supposed to take her to the airport. When he does, she leaves a brief case behind and Carrey rushes to give it back to her, but its too late. So he takes his roommate and best friend, equally dumb Jeff Daniels to Aspen to return the briefcase to Holly. What they don't know is that the brief case is full of ransom money and Holly's husband will be killed if the money isn't given to the ones holding the ransom.The quest to give back the briefcase, plus what happens before and after is completely unforgettable."
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","2","7 January 2012"," Much funnier that you would expect
","I remember when this movie was first released: there was a lot of hype surrounding it and it was the movie that everybody went and saw. It still is a very popular movie (at the time of writing, being the mid to late nineties) and I do think that it is quite funny. Dumb and Dumber seems to be a movie that you either love or you hate. I enjoy it and at some points in this movie I actually find it quite funny.<br/><br/>A young lady named Mary Swanson is picked up by Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carey) and taken to the airport. Lloyd falls in love with her and treats her as a long lost friend. Mary has other things on her mind, such as her kidnapped husband and the ransom. She leaves a brief case of money in the airport but Lloyd sees it, thinks that she has left it behind, and rushes up and takes it before the crooks can lay their hands on it.<br/><br/>The crooks then try to get the money back while Christmas and his friend decide to travel across America to Aspen to find Mary Swanson and return the money to her. Thus Dumb and Dumber becomes a road movie, though quite a funny one. They set the jokes up quite well and then execute them even better. The comedy is a mix of slapstick and toilet humour, with some dumb jokes thrown it.<br/><br/>The main characters are simply idiots. They do not think about what they do, but more so they say things that we consider to be really stupid. Then there is the comedy of ignorance. The two idiots don't realise that they have stumbled into a kidnapping case and the crims think that the idiots are FBI agents who are constantly one step ahead.<br/><br/>I consider that Dumb and Dumber is a very clever movie that is thematically dry. It is a plot driven movie and was made for laughs and money. I guess that it emphasises the stupid side of us and in a way we are laughing at ourselves. It is a movie that takes our stupid side and over inflates it. Things such as the dead parakeet being sold to the blind boy. It is not something that we would expect to happen, but it shows up the side of us that wants to rip off those who are less fortunate. There is the scene where Lloyd meets Mary and instantly falls in love with her. Though this is blown out of proportion, it reveals to us the way we will fall in love with people that we do not know.<br/><br/>It also reveals the side of us that makes unsupported assumptions. Such as the crooks thinking that Carey and Daniels are very sophisticated and intelligent private detectives or FBI agents, when we know that they are really just a couple of twits. This shows us up as we tend to jump to illogical conclusions and they do tend to be the opposite.<br/><br/>I really enjoy this movie. It is funny, witty, and quite smooth. It is one that you either love or hate. I don't love it, but do enjoy watching it every so often."

","Basically if you watch this movie and you don't fall over laughing there is more then likely something very wrong with you!!! CLASSIC!!! This is Jim Carrey at his finest. There are more hilarious lines in this movie then maybe all other comedies I can think of combined! Jeff Daniels usually known for serious or dramatic movies also plays off his character extremely well! But especially if you are a Jim Carrey fan this is him at his absolute finest just the faces he makes in re action are hilarious...

"theshadowoftheghost","10","1","2","11 December 2011"," Perfect comedy.
","This is Jim Carrey at his peak and will not be, since it is very much him doing what is completely HIM, to everyone's taste. But you are surely the one person who has made a mistake if you've watched this film and disliked it without realising it's called ""Dumb and Dumber""?. I will TRY and keep this brief (impossible), but this is one of my all-time favourite films and for good reason. The same way I have given Lord of the Rings the title of my favourite fantasy adventure movie, Star Wars the Sci-Fi favourite, and so on and so on, is the same way I put this among my top-ten of comedies ever. The duo of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels is one of the best comedy match-ups since John Candy and Steve Martin. Both are dumb as each other in equally dumb ways but this truly is NOT a ""dumb"" movie. It's heart-warming, ridiculous and it's a proper journey of friendship and male-bonding. I won't go into the plot, but imagine the best road trip you could ever go on with your best mate, filled with memories you will never soon forget (for better or worse). THAT is this film.<br/><br/>The comedic timing is perfect. The choreography captures the scenery beautifully as they trawl from Rhode Island to Aspen, and I don't think the Farrelly brothers have ever made a film as great as this. I mean, the humour is perfect. The crass and gross moments aren't tastelessly done like in something like American Pie or some teen flick, this is smart yet incredibly thick! If you don't cry laughing at the kind of scrapes these two get themselves into, you've dislocated your funny bone. And serious applause is due to Daniels who isn't overshadowed by Carrey. As a big Carrey fan, I've never found anyone as funny or able to pull off dumb and wacky humour the way he is, but Daniels is the only person I've ever seen who works in perfect harmony with him, and with Jim being the big man of comedy himself, that is no easy feat. Daniels, I truly commend you for that. He confessed he never did a film like this, ever. And for someone I will always remember for Arachnophobia, he was outstanding and I could not imagine a better casting choice. A real shocker of a role for him, but acted flawlessly. The laughs just keep coming, and it tugs at your heartstrings at just the right moments.<br/><br/>As a side note, the soundtrack is also a great selection of memorable tracks that suit each mood accurately and work very well with the action on screen.<br/><br/>There's really not a bad thing I can say about this film. If you haven't seen it, well... You're dumber than dumb."

","I would have to agree with other reviewers which have Dumb and Dumber up there with one of the funniest movies of all time. This is a hysterical movie.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that it starts funny and keeps the laughs coming for the duration of the movie. I often find that comedy movies will have a few funny bits (which usually feature in the promotional clip) and very little else.<br/><br/>While the humour in Dumb and Dumber is always in pretty bad taste, it is very hard not to laugh. The best parts of the movie for me were the restaurant scene which turns into a bloodthirsty kung fu fight and the scene where Harry and Mary are playing in the snow together and decide to make a snowman. There are plenty of other highlights - for example eating chilli dogs with the hit-man, the collection of outfits Lloyd and Harry wear, particularly to the fund raising event.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the movie is that it does not make any attempt to teach any sort of moral. Often humorous movies will try to teach a moral, maybe in some vain attempt by the director to justify having made the movie in the first place. However no such attempt is made in Dumb and Dumber - the two central characters start the movie as shallow, bitter weirdo's and that is exactly how they finish up."
"frances59","9","1","2","20 September 2009"," New Footage and Extras are Nice, But You'll Want to Own the Original as Well
","This Unrated Version finally gives the DVD fans what they want -- 6 minutes of additional footage, two alternate endings, and some making-of bonus features. At least... we thought we wanted an ""unrated"" version. The problem is, the original was consider a classic in its day, that adding six more minutes of footage (sprinkeled around a number of scenes) really breaks up the almost-brilliant pacing that fans loved from the original film. The footage added also makes this basically an R-rated film now, with what we would call ""strong sexuality"" (without given away the jokes. It was nice to see the extra footage, even if it is a little more risqué, but the original PG-13 rating really suits the movie better (and younger teens can watch it without hearing jokes that parents think are too strong). Missing is any kind of audio commentary, and the complete absence of Jim Carrey in the bonus material is rather strange. Swartzenegger was available for the bonus' in the first Conan movie when it got re-released on DVD, so why didn't the studio at least try to wait for Carrey to have some free time. If you're a fan like me, and can almost recite EVERY line from memory, seeing this Uncut Version will be a nice treat, especially when it come to the extras (though everything fits on only 1 disc, so we don't get a whole lot of content). I liked seeing the extra footage, but as soon as I finished this new version, I went online and bought the original PG-13 DVD -- because that's the film that I loved and memorized years ago. Extra footage is nice, and a few sections of the Deleated Scenes are really funny, but they really did leave the funniest stuff in the original version. Still, buy this version for the extras, but buy the original on DVD as well. That's the version that will always be a classic, no matter how much time passes."
"agustin11","9","1","2","10 September 2009"," A Masterpiece By Carrey
","Carrey's delivery always surpasses just funny or just professional and is subtley maniacle in perfection. There aren't many movies that can make your ribs hurt from laughing, and it takes a certain subtlety in the comedy to push you over the edge into histerics, but that is exactly what you have in Dumb and Dumber. There were some parts that I had to rewind and watch again half a dozen times just to salvage the subtlety of Carrey's hilarious delivery. Carrey is certainly the focal point of the movie. The plot and his character's side-kick are really just props that Carrey uses to bring about painful laughter in anyone watching, (and I'm sure he is responsible for thousands of people choking on their drink whilst watching this movie). The two main characters in the movie are losers living together with an ambition to save up and start a pet store selling worm-farms. The tongue-in-cheek sentimental scene with Carrey and his friend talking about whether to go to Aspen and return a briefcase to a girl or not is hilarious as Carrey's friend shouts, ""I say we just find some work and scrape together the cash to start up the worm store"", (I'm sure it was Carrey that was responsible for the idea of the two character's enterprise being in selling worm farms). Carrey's character says to a woman he is attracted to being driven in his taxi/limo ""I've got worms"". Only afterwards does he explain that that will be the name of his and his pal's pet store. Another hilarious scene is the dream sequence in which Carrey's loser character fantasises and imagines the girl really liking him. He fights waiters as one of them started kissing the girl's arm, and Carrey uses a kung-fu set that made my ribs hurt with laughter. One of the best things about Jim Carrey's comedy is that he seems to be an expert in a number of areas, probably having carefully practiced for years to get his art to where it is here, and he also always has an intelligence about his work, making use of cliché hyperbolically at times in just the right way and often using a very classical style that is truly mastered."

"OwainBevan","9","1","2","9 September 2007"," The best comedy of the nineties.
","1994 was quite a year for Jim Carrey. Coming right on the back of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Mask came this comic masterpiece. Dumb & Dumber tells the story of Lloyd Christmas (Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Daniels), two idiots from Providence, Rhode Island, who get caught up in a cross-country kidnapping plot after Lloyd falls in love. Lloyd is a more down-to-earth character than those Carrey played in his previous two movies, but still posses the same slightly manic, almost childlike humour for which Carrey was now world famous. I found 'loveable loser' Lloyd Christmas a much more endearing and engaging character than Ace Ventura. Additionally, Dumb & Dumber was more story-driven and was instrumental in Carrey's development as a character actor, rather than just a comic-actor. Though Carrey was the star of the movie for most people, it would be hugely unfair to allow him to overshadow what was an excellent performance from Jeff Daniels. Proving his versatility as an actor, Daniels, who normally plays fairly serious or family roles, showed what a good comic actor he could be. Though Harry was by no means the straight-guy, his more laid back character, and occasional moment of clarity was just enough to keep their adventure on the road. Easily one of the best comedies of the nineties and, in my opinion, definitely Jim Carrey's best film of that decade.<br/><br/>My favourite moment: When Lloyd attempts to board a plane that isn't there and spirals off the end of the skyway.<br/><br/>My favourite quote: ""The first time I set eyes on Mary Swanson, I just got that old fashioned romantic feeling...where I'd do anything to bone her.""<br/><br/>Worth a mention: The late Joe Baker as Bernard. Always good to see obscure British actors show up in major Hollywood movies!<br/><br/>Owain Bevan"

","This movie is the most hilarious movie in the world. Dumb and Dumber is filled with great gags and many, many laughs that I still laugh at. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are an awesome pair. I never get tired of seeing those two acting like complete morons. It may be kind of gross at times but that's what makes this movie so funny. I have seen this movie probably 20+ times. I don't care what anyone says, this is the funniest movie ever. Some may say Animal House or Airplane or Caddyshack but I say Dumb and Dumber. Some people would say that the greatest pair in movie history would be Wayne and Garth or Bill and Tedd but I say Harry and Lloyd.

The fact that these two guys simply don't get it could not be more apparent, making them the best duo in any comedy I've ever seen.<br/><br/>From the out-set everything that happens to these two seems entirely real, and by the end your laughing about the events as if it they happened to two of your idiot friends.<br/><br/>So, don't slam the movie for having ""dumb humor"", get your buddies together, put it on, and enjoy the laughs."

Jim Carey is his usual hilarious self, probably at his rubber-faced best in this movie, but it's Jeff Daniels as the extremely moronic Harry that steals the movie. Whether it is putting a carrot and two cotton balls on a snow man at his ''waist'' instead of as a nose and two eyes or whether it is lighting himself on fire, Harry will make you laugh as hard as you ever have.

","This movie is a great movie. I saw Dumb & Dumberer before this, and it only made me respect this movie more. It is an excellent comedy that hasn't been so true to the genre in years. Another good thing is that it is one of the longer comedies. I mean, yes there are comedies that are over 2 hours, but nowadays, it seems like there's a rule: comedies may NOT exceed 90 minutes, as every comedy I've seen recently is a completely short movie besides Click, where if you only count the comedy part, though, it's about 69 minutes. Another good thing is the choice of actors. Jim Carrey was great for this. Not only is he one of my favorite actors, but he is just plain funny. So if you have 100 minutes of spare time, I recommend this movie. I rated this movie 10, but I'd rate this 20 if I could."

It is supposed to be stupid and dumb, the name already suggests that and if you're still saying that it is stupid you are dumber than I thought.<br/><br/>Staring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as Lloyd and Harry; the two best friends are on the road trip to see Lloyd dream girl Mary; along the way they face many adventures.<br/><br/>This is without doubt one of the funniest movie, involving almost everything Â– kidnapping, stupidity, love triangle, friendship, road trip, girl, murderer and twisted joke. The cast is brilliant, I don't think it can be any better; Jim and Jeff are superbly funny and their acting is second to none. And the joke and the situation is a killer, the movie is consistently funny throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie seems to be well thought and is a great flow and balance. And though the directing and all the technical work are averagely done it doesn't stop Jim and Jeff to delivered all that humor.<br/><br/>I still can remember when it first came out in '94s and how hard I laugh the first time I watch it.

","Dumb and Dumber is, and always shall be, the funniest movie on the face of the earth, and any other planet who's surface it might grace. From the opening credits, with everything misspelled to the riotously ridiculous theme song, ""Boomshakalaka"", to the final frame of Jim Carrey's and Jeff Daniels's retarded backsides, this movie inspires awe, wonder, and tears of laughter and of the pain from falling out of whatever you might have been sitting in. Nearly every piece of dialog in the entire movie has comedic intent, and it all works. From Lloyd's very first conversation, ""My that's a lovely accent, New Jersey?"" ""Austria"" ""Austria! Well, good day mate, let's put another shrimp on the barbie!"" to the last sentimental yet stupid line of the movie, brilliance unlike anything ever seen before is shown in the writing. Every actor plays their role perfectly. The good guys are unrealistically dumb, but the bad guys are perfect. They're not over the top and they're just bad enough to make us know they're the enemy, but we never get swept up in what they're doing. This movie is all about the 2 man wrecking ball of Harry and Lloyd. I am confident this thing will endure beyond any other movie, and on my dying day of April 4th, 2050, I will watch this movie and laugh my butt off one last time before going to the white light. It's that good. If you have not seen this movie at least 5 times, watch it again for all our sakes, and catch the last 30 jokes you missed in the first four viewings, due to you laughing over them. 10 out of 10"

","Postmodernism and Poop Jokes: Dumb and Dumber and the Collapse of ""High"" Art (abridged version)<br/><br/>Ninety years ago Marcel Duchamp printed his name on a white porcelain urinal. In the winter of 2004 that urinal was named the most influential work of modern art by five-hundred of London's top art experts beating out Matisse, Andy Warhol and Picasso for the top spot. Naturally many found the decision, ""a bit of a shock"" but some came to realize that Duchamp's urinal, ""reflects the dynamic nature of art today and the idea that the creative process that goes into a work of art is the most important thing. The work itself can...take any form"" (World's Best..., 1). In 1917 critics and audiences alike were appalled by Duchamp's urinal, but today our culture embraces this postmodern fusion of ""high"" art with ""low"" art. The Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber (1994) could be considered the ""Duchamp urinal"" of the 1990's. Once again critics had a hard time embracing the Farrelly Bros.' use of ""low"" culture. They still saw cinema as an art-form that should represent a sort of sophisticated entertainment. Although many critics abhorred the film, the box office success and widespread pop-cultural acclaim of Dumb and Dumber suggest that postmodern films should be judged by the postmodern audience rather than the critics.<br/><br/>In an interview with Mr. Daniels, Leon Harris asks, ""Is this your kind of humor? Is this the kind of thing you'd watch when you want to go out and see something funny?"" in an attempt to understand how such a qualified actor could sink so low (Daniels, 2). Daniels responds with, ""I know that I am ready for...an hour and a half of nothing but laughs, and if movies like Dumb and Dumber can do that, then I think that has value."" (Daniels, 2).<br/><br/>Daniels defends his decision to star in the film and also questions the role of comedy in the artistic world. He recognizes that the Academy Awards tend to favor serious dramatic films that evoke deep thoughts rather than lowbrow comedies that simply cause laughter. He essentially exposes this bias that exists within the critical world that favors sophistication over anti-intellectualism. Does the fact that Dumb and Dumber won the MTV Movie Award in 1995 but was never considered for an Oscar nomination mean that it was a complete failure? Who is to say one human being's opinion is more valid than another's? While some might have seen Harry the dog groomer as a step down for Daniels, his involvement with both ""low"" and ""high"" forms of entertainment demonstrate this flexibility that the postmodern era embraces.<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber was released on December 16, 1994 and within a few days had become the second biggest December box office opening in Hollywood history (DeRosa, 1). Apparently though, there is quite a market for ""incredibly dumb"" comedies about two friends on a road trip to Aspen. The general audience had spoken and $127 million speaks louder than a handful of negative reviews.<br/><br/>Headlines for online user comments read, ""Best Comedy Ever, Painfully Funny, Pure Laughter, Oh Admit it You Love This Movie, If You Don't Like This Movie You're an Insufferable Bore, etc."" (User Ratings, 1). Though there are some negative comments strewn about, it is nothing like the critical reviews in magazines and newspapers. Out of over thirty-five thousand user comments, there are only seven-thousand people that graded Dumb and Dumber as average or below (a score of 5 and below on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the best). This means that eighty percent of the people that voted scored Dumb and Dumber above average. Also, about one-third of the voters scored the film with either a nine or a ten. This data illustrates a vast difference between general audience member opinions and critical reviews. After the release of Dumb and Dumber, Bobby Farrelly said, ""We fully expect to get ripped apart by the critics, but we didn't make it for the critics"" (Dermody, 1). Again the question arises of whether or not a handful of critics know what is best for postmodern audiences.<br/><br/>The human being is a complex organism that can enjoy an opera one moment and laugh at a fart joke the next. Recently the latter tendency has been capitalized upon, but the critic chooses to focus on the ""finer"" things in art and culture. Postmodernism attempts to blend these two spheres of the human mind into one while modernism denies its other half. If we follow the modernist assumption that science and technology will lead to a fuller understanding of life than we find ourselves in a bit of a bind. If we study Darwinism and the process of Evolution to find that we, the human species, the children of the Enlightenment are in reality children of apes, the idea that we should only respond to ""high"" culture and sophistication is absurd. Millions of years later we still have some of these animal instincts that tell us to laugh at Jim Carrey when he makes a funny face or attempts to wash his mouth out with ketchup and mustard. Some try to cover up these instincts and pretend that sophistication and intellectualism come naturally to humans. If this were the case babies would be born with calculators and paperback copies of Madame Bovary. This is not to say that we should all revert to living in caves and hunting with spears, but we should also remember that we are one chromosome away from being chimpanzees. If Dumb and Dumber does have a message, it is to never become so serious that you cannot laugh at yourself."

","Well it may not be Fellini, but it certainly takes an iron stomach not laugh at arguably, The Farrelly brothers most rib-tickling movie to date. Jim Carrey does his stuff like only he knows how, but it is Dumb, rather than Dumber, who takes the biggest plaudits. Jeff Daniels makes mince meat out of some of the scripts best lines (""She fed me some crap about not listening to her, I dunno, I wasn't really paying attention""). There are wonderful site gags (checkout Lloyd's plunge onto the airport floor) and magnificently delivered lines. Some of the material doesn't leave much in the way of subtlety (one moment involving a toilet and a laxative), but as crude humour goes, it's hard to fault. And unlike so many comedies before it, D & D manages to stay true to its material until the very end, eschewing soppy feel goods for dumb, and then some. I haven't laughed this much since I saw The Quest For The Holy Grail, and I do not say that lightly."

Loaded with sight gags,verbal humor,toilet humor,pratfalls,cross-ups,mix-ups and perfect timing,this film employs just about every level of film comedy and makes practically all of them work.<br/><br/>The story is almost pedantic and non-essential:two hopelessly half-witted buddies,Harry and Lloyd(the very adept Jeff Daniels and the very comfortable-in-the genre Jim Carrey)agree to travel cross country to return the briefcase that a fare who Lloyd(a chauffeur) taxied to the airport ""lost"" at the terminal. Of course,they are not aware that the briefcase was intended as a ""drop"" for a hostage situation where the fare,a lovely redhead named MAry(perennial straight woman Lauren Holly),was to ransom her kidnapped husband. Naturally,Lloyd and Harry's meddling throws the hostage development into chaos,but not before the dim-witted duo get into various forms of trouble along the way. <br/><br/>ONe should have a strong stomach while viewing this,as was the case with most pre-""Shallow Hal"" Farrelly Brothers(who wrote and directed in tandem)films.

"Angry_Arguer","Null","1","2","25 July 2003"," Vacation with Beavis & Butt-Head
","Dumb and Dumber is just that, a stupid movie without purpose.  Dr. Strangelove mixes a message with its parodizing view of the world.  The Breakfast Club combines an adolescent fantasy world of detention with the stereotypical self-discovery element.  Monty Python has an edge due to the typical Python wit, that's all I can say about it.<br/><br/>Dumb & Dumber is no more than an enhanced, live-action Beavis & Butt-Head cartoon.  All the same pitfalls and baloney circumstances you'd expect from them are here.  Also, the movie goes too long for its own good and winds up being what I call a 'watch checker', wherein you are checking your watch every 45 seconds while thinking ""Is this EVER going to end?""  As much as I enjoy Jim Carrey in Liar Liar and The Mask, his work here is too annoying to be fun (he couldn't POSSIBLY intend on being this annoying).  Jeff Daniels gets my sympathies for getting cast into this movie, I guess there was nothing he could do other than live off the profits from SPEED.<br/><br/>Overall, save yourself some time and just rent episodes of Beavis & Butt-Head or National Lampoon's Vacation for the same effect in your brain. The movie tries too hard to be funny and stupid and, as the saying goes: ""The harder you try, the dumber you look.""  The ending was the only high point because it solidified how self-centered and incompetent our 'heroes' are.  1.5 out of 5 stars."

","Jim Carrey is absolutely incredible at physical slapstick. I feel a bit more uneasy when Jim Carrey plays ""smart"" parts such as the Riddler or when he wears ""The Mask"" but in all out slapstick he is perfect and goes way beyond his ""inspriation"": Jerry Lewis.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels did a wonderful job because he is usually cast as a mild mannered likeable guy. He reminds me a bit of Daniel Stern in the ""Home alone"" series. Of course in both cases the ""likeable guy"" comes out a bit. And then again: why not? <br/><br/>The parts involving the ""pretty girl"" are usually very painful to watch in these kind of movies. Something's just not right when we see romance and our ""heroes"" making fools of themselves at the same time. Maybe it's because many of us see themselves a bit in this situation. We can trace this problem back to ""Laurel and Hardy: Way out West"" and most likely even further back.<br/><br/>
I like the attention to detail: How come these two dumb guys can drive a Lamborghini that smoothly? They both are seen having jobs as drivers at the start. I also like the fact that the movie doesn't fall into romance near the end or any ""they have the heart of gold"" routine. <br/><br/>I love the choice of clothes when they use up the money in the suitcase. Now that is really such a bad taste that it is way cool again :-)<br/><br/>Great movie, as has been said before not for all tastes, but a great movie anyway."

I normally can't stand brainless gross-out comedies, but this one I found just twisted and edgy enough to make me laugh. <br/><br/>Unlike most fans, however, I didn't find Jim Carrey all that funny. As with ACE VENTURA (which I hated), he bugs his eyes, waves his arms, screams, flails, and seems to think he's simply hilarious, when he's actually little more than amusing (if not a tad annoying). <br/><br/>The highlight of this movie is Jeff Daniels. He's done comedy before, but never this broad, as he usually plays the straight man to someone else. Here, though, he turns in a brilliant comic performance that blows Carrey off the screen. The infamous diarrhea scene could have simply been nothing more than a gross potty humor joke for eight year olds, but Daniels turns it into a slapstick masterpiece that would make Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards proud. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the success of this movie (and Daniels' newfound popularity because of it) led him to star in such lame-brained romps as TRIAL AND ERROR, 101 DALMATIONS and MY FAVORITE MARTIAN. Hopefully he'll get back on track and do some real acting again. But DUMB AND DUMBER, like it or not, will forever be one of his very best performances."

"eragonbookfan","2","2","8","13 October 2014"," ""Rocketman"" >>>>> ""Dumb and Dumber""
","First off, I'm a HUGE fan of comedies - just see my IMDb list called ""Funniest & Most Hilarious Movies ever""; films like ""Rocketman"" (starring Harland Williams) & ""Groundhog Day"" (starring Bill Murray) which are genuinely funny, family-friendly, and have got appropriate humor in them. And kind of a guilty pleasure but I do like ""Gigli"" for a few reasons, too (Never understood all the bashing & hate).<br/><br/>But THIS??? Judging by the poster, it seemed like a flick that was gonna be horrendously dumb, awful, and stupid. I WASN'T WRONG!<br/><br/>Did those who've written glowing reviews of Dumb & Dumber see the same movie I did?? Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels have done some great movies, but this is not one of them! Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. But it's an astounding PUTRID dumb film, and a complete waste of celluloid, IMO.<br/><br/>Though to be fair, the scene where Harry slams the bathroom door in the face of the guy who's gonna... *ahem*... RAPE Lloyd, in order to put out the fire on his foot, was kinda funny. Even with some of the worst movies you could giggle a bit.<br/><br/>Understand. ""Nostalgic"" doesn't mean ""better"" - it just means you're more attached to it. <br/><br/>It boggles my mind that Carrey is one of the highest paid actors out there. This movie, and the one he appeared in before it (""Ace Ventura""), are unbelievably awful & overrated. These films utilize slapstick/absurdest humor, as opposed to Carrey's running gag of distorted faces and talking out of his butt. Plus, him having a chipped tooth is NOT FUNNY! Oftentimes I felt like saying, ""What the &%$#@? are you doing???"" The characters of Lloyd and Harry are an INSULT to your intelligence! Even if you liked their brand of humor, wouldn't it get old after 30 minutes or so??? My advice: I recommend you go watch Jim Carrey's ""The Grinch"" or Jeff Daniel's ""101 Dalmatians"" - they play much more convincing & less annoying characters than in this.<br/><br/>But this overrated film was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. The story as a whole was difficult to follow, due to the two acting like a distracting fools most of the film. This movie is about a briefcase that never gets mentioned again, bad language, abuse for women, violent homosexuality, gross-out humor, annoying humor, bad pop-culture references, jealousy, unfunny/nonsensical humor, inappropriate humor, and generally other things that I particularly don't want to watch. It's basically a film that tries WAY TOO HARD! And the ending was just awful, left a bad taste in my mouth, being the last nail in the coffin of this bad movie. Long story short, ""The Mask"" was the only ""good"" Jim Carrey film that came out in 1994.<br/><br/>I'm all-round so glad I didn't grow up with this flick; because if I had, I would've likely lost HALF OF MY BRAIN if I did! I would just like it to have my memory erased for acknowledging it exists!<br/><br/>Overall, this one is a real dud in my opinion, I give it 3/10<br/><br/>PS: Happy 20th anniversary... NOT!"

","Hoping to return an abandoned briefcase to a beautiful woman he drove to the airport, a limousine driver takes his best friend on a cross country trip, unaware that he is being pursued by angry kidnappers in this comedy starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. As per the title, the running gag is that the friends are incredibly stupid - and oblivious to the fact that the briefcase contains a hefty ransom. The film gets its best laughs from the kidnappers coming to believe that the pair are highly trained assassins and criminal masterminds; their ignorance towards being pursued is also often funny with the pair leaving a note to the ""gas man"", which the kidnappers think is written to them and so on. What does not work so well are the simple scenes of the pair acting stupid. From blowing their noses on $100 bills to getting their tongues stuck on cold surfaces, it is all pretty groan-inducing stuff. There is an overabundance of toilet humour too (the cop taking a drink scene is very funny though). Daniels also gets far better laughs than Carrey. The way Daniels manages to keep a straight face while saying things like his pet bird's ""head fell off"" is far more amusing than Carrey's excessive mugging. Thorns and all though, this is entertaining stuff while it lasts. The gags may vary in effectiveness but the leads are always vibrant and full of energy with a very genuine chemistry between them."

","This movie to me is the exact opposite of what the title and the plot suggest. It is hysterically funny, but it's not so much the jokes that make you laugh, but the wicked and wildly optimistic humor they are rooted in. <br/><br/>We see two guys acting totally stupid all of the time. Why doesn't it become boring after five minutes? Because all this dumbness is not shown to generate cheap laughs. The jokes point to something deeper, something more substantial and important for our lives. The final scene, which left me gasping for breath, makes it totally clear: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Which may be translated into our daily lives as: relax, and trust yourself to find your individual path to happiness - so what, if you look dumb to your fellow men! I love this movie."

","Released in 1994, ""Dumb and Dumber"" stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as best friends and likable morons; one's a limo drive and the other a dog groomer who drives a silly dogmobile. The former falls in love with a client (Lauren Holly) and the duo chase her to Aspen, CO, to bring her a brief case that she (intentionally) left behind. Meanwhile, gangsters who want the briefcase follow them with intent to kill (Mike Starr and Karen Duffy). Teri Garr and Charles Rocket are also on hand.<br/><br/>I was hoping for a funny and entertaining flick in the manner of ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""The Mask,"" both released the same year as ""Dumb and Dumber,"" but, unfortunately, ""Dumb and Dumber"" just isn't that funny. There are a couple laugh-out-loud scenes, like the karate fight, but most of the jokes either fall flat or are so dumb they're not funny (and I'm speaking as one who likes dumb humor – GOOD dumb humor). Another thing that didn't appeal to me was the potty jokes, which also weren't funny. Thankfully, there are a few things that make the film worth checking out, like the camaraderie of the two protagonists, Holly's incredible beauty, the road-trip element and the great locations.<br/><br/>The original film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Providence, Rhode Island; Pennsylvania; Nebraska; Utah; and Colorado. I haven't seen the unrated version and don't want to since it adds a bunch of tasteless or gross bits, like the guy spitting into the burger and worse.<br/><br/>GRADE: Borderline C/C- (4.5 out of 10 Stars)"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","3","24 June 2012"," A Dumb Comedy with A lot of Brains
","Dumb and Dumber (1994)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Idiots and best friends Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) travel from the East Coast to Aspen so that Lloyd can give a briefcase to the woman (Lauren Holly) he's fallen in love with. The two don't realize that they've just gotten involved in a kidnapping plot. DUMB AND DUMBER is obviously a pretty dumb movie with one dumb thing after another happening but it's also one of the smartest comedies in the past few decades. I think anyone could have made a movie about dumb people as they do it all the time but the writing here was just so perfect that you can't help but be drawn into Lloyd and Harry's world as they get into one problem after another. A large portion of the credit has to go to Carrey and Daniels for delivering two excellent performances. It's not easy playing dumb but these two do it so well that it would be impossible for any other actors to fit these roles. Carrey, the maniac, does a very good job at playing Lloyd for this moron who never knows when to give up. Daniels, I think the smarter of the two, manages to sometimes be ahead of his friend but the way the actor plays almost like a big brother was extremely fun. The two of them have perfect chemistry together and the majority of the jokes wouldn't work if they hadn't, one, nailed their performances and two, worked so well together. Holly does a good job looking pretty and playing it straight to the two idiots but I think Mike Starr is the one who gets overlooked. He's a wonderful character actor and has put his stamp on many great films but the comic timing here was just perfect and the scenes with him and boys are priceless and among the best in the picture. The one flaw with the picture is that it does run a bit too long and especially in its ""uncut"" version. These extra jokes really don't add enough to the film to warrant them be included. Still, DUMB AND DUMBER is one of the better comedies to come from the 90s."
"Chase_Witherspoon","7","1","3","6 June 2012"," Moron bro-mance
","Slightly uneven, yet fitfully funny comedy about an inseparable pair of dimwits (Carrey and Daniels) who stumble upon a brief case full of tainted cash and then attempt to return it to its owner, living in Aspen. Pursued by mobsters, police and hindered by their own incompetence, the pair eventually find Aspen and the owner of the brief-case (Holly - with whom both men become enamoured) only to find themselves unwittingly the target of a murderous extortionist.<br/><br/>There's some great scenes along the way, including the truck-stop bully at the diner, then again in the service station toilet, the patrol officer who takes an ill-advised swig from a tainted beer bottle and though entirely unrelated to the story, the immortal scene where a bus-load (literally) of bikini models offer the pair the dream job as oil-boys. Daniels is surprisingly humorous considering he's not essentially known as a comedian, while Carrey is, fortunately, more restrained than at times in other movies. Teri Garr, Felton Perry and Hank Brandt have minor supporting roles, adding some depth to the cast.<br/><br/>A decent soundtrack developed by Todd Rundgren contains some memorable tunes, not least of all by The Cowsills and Rundgren himself, and the tone of the picture is generally pleasant and easy-going. Nothing too distasteful or gratuitous and so long as you watch it in the right frame of mind, should keep you entertained. There's plenty of conjecture over the tone of the ending - not the crowd-pleaser you might expect - and though frustrating, it's consistent with the narrative and probably just what needed to happen."

I wasn't expecting much (from the movie's title), but the end result turned out to be quite good.<br/><br/>The movie is light entertainment and hit and miss jokes, but like Monty Python, the actors made the material work through good acting. The chemistry between the lead characters was perfect, and there were clever bits such as the dog van ""peeing gas"" and their unwittingly bringing their would-be assassin on the road with them, only to unintentionally have him poison himself.

(Lloyd fell in love with her, you see, while he drove her to the airport.) Along the way they steal from a blind kid, poison a hit-man, and give a motorbike cop a swig of moonshine he'll never forget... And that's before they've even reached Colorado.<br/><br/>Writers and directors the Farrelly Brothers forego the cutesy angst that blunted There's Something About Mary and go flat-out on the sick and the scatological. It's puerile, of course, but Carrey's clown has never had a better home, and Jeff Daniels shows expert comic timing to add to his impressive dramatic range. The script they share is sharp as a shiv, as well as being endlessly quotable. Does the gag count sink ever so slightly in the final reel? Perhaps.

"vipher20","10","1","3","8 August 2008"," Gotta say it.....Greatest comedy ever
","I've never had an easier time giving a 10/10 rating to a movie then this one. After all, when I approach a site that asks my favorite movie...I don't have to think twice......Dumb and Dumber. I guess the truth is, you have to LOVE comedy to truly appreciate this movie. Sure, there are other great comedy movies, but I just feel like no movie really uses every second to other second to make you laugh like Dumb and Dumber does. You have to see the true art of being able to make a pun or underlying joke out of any simple phrase....""Big gulps, huh?"".<br/><br/>If you want to see a clever, well-educated, plot heavy, witty comedy.....go see a Woody Allen movie. If you want to exercise your right to let go, relax, not think too hard about everything, and just LAUGH... this is it. I've been quoting this movie since I was 15, and probably will till I'm at least 50. Anchorman is the closest I've seen to a movie like this that's purely quotable and makes you want to pause the movie just so you can finish laughing before something else makes you feel like you'll throw up from laughter.<br/><br/>I say any movie can really be depressing and dramatic and friggin win an Oscar.....but comedy is an under-appreciated art form. One that makes you feel good. Makes you want to be a fun person. Makes you want to soak up life and take it a little less serious. Since when has an award winning movie like ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" provoked such joyful feelings in a person. The only thing it gave me was an unhealthy interest in Asian women.<br/><br/>This movie is solid gold. There's a reason why nearly every Farrely Brothers movie that comes out uses the tag line ""From the guys who brought you Dumb and Dumber""......cause it set the bar for comedy in a whole new way and those guys are still trying to pull that off again. If you're one of those people that think this movie is stupid...lighten up. Watch it again and WANT to laugh. Enjoy it for what it is and bask in the pure insolent joy that comes with a perfect comedy.<br/><br/>""Well.....see ya later...."""

","I didn't like this one much when it came out, but I've changed my mind. It's a great, funny, very entertaining movie. That said, I'd still hold that it's not anywhere near being the ""best comedy ever"", as claimed by some fanboys here on IMDb, or even the best Farrelly Bros. movie. That would be asking too much, it being, after all, their first feature movie, and as a consequence still a bit rough around the edges. Namely the plot is a bit on the thin side in that it consists of little more than our two likable losers traveling halfway across the US of A (a nomial distance of 2,200 miles, which they manage to ratchet up to at least 3,000) to return a suitcase to a girl, because one of them has ""that old-fashioned feeling, where I'd do anything to bone her"", and then rampage through the city of Aspen.<br/><br/>This is because the culmination of the plot, an elaborate kidnapping story, was more or less dumped unceremoniously from the final cut. A very wise choice, as the movie is now essentially a showcase for the perfect comedic duo, the gentle and laid-back Jeff Daniels and the obnoxious-aggressive Jim Carey, in their hilarious quest to cast aspersions on the definition of humans as a sentient species.<br/><br/>Jim Carey went on to rise to greater comedic stardom, but Jeff Daniels is just as brilliant here, and a lot more likable.<br/><br/>Just as a side note, I always marveled at Carey's brilliant ""chipped tooth prosthetic"", until I read here on IMDb that those are his real pearly whites -- he does actually have a chipped tooth and just took the cap off."

","This is probably my favorite comedy of all-time. The dialog is hilarious, utterly hilarious, but the real reason this film is such a gem is faces the characters make in-between the dialog. I have to mostly attribute this to Jim Carrey and his brilliance in his early career. I can still laugh at jokes I've heard a hundred times before because I will notice subtle nuances I never noticed before in Jim's face. For a film focusing on the dumb, it is intelligently written. Yeah, there is the usually toilet-humor (hilarious nonetheless) but there are very intelligent jokes happening to mix things up.

Yes, the characters are stupid (hence the title), but the comedy is genius. <br/><br/>The dialog and layers of comedic devices render silly visual and verbal jokes into sublime hilarity. This movie is like a treatise on comedy--employing irony, satire, slapstick, scatological humor, puns, mistaken identity, and double entendre. Sometimes they come in rapid succession and sometimes they are used simultaneously. This is why the movie is so re-watchable...you can pick up on new layers of jokes with every viewing.<br/><br/>If you love movies like Old School(2003), The Big Lebowski(1998), There's Something About Mary(1998), This is Spinal Tap(1984), or The Jerk(1979) then you can't help but love Dumb & Dumber!"
"sme_no_densetsu","7","1","3","3 June 2008"," Brilliant stupidity
","Some 'dumb' comedies can take idiotic humour and elevate it to another level. This is one of those films.<br/><br/>The story follows Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) as they trek cross-country, ostensibly to return a briefcase to Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) but equally motivated by Lloyd's desire to strike up a relationship with her. There is some inventiveness in the situations that the duo get themselves into but the story isn't exactly 'edge of your seat' material.<br/><br/>The movie lives up to its name with the humour stemming from utter stupidity in most cases. Carrey & Daniels are adept at imbuing their characters with a sincerity that makes the idiotic comments they make endearing in a way.<br/><br/>This is perhaps Jim Carrey's finest hour with his comic timing and rubber-faced mugging frequently drawing laughs. Jeff Daniels is a pretty good complement to Carrey's shenanigans though he isn't in the same league as him. The supporting cast is merely alright, with a memorable turn by Mike Starr, who's usually relegated to smaller roles.<br/><br/>There's nothing worth remarking about in terms of direction but I will comment on the music. It's a mish-mash of then-hip alternative songs, featured prominently enough at times to seem like an advertisement for the soundtrack album. Remember Dead Eye Dick's hit ""New Age Girl""? Worse than the songs, though, are the (thankfully) brief snippets of a sort of love theme. On the other hand, there's an excellent use of The Cowsill's ""The Rain, the Park & Other Things"".<br/><br/>This film isn't exactly awards material but it's a pretty pleasant diversion. Beware, though, that I've seen it butchered on television (even though it's actually quite tame), so your best bet is to stick with video/DVD."

","Hollywood has been accused of dumbing down comedy over the last couple of decades, and if anyone in particular could be held accountable for this trend it would be The Farrelly Brothers, Bobby and Peter, who between them have been responsible for some of the most puerile, bad taste, gross out comedies ever made. All I can say is 'God bless 'em both', 'cos I'll take a good poo gag over dry wit or a clever play on words any day of the week.<br/><br/>In Dumb and Dumber, the film that first brought the brothers' manic brand of inane humour to the public's attention, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play best pals Lloyd and Harry, a couple of morons who take a road trip to Aspen to return a briefcase to pretty socialite Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), unaware that in doing so they are risking their lives.<br/><br/>Although this might not be the best of the Farrelly's outrageous comedies (that honour would go to There's Something About Mary or Kingpin), it sure is the dumbest: the plot is dumb, the jokes are dumb, and the characters are dumb... and dumber. If jokes about blind children, boobies, gay truckers, and uncontrollable bowel movements make you bust a gut, then come on down... this'll give your chuckle muscles a more than satisfying workout! If, on the other hand, you find amusement from more sophisticated material, like those movies by neurotic New Yorker Woody Harrelson, then give Dumb and Dumber a wide berth, 'cos it is dumb with a capital 'B'."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","4","26 March 2004"," Wouldn't have been anything if it wasn't for Jim Carrey's amazing talent(s)...
","I have to say, this movie really would have been bad if it Jim Carrey hadn't been in it. Every single scene without him is hardly funny; Jeff Daniels if miles away from Jim talent-wise. Jim can make you laugh with a simple movement of his face, whereas Jeff hardly could make me laugh at all. The script does put the two in some pretty funny situations, but hadn't it been for Carrey, the movie would have been very bad. I especially thought the dream/fantasy sequences with Carrey very unbelievably funny; they really let him display his full talents, making extremely funny facial expressions and hilarious noises. This movie holds a few of the greatest moments with Carrey that's on film(in my not particularly humble opinion, at least), but apart from those few truly great scenes, the movie isn't all that funny; as mentioned earlier, especially the scenes with Daniels were usually barely funny at all. I would recommend any fan of Carrey to watch this, at least to watch the few very memorable, incredibly funny scenes in which he shows his potential. It has a lot of crude humor though, and a lot of it is downright disgusting, especially if you're not used to that sort of humor, but apart from that, it's just barely worth watching for any fan of Jim Carrey. 7/10"

","""Dumb and Dumber"" is a film that was fabulously successful. Although it cost $17,000,000, it ended up grossing $247,000,000!! Talk about a huge payoff for the Farrelly Brothers!<br/><br/>The story is about Lloyd and Harold (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels)--two complete idiots who are roommates. When a passenger in Lloyd's limo leaves a briefcase behind, he vows to return it to her. There are two huge problems with this. First, this occurred in Rhode Island and she now is in Aspen! Second, although Lloyd thought she left it by accident, it was ransom money...and now he and Harold have it and mobsters are after them!<br/><br/>Much of the humor was stupid--the sort of stuff middle school kids would love. However, I must admit that although much of the humor was awful, sometime is still made me laugh. Plus, the film ended well. So, I do recommend it BUT must point out that it is NOT for anyone wanting cleverness. Nope...crude humor, bad jokes and embarrassing moments...that's what you'll find and you, too, might laugh a bit like I did.<br/><br/>By the way, for the love of God, do NOT watch the sequel ""Dumb and Dumberer"". None of the original writers, directors or actors are in it and it is a total bomb....and currently is on IMDB's notorious Bottom 100 list."
"Floated2","4","1","5","18 June 2017"," Entertaining but over-hyped
","Dumb and Dumber has been highly praised and loved throughout since its release in 1994. Having over twenty years later, the long awaited sequel was delivered. This film has been considered by many to be hilarious, and one of the funnies ""silly"" comedies of all time. Nothing much about the film is as funny as advertised, more so a bunch of silly and cringe gags and jokes which we are intended to laugh at. What works for the film is the characters and the chemistry of both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. We understand their characters are dumb and the situations they are put into are silly, they do carry the film but as a whole the jokes aren't funny. Dumb and Dumber is more so entertaining than it is funny, and many jokes try a little hard to be funny, which isn't great. Most of the jokes come from toilet humor and obvious predictable events, filling with a simple and predictable plot."

","Very few comedy films can provide such quality laughs so consistently. In my opinion a great comedy should not be all about the jokes, the actors chemistry is a pivotal part in making the film work. Dumb and Dumber has this and then some. Carrey and Daniels are a fantastic duo and really make this film what it is. Whether it be Carrey's priceless facial expressions, Daniels great one liners or the sheer stupidity of both characters, this film has it all. The plot is not the greatest but the acting and comedy makes up for it. With comet being my favourite genre, I struggle to think of a single film that compares to this genius piece of cinema. The soundtrack is also massively enjoyable and the supporting actors contribute towards the humour. And like all great comedy films, the amount of quotable lines are endless. Other films like Harold and Kumar try and adopt a similar approach but even though I massively enjoy the first two Harold and Kumar movies, none of them come close to Dumb and Dumber. If you haven't watched this film stop procrastinating and do so. You'll enjoy every second!"

","Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title roles (though viewers may find themselves debating which is which) in this genially low-brow comedy. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are two intellectually-challenged best friends who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to trash the place; the guys also have a certain problem (not difficult to understand) holding on to jobs. Lloyd is working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight (though not for lack of trying). Harry has a van decorated to look like a dog (to promote his failing dog-grooming business), and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen. What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped husband. Incidentally, Lloyd's chipped front tooth happens to be real; while Jim Carrey had the injured tooth capped many years ago, he thought a broken smile would suit Lloyd's character and had the cap removed for the duration of filming. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"

Little does he know that she left it deliberately for a couple of kidnappers as ransom.<br/><br/>This is the Farrelly brothers' first and possibly best hit. Over the years, I have seen this movie many times and every time I have gut busting laughs. The gags work no matter how many times you see it. Jim Carrey is at his hilarious best.

I'm not really a fan of road movies (with the exception of 'Rain Man,' 'Little Miss Sunshine,' 'RV' and this one) but I still found it side-splittingly funny.<br/><br/>This film has a ton of memorable laugh-out-loud, crude and sad moments such as Harry and Lloyd driving in a dog van, Lloyd peeing in several bottles in the van followed by the ""Pull over"" joke (""That's a cardigan!""), an owl being knocked out/killed by a flying cork, a dead bird being given to a blind boy, Harry getting his tongue stuck on an icy lamppost, Harry and Lloyd's makeover-type sequence set to Roy Orbison's 'Pretty Woman (this film was the first time I heard that song)' and Harry suffering from the nasty consequences of laxatives. Upon re-visiting this six years ago, I noticed some innuendo such as when Harry tells Mary she has a nice pair of hooters to which she questions, ""I beg your pardon?"" (Because she thought he meant boobs) when Harry means the owls and word play when Lloyd mistakes an Austrian woman for an Australian one as well as the ""pull over"" pun I mentioned earlier. The other thing I noticed first time around six years ago was the poor grammar in the opening credits but I soon understood that this was done to reflect the stupidity theme throughout the film. Jim Carrey was the funniest actor here while Jeff Daniels was nearly as humorous. I also remember watching the animated spin-off of this film, which was nearly as good.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the funniest films I have ever seen in spite of its crude and sad moments. 9/10."

"AudioFileZ","7","0","1","30 May 2013"," 20 Years Later...Still The Definitive Jim Carey Comedy
","As of mid 2013 this is still Jim Carey's highest rated movie...Believe it! The reason is that it is a perfect palate with his best foil, Jeff Daniels in the co-starring role. Carey has such a unique physical comedy it's a gift and a curse. Though he has proved he can do decent drama, his ""wheelhouse"" is assuredly comedy, and all cylinders hit here.<br/><br/>Lloyd Christmas is a totally witless loser, except he is so naively innocent that he is lovable...And, damn funny. That is given the right vehicle. Dumb & Dumber is close to that perfect ""ride"". The Farrelley brothers understand how to utilize the special talents of Carey's comedic brilliance. First, they've provided a script that plays to the strengths Carey possesses. Then, they take what would appear to be a left turn and pair him with a formally serious actor, Jeff Daniels, who proves to be the synergistic pairing needed. Daniels shows a ""straight-man"" (yet total dumb ass) comedic flair that nobody would guess he had in him. He almost matches Carey and in the process garners unforced knee-slapping laughs.<br/><br/>This movie has a real pull for the viewer. Absolutely hilarious sight gags with snappy dead-pan comedic gold dialog delivered perfectly. Add the fantastic backdrop of Aspen, with all of it's pretentiousness for a brilliantly scenic juxtaposition to the low-brow comedy - what you get is an unexpected comedy classic. These guys are better than Martin and Lewis because, mostly, you have two Lewis'! While Martin was the ""cool"" in those classic comedies this one uses two comedians and an assortment of ""cool"" supporting characters to out-do other classic comedy ""buddy movies""! Even the sophomoric gross stuff rises above the usual into more rarefied air as a result.<br/><br/>Nothing can take away from the fun that makes this movie comedic gold. We know in 2014 there will be a sequel. It doesn't matter, like the original Blues Brothers movie, if that sequel works or is an embarrassment. Nothing can take away the ""crown"" of this gem. See it again as comedies with so much right like this one are scarce."

","Dumb and Dumber is about two lower class under educated buddies who decide to embark on a cross country trip.<br/><br/>The movie is about Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne, both of which are under achieving low IQ morons for lack of better terminology. In short...Lloyd drives a limo ''rather poorly'' and this is his job. The movie starts with him shuttling the beautiful Mary Swanson to the airport. Upon seeing Mary for the first time Lloyd decided that it can only be love at first sight, which leads to some uncomfortable small talk on the way to the airport. Upon arriving to the airport Lloyd watches as his ''dream girl'' walks away and out of his life, as he is watching her leave the terminal he is also still moving forward in his Limo, this leads to a minor accident which causes Lloyd to realize that Mary has left her briefcase in the terminal. Lloyd takes this as a chance to pursue Mary halfway across the country. Lloyd enlists Harry, his dog grooming friend and the ''slightly'' more sensible of the two, to drive him across the country.<br/><br/>Overall Dumb and Dumber is a good flick for those that have the right sense of humor. Dumb and Dumber is very low brow humor. If that's not you're thing then you probably won't like this movie. Dumb and Dumber has a lot of things in it...From homicidal hillbilly truckers, to an almost gruesome rape scene in a truck stop bathroom, to an unfolding kidnapping murder case, most of which sounds pretty serious, but somehow this movie manages to make light of all of it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Dumb and Dumber, Back then and currently."

It still plays regularly on TV and is probably regarded by a good number of teen-aimed comedies as a legendary duo/road trip film. It's chock full of childish, awkward, visual humor where catch phrases are key. Jeff Daniels' Harry is such a good pairing with Jim Carrey's cartoonish Lloyd that you can't go wrong. The soundtrack was an alt-rock hit in the 90's and featured a lot of one-hit wonders that were solely known for their music for this film. I recommend it you like the other screwball comedies of Carrey's earlier works (Ace Ventura, The Mask) or even other buddy comedies of the time, like Tommy Boy.

But I still get the thrill of noticing new hilarious parts randomly thrown into the movie for the viewer's pleasure. Tonight, for the first time, I noticed the older guy who randomly takes a leak on a brick wall in the scene where Harry and Lloyd leave home. It's these random, simple, hilarious parts that come together to keep viewers laughing during 90% of the movie. This is one of the most quoted comedies of all time, deservedly so...

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","1","24 February 2007"," Suck me sideways
","I'd find it hard to trust someone who wasn't the slightest bit amused by Dumb and Dumber. After all, what kind of person doesn't laugh at a man firing hot waves of watery excrement out of his horrorstruck anus, or at a blind boy stroking a decapitated bird, or at an owl being shot by a cork? These are all things that should appeal to any right-minded individual  it's comedy at its basest, but the funny bone should never be concerned with good taste.<br/><br/>Of all the gags and silly lines in Dumber and Dumber, my favourite moment actually involves attempted male rape (always a prime source for comedy!). The moment I'm talking about is when Sea Bass very nearly forces himself on one of our heroes. But one of the things I love most about the scene is Lloyd's fascination when reading the message on the toilet wall. 'For manly love be here March 25th at 2:15am sharp' it reads. Lloyd looks amused, even a little bit curious, but then as he consults his watch you hear a 'Wah-wah' on the soundtrack, which translates into 'you're about to get buggered' and the smile on his face vanishes. Wonderful stuff.<br/><br/>But the character of Sea Bass himself is just bloody hilarious (even if he only has two scenes and hardly says anything). I could easily watch an entire film devoted to him and his sour-faced, bad tempered homosexual antics. But as it stands we only get him spitting into a burger and him trying to molest someone. But that's enough, I guess. However, there is another great Sea Bass moment. Just watch Sea Bass when Lloyd and Harry are trying to scam him. The way he points to himself and his 'boys' never fails to crack me up.<br/><br/>Another supporting character rich in comedy is Mental the gangster. He has quite a few amusing moments, but the best one by quite some margin is when his phone conversation in a phone booth is interrupted by some bespectacled nitwit. The man is so geeky and so annoying that the punch that comes thundering through the glass not only induces laughs but also elicits cheers  you can't help but like this bloke. However, as likable as this mentalist is, die he must. And his death scene includes some of Carey's and Daniels' best acting. Just look at them when they spike Mental's burger. They're like kids  they can't suppress their mirth.<br/><br/>Speaking of acting, it's not a surprise that Carey is so good at acting dumb, but it's something of a minor revelation that Daniels is so good at comedy. After all, before this, he was known for more serious roles. But here Daniels' allows his IQ to plummet and he more than holds his own with his more experienced counterpart.<br/><br/>One of the most enjoyable things about Dumb and Dumber is how petty and bad tempered the two friends are ('You are one pathetic loserno offence')  some of the best scenes are the ones where they argue like school kids. A great scene happens near the end  Lloyd and Harry are arguing over Mary. They no longer want to be friends and Harry asks him where he has to sign. 'Right on my ass after you kiss it!' And I can't help but crack up at Lloyd's shooting fantasy when he sees Mary's husband. Both characters are borderline psychotic, which only makes the film even funnier.<br/><br/>I also like how relentlessly horny Lloyd is. Just take the scene when he first meets Mary. The quasi-romantic music and the way Lloyd grabs his heart when Mary walks back into her house are bloody hilarious, as is the 'Goodbye, my love!' moment at the airport (also note Lloyd's reaction when he hugs his 'love'  the groan as he relaxes his body is disturbingly sexual). And I've also just remembered the 'Be strong' moment and the little sobbing sound he makes (man this film is funny!). But just as good as this is Lloyd's daydream as he drives. The way he sneaks a look at Mary's butt is priceless (and what a butt it is, too!). And then the schmoozing at his dinner party (if only lighted farts really did impress people at 'sophisticated' parties) and the fight at the restaurant. But although the fisticuffs are brilliant, there's a much smaller and funnier moment in this scene  note the way the waiter chucks Lloyd's plate onto the table and the way he carefully places Mary's; who says the film isn't subtle? <br/><br/>But even though there are one or two gags which can rightly be declared as subtle, they kind of pale in comparison to the instances of bad taste. Just take the officer drinking his own urine ('give me the booze you pumpkin pie haircutted freak!') or Harry crapping his brains out. These are the showcase moments. But as good as these are, what keeps me coming back are the little things  Lloyd trying to buy a copy of 'Rhode Island Slut', Lloyd gagging when he sees his best friend hanging out with his 'girl', the 'big gulps' moment, the look on Harry's face when he finds out that his best friend has been wearing extra gloves and Lloyd burping in utter contempt when he gets stuck next to an insufferable woman at a bar. As dumb as the characters are, there's far too much great comedy for it to be written off as a dumb film  you've got to be smart to make stupidity as funny as it is here."

","Well, as far as comedy goes, this is one of the staples among the 20-something crowd. Certainly not ""art"" or an ""epic"" by any standard but for pure comic and quotable genius, this film takes the cake. Dumb and Dumber has everything you need in a comedy: romance, drama, slapstick, one-liners, completely brainless mind-numbing stupidity and above all a shaggin' wagon. I have still have yet to find a movie (even above its contemporaries like Tommy Boy) with more replay value and quotables. Having viewed this countless times I can still get a laugh out especially with friends even though it's been out over a decade. Much to my amazement there has not been a special release of this film until 2006 but alas our day is come. If you haven't seen this comedic gem, please rush to your store be it rental or otherwise and give this a once-over and I'll bet you'll agree with me."

","OK, well let's start this review off with a good thing, first of all it wasn't what I thought, it was a lot better. I was thinking, OK, you got funny man Jim Carrey and straight man Jeff Daniels, how on earth are they going to pull it off. Well, let's just say they did, a lot of people didn't like this movie because they said it was DUMB. I got to tell you there are some DUMB parts in the movie, but they make the movie hilarious. We all know Harland Williams for his sense of humor, and yes, he does have a great part in the movie, loved his scene with the two lead actors.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays a limo driver, who drives Lauren Holly to the airport, and he ends up having a crush on her. Lauren leaves a suitcase at the airport and the movie is about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels giving everything up so they can give the suitcase back to Lauren. Will the boys make it in time? Well, they might be delayed by a few bad guys, a state trooper and a whole bunch of crazies.<br/><br/>I loved this movie though, I thought it was really funny. Jim Carrey is hilarious of course, duh, everybody that's seen one of his movies knows that, and Jeff Daniels he shows that he's got a great sense of humor to, and the guys just play it off one another perfectly. I love Lauren Holly's look that she gives the camera when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) comes up and hugs her, it's priceless. I chose to give this movie a 7 out of 10, because yes it is a good movie, it's one of those movies though where you laugh at the actors and the story because it's so dumb, it's funny. There were a lot of great scenes, and the actors were wonderful, it's got a good story, a couple memorable lines, but the potty humor kind of got to me, a little too much for my taste."

","What can I say? Maybe I underestimated this Jim Carrey guy. I always found him annoying, but after seeing him in this movie, maybe I better give him another chance. He was so talented in this movie. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play together in this movie. They both really play their part well. There isn't a scene without Jim Carrey or Jeff Daniels that isn't funny. If it isn't Jim Carrey been funny with his amazing talent it's Jeff Daniels making funny quotes. It also gives Jeff Daniels a chance to show his idiotic/funny side, because mostly he plays in drama.thriller/horror movies. The script put these two characters in some very funny situations. The plot is good. Them setting off on a big adventure to give a lady in Aspen back her suitcase. And along the way funny things happen! The direction is excellent and the script is well written. Sure, two idiots setting out on a big adventure. Who doesn't like that? Everyone will love it. Kids, adults and old people in Nursing Homes will love it. I recommend this to any human being. 10/10"
"jaysilentbob37","10","0","2","9 July 2006"," An absolute classic! One of my favorites of all time!
","This was one of the first movies I ever saw, and NASA couldn't count how many times I've seen it since I was four years old. I have this movie 99% memorized, though I can't remember what it is I don't remember in this. Ironically, this movie never loses it's hilarity, and I laugh endlessly whenever I watch it for the hundredth time.<br/><br/>The title explains it all. Two insanely dumb buddies (you can't really tell who's dumb and who's dumber), Lloyd (Jim Carrey), and Harry (Jeff Daniels), who's lives are going nowhere for obvious reasons. One day, Lloyd drives the beautiful Mary (Lauren Holly) to the airport while working as a limo driver. Mary drops off a briefcase full of ransom money at the airport, and Lloyd, thinking she forgot it, swipes the case, and he and Harry set off on a cross country journey to return it to her in Aspen, oblivious to the fact that they have kidnappers on their trail, intending to kill them and claim the money. Of course, the two idiots have a knack for getting out of danger and/or defeating bad guys without ever knowing they were in danger, so everyone who crosses them is in for a humiliating surprise.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that you can NOT leave running while you take a bathroom break. You are bound to miss an abundant amount of classic lines. I don't know a movie that I've spent more time in my life quoting than this. The plot of the movie is nothing more than a setup for an endless stream of hysterical jokes, gags, and rampant silliness. And the talented Farrelly brothers do not waste a second. Every chance they get for a clever gag, they take it.<br/><br/>The movie actually runs longer than you'd expect. It could have easily been one of those crappy, 80 minute movies where the characters qualify as retarded, and every other character is just as dumb as they are. Well, let me just say that for a dumb comedy, this movie is surprisingly intelligent. The two main characters are EXTREMELY dumb, no question, but are far more realistic and convincing than any of those other retards such as the characters from Dude, Where's My Car. The movie resists any temptation to stoop to the pure stupidity of that crapfest. Instead of everyone being as dumb as the title characters, the title characters are the dumb ones, and the supporting cast, while quirky, are far more mentally stable, and are constantly affected the the ridiculous antics of Lloyd and Harry. When there isn't some riotous line being spoken, or outrageous slapstick being inflicted, the supporting cast is reacting to it.<br/><br/>This movie is a tradition in my family, and is still tied with There's Something About Mary the funniest of the Farrelly brothers work. I know nobody who's seen this who doesn't think the movie is great. I probably have the most sympathy for it, however. I give this movie my fullest recommendation of 10/10.<br/><br/>It is rated PG-13 for Sexual Content, Crude Humor, Some Violence, and Language. Sex: 5/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 4/10 Drugs: 3/10"

Some movies start out funny and then die down as they try to fill the plot with bad jokes, but this movie doesn't disappoint. Jim Carrey's role in this movie is the perfect fit for him and Jeff Daniels is surprisingly funny as well. Their characters' lack of social skills and general knowledge (hence the name dumb and dumber) keep you entertained throughout. Also, this movie contains one of the funniest bathroom humor scenes I've ever seen.

","One of the best comedies of all time. The story is a bit patchy and besides the acting of Daniels and Carrey the movie totally suck. I like the movie because it has classic slapstick Farelly comedy but this was one of the first movies where Jim Carrey showed he has a dramatic side. It is few and far between but the scene where Lloyd convinces Harry to go to Aspen actually has quite a bit of drama. When Harry gets shot in the hotel room we also see a dramatic scene from Carrey. Most importantly to remember though is that so many people passed on this movie and when it was released no one really expected too much. This movie along with Ace Ventura made Jim Carrey into the 20 million a movie actor he is today. NOTES<br/><br/>Lauren Holly's one and only decent film. Yes it is stupid, yes it is easy to follow, but what makes it simple is what makes it good. If you don't enjoy this flick than you must not like to laugh."

","Never in my life have I ever laughed so many times at a movie after having seen it many times before. Amung my community this film was (and still is) a classic comedy, a cult classic if you will. Clearly it isn't widely accepted by you ""mature"" people who laugh at people in awkward relationship situations involving someones mother walking in on two people talking about sex (Now THAT'S classy comedy!), but this movie offers (to those who don't pay to see every Tom Green movie) a hilariously stupid comedy about two morons who go on a messed up adventure.<br/><br/>The writing of this movie is (suprisingly) clever. The jokes aren't just people farting every four seconds, they actually have some style to them (if you can call it style...). The movie is fluent, fast paced, and funny all the way through, which is really a rarity in many wannabe comedies.<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie you should see drunk with your friends, or even on your own. Do NOT EVER WATCH THIS WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS! That would be a mistake. Basically, what I'm saying is it's a movie for people with the ability to be immature for 2 hours of their life, or for anyone who just wants to let their guard down and laugh at a vulgar yet hilarious film.<br/><br/>So of course I'm going to give this movie a 10. It deserves it. Kudos on a suburb comedy that will be passed down from generation to generation. Those kids are as corrupt as it is... might as well give them what they want."

","I first saw dumb & dumber a couple of years ago. That time I laughed so hard i almost lost my breath. I forgot the name of the film, but fortunately I found it again in a shop. I didn't expect much, because I was much younger back then. But I laughed just as hard the second time. Yes, the movie has its weaknesses such as when ""the gas man"" says after finding the note on the door. He says that they must have been watching him for weeks, but later in the film he hitchhikes with them. Its a small detail you wont notice the first time, but I've watched it a couple of times and I wonder how the Farrelly brothers could Miss this...<br/><br/>But when the movie ends you must have had a good laugh, or something is seriously wrong. If Jim Carrey wasn't starring in this movie it wouldn't be as good as I think it is. But Jim Carrey is a Comedic genius. All in all, maybe the funniest movie i have ever seen."

","In my opinion, this is a funny movie with raunchy content. The one thing that made me feel uneasy was when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) did something really vulgar. I don't want to say what it is, though. If you ask me, this movie had very funny humor, even though it was vulgar at times. Another raunchy part was when Harry (Jeff Daniels) was in the toilet. The things I liked most were the feelings that Lloyd and Harry had for Mary (Lauren Holly).

When I saw this initially I wasn't impressed at all and it was when I was forced to sit and watch for a second time whilst on holidays and it amused me slightly. By the sixth time it was downright hilarious. There was this camaraderie between Carrey and Daniels and they really look like they had a great time making this movie. This is a rare comedy where it's funny all the way through and doesn't die in the middle or get stale at the end because of Carreys and Daniels great ""chemistry"". These two although are never likely to earn anything from this movie except for a huge amount of money and laughs but thats okay because not all movies are award material. I am thankful for the fact that there has never been a dumb and dumber sequel because I don't think that it could have lived up to the original (which the prequel proved. The funniest parts for me are the travelling in the infamos wagon to Aspen from the meeting with the highway patrolman to the tough guys in the café (watching this scene should prove to anyone that these two are not as foolish as they appear to be) along with the chilli pepper scene.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great slapstick comedy."

","The movie is unsuitable for clever and serious men and women because it is devoid of philosophical content and any deep thoughts. What is worse, the movie is totally devoid of sophisticated special effects and it is a very rapid example of cinema making (the movie has no intermissions when a viewer can think of his own problems).

Where is the perfect English speech?

"astro_92","10","0","1","17 September 2005"," One of my all-time favorite motion pictures!
","Without question, the 1994 comedy film Dumb & Dumber is one of my all-time favorite motion pictures. I saw this movie when it first came out and I was instantly hooked on it. I laughed very hard when I watched it on the big screen (by the way, I was twelve years old when this film was theatrically released). Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are terrific as the two lead characters. The rest of the cast also really glows. This film will probably still be a favorite with me even when I am past the age of fifty.<br/><br/>The film is about two best friends who are unable to keep sensible, steady jobs while hoping to eventually start their own business. Lloyd was working as a limousine driver when he met a gorgeous woman named Mary Swanson. He proceeded to drive her to the airport when he fell madly in love with her. She leaves her briefcase in the airport terminal and Lloyd immediately rushed to get it back to her. He was too late and lost his job following his fall from the jet-way. Harry was also terminated after he failed to deliver dogs to the proper pet show on time. After much deliberation, Harry and Lloyd decide to take a road trip across America. Their destination: Aspen, Colorado. Lloyd wants to be reunited with Mary so that he can start a relationship with her, in addition to returning her the briefcase she left behind. Little do the boys know that they are being pursued by a couple of criminals who are after the money that is being kept inside the locked briefcase; they were sent on the mission by Nicholas Andre, a man who is linked somehow to Mary and her family.<br/><br/>I have several favorite sequences from this hysterical picture. One is where Harry and Lloyd encounter trouble at a truck-stop diner. A truck driver named Sea Bass is accidentally hit with a salt-shaker from Harry. Sea Bass is irritated and spits on Harry's hamburger. Lloyd decides to seek revenge on Sea Bass and his gang by telling the staff that they are willing to pay for the service that he and Harry received at the restaurant. By the way, the waitress that they talk to is a very cute young woman with black hair. She also seems to be very sweet. They get away with this scheme while the overly tough Sea Bass is left feeling tremendous amounts of anger. I also like it when the duo puts atomic hot peppers on Joe's burger and makes him sick; he has an ulcer and cannot have such edibles. Joe groans and gives a request for his medicine; Harry unknowingly gives Joe rat poison, which instantly kills him. I also liked it when Harry drank the tea containing the Turbo Lax; this made him have to go very bad as his bowels were getting ready to pop.<br/><br/>I love this movie! Dumb & Dumber will forever remain to be one of my favorite films. There are so many moments in this movie that are exceedingly hilarious. I recommend this title for anyone who loves to laugh."

","Dumb and Dumber, the tale of two dimwits who go on a cross country road trip to Aspen, is nothing short of a comedy classic. And it's nothing short of well, dumb. But if a movie is to be judged on how well it achieves it's desired goals, then this comedy is a roaring success. Because being dumb is the whole point. But besides featuring top-notch stupid humor, the film has what other ""dumb"" comedies such as ""Freddy Got Fingered"" and ""Half Baked"" lack. Charm and even some touching aspects. Dimensions that bring the purpose of the story full circle. Pedomorphic protagonists Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) make their journey to Aspen with the noble intent to return what they think is a lost briefcase to wealthy socialite Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) and pursue Lloyd's on-the-spot infatuation with her. In their stupidity however, never truly seem to understand the real circumstances surrounding the attachÃ© and the trouble it could cause.<br/><br/>Even if this movie is what you believe to be ""not your thing"", as is the mentality many have toward ""stupid comedies"", at least give it a try.

Jim Carrey was obviously the hot comedy actor, but Daniels does a great job hanging with him in terms of comedy. One of my favorite examples of Harry is when he spends the day Mary and they get in the snowball fight. While with a group at a movie a few years back, we saw the first teaser for Dumb and Dumberer where all you hear are Carrey and Daniels voices.

The Farrelly's have a unique was of writing movies but hey works for me. So yeah I was suckered into the movie and came out and enjoyed it. Of course Jim Carrey sucked as usual. So watch it on video yu'll enjoy it better."

","this movie rocks! never have i laughed so much, unless talking about other Jim Carrey flicks such as liar, liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Jim Carrey is a comedy legend in his own right, and to me he stands head and shoulders above any other comedian on screen. he MAKES the movies that he appears in. OK Jeff Daniels is a funny guy too, but it would never work without the irrepressible Carrey. i don't remember laughing until I've cried this much, i was out of my seat on several occasions, especially the first time i saw it at the cinema.<br/><br/>this movie is toilet humour through and through, and is not for everyone, people who will not like it are people with no sense of humour, uptight people or people who just don't get that they are meant to be THAT stupid. what a great movie! 10/10"
"paulrudz-1","9","0","2","16 May 2005"," A critique on the film's techniques.
","The film is a comedy that keeps the viewer laughing and well entertained for the entire film. Jokes are abundant and often subtle; watching the film multiple times does not bore the viewer, it often makes it more enjoyable. The laughs start in the opening scene and don't end till the credits are rolling. The cast is lead by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Their interactions with one another and the supporting cast make for a memorable comedy. The film takes across the United States, from Rhode Island to Colorado. The soundtrack in the film is very fitting for the gestalt of the movie as a whole. The film doesn't employ many special effects but a wide range of shots, including crane, close-up, and zoom are used. My rational for giving the film a rating of 9 is that a few parts break from the comedic tone and become to serious. Despite that, the movie is great to watch alone, with friends, or with family of all ages. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good genuine laugh."

","This movie is brilliant. Its a simple premise but thats why it succeeds so well. There's so many memorable parts in this movie, its so hard to remember all of them. Carrey and Daniels are a great pair in this movie. I still see it today on TBS and laugh my *** off! I don't want to give much away, but if you love intelligent dimwitted comedy(oxymoron) then watch this classic. The plot is great too.Carrie is a limo driver in Providence,RI who brings a young woman to an airport. She drops her suitcase at the airport and Carrie attempts to bring the suitcase back to her. Daniels and Carrie are both fired from their job and decide to take a cross country trip to give the poor woman her suitcase. Little do they know, the suitcase contained money that belongs to the mob. Hilarity ensues."
"Corky1984","Null","0","2","21 April 2005"," Toilet humour galore
","This is a great film, well worth seeing a few times and just as funny now as it was over a decade ago. It's essentially a vehicle for Jim Carrey to show off his array of face pulling and odd voice skills with Jeff Daniels starring as his retarded mate. The film is all about their journey across the States to deliver a briefcase to some chick that Carrey has the hots for. Naturally she doesn't feel the same! There are plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially when Carrey can't stop urinating into beer bottles whilst Daniels is driving. The subsequent stoppage by the Old Bill sees the cop make a poor choice when he decides to take a swig from one of Carrey's offerings... That pretty much sums up the film, toilet humour, but its all well done! The undoubted highlight of the film is Daniel's frantic attempts to find a toilet to relieve an urgency brought on by Turbolax! Ensconced on his bird's bog he's let it all out and then some before she utters the immortal line 'I hope you're not using the toilet, it doesn't flush'! Comedy gold! There are numerous other funny scenes, too many to mention really. When the focus switches to the serious characters the pace can be a tad slow, but thankfully these scenes are fairly short. The soundtrack features plenty of easy listening 90s and late 80s rock, all harmless enough. Dumb and Dumber is Carrey's best film by far, its a shame that we haven't seen anything of this calibre from him for so long. Another of those films best seen as a group."

","Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Llyod (Jim Carrey)are two low-life Providence men with nothing going for them. Llyod is assigned to drive a beautiful woman named Mary (Lauren Holly) to the airport. After Mary 'accidentaly' leaves her briefcase in the terminal, Harry and Llyod go on a cross-country trip to Aspen to return the briefcase. <br/><br/>Carrey is put in the film for more of the goofy comedy. He is off-the-wall funny and always says something stupid that almost sounds right. Nevertheless Carrey puts a lot of thought behind his character and creates good chemistry between himself and Daniels.<br/><br/>Daniels surprised me the most. After seeing his work in such films as Gettysburg and Speed you'd never think the guy could do comedy. WRONG! Daniels is brilliant, again. He's put opposite of Carrey for some of the serious humor but soon his role too falls into the goofy side. One scene especially involving a toilet stands out on how good his acting was.<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies every seen with the interaction of Daniels and Carrey. After the movie you try to wonder who really was the dumber one. Some of the gags are just ingenious from Seabass, who was going to kill Harry in a truck stop ends up being gay or Harry licking the frost on the lift and getting stuck to it.<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber.

","In the 90's the Farrelly brothers brought a new stream of gross-out toilet humour to the movies, and with Dumb and Dumber they hit their peak. There's Something About Mary may have been a bigger critical hit, but this film, uniting the talents of Carrey and Daniels is the funniest film of the decade, and for fans of this kind of humour, it is the best comedy ever. If you like your jokes subtle, or Frasier style then be warned-here we have lewd sexual jokes, making fun of blind kids, drinking urine, and laxatives...<br/><br/>Dumb and Dumber is above all a road movie, following two friends who are dumber than the average person across America in search of a woman who left her briefcase behind. Lloyd (Carrey) works as a chauffeur, and after taking a beautiful woman to the airport he realises she has forgotten her briefcase. He takes it, intending to give it back to her, getting fired in the process. Unknown to him, she left it on purpose as it was full of money for the mob. Soon two hit men are after Lloyd. His friend Harry looks after dogs, and after he messes up another job he too is fired. After hitting rock bottom they decide to look for the briefcase girl, as Lloyd has fallen for her and hopes that she will love him when he returns her case. All he knows though is she is called Mary, and was going to Aspen. So they head out on the road. Along the way the get into a few scrapes, encounter the hit men, get lost, but eventually make it. When they find Mary, Harry goes on a date with her leaving Lloyd jealous. But they are both kidnapped leaving Lloyd to save the day.<br/><br/>This is Carrey's funniest performance, every second he is on screen will make you laugh. Daniels is the perfect support, being equally dumb but letting Carrey steal the show. Holly is very good as Mary also, and the rest of the cast are good in mostly small parts, from the hit men to Sea-bass. The cinematography is very good for a comedy, exploiting the scenery to its fullest, the soundtrack is brilliant, and the plot is hardly complex, but nor is it simple. Funny moment are everywhere, and everyone has their favourites. Mine- the fact that when Harry asks Lloyd to buy only the bare essentials as they have no money left, then Lloyd goes and buys a jumbo hat etc, the dream sequence featuring lighting farts and a vicious fight, the Sea-Bass sequence, and the snowball Harry throws at Mary, yes laughing as i type (must watch it later). Other moments include, 'Pretty bird', 'Tick-tack sir?', the laxatives, and various one-liners. Aside from all the jokes, the film has a charm about it, the two friends are constant losers but we love them anyway. 1994 was a magnificent year for movies, many of my favourites come from then, and this is undoubtedly one of the best.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"pax03","10","0","2","6 March 2005"," my all time favorite comedy!!
","To this day, no other comedy has hit me like this one, it is my all time favorite and its not one of those all time favorite comedies, then out of nowhere there is a new all time favorite. This one is the king of the mountain until another comes along to knock it off and going on 11 years there is still no other. The writing, acting, everything to make a classic comedy was here. Carrey gave us the role of his career, that he will always be remembered for. The real surprise here is Jeff Daniels, he comes from mostly dramas and other genres but not comedy but he pulls this role off to a perfection. This also will be the role everyone remembers him for. So, 2 iconic characters were defined here. There aren't that many movies you can say that about. From the gags to the pranks to the downright stupidity of the characters, this is a classic hands down. There isn't a scene in this movie that isn't well known by the people who have seen it. From the opening scene where Lyoid ask for directions to the ending scene where they turn down a job oiling down models, there is not 1 scene that isn't memorable. Some of my favorite scenes are: the snow ball fight, the Dante's atomic pepper scene, the dinner preparations scene, the Jeff Daniels bathroom scene, the Sea Bass scene, the urination in the Beer Bottles, Carrey's dream sequence, the ""Mockingbird"" singing scene, The apt. scenes, When they find the money scene, the airport scene, the Pete bird scene (his head fell off), the crying like girls watching TV commercial scene, both of them driving into Aspen on a motor cart. The great part about this movie, is about friendship and all the ups and downs friends go through on a trip like this. Its something you should watch with friends. If you look at it as a whole, its actually a heart warming movie about something sacred like friendship and thats something no one should ever mess with. The Farrelly Brothers best movie."

Maybe this doesn't have the smartest plot, but all that matters is that you're entertained. We all knew Carrey would be good in a ''slapstick'' comedy. But the real surprise is Daniels. After being usually in dramas or some comedies, but never in ''slapstick'' comedies. Both Carrey and Daniels are hilarious. Check out those haircuts. ( Spoiler Alert! ) The only scene I don't like is the scene where Lloyd( Carrey) sells Harry's( Daniels) dead bird to a blind kid. That's not funny. Other than that, this is one of the best ''slapstick'' comedies of the 90's. Also, the best Farrelly Brothers' comedy."

Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels portray their characters really well, adding humour where needed. I have to agree with others that it is the Farrelly Brothers' best movie!!!! Although a decent movie there are some parts which could be improved. Some of the actors could have played their parts with a bit more enthusiasm.But, overall I can say it is one of carrey's best (apart from Bruce Almighty).

This is also probably Carrey's best film. I laughed my ass off the first time I saw it and have done every time I've watched it. It never gets boring and the plot is very simple as it develops into a road movie. Recently Road Trip was made which is similar to this and I found that funny, but nowhere near as good as this. I won't give away any of the gags or jokes because they'll be a hell of a lot funnier when you actually watch them, but they are possibly the best ever.

","I've been thinking and thinking, and I have finally realized something: Dumb and Dumber is my favorite movie. No movie I've seen before can make me laugh or amuse as much as dumb and dumber. I would honestly say its nothing short of brilliant. The Farelly brothers use clever comedy to confidently conjure an extremely crazy yet impressively deep storyline. I've seen all there stuff, and I really think this is the best. Well, as I said before it is my favorite movie of all time. Its about Loyd Christmas and Harry Dunn, two idiotic best buds who embark on a marvelous adventure, and eventually foil an insane mobsters plot, all the while having no idea their doin it. How this happens would spoil the fun of course. Jim Carrey is amazing and at his best, as the more insane of the two buds, and Jeff Daniels is perfect as the more calm, slight more intelligent member of the dynamic duo, even though calling him bright would be a stretch. Beyond that, I really cant describe how great this movie is. Its my all time fave and it should be yours to. So go rent it. Now......................."
"chetan_thebest2003","7","0","1","17 June 2004"," Jim Carrey is cooler than the coolest...
","One thing i must admit is that i saw this movie only because of Jim Carrey. It's a reason enough to watch any comedy movie as Jim has carved a niche for himself in this category and this film ain't different; rather it strengthens his position of being the most loved and admired comic actor's of all times. Another great aspect of this film is Jim's co-partner in comedy, Jeff Daniels. He gives good company to Jim and adds more humour to already saturated comic situation's !!! The main plot revolves all around two lovable idiots and best friends Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) who can easily win the joint-crown for being two of the most foolish guys in probably the whole Universe !!! One fine day Lloyd meets a lady, Mary (Lauren Holly) in due course of his life and his heart-bells ring at once. And he finds a chance to meet Mary again : courtesy her suitcase which she forgets in the airport while boarding a plane to Aspen and which is picked up by our loverboy Lloyd (ofcourse..whom else can you expect to pick it up???). So from here takes off Lloyd's and Harry's adventure to return the lady her belonging and their experiences during this journey acts as the much needed fodder for the film. Jim Carrey is cool as usual. Can't have been better. He is so versatile, so fluid, so PERFECT...Does he realise that he is the best guy around who can use his face so well ?? It's amazing to watch him mould his face into thousand expressions in fraction of a moment !!! Jeff Daniels gels with Jim so well and both of them play the role of being the most imperfect guys in the most perfect manner...Jeff really is praise-worthy in his attempts of matching the skills of Jim, the comedian and gives him serious competition throughout. He makes you think sometimes that who is more funnier?? Also Lauren Holly's contribution of adding a glamorous look can't be ignored. You must watch this movie.It can make dead persons burst into loads of laughter. You can term it Jim Carrey's charisma or Jeff Daniels struggle to outsmart himself as a comic actor but what matters is that you shouldn't give this movie a miss until and unless you are blind!!! as even aliens would laugh at this movie no matter what language it is in... I would give it a 7.5/10"

Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are the perfect pair in this movie; I wish they did more movies together. One of my favorite parts is when they pull that trick on Sea Bass (Cam Neely) in the restaurant seen. Jim Carreys response to Sea Bass' question: ""Alright, who's the dead man that threw the salt?!"" Was hilarious. He just looks out the window and points his finger at Harry.

It's just a picture about two ridiculously dumb guys that gets its comedy from their stupidity. Some people may consider that sophmoric but in this case for the most part it is very well written, and is executed beautifully by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the ONLY 2 who could have done it that way (not a smart move making a sequel/prequel with 2 completely different and unknown actors). The jokes are consistant throughout the entire movie and the events all fall into place nicely, and the plot for the movie was original. It's a comedy, and as long as it's funny, it's done it's job and this movie doesn't have to go to ridiculous lengths or screw up the plot as an excuse to get laughs, it just does it easily and smoothly.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is one of Jim Carrey's best comedys and Jeff Daniels does a great job as well.

","Or was it ""hog?""  In any case, I had a great time watching this movie.  I saw it with my Dad and my brother, and I laughed so hard I felt like I was going to choke.  We all did.  You know, I wonder whether a sense of humor can be correlated to individual courage.  There are people who don't find this movie, or lots of funny stuff, funny. I wonder if they are living and acting and having a personal style that they don't really like, just to conform or please someone else.  I wonder if that sort of self-prison keeps them from finding much of anything spontaneously funny. There was a pony-tailed pseudo-intellectual type sitting behind us in the theater.  I heard him in the parking lot afterward, telling his friends that he just didn't see what was so funny or how anybody could laugh at Dumb and Dumber. Well, I laughed because the stuff was funny, and I wasn't busy trying to act or dress or sit some way that I thought someone wanted me to act or dress or sit.  Doing things my way allows me to laugh at a lot of things (and not laugh at a lot of things).  Maybe I won't have a heart attack, either, or miss great moments in life everyday.  I guess I won't be able to impress guys with pony tails and no sense of humor, but I can handle that."
"sirwilliams","7","0","2","13 March 2003"," Yes!
","Basically, this films contains a certain brand of humour. And you either love it or you dont. I happen to love it and thus i find this film immensely funny.<br/><br/>The main thing which makes it stand out from other comedies is the fact that it manages to sustain a consistently high level of humour throughout the film. At no time does it drag, as is often the case with most comedies thesedays. Films like Theres Something About Mary tend to have their funny, laugh-out-loud moments but they are few and far between.<br/><br/>Carrey and Daniels play off each other very well. I think this film works extremely well for Carrey (a generally comedic actor) because its not all about him and he is not always relied upon to make the audience laugh, unlike in Ace Ventura where he is forced to be the constant source of humour which thus makes it harder to sustain such a high level of humour. Daniels has his fair share of one-liners and so this periodically helps to take the focus away from Carrey which is probably a good thing because his unique style of humour is not always to everyones taste!<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very funny film which is extremely quotable and that is always the sign of a good film (one that sticks in your head). Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?"

","Imagine the two dumbest people you've ever met. Now imagine those two in charge of returning your lost luggage. Wow, what a feat it would be if you ever received your luggage back. This film shows that even two idiots can deliver a briefcase across America when they put half their brains together. One of the underlying themes is that this is a love story, plain and simple. It's what really drives Carrey, and Daniels across country to deliver the goods.<br/><br/>Most of today's pure comedies tend to have a cast that isn't half as strong as Dumb and Dumber. Thankfully Time Warner made this movie in the early stages of several of the cast members careers. Names like Jim Carry who plays Lloyd Christmas, Jeff Daniels as Harry Dunne, these guys are lead actors equally sharing half the movie, and it's directed by the Farrelly Bros. to boot! It's hard to have a bad movie with those names on the scene, and this is no exception!<br/><br/>They say never do business with family, but that couldn't be less true for the Farrelly Bros. Very few first or second time directors have been able to produce terrific films in the same vein as Dumb and Dumber, so early in their careers. A few directors that have had similar movie success are Robert Rodriguez, Manoj Night Shyamalan, and Orson Wells. I can only interpret that we're on the cusp of a lot of laughs and more great movies by the Farrelly's.<br/><br/>Several slap stick movies tend to drag but this one continues to keep the audience moving. This is an Airplane, Naked Gun type film that has the viewers just itching to find out what these two numbskulls will say next. It's 101 continuous minutes of unbridled childish laughter.<br/><br/>In order to deepen the secondary love theme, the Farrelly's used two techniques music and symbolism. In one scene Carrey goes into a daydream-like state thinking about what life would be like with Lauren Holly, she plays Mary Swanson the beautiful `out of reach' woman who lost her baggage. Carrey tilts his head back, the camera moves in closer, and The Love Affair by Dick Walter starts playing. The audience knows that they are in the dream state because for the entire song they show continuity clips of Holly and Carrey having a wonderful life together. Great use of editing to music, even the proverbial beach running scene even makes a cameo.  One attempt at symbolism is in the same dream sequence, Carrey hugs Holly and about ten doves fly out of nowhere from behind them. The doves symbolize the innocents and immaculate cleanliness that is most typical of a dreamy love sequence.<br/><br/>Face time, ego and money rule the silver screen when it comes to big Hollywood names. Every once in a while you can find two lead characters split everything in the film, including jokes, mishaps, and adventures. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels share the screen and script perfectly. This is a movie that left the audience wondering, who's funnier, and who's dumber?"

"mattymatt4ever","7","0","2","24 May 2001"," A well-deserved sleeper hit
","Even after its huge success, I can still say this movie is not for all tastes.  But, like almost any Farrelly Brothers movie, the tastelessness factor gets elevated to a work of art.  Of course, it's hard to visualize anything involving Jeff Daniels accidentally taking a gulp of Turbo-Lax and having the worst case of diarrhea (which I believe is the pinnacle of the film, and will ALWAYS make me laugh again and again and again) art, but if you look at the word in a figurative sense and observe how the Farrelys handle each situation with perfect timing and delivery--you'll get what I'm saying.  The Farrelys are underrated geniuses in the comedy genre, who sometimes tend to overdose on the crudeness, but their style of humor is often effective.  Peter and Bobby (Farrely) are aware that these characters are dumb and don't use it as an excuse to have the audiences laughing at them, rather than with them.  Of course, there are moments--like the jalapeno scene where Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are squirting mustard and ketchup into their mouths--that are just plain...dumb.  But this is not a hit-or-miss comedy.  The misses happen only on occasion; the hits happen very often.  The plot is very original.  I'm sure the concept of two simple minds with almost nothing to live for is a concept that's been used before, but it's the way the concept is handled that makes it special.  Most of the time I was either laughing or laughing relentlessly.  Another memorable moment is the Harland Williams, urine-sipping cameo.  That is bound to make you laugh 'til you're senseless!<br/><br/>One minor flaw I found was the soundtrack:  a compilation of melancholy, easy listening crap that would've been appropriate for a seventies melodrama.  I felt the music brought down the mood a tad.  Other than that, the combination of original writing, slick direction and a stellar cast (including some Farrely favorites) is quite a delight.<br/><br/>
My score:  7 (out of 10)"

","Picking a top ten list of the best comedy films ever made is a lot more difficult than, say, picking the best Science Fiction films, War films, Westerns, or many other genres.  Comedy ain't easy to do.  It's tough to sustain a level of hilarity for over an hour and a half, but Dumb and Dumber ranks right up there with the best comedies ever put on film.  It is consistantly hilarious from beginning to end.  A non-stop romp ""buddy"" film in which just as you think it couldn't possibly get any more absurd, it does.<br/><br/>Asked my favorite comedy of all time, it'd still probably be Planes, Trains and Automobiles, oddly enough, another buddy film.  Dumb and Dumber would be in my top three.  Why?  Well, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are simply superb. Carrey has built his entire career on portraying rubber-faced idiots. Daniels, however, has a much more eclectic body of work, but as an idiot, this is absolutely his finest hour.  <br/><br/>This film is rude, crude, obnoxious, loud, uproarious, and if you don't find yourself with tears of laughter streaming down your face at some point, then you're probably either unconscious or asleep. <br/><br/>Daniels graces us with what is the single best toilet scene ever put to film.  In the grand scheme of things, that may not be saying a lot, but compare it to other similar scenes like the one in ""American Pie"" or the farting scene in ""Blazing Saddles"" and you'll get what I'm talking about. If his experience after unknowingly gulping down a bottle of ""Turbo Lax"" doesn't have you howling, then there's something seriously wrong with you.<br/><br/>A very very VERY funny film.

"wforeman","10","0","2","18 August 2000"," THE BEST COMEDY OF ALL TIME
","this was the funniest film i have ever seen. every time i see i cry with laughter. it seems to get better the more times you see it, as more a more jokes become notisable.<br/><br/>
i first watch it at the cinema, back in 94', and i am still watching it today. i must have seen it around 40 times...at least.<br/><br/>
my friends get annoyed as i am allways quoting from the film..and when we watch it they can never hear the film as im quoting over it.<br/><br/>
0ne of my favourite scenes is when jim carry is putting the vibe out at the bar. some of his expressions and movements are cryable<br/><br/>
i don't think there will ever be another comedy that comes close....it's a shame but true.<br/><br/>
10 out of 10 for this hit"

","Dumb and Dumber is absolutely hilarious. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give their best and funniest performances. I have seen this movie 7 or 8 times and it is just as funny the 8th time as it was the first time. I have seen Jim Carrey's other movies, but this one is his funniest ever!!! Overall: 10/10"
"millers16","10","0","2","10 July 2000"," BEST MOVIE EVER
","To keep it simple... this movie is the best ever.  Every single line is quoteable and memorable.  Lloyd Christmas will go down in history as one of the all time greatest characters!  This movie left me only inches away from dawning an Orange Tux to my senior prom.  There may be no better line in any movie than when Lloyd goes, ""Why you goin' to the airport?... Flying somewhere?""  Jeff Daniels is better in this than in any other movie.  I have watched this film at least 20 times and it seems to get funnier every time! It makes me long for a sequel but at the same time I know that the greatness of the original could never be duplicated!"

","I love this movie! I've watched this movie about 10 times and it was just as funny the tenth time as it was the first time.  The gas station scene,when Harry had the ""runs"" and when Lloyd confesses his love for Mary were pure genius!  The ending (I won't spoil it here) was also very hilarious. 10/10!!!!!"

","I just thought of this movie again today..not sure why, though.. I saw it when it was new, and laughed myself silly. I especially remember something close to the end of the movie: Jeff Daniels has to go to the bathroom real bad because of the laxative-laced coffee Jim Carrey gave him. So, he sits down on the toilet and lets loose a riptide of fart sounds... I laughed so hard at that, I screamed and hollered and lost my breath, tears were streaming down my face. Just as I thought I had managed to regain composure, he (Daniels) lets out this little squeaky fart and there's a look of ultimate bliss on his face. Well, I just lost it all over again. At that point, I was very glad that I was in a dark movie theater, so nobody could see me and wonder about my age. (I was 29!!!!) I noticed an earlier comment here saying that Dumb and Dumber is a movie for guys, because it caters to their immature humor. Well, ex-squeeze me, I'm a woman, and I still laugh at body functions!!"
"roger.rumsey","10","0","2","3 March 2000"," Great movie. See it as often as you can.
","The obvious humor of this movie can be seen on the first viewing but it should be seen many times as possible to fully appreciate all of the subtle jokes.  Very witty details that you have to pay attention to notice."
"freddyKruegar","10","0","2","9 February 2000"," This film is defiantly a 10/10
","This is the funniest film i have ever seen in my life and the only film i have watched over 20 times , non-stop laughs makes you cry all the way through , great acting , great comedy, great film 10/10, Go out and buy this film now your video collection will be worthless without it trust me."
"batmite7","9","0","2","7 January 2000"," Still makes me laugh after 6 years...
","I don't know why this still makes me laugh out loud.  I mean, how many times can you see a man go into near prolapse after his best friend filled his glass with laxative?  Well, i admit that has got a little old, but the great dialogue and the amazing (and believable) perfromanaces here will make this movie stand out as one of my favorite comedies of all time. <br/><br/>
One reason this movie will endure is because it doesn't insult the viewer. Alright, maybe the endangered snow owl being killed bya  cork will offend the nature lover, but never will this movie insult your intelligents. (Re: Deuce Bigalow)  The movie works i think because of the reason that these two goofs don't realize what they're doing is so...well, dumb.  They don't get it.  We do, and we laugh.  The movie makes you feel smarter.  And people like being smart.  It works.  Carrey is wonderful here (his only comedy I can stand) and Jeff Daniels is just the good friend following blindly...<br/><br/>Great movie.  Highly recommended."

"Whitdog","10","0","3","9 September 1998"," Two complete idiots in a very smart comedy.
","The first and still the best major release by the Farrelly brothers, Dumb and Dumber can be watched time and time again with the same result: side -splitting laughter.  Despite the hair-brained nature of Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunn, the Farrellys' comedy is a far cry from lowbrow, fall-down slapstick.  Tracking these two morons' trek across the country to return a lost briefcase provides nary a scene without a classic moment.  From Providence to Aspen, they are trailed by thugs, Feds, and boatloads of idiocy.  I laughed, I cried from laughing, I nearly threw up from laughing."
"ITAFilm","9","0","2","25 June 1999"," Destined to be a classic
","Despite being shunned by many, DUMB & DUMBER is one of the brightest, funniest, and well-crafted comedies of the 1990's.<br/><br/>Those who shun this film probably... 1) haven't seen it 2) have seen it only once 3) don't get the humor<br/><br/>Yes, the film has its share (and then some) of scatological humor, but the pure genius of the film is displayed through the intertwining of gags with plot, as opposed to a separation of the two, as evidenced in fodder such as THE WATERBOY and AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME.  D&D uses humor as narrative and not as the sole reward of the film (i.e. the two examples I previously mentioned).<br/><br/>Carrey's physical humor is very reminiscent of a Lloyd (Harold, that is, not Christmas! :) ) ... not to mention, the hard effort that Mr. Carrey put into his performance shows through and transfers to us.<br/><br/>Perhaps when the next generation of film professors begin entering our university's halls, they will be presenting this film as a quintessential example of (well-designed) American comedy of the 1990's."

This is my all time favourite movie, and I must have watched it about 10 times or more. Both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were great in this movie, and you can never stop laughing at their jokes, and their witty sense of humour."

"uds3","Null","0","4","4 April 2002"," This and SCARY MOVIE are two of the funniest films ever made!
","Whatever happened during the making of this film has been captured for all time within its images - the thing just gets funnier however many times you watch it - even if you can recite the entire flick in sync with the actors. Some years ago two of my daughters then 11 and 15, put together without prompting, the entire scene in the restaurant when Lloyd dupes Sea Bass into paying for their meals. Their performance was as good as Carrey's and Daniels. I mention this to show the influence this film has had on kids even that age.<br/><br/>With the passage of time and fifty or sixty viewings, even the crude edges have worn away, leaving a dearly loved film and a comedy I can't see anyone ever topping. It wasn't just funny in places but simply right the way through it. When I saw the original karate sequence when Carrey is wining and dining Lauren Holly, I cracked up in the theater like I have never done before or since..and it takes a lot for me to lose it!<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels, you realise more-so after multiple viewings, has contributed equally to the film in a role totally alien to him, yet the two of them are simply brilliant together. Add to this one of the best soundtracks backing up any film I can recall and you have a grade A winner.<br/><br/>If you don't find this funny, you have no sense of unrestrained humor and I would suggest an immediate cat-scan!"

","As a college student, this movie speaks to me on many levels. Just thinking about some parts make me laugh. The dialogue is so simple--there isn't anything to ""not get,"" and the jokes are thick. It might take 2 times through to hear all the jokes and gags, because I bet for every 2 jokes one sees, there's another one they'll miss. Watch this movie, you'll laugh.

One good thing about this movie is that it never gets boring; I own the video and I still laugh every time I watch it (which is quite often) .<br/><br/>This movie has no serious parts, no cheesy romantic moments or attempts to draw tears.  This is a straight in-your-face silly comedy that starts on the jokes at the beginning and doesn't stop till the very end.

","This was the best movie in '94 and continues to hold its title today. If there was a heavy-weight champion with movies, this one would get it and keep it. We are talking about Ali here. I have watched this movie more than any other movie and the lines never get old. It was the best, is still the best, and will always be the best. A sequal sounds tempting but how many sequals do you know of that are better than the first? It's not hard to add zero with nothing. This was by far Jim Carey's best work and that is pretty good since all of his movies have the best comedy."

","Why?<br/><br/>Well, if you like original jokes (sometimes silly, but hey, what can you expect from 2 dumb guys), nice story and mostly black orientated humor (ahhh, the unforgettable scene with parrot...) than these is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Sure, some will dislike Jim Carrey's impression of Jerry Lewis, although his ""monkey scenes"" goes along in this movie (hmmm, what is hard to say for Pat detective 2 & Me, myself and Irene). Jeff Daniels did his part O.K. too. And yet we must not forget super-sexy Lauren Holly who fitted perfectly for her role. If there will be a little less ""Hollywood-movie-style"" involved, than this movie will certainly  be marked as one of the best comedies ever.<br/><br/>

The movie has many comedic highlights that will make you laugh for a long time. The story is very weak,but most comedies are.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it very much the first time i saw it and also the second time.

But if you are willing to throw plausibility out the window, sit back,relax and take in the funniest antics Jim Carrey has to offer.  When it comes to silly, slapstick, in-your-face funny:  ""Dumb and Dumber"" beats everything ever put on celluloid.  If you giggled at ""Kingpin"", you will fall out of your seat laughing at ""Dumb and Dumber"".

","How can a movie be bad if the more you watch it, the funnier it gets? That basically sums up this masterpiece of comedy! Slightly corny at times, this movie never lets up on the laughs. It's hard for a movie to keep you laughing from start to finish, but this one somehow does it. Too many histarical scenes to mention, but the two that stick out in my mind is when Harry inadvertantly breaks up a fight between Lloyd and a bully they ""swindled"" earlier in the movie and Harry finds Lloyd sucking his thumb in complete fear; and of course, the ""Toilet Scene"" with Harry (I'll leave it at that). The plot isn't fancy, but Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels make you ignore the simplicity of the whole thing because they are so funny together! A born classic, this movie is in my Top Five of all time - and I've seen some very funny movies!"
