"doyles-1","10","60","64","21 November 2005"," Easily the best arm wrestling movie EVER MADE!
","I challenge anyone to find a better arm wrestling movie.<br/><br/>Since becoming a professional arm wrestler and losing my ex-wife, this film has inspired me. <br/><br/>It's not easy being a single dad whilst trying to cope with the rising gas prices to keep my rig on the road.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of Americans find themselves in this position, and they too should benefit from this realistic docu-drama of the typical American man.<br/><br/>To anyone, who find themselves in a similar rut, or experience any type of bad luck, I thoroughly recommend renting this movie, and joining the local arm-wrestling club.<br/><br/>Like I said this is easily the best made arm-wrestling movie, and I look forward to perhaps a left-handed sequel."
"jehn","7","97","107","28 December 2001"," Am I delirious or is this an alright flick?
","I recently remembered seeing this film when I was much younger and liking it.  When I checked it out on IMDb, I was quite disturbed.  Why in the world would I like this weird, arm wrestling movie with Sylvester Stallone?  So I rented it again to see why I had liked it as a kid or to see if I had been delirious when I first saw it.  The strange thing is, even though it is not at all my type of movie, I still really enjoyed it.  I've heard that the kid is a bad actor and all, but I really don't think he is.  Maybe I'm still delirious, but I thought the movie was pretty darn heart warming."
"supereva","Null","42","47","10 October 2000"," This film does what any good 80s movie should
","This film is all about the thrill of seeing Stallone reveal his more 'sensitive' side. Not to mention the great scenes where he works out the rippling biceps of his 'wrestling arm' using an ingenious hand-weight pulley system in the cab of his truck. Sure it's cheesy, but this film does what any good 80s movie should. The part where he turns his cap backwards before a wrestling match is a highlight, symbolising some kind of metamorphosis from sensitive dad to macho man. What a great flick!"
"BeyondRosebud","8","27","30","17 December 2005"," A real crowd-pleaser
","It's hard to dislike Over The Top. Sure, it can get corny, old-fashioned, far-fetched (the gate-crashing scene, fun and unbelievable.) The movie sorta plays like a cross between Highway to Heaven and THe A-Team. But somehow, you find yourself watching despite whatever 'good judgment' you think you might have regarding the cinema. You get swept up in the film's good vibes. You care about what happens to Hawke and his son. Most of the credit for this has to go to Sylvester Stallone. He plays the part of a truck driver coping with the new experience of getting to know his twelve-year-old son for the first time quite well. You care because you sense how much HE cares. it is conveyed by a sure delivery from Stallone. His character never seems too slight or well, too Over the top. There is a bond that slowly forms between him and his son. And the movie has a great ""training"" montage complete with great song that will remind you of what was so good about the Rocky films. David Mendenhall agreeably plays the part of Mike with the combination of distrust, arrogance and vulnerability you would expect from someone his age who went thru what he did.. No, he's not Haley Joel Osmont. We won't leave the movie shaking our heads at his incredible,precocious talent. That doesn't mean he didn't acquit himself nicely in the film. Robert Loggia's role could have been fleshed out a little more. He seems to much like a comic-strip villain. The film could have delved more into his reasons for hating Hawke. that part could have been beefed up a bit. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the Arm-wrestling backdrop. It was a refreshing change for movies of that era that boasted big stars like Stallone. Usually, movies that were sport-specific other than the trad football, baseball, or boxing stories tended to use people who were less known (Gotcha, Gleaning the Cube)<br/><br/>A good film. warm, funny, exciting. The better face of the Eighties cinema."
"robertvannsmith","Null","20","23","29 March 2000"," One Of Sylvester Stallone's Best Movies, In My Opinion
","This movie really touched base with me. I grew up not knowing my father, so I really felt for ""Michael Cutler"", played by David Mendenhall. This was the first thing I remembered seeing David in and I became a big fan of his thru this movie. I identified with his character so much.<br/><br/>If only there would have been a sequel to this movie. (+:"
"nitratestock35","Null","12","13","14 April 2003"," Pure Sly
","Over the Top is pure Sylvester Stallone: the blue collar man with the heart of gold fighting his way through a world that dismisses him as a loser but he wins at the end with the help of someone who really understands and loves him. Same as the Rocky series, same as the Rambo series.<br/><br/>
But I can't help it, I really like Sly. He certainly is no Shakespeare actor but there is that deep honesty he represents in all his flicks and it works. When he first walks into that military school building to fetch his son after cleaning his truck and trying to make himself look his ""Sunday best"" - I can't help it: it is just great.<br/><br/>Yes it is strange to see a well educated kid (by a military school) being transformed into a ""regular guy"" by his own father. But in this film that is only a metaphor. The real meaning is: it's the heart that counts, not the social position. Now that's a message which can't be dismissed as junk that easily. <br/><br/>I love the portraits and short interviews of the arm wrestling contestants. Brilliant. <br/><br/>Probably the best scene is when the (always wonderful) Robert Loggia finally accepts the fact that his grandson loves his dad. The ""villain"" hasn't been beaten. No even better: he has been convinced and transformed.<br/><br/>Over the Top works on two levels: as popcorn entertainment: ""Blue collar hero beats the odds"" and as good old fashioned, almost Frank Capra- like cinema: ""good will always win in the end"". <br/><br/>Bottom line: as with many a Sly flick (any film Sylvester Stallone agrees to participate in or where he actually did the writing, directing etc.)we have to work our way through a popcorn flick to find a deeper meaning. And I say it is there in Over the Top hitting it dead center.<br/><br/>So I'm a Sylvester Stallone fan. Now call me names, I can take it."
"Chugs1124","10","49","63","19 June 2003"," Classic Stallone
","I read one comment that said this movie is boring and lifeless which is a false statement.  This movie is classic Sylvester Stallone and if you enjoyed the Rocky series you will enjoy this also.  There are not many movies out there about arm wrestling but this movie does a great job and who better to star in the role but Stallone.  Their might be some things in this movie that are stupid but it is the kind of stupid you laugh at.  Also the names in this movie are great also, and it is just like a Stallone movie to have great names, but Lincoln Hawk is a great name.  Underdog movies like this are great to watch and no one does them better than Stallone.  The names and the one liners definetly make this movie worth watching. ""When I turn the hat around its like a switch."""
"Nas150","9","50","65","19 January 2005"," I have watched this movie at least 25 times
","Well... I will start by saying that I realize that every movie is not for everyone. That being said, I will say this movie is very much to my liking, I watched this movie in the theater when it was new with my family...we all liked it then & My brothers & I still do to this day. Some of this could be due to the fact that our father was a truck driver & my older brother is a truck driver now as well. Add to that the fact that this is a Stallone movie + having to do with the sport of arm wrestling & you have a winner in my book. Yes I will admit that you know ahead of time what is going to happen in the end, but to me that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of this film (atleast for myself) It also has very touching moments thru out the movie. When Mike's Mother/Stallones x wife in the movie is found to have passed away, wile Lincoln Hawk(Stallone) & his son Mike were on the way to see her still gives me moist eyes every time as well as other situations during the film. Plus the very cool classic Stallone lines that stick in my head to this day.... ""The world meets nobody halfway Mike""...& ""You've gotta do what's best for you""....& the ""I'm thru talking"" response to Mr. Cutler's body guard just to name a few. Yes the movie has the same concept as the Rocky films & the Rambo films with the underdog winning in the end, but come on now who want's to go to the movies & see the hero of the film come up just short in the end. The movie has a good soundtrack as well with Kenny Loggins doing a few of them...Over all it is a simple movie but a great movie, I am looking for it on DVD"
"tarheel777","Null","93","129","31 January 2003"," Forget the wannabe movie critics...
","Some LOVE this movie. I do. I LOVE the soundtrack. You'll see a million posts from ""critics"" on here who will look down their nose at this flick. Do you like a movie? WATCH IT! Forget what these morons say about bad cinematography, etc. Movie-makers create films for one reason -- viewers' pleasure (which brings money). Great 80's movie. Period."
"buff63","7","6","6","13 June 2013"," Nostalgic Gold!
","Are you kidding me? Sylvester Stallone in an arm-wrestling movie? Does it get any better than that? If your balls have not turned into steel after seeing this movie, you're either a woman or... that is the only explanation. Acting? Plot? Cinematography? Who cares? Enjoy 90 minutes of pure testosterone and corniness. ""Over the top"" is without a doubt the most fitting movie title ever. If you enjoy either movies from the 80s, anything that's over the top or just Sylvester Stallone's weird acting and awkward yet somehow touching speeches, than you're gonna have a great time watching this movie. However, if you're not a fan of said things, than you should probably stay away from this masterpiece."
"chrnaess","9","15","18","10 December 1999"," Sylvester Stallone pulls it off
","This movie was one the many good movies that came out in that period, i want to mention Twins(88) and  The Secret to my success(87)in that concern. Over the top gives the same quality entertainment.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone stars and gives a great performance as the man who just wants to get closer to his son. David Mendenhall stars as well, he plays the son and gives a fine performance, the kid was beautiful to watch. The film also have outstanding music which warmed my heart.<br/><br/>All in All this was an entertaining film which made my day."
"dossadam","10","129","192","21 February 2005"," Perhaps the finest 93 minutes of cinema ever produced
","This movie embodies all that I find amazing in a movie. Passion: about a son, a truck, and, of course, arm-wrestling. Sly Stallone deserves an exponentially increased amount of respect for writing this masterpiece. I don't understand how someone can watch this movie and fail to be entertained by the compelling plot and characters.<br/><br/>As a movie from the 80s, Over the Top pretty much represents everything good about the decade. Other than perhaps Rocky IV, this is definitely Stallone's best work. The man is unquestionably a genius. The only part of the movie that is a little far-fetched is when Stallone plows through his father-in-law's gates in a moment of pure man-passion. The unrealistic quality of this scene is obviously the lack of explosion when Stallone's truck hits the gates. This is also an anomaly of the 80s; I think Stallone was going for something unique in a decade of decadence, but I can only hope to comprehend the motives behind any of his films.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend Over the Top for anyone who enjoys classy film."
"Vpirates62","5","29","40","20 March 2001"," The movie that made turning your hat backwards cool!
","I grew up on this movie. This is the first movie I ever recall watching. My grandpa has his own Tractor-Trailer and I always went with him on road trips, so I instantly fell in love with this movie when I saw the truck. Even though it's an old, beaten up, disgusting truck, I would have to say it looks pretty sweet. Lincoln Hawk, played by Sylvester Stallone, is a independent trucker just trying to put his life back together. He realized he made mistakes, and tries to reconcile with his son that he abandoned years earlier. When the boy's grandfather offers Hawk the offer of a life time, and Hawk refuses....it's very clear to him, that he has no other choice but to win, and the determination really shows. Sly acts a bit uninterested in this movie...you can see it in his eyes. Every now and then you can catch his wandering off and not paying attention. If you watch closely, some of the extras often keep there eyes on the camera, and Sly will look at them. Pretty good movie, could have been better, but it's a for sure movie to watch."

","Where were you in 1987?  For those of you can't remember the late 80's was a critical time.  So many issues with the world still flourished.  The cold war still continued,Reganomics,communism,the divorce rate rising, child custody and arm wrestling.  This movie takes the two most important subjects, child custody and arm wrestling, and made one of the most excellent movies of all time.  There movie is absolutely flawless is both style and substance.  If you truly want to look into God's eyes please rent Over The Top.  It just might change your life."
"thereffman","10","5","5","24 February 2018"," One of the best movies ever made
","I watch this movie when I go to bed every night. Well, not every night, I missed one day the other week. Sure, people may think ""Why is Hawk the good guy in this movie?"" But I say to this person ""Who are you, and why are you talking to me?"" But then I tell them ""this is a movie, you have to ignore the fact that Hawk abandoned his dying wife and son, for what reason you say? Well, her dad wasn't a good guy."" Then you may ask ""But Robert Loggia raised the kid as his own, took care of the mother and provided them a good life, Hawk just shows up and takes the kid, why would you support a deadbeat dad?"" I say ""Doesn't matter, he arm wrestles, you can't beat that, I win"" Then we go back and forth and you bring up that he picks the kid up at the military school and 10 minutes down the road they stop at a diner that Hawk frequents and everyone knows him. Well, if he's a regular at a diner that's just a couple miles down the road from where the kid is, why couldn't he attempt to be a dad and a part of his life? To this I answer ""arm wrestling"". You concede this point, because of arm wrestling, and move onto the tournament at the end of the movie. Ignoring the fact that a 12-year old on his own drove to the airport, boarded a plane, flew to the tournament in Vegas and no one had the means to stop him, because all it would take is a 2 minute phone call. So at this double-elimination tournament, which is shouted continuously by the announcer so we all know Hawk will lose at least once, why is everyone who Hawk defeats automatically out of the tournament? The grizzly guy who beats him, we never see him lose again, and who could beat him anyway? He beat Hawk. One loss and he's out. The Canadien guy that loses to the Bull, seems he only lost once and he's out. The black gentleman who looks like he was cheated, lost once and he's out. Bull, only loses once, and he's out. Also, what if the arm wrestler isn't a trucker? What the heck would they do with a tractor trailer? Doesn't matter, because Hawk is a trucker, eat it guys with real jobs. In all, I would rate this movie a 12 out of 10, it shows me what's important in this life. It's not being a good husband to a dying wife who never did anything to deserve it, it's not being a good dad to a son who desperately needs it, it's about arm wrestling. The real tragedy here is that there was never a sequel."
"ngemedjiev","10","62","94","28 November 2004"," Very inspiring!
","I find every movie of Silvester Stallone very inspiring no matter what the critics may say. Maybe because he is the brightest example of a man who reached so much in his life. I am not a truck driver. I am a judge. But I can tell right after the first few minutes of the film how much Mr Stallone got into his character. He is even driving with the gestures of a real truck driver.<br/><br/>I think it takes too much to be an actor of his value, to go deep into his character and to drive a huge truck. And again there comes the idea of physical strength and stamina.<br/><br/>Which I find very inspiring. Not drugs, bad language and manours. Training the body and the mind. Silvester Stallone is one of my inspirations to deal with sports. And I have done it for over a decade now."
"dtrent-2","Null","19","26","23 November 2000"," Sly acts a bit 'un-interested' in some parts of this film.
","Good choice of work for Sly - a trucker. Something 'masculine', on the move. He wrangles with his father-in-law for custody of his son, who thought his dad (Sly) disowned him. To the contrary, grandfather didn't want the boy associating with Sly because he was'nt 'of money' like grandfather was. When Sly's former wife dies of cancer, (Susan Blakely again), Sly sees it as a 'sign' to take his responsibility seriously & raise his son the only way he knows how - take him on the road with him, teach him not to be a spoiled brat all his life, live a little! At first, his son rejects him totally. But later on when he finds out the truth about his dad, he decides he WANTS to be with him. <br/><br/>Yes, the veritable 'macho-sport of arm-wrestling' is thrown in as a way to win big money quick & show-off Sly's ever-bulging muscles. But hey! What's a Sly-film without muscles?? See this one for family entertainment. Sly might be a bit 'wooden' with some of his lines, but the action scenes are typically Sly!"

"ivo-cobra8","10","4","4","27 December 2015"," My all time favorite Stallone's classic action film!
","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an action classic sports drama, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.<br/><br/>Over the Top (1987) I really do believe is an action classic sports drama! This is a great film for what it is and it is ""Over the Top""! This is a movie I always was a big fan of it. I am a just big fan of the film. I used to watch this film over TV when it was on and I used to had a copy on VHS tape, I don't have it anymore, but I will get it on Blu-ray. This movie is directed by one and only Menahem Golan and it was written by Stirling Silliphant and Sylvester Stallone him self. Right after Rocky IV, Rambo: First Blood Part II and Cobra was followed by Over the Top about an arm wrestler father who try to reconnect him self with his son. I Loved this movie as a child and I love it since now! I think Stirling Silliphant did a great job writing a screenplay for this movie, he actually first wrote for Don Johnson - Miami Vice star, when he was so popular in that TV show in the 80's. Stirling Silliphant's presence and screenplay did help a lot of this movie! <br/><br/>I know A lot of people will disagree with me and put my review down but I prefer this movie over Rocky V and Real Steel! Someone wrote on IMDb on Rocky V ""A wonderful movie about father and son"", that would be Over the Top! If you look Rocky V closely, you will probably see, similar story from Over the Top! I know a lot of people are making fun of this movie saying is just ridicules, it is a drama about a father trying to reconnect with his son, it also has an arm wrestling. And I am what makes this movie and the plot more ridicules than Real Steel?, which is a film that got praised and got thumbs up by critics, I would really like to know, because that movie has the same plot and it is even more ridicules. It is about a father trying to reconnect with his son, but it also has robots boxing, boxing robots! That's more ridicules than arm wrestling! Really?, seriously? Real Steel has 60% Rotten Tomatoes, but this was slammed from critics and only got 36% and get's a lover ratings over Real Steel on both sides. And Real steel is a film that basically rips off this movie, does a bad job of it, it's 10 time ridicules than this. It is nearly as much fun and the father is an asshole who was whiling to sole his son. Really? He was whiling to sole his son! In this film Lincoln Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) is not that kind of dad, he would never even remotely thinking of doing that!!! In fact he beats some guys up, who try to takes his so away from him! <br/><br/>So why Real Steel get's the praise?, but Over the Top get's the bashing and get's the crap from critics. I really don't understand, but that just me personally. If you like Real Steel more, that's fine I don't have a problem with that. Over the Top is not your film, that's cool, you don't like it, that's cool I just don't understand it. I just don't understand why this film has such a bad reputation, the same goes with Lethal Weapon 3. Why is Lethal Weapon 2 much more better and bad ass than Lethal Weapon 3, ""oh wait Riggs kills 15 people in 2 and in 3 he only kills less than 5 people. To me that is not the case, I think Lethal Weapon 3 is the same good as the 2 is. The odds are always against this movie.<br/><br/>""The world meets nobody half way. If you want something? You gotta take it."" <br/><br/>Rocky and Rambo star Sylvester Stallone gives fans another reason to stand up and cheer. He stars as hard-luck big-rig trucker Lincoln Hawk and takes us under the glaring Las Vegas lights for all the boisterous action of the World Armwrestling Championship in Over the Top (co-scripted by Stallone). Relying on wits and willpower, Hawk tries to rebuild his life by capturing the first-place prize money - and the love of the son (David Mendenhall) he abandoned years earlier into the keeping of his rich, ruthless father-in-law (Robert Loggia). He matches muscles with some of the game's gargantuan greats - and grips you tightly with a rousing finale in crowd-pleasing Rocky style. Grab hold for rip-roaring fun! <br/><br/>Over the Top is a 1987 sport drama film starring Sylvester Stallone. It was produced and directed by Menahem Golan, and its screenplay was written by Stirling Silliphant and Stallone. <br/><br/>10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

"Robert_duder","9","4","4","26 June 2013"," Bring on the haters because I have always, and still love this movie
","Another reviewer said this about ""Over The Top"", its impossible not to like it. Unfortunately that's not true because even Sylvester Stallone has expressed his disappointment in this film, however I agree with that reviewer!! For me, personally, there is nothing but fun and good memories watching Over The Top. When I was in my early teens discovering Stallone for the first time (he's an icon to me now) this was one of the movies I discovered and fell in love with. It's cheesy and melodramatic and silly and so chock full of 80's Goodness that it seeps with everything I love about a great 80's film. Its also fun and sweet with a good story, great characters and good action (albeit sometimes misplaced action scenes.) I suppose I am simply biased in reviewing this because it is one of those movies from my childhood that I just can't say anything bad about. Stallone being who he is, its inevitable that they would have to put some sort of action scenes in place. Something about him driving his enormous transport through the front gate of his rich father-in-law's mansion and tossing a guy through a plate glass window doesn't exactly fit in with the feel of the film and yet it works because he's Stallone. Inevitable comparisons to Rocky are warranted as this is a terrific underdog story which Stallone is perfect for.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is a love him or hate him kind of actor. I love him! His charisma is undeniable and his quiet determined but fallible Lincoln Hawk is a great character. He is far from perfect but trying to make amends and has this solid determination that is endearing. David Mendenhall is just nearly the perfect 80's kid. He is spoiled and bratty but you root for him to come around and connect with his father. His acting ability isn't perfect but for this type of movie he fits it so well. The chemistry between him and Stallone is surprisingly spot on. I would consider Robert Loggia a terrific character actor. He has been in some phenomenal and classic films. He is perfect in this movie as the overbearing and demanding rich Grandfather. He is the perfect adversary for Hawk and the only problem is there isn't enough of him. He's actually underused in many ways. Rick Zumwalt is the brutish, muscle bound arm wrestling champion. He is okay but he really is just the muscle that Stallone has to beat without any real character behind him. He's like a wrestler and he's there to look menacing and larger than life and he does that well.<br/><br/>Menahem Golan churned out movies like few other directors. He is like the king of B-Action flicks. You would probably not even recognize any of them. Still he clearly knows the cookie cutter recipe for making an 80's flick. He knew his demographic and he knew who he was working with (rumour has it that he just kept offering Stallone more and more money until he said yes) and he doesn't pretend that Over The Top is anything more than it is. Its not pretentious and doesn't try to shove the story down your throat. It is a simple, fun, sweet movie that is ultimately very uplifted. And the soundtrack...is there literally another 80's movie that just reeks of 80's music like this one? Its all original music for the film and it is literally quintessential 80's. Meet Me Halfway by Kenny Loggins has gotta be one of the greatest 80's theme songs in the world and it nearly chokes me up every time I hear it. It is absolutely true that this film is overly sentimental to me so I am probably reviewing it better than what it might actually be to most. But I simply can't deny the sweet and fun quality of the film. I recommend it to everyone, especially Stallone fans because it has so much heart. Plenty of action and the arm wrestling just makes it even more fun. You can't go in expecting an Oscar worthy classic but just sit back and enjoy because it is simply fun. 9/10"
"snksaint","10","12","16","10 October 2005"," people who don't like this movie are brainless or heartless
","that is all what i have to say, if you don't like this movie, please retire, you don't have nothing to do in the movie world. Movies are simply not for you. This movie is one of the best Stallone's. Its touching, sentimental with a lot of action and a central subject pretty unusual and interesting. Forget arm wrestling because thats not the point of the movie, neither are the trucks. Thats only the address to the salad. The important thing is the father-son relationship and the way Sly rebuilds it. Who cares if to make money and support his son he has towin an arm wrestling championship or a micro-machine race? for gods sake! Please try to see the mean point of the plot, don't be that superficial.<br/><br/>Anyway, arm wrestling screenplay and all related to it was simply so good, so there is no reason to not enjoy this movie, and i don't neet to mention the amazingly good soundtrack.<br/><br/>Rates for this movie should be reset and started from 0 again, after some people re-see this movie and reflect I'm sure it would get a much higher score."

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","3","3","18 October 2019"," My personal favorite Stallone movie an underdog Rocky one of his best underrated movies I have seen
","I can't believe you people have dare you insult this movie? If u don't like it fine. I don't need haters in my life because I love this film. This is sports drama of the underdog in arm wrestling. Here is the best of the best and deals with the real world and trouble, mistakes and real world problems. Over the Top is Stallone's underdog Rocky one of his best underrated movies I have seen. This is my personal favorite favorite Stallone movie of all time.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this film as a kid I did not like it: because I saw this kid David Mendenhall playing Michael Hawk who was against his will taken in to custody on the road with his estranged father. That kid Michael was like me, my father was taking me on a road trip against my will after school. My father was a selesman, he was taking me from school on a road sell trip. I still remember I waited hours in a back sit in a car my father with two dogs. Sylvester Stallone was following me around because I remember me having a Rambo knive toy and mostly playing my self John Rambo the fugitive with knife against cops. Like Michael I did not like my dad even now I don't like him a lot and his actions. My father is a drunk, of course Michael's dad was not a drunk he made a mistake by walking away and abandoning his son. Michael loved his mom just like me. Just like Michael's my mom died mine died too when I was an adult. But now as an adult I try to get buy with my hard life and I adore this classic cheese 80's sports drama movie.<br/><br/>Over the Top has a similiar story like mine has. but the movie is about father and son. Lincoln Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) is the underdog. He lost everything years ago and now he is fighting to get it all back. He fights for his son costudy, against Michael's grandfather and he sign in to an arm wrestling tournament to win it all. To fight againts five tiime champion as Bob ""Bull"" Hurley (Rick Zumwalt).<br/><br/>This is Sylvester Stallone's best performence like Cobra (1986) it is part of Cannon Group. inc. It is one of the best underdog Stallone movies. Like Rocky Balboa - Lincoln Hawk and Sylvester Stallone is the underdog. Sly is incredible actor and I grew up with this movie. There is Real Steel film that copy's this movie remades it and makes it a lousy job. Hugh Jackman play the same character as Stallone does in here, just his character is a selfish prick he was willing to sole his own son! In this movie Lincoln Hawk would never sole his son, he even fight off three thugs to save his son. Rick Zumwalt as Bob ""Bull"" Hurley was excellent as Hawks oponent. It is a tragedy he is no longer with us anymore I fell bad for his family David Mendenhall as Lincoln's son was the best in this movie great acting from late actor. Robert Loggia was fantastic as Lincoln's enemy for life.<br/><br/>It is not Rocky, but it is a sports drama about arm wrestling and father and son relationship. This movie is MILES way better than Rocky V (1990) in my opinion. Over the Top has great songs: Meet Me Half Way - Kenny Loggins and Winner Takes It All by Sammy Hagar. It was beautiful directed from Menahem Golan. I still till it's day I don't understand why is this movie hate it and bashed from critics and haters. Hold only 27 % on Rotten Tomatoes, but Real Steel holds 60% on Rotten Tomatoes and that movie is better than this? I don't think so!<br/><br/>I will always choose Over the Top (1987) over Real Steel and over any new upcoming movie nowdays. This movie is classic and it is a golden year for Stallone. Just like Jean-Claude Van Damme in Lionheart is the underdog. In my opinion both of the action stars are the underdog actors of action movies. I love this movie to death sue me. The acting it is not bad it is better than nowdays. Those kids in which Michael is arm wrestling are better kids than nowdays are. Nowdays this year kids are awful, they are horrible thugs brats they suck and I hate them. I hate now days the youth. P<br/><br/>R.I.P Rick Zumwalt, Robert Loggia and Menahem Golan you are all missed. This si my personal favorite Stallone movie of all time."
"brandonmatzke-69819","8","3","3","7 November 2016"," Stupidly genius.
","Over The Top is bad. It's corny. Every actor (except for Stallone) acts like they had 50 gallons of coffee before filming. Not to mention, the script is extremely formulaic and cheesy. And that's exactly why I love it. It's flaws make it even more entertaining, it's hyperactive attitude makes it brilliant, and it's corny script makes it work like magic! I mean, it's just ARM WRESTLING, but the film acts like it's curing cancer! I personally find it to be a guilty pleasure. Far from Stallone's best (look at the Rocky franchise for that), but still entertaining enough to hold a spot on anyone's collection. But seriously watch Rocky first."

","***SPOILERS*** Another one of the many Sylvestor Stallone meek common and simple man winning against astronomical odds like films that he made in the 1970's and 1980's has Sly playing soft spoken and inoffensive looking, until you try to mess with him, trucker Lincoln Hawk. Hawk has been summoned by his dying, from a serious heart operation, ex-wife Christina, Susan Blakley, who wants him to reunite with the couples 12 year old son Michael,David Mendenhall, whom he hasn't seen since birth! Of course Michael who's attending military school wants nothing to do with his dad feeling that he deserted him and his mom because his control freak Grandpa Jason ""Cut-throat"" Cutler, Robert Loggia, has been feeding him all kinds of crap about his dad for as long as he could remember.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for Hawk to win little Michael over in his revealing to him, when he's challenged by some muscle bound dude at a local truck stop, his secret life as a big time arm wrestling champ. That together with teaching Michael to drive his 18 wheeler, without a license, down the highway had the boy finally look up to his absentee, for some 12 years, poppa as the man he'd like to be when he grows up! This all turns sour when finally getting to the hospital to see mom Michael finds out that she passed away without him being able to say a final good-by to her! Holding his pop responsible for being too late, by driving to the hospital with his dump truck not flying there with Grandpa, to see his mom alive he suddenly doesn't want to have anything to do with him. <br/><br/>The movie takes another turn for the worst for Hawk when in desperation to see Michael he power drives his rig straight into Grandpa Jason's mansion totally demolishing the place. Gramps declines to press charges against Hawk only if he gets out of both his and Michael's lives which Hawk, in avoiding the slammer, grudging agrees to. Now really on the outs with Michael the only thing left for Hawk to do is win the world champion arm wrestling contest at Las Vegas. That's where the down and out Hawk can finally prove to himself Michael and the world, as well as Grandpa Jason, that he's not the loser in life that everyone says he is. There's also the fact that Michael later finds hundreds of letters, including Christmas birthday and get well cards, from his pop that he sent him over the years that Grandapa hide from him! That proves to Michael that Poppa Hawk was indeed the sweet and caring person that he always told him he was! It also proved that Grandpa Jason wasn't that bright by leaving the letters out in the open, and not burning them, for his grandson Michael to find.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** The big final has lots of grunting and grinding among the sweating arm wrestling contestants at the Las Vegas Convention Hall with Hawk, sprained arm and all, taking on all comers as he works his way up to the #1 match with world arm wrestling champ, for five years straight, the 6 foot 4 inch 350 pound Bob ""Bull"" Hurley played by actual arm wrestling champion Rick Zumwalt. It's then that Michael, who ran away from home, shows up at the tournament together with Grandpa Jason, who's trying to get him back home, which turns out to be the turning point in this earth shattering and arm breaking arm wrestling match! That's by his son Michael giving Hawk the push that he needed to get it ""Over the Top"" and finally, after all the grunts groans and broken fingers & bones, winning the damn contest!"
"Cobra2003","6","3","3","16 September 2003"," Nice little Cannon Films stand in for Rocky
","Nice is the word. Over the Top is a good example of Sylvester Stallone stepping away from the trappings of Rocky Balboa and John Rambo, and trying to create a movie the whole family can enjoy. Sure, the whole family may have enjoyed the Rocky movies but the violence of those films at best is toned down to mute here. Unlike the Rocky series with Boxing, Over The Top doesn't square its attention solely on this movies sport, Arm wrestling. So, there is plenty of room for deep rooted character developement. Unfortunately, Over The Top doesn't present us with this, and what we have is a Cannon Pictures knock off version of The Champ (1979), with Stallone and Sterling Silliphant's screenplay spreading on the sentimentality very thickly. We are presented with a screenplay remeniscent of the sentimental moments from the bulk of Slys career. And for the majority of the time it works remarkably well. Sly proves that he can act, making Lincoln Hawk (a typically mach named Stallone character), a likeable, funny and sincere character, so that you dont for one minute doubt the values of Hawk and the good man he is. The hard work Stallone puts into Hawk is completely obliterated by a terrible cliched performance by David Mendenhall as Hawks long lost son Mike. A typical spoilt bratt, you wish Sly would beat the life out of Mendenhall ala Rocky VS Drago in the closing moments of Rocky IV, at one or two times during the movie. Mendenhall has NO redeaming features and compliments the movie zero. It would have perhaps been better had someone like Sean Astin or Macauly Culkin played the part of Hawk's son. The sentimentality comes in the form of Susan Blakely as Hawk's estranged and dying wife, and this once again is a burden to the movie, because the scenes, handled with too much syrup by director Menahem Golan go too far over the top (no pun) to try and reach your tear ducts. Despite this everything pays off. The Arm wrestling scenes are handled efficiently by Golan, and come close to the heart pumping heroics of the Rocky movies, and Georgio Moroders 80's Rock score is as good (and dated) as anything Vince Di Cola and Survivor did for Messers Balboa and Drago. And i would defy even the most ardent of cynics not to root for Hawk in the movies macho encrusted arm wrestling finale. An efficient fammily/adventure movie, that is good to pass the time with, but for sheer class, watch the Rocky movies.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I actually quite liked Over the Top. The story of the kid and Stallone was pretty deep if you look at it closely. The idea of Arm Wrestling being a major part of a movie sounds stupid, but Stallone plays it pretty well. Some of the acting in this is pretty bad, but some of it is pretty good. Also, the sound track a excellent (Sammy Hagar - Winner Takes It All was the best). Overall, I give it 3.5/5 for being a good movie, but not excellent"

","This movie is great. It combines all the drama of a child custody case with arm-wrestling! Stallone is ultra-cool and the soundtrack is superb.

","This is a quite good heartwarming movie. In this movie Stallone plays a man who has separated from his wife. She is on her deathbed and she asks him to visit their son and get to know each other. Together they go into a trip to visit the kids mother and we watch them as their relationship develops. He is a man that has realized the fact that leaving his wife and son behind was a sign of weakness and tries to mend the bad he has done to his son. The arm-wrestling competition element in this movie is just the icing in a Rocky type of movie. The message of this 80's action drama is that ""The world meets nobody halfway."", which is so true, as most adults already know. We make mistakes and problems will always arise, but we just have to keep on pushing forward. Believe it or not this is a family movie! And a good one I might add."

It very entertaining! Check out Menahem Golan's IMDb's page. His resume is very impressive. These directors of; Over the Top, Delta Force, Kickboxer, and Bloodsport, and even Cobra really know what they are doing, they know how to make an action flick. And to finish my babble, Watch Over the Top, you will not regret it!"

","Stirling Silliphant wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for 1967's In the Heat of the Night, as well as The Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure, Village of the Damned, Telefon, The Enforcer, Shaft In Africa and more than 700 hours of prime-time television drama to his credit. He was also a close friend and student of Bruce Lee, who he featured in the movie Marlowe and four episodes of the series Longstreet. They also worked together on a script called The Silent Flute, which was eventually filmed as Circle of Iron.<br/><br/>Those are some pretty amazing credits. Somehow, someway, he eventually found himself working with Sylvester Stallone to write the screenplay for the movie that would take arm wrestling from the bar to the mainstream. And who was ready to direct?<br/><br/>None other than Cannon Group co-owner Menahem Golan, the director of Delta Force, Enter the Ninja and The Apple. Yes, that Menahem Golan.<br/><br/>Lincoln Hawk (Stallone) is a man trying to rebuild his life. While he does that, he's driving a truck and arm wrestling. His ex-wife Christina (Susan Blakely, My Mom's a Werewolf, The Concorde ... Airport '79) wants him to bond with their son Michael (David Mendenhall, Space Raiders, Streets and the 12-year-old drug dealer in the Diff'rent Strokes episode where Nancy Reagan shows up), because she knows that she's dying.<br/><br/>Michael's been in military school and calls everyone sir. His grandfather, Jason Cutler (this movie is yet another in my question to see every film with Robert Loggia in it) hates Hawk and never wanted him in their family.<br/><br/>On the way from Colorado to California, Michael comes to love his father, who teaches him how to arm wrestle and be a man. Yet when they get to the hospital, Christina is already dead. Michael blames his father for not getting to see his mother before the end and goes back with his grandfather. Hawk tries to break him free but gets arrested. If the mansion that Cutler lives in looks familiar, that's because it was also the home of The Beverly Hillbillies.<br/><br/>Michael visits him in jail, informing Hawk that he will stay with his grandfather, so our hero leaves to compete in the World Armwrestling Championship in Las Vegas, which has the prize of $100,000 and a brand new, larger semi-truck. He then makes a desperate bid by selling his truck and placing a $7,000 bet on himself at twenty to one odds to win it all. Then Michael finds the letters that everyone kept from him, with Hawk writing him for years and trying to connect.<br/><br/>Hawk advances to the final eight, but suffers his first loss in the double-elimination tournament and hurts his arm. Cutler summons our hero and tells him that he's always been a loser, but he'll give him $500,000 and a better truck than the prize if he leaves forever.<br/><br/>Hawk refuses and makes it to the finals, taking on his rival, the undefeated Bull Hurley. His son finds him and gives him the emotional energy he needs to survive, just as Hawk doesn't only beat Bull, but gains his respect. Somehow, Cutler gets over ten years of being a complete jerk and is happy about Michael and Hawk being reunited, because that's how eighties movies work. Oh yeah -- the guys get so sweaty in the final battle that they have to get the strap, with people going wild for it. It's pretty amazing and you'll yell ""Get the strap!"" too.<br/><br/>If you're into pro wrestling, Terry Funk, Reggie Bennett and Scott Norton both show up here (Ox Baker, who was in Escape from New York, as well as Manny Fernandez and The Barbarian almost made it into the movie). There are also plenty of professional arm wrestlers, like professional arm wrestling personalities such as Allen Fisher, John Vreeland, Andrew ""Cobra"" Rhodes, John Brzenk (who inspired the story) and Cleve Dean.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is astounding. You've got Kenny Loggins singing ""Meet Me Halfway"" numerous times, some Giorgio Moroder, some Asia, some Robin Zander, some Eddie Money and Sammy Hagar singing ""Winner Takes It All,"" which was also made into a music video to promote the film.<br/><br/>The film received three nominations at the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards in 1988. David Mendenhall won two for both Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star, which seems kind of crappy for them to abuse a kid. Sylvester Stallone was nominated for Worst Actor, an award he's won four times, but this time he lost to Bill Cosby in Leonard Part 6.<br/><br/>Stallone has claimed that if he had directed this, he would've changed the setting to an urban environment, used scored music instead of rock songs, and made the Las Vegas finale more ominous. So why was he in it? He answered, ""Menahem Golan kept offering me more and more money, until I finally thought, ""What the hell - no one will see it!""""<br/><br/>Speaking of Stirling Silliphant, he only did the screenplay. Actor/writer Gary Conway (American Ninja 2: The Confrontation) and director/writer David Engelbach (America 3000, Death Wish II) created the original story. Engelbach cried when he saw the finished movie, remarking that his original draft ""wasn't nearly as dumb as the final film and that it was more about truck driving and arm-wrestling than it should've been.""<br/><br/>When this movie came out, my brother and I were in our early teens and couldn't wait for it. There was an entire line of toys that had knobs in their backs that allowed them to arm wrestle and even better, an actual competition table. We begged our parents for it nearly every single day for six months, but our mother continually just told us to use an actual table. She had no vision. At this point, I could have a father in law that hates me, a bedridden ex-wife and a son who doesn't know me, but I could flash anyone and put their arm down in no time. Get the strap!<br/><br/>Even more magical, fifty miles from the filming of this movie, Sergio Martino had assembled an Italian/American crew to create Hands of Steel, the only Road Warrior by way of The Terminator truck driving movie that also has arm wrestling in it. Coincidence? Do you know anything of Italian cinema?"

"matatosky","9","2","2","15 May 2016"," Still a classic and still a Sly Stallone gem
","OK, so this one doesn't get mentioned a lot when you're listing Stallone movies out loud. Rocky, Rambo, Cobra are the ones who come to mind quick and true to the fact that they are all rightfully legendary in their own right. Any one familiar with Stallone from the 70's, 80's and 90's can mention those 3 right off the bat. I am a HUGE Stallone fan. I love the guy more than I love my biological father (don't even ask). So, when I ask guys who are familiar with him to name a few of his movies, Over the Top is never mentioned and that....really annoys me. Over the Top is not a film that was meant to win an Oscar, if you'll pardon the pun to Sly's comedy masterpiece, but it sure should have turned some heads. Think about it, it's 1986. Rocky and Rambo have happened. Schwarzenegger has had The Terminator and Commando out. They are Hollywood's Go-to Action stars at the moment. So when Stallone decides to do this little film, which he acknowledges that he only made because it was quite a lot of money offered to him and he knew the role nor the script were anything special, you gotta love his efforts here. If it hadnt been Stallone in this, I probably wouldn't cherish it as much as I do. The movie is an 80s hidden gem. Why? OK, take it for what it is, and what do you have? A touching story about an everyday trucker who wishes to win an arm wrestling competition to gain the trust and respect of his son. Is that not noble enough? Apparently not to most. The movie has a beautiful message that CAN still be translated to today, but people will discard it because of their dislike for Stallone. Personally, I agree that Stallone's acting is not for everyone but to me, it is like Sushi, meaning that it is not for everyone and some people hate it incredibly but does that mean it's terrible? NOPE. Not at all. It is just a matter of taste. Stallone has always had a way of inspiring you through his roles, making underdogs believably outnumbered and surprisingly heroic, if Rocky and Rambo are not prime examples of that, I don't know what is. Back to the movie, it displays pretty strong acting from the kid who plays Stallone's son. May I remind you that before this movie, the kid did a lot of voice work?? Not too bad a transition, as well as Robert Loggia who looks very sinister EVEN in playing a well respected and powerfully influencing figure who can even disrespect heads of a military prep academy without batting an eye. Thats about it for the acting portion, which Stallone carries beautifully as much as an 80s hot action star can. Then there's the score for this film. Personally, I think it is wonderful. As a kid, I fell in love with ""Winner takes it All'' and ''Meet me Halfway'' just because they sounded cool, cant say the same for the other tracks their respective singers put out but these ones were nice. Giorgio Moroder, whom a lot of us PACINO fans know, produced most of the Scarface film score. Now, this one doesn't have the bouncy and hacky Disco feel that Scarface did, rather than it holds a combo of power rock and synth laden riffs to make it sound like either a video game or a legitimate sports competition being broadcast. It fits very nicely though, considering the premise of the movie. To me, Over the Top is a childhood memory that I will always treasure. Watching it on DVD now, still gives me nostalgia and like I said, had it been another person playing Lincoln Hawk, I wouldn't have seen it twice. Sylvester Stallone is just such a unique and talented individual, that only he can give a character the toughness and vulnerability at the same time that he needs to make a movie inspirational and he continues to prove it EVEN after all these years, as he wins the Golden Globe for Rocky Balboa in a terrific movie called Creed, so if you cant value his talent and ability, then you just hate the guy out of sheer petulance. If you expected this to be Ben Hur or something, then you really don't know anything about cinema and only watch mainstream movies that mostly don't mean anything. Over the Top will always be a good little movie to watch, even if you're not a fan of the sport or the actor."

","I think its unfair most of the criticism here focuses on superficial aspects. At the same time this shows that the actual qualities of this movie lies within its message. I admit the story isn't quiet realistic and the acting is not special but this movie is not like movies are nowadays. Its not a hype-realistic documentary about a father's life and his relationship to his son. Its rather a modern fairytale with focuses on the message its trying to bring across (which is predominantly the same message as in Rocky but in a more metaphoric way) alongside with portraying the type of a sympathetic warm hearted and sensitive man that is also strong and has his principles .. yes, both at the same time. Its a movie that will appeal to people who like warm hearted and emotional stories about underdogs fighting their way to success by the help of those that believe in them.

","Sylvester Stallone, one of my 'obsessions' (along with Tom Berenger), wonderfully plays an ""armwrestler"" named Lincoln Hawk whose fighting for ""custody"" of his son. Sly lives life ""according to his own rules"". His ex-wife died (I felt so 'bad' for him!), & her family doesn't want him taking care of the kid. Sly's son doesn't want to 'live' with him either, but Lincoln slowly wins him over on a long truck ride, when they find out that they truly can ""get along"".

"tomgillespie2002","Null","3","4","15 May 2011"," Predictable but fun, with an absorbing father-son story at its heart
","Awww....the 1980's. A time that seems so quaint. A time when problems could be quite easily solved with muscle and sport. Just the fact of winning could bring you the girl of your dreams, the many material wealth that you could hope for. Or, in the case of Over the Top, it could win the affections of the son you abandoned ten years ago.<br/><br/>Stallone brings his laconic acting style to this late-80's Rocky-style tale of a working class dad who left his wife and son in undisclosed circumstances ten years previously. His ex-wife was the daughter of a very rich man (played by Robert Loggia), weirdly never to see his son again. She is, at the start of the movie dying of heart failure. Their son, Mike (David Medenall), has been educated in a military school. Christina's (Susan Blakely) last wish is that Mike;s father drive him to the hospital to see her so that they may get to know each other. So the working class trucker (Stallone) arrives at the military school to know his father. A quite founded concept considering he has not seen him for years and the fact that his grandfather (Robert Loggia) has fed him false stories about his dads misconduct.<br/><br/>So begins the obvious, clichÃ© ridden tale of father-meets-son, son- hates-father, but all ends well!! But, I have to say, this is the first time that I have watched this movie since it was released on video, either in 1987 or 1988, and I cannot say that I did not enjoy it. There is an endearing quality in the growing relationship between father and son. Maybe this is the drink talking, but I enjoyed its utterly silly machinations. The main crux of the film is pivoted on the competition that Licoln Hawk (Stallone's character), is planning to compete in in Las Vegas. A world Arm wrestling competition. A very working class style of machismo, that would win the heart of any son (sic).<br/><br/>After the death of Christina (Mikes mother/Lincolns ex-wife), the grandfather is determined to get custody of Mike. Something which is highly likely considering the fact that he is rich, and Lincoln is utterly poor. Despite earning the trust of Mike, Lincoln is abandoned by Mike, and is left alone to compete in the competition. He pawns his truck (the only form of income he has) before entering, and bets all the money on himself to win, he hopes to win the $10,000.00 prize, along with the uber-smart truck on offer.<br/><br/>There are many inconsistencies in the film, but they fall to the side. It's a completely absurd concept, yet I found myself totally absorbed in the growing relationship between father and son. Now this is certainly not something I would have come across as I watched as an 11 year old child. Maybe age has rendered me pathetic! This was the main focus as I watched the film. I mean, we can't genuinely for one second believe the performance of Stallone; he just plays the same role he always did. The use of bad, almost incomprehensible speech, with the dour eyes and wonky mouth. but his performance is a little touching! (I just vomited in my mouth!).<br/><br/>OK, so we all know the end result, even if we have not seen the film. All is well (just like in real life - ha ha). Well, anyway. Lincoln makes it to the Las Vegas competition, where there is hot competition. He is a newcomer to the event, so odds are against him.<br/><br/>I have to give special comment to the arm wrestling contender John Grizzly. There are snippets of interviews with some contestants who give comment. Gotta love Grizzly's one: ""When I get to the table, I don't care who they are, they're my mortal enemy. I hate them"". So direct. The final 'battle' (if you like), or if it were musically challenged, the montage, is the most fun part (well, of course). It's f*****g stupid; but it's silly fun. As Lincoln steps up to meet the final challenge, a huge mammoth of a man. It is dubbed a competition of David and Goliath; a clear parallel to the American/Russian paradox in Rocky IV, just without the political content.<br/><br/>Well, it's pretty obvious that the final arm wrestling match is barely about the winning of money and trucks; it is in fact the chance for Stallone to not only win the money, but the get to buy his son back from his rich granddad. Oh, how money buys you happiness! It is a kind to the perfect 1980's strategy. Money buys you love - f**k the Beatles concept said the '80's. Yes it can!! Just see John Hughes' Weird Science for proof of this analogy! Haha. It is a massive shame on my general moral and ethical opinion, that I actually enjoyed watching this film. I didn't even want to punch the child-actors face considerably. now that is a novelty in any film where the kid is prominent!<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"cibyll-1","7","3","4","20 February 2008"," Classic!!!
","Stallone made his best in the 80's. These ""forever young"" movies like Cobra, Rambo and of course this one are the essence of an actor who made a lot of things possible for his fans. Stallone will never be Al Pacino, but we never wanted this. His character and face gives us everything in his well known films. Akction and emotion are together in Over the top too. Lincoln and his son's story are one of the best in the Cannon-Era. Directed by Menahem Golan with good cinematography and very good, retro soundtrack. It's more than 20 years since this movie came out but I still say, it's worth to see, and wonder how the peace full years of the 80's were! Great remembrance!"

","I had originally started looking for this movie because I am a huge Stallone fan and my gym teacher had recommended this one. I couldn't find it in any of the movie stores around me so I made a list of other Stallone movies to look for. While in the Science Fiction section I found this movie for brand new like a blessing from God. I didn't know what to expect and wouldn't care anyway because Stallone's movies appeal to me in some way. However at the end of this movie, all I could think was: ""Man, that was one of the most surprisingly good movies I've ever seen."" The story was heart-warming the action was suspenseful, even the acting was top notch. It was a unique movie on an entirely different level.<br/><br/>********* out of ********** = 9/10 - Must see for Stallone fans!"
"ryder_78","10","3","4","10 December 2006"," Best All-Time American Classic
","I have grown up watching Stallone as a kid. From his untouchable blockbuster movies(Rambo & Rocky) to the most recent Rocky Balboa in its 6th iteration, Sly has carved a name for himself as a legend in American movie history, putting him alongside the late Christopher Reeves in portraying the all-time greatest American hero in Superman. All these great classic movies will never fade in time and would be still enjoyed by generations to come.<br/><br/>Over The Top remains the best under-rated movie I've ever seen with a great powerful storyline that conveys strength, love and sacrifice coupled with great action and drama as with most Stallone's works. Even after 20 years since I first watched the film as a 9 year old kid, memories of my 'idol' going against all odds in arm-wrestling battles are still fresh in my mind. Nobody on earth can portray the underdog hero better than the man himself(not even Arnie!!)and Sly shows he is more than just rippling muscles by showing his tender side as a lone father with a child.<br/><br/>I will always remember the final battle between Sly and the big guy. Although his nemesis's biceps are probably twice in diameter compared to SLy's(it's like pitting a golf stick with a fat baseball bat), Sly came out tops. I've forgotten if Sly broke the guy's arm, but hey it's been 20 years and I can still recall bits and pieces of the storyline so it's not that bad!!<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie and kudos to Sylvester Stallone in bringing great characters to life. Age seems to be catching up but looks like there's no stopping this man!"
"Nightmare-Maker","10","3","4","21 September 2006"," Over The Top
","I absolutely love this film, I watched it ever since it came out in the video shops (back in '88) - (I must have seen this at least 150 times - I ain't lying!). Sly hasn't seen his son (Mike) since he was born, split from his mother (who is dying from cancer, and has a couple of days to get Mike there to see her), hated by his sons rich Grandfather - and earns a living as a trucker. He has a few days to make up 12 years to his son - who totally resents him for never being there when he needed him! But he has two problems - Mike's grandfather! - And the World Arm-Wrestling Championship, on the horizon.<br/><br/>It has an awesome soundtrack, Sammy Hagars Winner Takes It All is Great!. If you like Sly's ROCKY films your sure to love this, predictable but a a brilliant hour and a half's viewing time. Also a mention to the great Rick Zumwalt, who plays Sly's adversary Bob 'Bull' Hurley in the movie - who sadly passed away a couple of years ago (He was actually the real World Arm-Wrestling Champion when the movie was made)"
"colosso777","8","3","4","14 July 2006"," Pretty damn sweet!!!
","This is totally my kind of movie. So, yes my review will be biased, but I really enjoyed this movie. Rick Zumwalt played an excellent adversary. I watch all of these hero/tough-guy action movies and I must say that ""Bull"" did an excellent job at playing the cocky intimidator. I do think that Sly could have been a little more emotional(during the interview at the end of the movie), but overall he did an okay job. Also, I find it amusing how the bad guys from 80s movies get cycled through- ex. some of Robert Loggia/Jason Cutler's security guys where also the adversary's extra manpower in Road House. Finally, I would've like to see more of Jimmy Keegan. Anywho, this movie is a must for any action buff."
"sveknu","8","3","4","24 June 2006"," Great job by Stallone here
","Maybe Sylvester Stallone isn't exactly the best actor around, but in this one I think he was very good. He just fit perfectly the part of the rather calm and sometimes emotional truck driver he was playing. The story in this movie is pretty good, and also it has a whole lot of the best the 80's had to offer. A great example is the film's soundtrack, it's truly great. The arm-wrestling championship was really entertaining, and some of the guys there were really cool.<br/><br/>Even though this is partly a drama movie, it should only be considered as mindless, total fun that only the decade of the 80's was able to perform."
"Bringthelynx","Null","3","4","29 April 2003"," What did you expect?
","I saw this movie (in it's entirety) today, and I have to say....I enjoyed it. When you watch it you know you're seeing a bad movie. However, it falls into the category of ""so bad its good"". If you ask me, it's one of the top movies of that kind. Sly's character in this movie is so pathetic that you can't help but empathize with him. The only thing that keeps him going in his worthless life is his son, who is actually very bratty and whiny.<br/><br/>All in all, Over The Top is a classic piece of 80's film making. It combines cheesy dialogue and scenarios with a terrible soundtrack, yet you can't help but to continue watching it. Which is what a good movie is all about, being able to watch it til the end and enjoying it while doing so..."

","Although Over the Top may be considered the Citizen Kane of arm wrestling movies, there is a slight plot flaw which renders it less than perfect.  The arm wrestling world championships are a double elimination tournament (Lincoln Hawk loses once on the way to the championship), but Bull Hurley is defeated only once when Lincoln Hawk is crowned champ.  I guess they correctly guessed that in the euphoria of Hawk's incredible underdog win, almost no one would notice."
"Hey_Sweden","6","1","1","14 April 2020"," Could you ever doubt Sly?
","Sly Stallone is once again in his element, in this memorable example of formula filmmaking from Cannon Group head honcho Menahem Golan. The star plays Lincoln Hawk, an independent trucker who'd left his wife (Susan Blakely) and son (David Mendenhall) years ago. Now, 10 years later, she is on her death bed, and urges him to make up for lost time. So Lincoln and young Michael do their best at bonding, while Lincoln prepares for an event that could make him or break him: winning the World Arm Wrestling Championship. Lincoln must also compete with Michaels' arrogant, filthy rich grandfather (a scenery chewing Robert Loggia) for the boys' affections.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie is better than its reputation. It worked for this viewer because it wasn't *just* about arm wrestling. For its first two thirds, anyway, it's a fairly compelling and touching story of a dad who knows he screwed up and is now determined to atone for his mistake. The father-son relationship will obviously get off to a ""rocky"" start, but will improve as the story progresses. (The movies' script is credited to Stirling Silliphant and Sly himself, based on a story by David Engelbach and veteran actor Gary Conway.)<br/><br/>The final third that focuses on the competition is pretty standard stuff: slick, manipulative, and trying to keep us in suspense even though we *know* how it's all going to turn out. It does benefit from the colourful personalities of the ultra-macho competitors, with Rick Zumwalt (actually, the third choice for his role) as domineering, reigning champion Bull Hurley. The soundtrack is full of grandiose pop tunes from the likes of Eddie Money and the ubiquitous Kenny Loggins.<br/><br/>The acting is serviceable from most of the cast. Sly's appeal as an underdog hero remains intact, and Loggia isn't treated as a purely one-dimensional villain. You do believe that he genuinely loves his grandson, yet he's still the type to believe that money and influence matter. Blakely has a thankless role, being required to literally phone in her performance. Mendenhall is okay as the kid. Assorted familiar faces among the supporting cast are Terry Funk, Magic Schwarz, Randy Raney (""Rambo III""), Sam Scarber (""Shocker""), and Flo Lawrence (""Don't Answer the Phone!"").<br/><br/>All in all, this is a predictable and yet amusing bit of entertainment that does have its moments, such as Sly driving his big rig right into Loggias' house.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."
"PredragReviews","7","1","1","14 May 2016"," ""Meet me half-way!""
","This is a typical Stallone film with a typical Stallone script, which is exactly why I enjoyed it so much. This is basically a road movie about a father whose trying to win the love of his son, Lincoln's ambition to win the world arm wrestling championship is cleverly used as a constant parody to the developing relationship between father and son.. The music that runs throughout the entire movie just adds to the effect. If someone is looking for the most inspirational speech in the history of mankind, then look no further than the scene right before the final arm wrestling match between Hawk and Bull Harley. Stallone emotionally explains how he becomes like a machine, or more specifically a truck, by simply turning his hat backwards. The emotional roller-coaster that is this film also provides yet another showcase for Mr. Stallone's spine-tingling acting chops, as his emotional, monosyllabic father-son scenes remain some of the most courageous ever captured on film.<br/><br/>I'll leave the final thoughts for Stallone's performance. He seems to have a bad rap as an actor, probably solely based on the first Rambo movie, however Stallone shows yet again that while hardly being the best, he is quite adequate. I love how for instance that Stallone comes across the entire movie as if he has two brain cells, yet it is he who we are really willing for. All in all, a good movie above expectations, that probably could not be made with the same impact today.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 7 out of 10."

We actually rent the movie and just make fun of it all the way to the ending credits, when the sheer cheese is capped by its own theme song, for goodness' sake! (It's titled ""Over the Top.""  Surprise surprise.) Watching Sly groan and moan during his arm wrestling matches always brings smile to my face (well, it's a sneer, rather).  The kid is the most annoying element of the movie.  Oh yeah, and don't forget all of the supporting cast, including the REAL arm wrestling champion trucker guy (the bald guy who happened to be the best actor in the movie after all).  You can't comprehend half of what Stallone says at first viewing, and one of the most hilarious part was when he was ranting and raving to a couple of goons driving away after an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt of Sly's son at a truck stop -- you just have to see it to understand what I'm saying here. Well, I guess that's just about everything I can say about this movie. It was a totally unimaginably dumb movie based on custody battle and arm wrestling (proved to be a deadly combination), and as long as you like making fun of movies and have a sense of humor, then go out and rent this movie!

Meanwhile he nourishes a secret dream of his own. To enter the Las Vegas Arm Wrestling Championship to win the Title and a Brand new Semi. That's the story in a nutshell The Acting is good and very well done Stallone breaks out of his action imposed exile long enough to remind us that he is a very good actor Robert Loggia delivers a hateful performance as Jason Cutler a man who doesn't like to lose and wants to destroy Hawk at all costs even at the expense of his grandson's love. The Late Rick Zumwalt is the one of the reason's the movie has stood out so well his Bull Harley is one of the most memorable character I have seen Bull is not a villain but he's not a good Guy either he's just a working man looking out for himself in a world that won't look out for him. The Story is nothing earth shaking original it's old and Time worn and Cliché after cliché the movie is a cliché Heaven but the movie makers cared enough to add some touches that make it stand out and put together a Fantastic Cast that makes you care about them and worry bout them. Not a Classic movie by any means but it should be a contender. A good strong family movie for the whole family."

","Sylvester Stallone stars as Sylvester Stallone, though unlike his usual appearance as a down-and-out boxer who comes back to fight in a championship, this time Stallone is a down-and-out truck driver who comes back to fight in a championship. So don't worry if you thought Stallone might try to do something un-Stallone (he wrote this screenplay, too). Along the way, he must reclaim the love of his son he abandoned and fight off thugs and professional wrestlers who show up to steal his son and arm wrestle him for kicks. This film has a multitude of plot holes and whoever edited this film should be shot for not noticing that Stallone's name changes a dozen times throughout the film. Despite this, the film is still fun in an 80s Stallone sort of way, and like all great 80s films contains a montage theme song from Kenny Loggins, turning a son's hate into love with less than 30 seconds on the clock.

","Okay, this is an unpopular opinion. But I believe there is something of value in practically every Sylvester Stallone film. I've been a fan of him ever since I was young, even when I couldn't remember his name. Every film he's made no matter how good (Rocky) or how terrible (Rocky V). I've always been able to take one thing from it and feel like I'm glad I saw it at least once.<br/><br/>When this movie was put on IMDB TV, I was a little confused about the poster. I thought it was about a vigilante with a son. (That's because it wasn't the poster with Stallone arm-wrestling). I asked my Dad if I should see this film, he told me don't bother. But I saw it anyway. This movie was made at a much simpler time, where films could just tell a story. Let's be honest, in the 80s, if a film was cheesy, someone liked it. There are a lot of cult movies in the 80s. Nowadays if a cheesy movie is made, it gets slammed hard. That's why this film is worth a look.<br/><br/>Honestly, I got emotional on some parts of this film. For several reasons. The first reason is, for a large chunk of the movie, they are on the road, just talking and bonding with each other. Sort of like a better version of Goofy Movie. It makes me emotional because before the world was quarantined. My family would always pick out a vacation spot, pack our bags and head out on the road. We would spend a ton of time just talking or watching the beautiful scenery, listening to music, or stopping at restaurants and seeing all sorts of people. I miss those days.<br/><br/>Second, hate me all you want for this. But Stallone's performance on almost anything sells me on his character. I felt for this guy who was just trying to be there for his son. I always felt like having kids was more of a chore than a blessing, but seeing them bond at the end sort of brought tears to my eyes. Because, I know what it's like to have a person who just wants the best for you and is willing to do anything you make you the person you want to be.<br/><br/>I know his son is whiny throughout most of the film, but that was because he was being tricked by his grandfather. Stallone's character Hawk, of course, I understand why he had to leave. He was avoiding a crazy father-in-law and let's face it, Truckers back then did not make as much money as they could have.<br/><br/>Okay, let's address this as well. Sly later admitted that he disliked the film. He said he would've added more of a score and made the final match of the arm wrestling contest more dark and ominous. That would work.....for Rocky IV. On a movie that is about bonding, I don't think it would fit, sorry Sly. I love you, but I have to disagree.<br/><br/>Of course, the film has its cheesy moments. The dialogue of the arm wrestlers and the fact that Hawk let's his son drive a truck without a license. Then Michael steals a truck and drives it to the airport without a license to catch up with his Dad is pretty cheesy. But 80s right?<br/><br/>Kenny Loggins performs the song ""Meet me Halfway"", which also makes me emotional. Just listen to the lyrics and you know what I mean. They don't make songs like that anymore, or movies like this.<br/><br/>For me, this movie is worth a watch, and it's a good Father's Day film. Now I'm not too concerned about being a Dad. If I'm there for my kid like Hawk was with Michael. I'll be fine."

It's just about a truck driver who finally gets in touch with his son, who is in the military academy, and his son is oblivious to the thought that he even has a father. To win his heart, he must compete with the toughest of the toughest in a world tournament arm wrestling match. Jesus, and you thought it was easy being an 80's dad, didn't you?? This movie isn't called over the top for nothing, as the main event itself is indeed OVER THE TOP with nonsense. A delight, but nonetheless nonsense. It was like watching wet paint dry, but less entertaining. In truth, this was a fun and early look at Stallones bogus roles, but watching all these arrogant tough guys talking all tough was just a bit too much for me. It was like an alpha male party.

"schroederagustavo","5","0","0","10 February 2020"," Not a good movie, but an OK/disposable 80's movie
","Ah, Over the Top. I wish I could say the title says it all, but we can never forget that the ""Winner takes it all, loser takes the fall."". Even though parts of this movie are pretty campy and could be put into the category of schlock, unfortunately most of the film tries to go for a more serious message about the relationship between father and son and how Stallone's character is trying to win over his son, both in a personal sense and in a legal sense, trying to gain custody over him. Most of the movie is just not that entertaining, the dialogue is pretty mediocre, but not bad enough to fall into the category of ""so bad it's good"", at least most of it. Everything involving arm-wrestling in the movie is pretty funny because of how ""over the top"" it is, however like I said, most of the film is trying to go for this father-son drama that turns out to be extremely predictable and therefore, just not that interesting.<br/><br/>However, the film does contain some pretty sweet 80's tracks throughout, which I guess don't work in the movie's favour in a strict ""movie critique"" kind of sense, but looking at this as a semi-campy 80's movie, I guess I could say it gets bonus points because of it, even if the film does feel like a long music video. And you know, watching men covered in baby oil screaming while they arm wrestle is sort of fun, especially when one of these testosterone driven maniacs chugs down some motor oil. You can watch Over the Top and be mildly entertained by it. It's the kind of movie that I often reference with friends because of how stupid the plot is, so there's that. And a few scenes are definitely worth watching, just for the entertainment value alone, I guess. However, this isn't a good 80's movie, but it's a good representation of the kind of disposable trash that Stallone and others occasionally put out during this fascinating decade."
"sol-","Null","0","0","15 July 2016"," Deceptive title and poster
","Cast as a truck driver and professional arm wrestler who bonds with his estranged son while the boy's mother is in hospital, Sylvester Stallone gives a touching performance in this deceptively titled film. The promotional posters are equally misleading, hinting at an all-out 'First Blood' style action film, whereas 'Over the Top' is actually about two relatives learning to connect while on the road despite very different attitudes and views on life. David Mendenhall is great as Stallone's eloquent, precocious son, who after years in military school, has come to always say ""sir"" and value nutritious food over the unhealthier snacks that boys his age tend to like. One of the best elements of the film is how Stallone, despite being a failure in his son's eyes, manages to teach him to enjoy life while his son also gives Stallone an extra boost in his depressing existence. The narrative nevertheless has striking gaps, particularly concerning why Stallone walked out in the first place and why his wife now trusts him with their son. The final half-hour of the movie is also far weaker than the first hour with everything focused on a wrestling championship, bizarrely edited to include documentary-style interviews. And then there is the ending, which is rushed and too neatly packaged, never resolving the grandfather's hostility. Never to mind, the strength of the first hour makes 'Over the Top' a film worth a look. The movie is also a testament to Stallone's ability to carry a film on his acting prowess - something one does not always feel in his more over-the-top (excuse the pun) actual action films."

","Wow not sure what I was expecting from a movie centering around arm wresting, but I guess I got it. This gem is from 1987 and about all it has going for it is the B-grade 80's campiness that now make it fun to watch. I mean who doesn't want to cut all the sleeves off your t-shirts, slap on a pair of suspenders, oil up your arms and drive your big rig off into the sunset while listening to Frank Stallone and Kenny Logins on the 8-track and yelling ""over the top"" at the screen. Awesome stuff.<br/><br/>This is one of those so bad its good movies that just gets better with age because it gets cheesier. Its along the lines of Rocky V -which was pretty terrible too- and is more of a father/son drama than the sweaty, sinew straining, pulse pounding action you'd probably expect from a movie about arm wresting.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is the awesomely named 'Lincoln Hawk' a truck driver trying to reconcile and gain custody of his estranged son after his ex-wife becomes deathly ill. Grandpa (Robert Loggia), is not having it though and his son is angry and disrespectful which makes for a (not so) fun road trip after Hawk busts him out of military school and takes him out truckin' in an attempt to bond.<br/><br/>Ultimately it comes down to Sly oiling up and arm wrestling for the custody of his son at the Las Vegas world arm wrestling championships.<br/><br/>This is heavy on the family drama and emotion and dare I say, takes too long to get to the arm wresting part which (come on) is why we're watching this. That part of this film isn't so bad, Sly knows how to do these kinds of action scenes and (I guess) there are some genuine techniques used -It looked good. I'm not embarrassed to admit by the end I was totally invested in him winning the championship and the custom semi-truck so he could start his own trucking company and the more I think about this movie the more I love it. 3/7/16"
"slightlymad22","7","0","0","9 January 2016"," Rocky But With Arm Wrestling And A Kid
","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 1987's Over The Top. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Lincoln Hawk (Stallone) is a trucker who arm wrestles to make extra cash. Hawk's estranged wife Christina, who is ill, asks him pick up their son Michael (David Mendenhall) from military school so that the two of them can get to know each other; (Hawk had left them ten years earlier) Michael's controlling grandfather Jason Cutler (Robert Loggia), a very wealthy man, hates Hawk and believes that he has no right to be in his grandson's life, and does everything he can to ensure he isn't in it for long. <br/><br/>This is a funny picture in Sly's filmography, as it was the first time he took a role since 'Rocky' purely for the money (although he still had a hand in the screenplay) Years later, he explained why he agreed to appear in this movie, saying, ""(The producer and movies director) Menahem Golan kept offering me more and more money, until I finally thought, 'What the hell - no one will see it!'"" It's rumoured the price that made him change his mind was $12 million <br/><br/>Basically Rocky with arm wrestling, Stallone is always at his best as the under dog, and Over The Top is no exception, Loggia is as reliable as always, and Susan Blakely (who previously starred with Stallone in 'Lords Of Flatbush' and 'Capone') is fine in her small role, whilst the movie has a great soundtrack with some catchy rock songs. <br/><br/>That said it's very much a product of it time, with Producers Golan & Globus producing a lot of movies each year, and with none of them getting preferential treatment. Get them made and get them out seemed to be the motto. <br/><br/>On my scoring system, this would rank a 6/10, but (as with Rocky IV) I'm adding an extra point for nostalgia, as I loved the movie as a kid."

","Over the Top is exactly that, over the top. It's a movie about a truck driver/arm wrestler played by Sylvester Stallone in a performance that is actually not bad.

More or less that's the movie for you. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. This movie has that Rocky Sequel feel, especially at the end and cheesy just doesn't cut it. I mean, you got Stallone with his oh so 80's tan and full of baby oil, the amazing soundtrack and at one point, one guy drinks oil. Yeah, that actually happens in this movie. But although it's all terrible, it instantly becomes sort of entertaining. I liked this movie. I didn't like it a lot, and I think its not one of the best cheesy 80's guilty pleasure type movies, although I did find it hilarious and enjoyable at the same time. OK 80's cheese fest."

","Sylvester Stallone, Robert Loggia, David Mendenhall, Susan Blakely and Rick Zumwalt star in this 1987 drama.

He picks him up at his military academy and they travel home to see Michael's ill mom, Christina (Blakely). Michael doesn't give Hawk a chance at first until they spend more time on the road. Michael's grandfather, Cutler (Loggia) is against the idea of Hawk reuniting with Michael and tries keeping them apart. He succeeds until Michael makes his own decision to be with his father. Zumwalt plays arm-wrestler, Bull Hurley who hates Hawk and competes against him in an arm-wrestling tournament. I think this is one of Stallone's most underrated films, he & Loggia are great in it as well as Giorgio Moroder's score. I recommend this good father/son drama."

"Aaron1375","3","2","5","10 March 2009"," This movie is more than just arm wrestling...it would have to be wouldn't it?
","Yes, if the movie was just arm wrestling it would be kind of hard to make the entire movie revolve around it and still be motion picture length. So how do you fill the rest of the time up, you add the touching story of a man trying to reunite with the son he left for his mother and grandfather to raise long ago. A plot straight from the lifetime movie channel that makes all the growling and yelling at the arm wrestling tournament all the more stupid. The saving grace of this movie is the rather good soundtrack. The music is good and saves this otherwise to sappy and overemotional movie. The arm wrestling tournament at the end is full of colorful characters, but they are not really delved into because we are busy trying to have the son driving to the matches to see his dad and they can have the sappy reunion. We get lots of arguing between father and son, mother and grandfather, grandfather and father this and that and we get a big migraine. Perhaps this is to better distract us from things that happen in the matches such as Hawks (Stallone's character) being in the perfect grid to face Bull Hurley in the final showdown or other strange occurrences like the fact Bull never seemed beaten at any time on his road to the finals. Of course, this type of movie is kind of Sylvestor's type is it not? He had Rocky and some other sports themed movie about wrestling that is not quite as well known. To bad he did not make more like that cop one he did with Billy Dee Williams, now that one was good."
"Anonymous_Maxine","4","2","5","15 December 2008"," The first and only Rocky spin-off?
","So I had been under the impression that the United States Military taught things like respect and honor and loyalty and determination. In Over The Top, we are introduced to the graduating class of what I imagine is something like the Junior Marines, where a trucker named Lincoln Hawk has an estranged son celebrating his successful completion of the program. But just when you might think that this place is turning out honorable and respectful young men, we meet Hawk's son, an arrogant little punk more in need of a smack than Rocky's son in Rocky 5. And that is BAD.<br/><br/>He immediately berates Lincoln for his dirty truck and scruffy appearance, wildly disrespecting him and acting like a snotty rich kid. Do you meant to tell me that this place, representing the United States of America, is churning out little punks that demand club soda with lemon when offered water? <br/><br/>Over The Top was released into theaters just over four months before Full Metal Jacket. This may be part of the reason why so few people remember this movie. <br/><br/>At any rate, Lincoln ran out on his family when his son Michael was a baby, so Michael was raised by his wealthy grandfather. Now Lincoln wants to make amends for past mistakes, so he picks up Michael from his military school and takes him on a cross-country road trip home. <br/><br/>At first Michael is an insufferable jerk, but ultimately warms up to Lincoln as Lincoln teaches him, through arm-wrestling, that he learned nothing about being a man in his time at the military school, but now Lincoln can teach him all he needs to know about manhood and fatherly responsibility by arm-wrestling a lot of sweaty meatheads. <br/><br/>I love the realism in the movie. Lincoln Hawk is a quiet, respectful man who only wants to have a relationship with his son. He honestly regrets his past mistakes and will do anything to make them right. Nevertheless, Michael's grandfather wants him out of Michael's life so badly that, even after Lincoln drives his semi-truck through the man's multi-million dollar mansion, he offers to drop all charges if Lincoln will just leave the state.<br/><br/>Really? That's all? After what must have been hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage inflicted with a deadly vehicular weapon? <br/><br/>I guess so, because Lincoln has no choice but to accept. So he loses his son, sells his meager truck, and heads off to the arm-wrestling world championships in Vegas. I didn't know there WAS an arm-wrestling world championship, but no matter. Lincoln enters as pretty much an unknown, and bets $7,000 on himself with 20:1 odds. <br/><br/>Soon after entering the contest, we hear a broadcaster announce that each contestant can lose once and still have a second chance, and immediately the rest of the movie is spelled out with such clarity that you may notice a distinct sense of deja-vu permeating the rest of the film. <br/><br/>I love the other arm-wrestlers, by the way. They are belligerent, mindless morons who are more like apes than men. Professional wrestlers were hired for the movie, but someone should have told them that they are not doing the soap opera of professional wrestling in this movie, and that maybe they could act a little more human than they are used to.<br/><br/>Nope, not in this movie! We get interviews with some of them where they say things like ""My whole body is an engine, and this here's the fireplug. And I'm gonna light him up!"" Interesting thoughts, you knob. Others just scream and roar at each other like hyenas, but not Lincoln, he calmly gets on camera and he's not really in it for the money, he just really needs the brand new semi-truck that they're giving away to the winner.<br/><br/>I appreciate that it really gets you to root for him, but a LITTLE bit of realism wouldn't have hurt either. Grandpa, for example, comes back at one point and offers Lincoln a brand new truck with a full-sized trailer AND $500,000 in cash just to quit the contest. What is that? Lincoln must surely have done something much worse than drive through the man's front yard for him to make an offer like that just to get Lincoln out of Michaels' life, but we're left to wonder what that might have been.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that it's just a little too obvious that the movie is a spin-off of the character of Rocky Balboa, with his charm and honesty at war with the vicious world around him. Here, Lincoln is just a simple man wanting to bring his family back together, and the cruel world doing everything possible to keep them apart. The arm-wrestling competition, and particularly the grand prize, was just a little too tailor-made for Lincoln's particular needs. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is about genuine repentance after a terrible mistake, and it delivers the message well and it's even a pretty fun ride for a lot of the time, but while the cheese factor is often the best part of a movie like this, here it is just a little too much for the movie to be good and not quite enough for the movie to be fun."

Somewhere around 1985, when Sly was really being trusted with properties that were commissioned solely to be Stallone vehicles, he lost whatever traces of subtlety his career might once have started out with. Then only self parody and a restaurant venture barely managed to keep his head above water, until both ""Demolition Man"" and ""Cliffhanger"" heralded a slight return to early form. ""Over The Top"" is a relic from the dark ages of the mid 80's.

I'm not crazy about all 80's movies. heck, this movie came out the year i was born. but i really really enjoyed it. i like most of Stallone's movies, any time period, cuz he rocks. he always blends a macho ism with sensitivity for the most part, thats why i prefer him over Schwarzenegger for the most part. hes not just a killing machine, hes got heart. and thats reason enough to enjoy this movie, you really care about the characters."

He's a trucker and needs a new truck to support the family as an independent trucker. What does he do? Enter the dark and underhanded world of the World Arm Wrestling Championship. The prize, money and a New Truck.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's also the plot about gaining the son's respect, but IMHO it was treated more as a subplot than winning the truck. That's where the movie failed. I mean, not all arm wrestlers are truckers, and I think its kind of presumptuous to have a truck as a prize. Forget having the blasted truck as a prize. It just becomes so obvious a plot device that it's disgusts me. Of course the baddies don't want Stallone to get the truck.

(Military school? Seriously what were they thinking?) I do congratulate David Mendenhall however, for looking the part of an 11 or 12 year old. Apparently he was around 15 to 16 when the film was made, but really doesn't look like a teenager.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we get too many weirded out supporting characters, too many slow motion arm wrestle matches, arguably too many 80's soundtrack songs, too many melodramatic moments, too many Sly long faces and too little humour to lighten the soap opera quality of the drama being presented onscreen.

","Over the Top should not, I repeat, should NOT inspire the kind of hopefulness that the film will be like Shoot em Up, where the title indicates what the movie will be and the final product lives up to the title and then some. No, this is not an over-the-top vehicle for Stallone, which should be easy enough. It's instead an estranged father/son story about a trucker who arm wrestles for extra cake. Um, should I go on? It's not very over the top, since the title instead refers to the term used when an arm wrestler is about to pin another guy who has the other guy's arm pinned down during the match, hence going OVER the TOP of the uh, something.<br/><br/>The movie provides us with a story that is about as hackneyed and idiotic as one can imagine, with sappy twists like a dead mom and a muddled custody battle between Stallone and Robert Loggia, who has almost nothing to work with here (I might mention the actor playing the son but it would give too much credit, though since this is a mention already I should say that he's a terrible actor, not the worst in the children lot but enough to make most others cringe reciting the dialog). Basically none of the characters are much likable, even for Stallone he's a dead-beat dad who somehow is given a slight break since his ex-wife is a total B-word and her father is a rich control freak with hired goons and private jets and wont let go of his grandson until.... Stallone wins a big arm-wrestling match in Vegas? <br/><br/>Part of the reason I wanted to check out Over the Top, directed by one of the Golan-Globus guys (you know, the ones who actually agreed to produce that disaster King Lear by Godard, among other 80s hit or misses, mostly misses), was that it was about arm wrestling. This isn't a sport at all, though one of the half-crazy half-dumbass things about the movie is that it portrays it as if it has a gigantic and rabid fan-base (frankly I'd think cockfighting would get bigger crowds). At the least it's sort of interesting to watch as an activity, and even fun to do with equally strong or even weak armed friends. In the hands of Stallone and company it's as equally dumb as the plot and characters; one laughable bit, amid a bunch of ""interviews"" done in documentary style (!) with the arm wrestlers is when Stallone's Hawk(s) says that turning his hat around backwards somehow gives him special powers in the matches! <br/><br/>If there were more things like that, or that one Stalloney bit where he smashes Terry Funk through the window or crashes his truck all through Loggia's property with no real consequences, it might have been a lot more so-bad-it's-fun super-80's material. As it is, it's just mind-bogglingly stupid, with its few respites of guilty pleasure overwhelmed by the terrible writing (the guy who did In the Heat of the Night wrote this!) and terrible direction."

","Since I can't get the two hours I invested in this flick back, maybe I can get my money?  Don't get me wrong... I like Sylvester Stallone.  But how many crappy movies can one person make?  When he allied himself with Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of Cannon Films (two of the worst producers of all time) for this movie and ""Cobra"", he should've known it was the beginning of the end.  Everything they touched during the 80s turned to shit.  The few Academy Award worthy films they produced (""Runaway Train"" and ""Barfly"", among them) were probably made by accident.<br/><br/>Back to the movie itself... it's a very touching story of a kindhearted truck driver (Stallone) trying to reconnect with his bratty son (David Mendenhall) while his ex-wife is dying of a convenient illness. Meanwhile, the tyrant of a grandfather (the always excellent Robert Loggia) tries to put the kibosh on the father-son bonding for no apparent reason other than the fact that his daughter married someone who makes less than six figures a year.<br/><br/>The film culminates in a climactic arm-wrestling showdown, in which you learn that if you turn your ball cap hat around, you get stronger.  I never knew that.<br/><br/>The burning question is ""Where do they come up with the names of these characters?""  Lincoln Hawk?  Bull Hurley?  Is this supposed to be symbolic?<br/><br/>Thankfully, Stallone had a couple of minor hits a few years later, most notably ""Cliffhanger"".  However, for every ""Copland"" there are 5 ""Rhinestone""s."

"Gus_Porter","6","1","3","24 November 2005"," A professional sport poorly depicted ...
","Sylvester Stallone's (Over The Top) is a Hollywood representation of arm wrestling, and in no way depicts the REAL life of a professional arm wrestler or the arm wrestling profession as a whole.<br/><br/>Before the release of this movie in 1987, I was both a local and state champion arm wrestler for three consecutive years (1985-1987). My girlfriend at the time (now a lost ex-wife) and I, went 'dutch' to the premiere of this movie during our 'courting years'. At that time, Drive-In Theaters were very popular in our state (South Carolina). With ample parking made available for tractor-trailers, I was able to pick my sweetheart up in my big-rig, and show her a real good time that night.<br/><br/>I did not let my passion for the arm wrestling profession prejudge my expectations of what I thought would be another ""Stallone Classic"". However, (Over The Top) does not tell the viewer about the real ""darker"" side of the arm wrestling profession.<br/><br/>Some interesting statistics: Did you know that there is an average of (153) arm wrestlers that die every year (in the U.S.A.) directly related to arm wrestling tragedies? Also, (1) out of (14) patients admitted through hospital emergency rooms, each year, are medically treated for arm wrestling related injuries? Shocking isn't it ??? Most of these injuries and deaths involve young males (30-45 years of age), who grew up watching (Over The Top), and living the all American dream as a professional arm wrestler. Like myself, a majority of those inspired by this movie and profession, ended up losing all that they loved. Personally I lost my house, my big-rig, and my ex-wife  but that was not the worst. I also lost both or my arms to the profession; both in the same nation-wide competition (1988). I wanted to be ""the best of the best"". I stayed up night after night, watching and re-watching (Over The Top) endlessly. Each time, learning something new. There was even I time when I thought I was actually Lincoln Hawk (Stallone's character in the movie), and went as far as changing my name legally to that of the movie's main character. In the end, after all of my hard work preparing for the nation-wide competition, I found I was not prepared at all. During the first round eliminations, I lost the first arm. I was too obsessed, and asked the paramedic to toss away the appendage and bandage me up. Due to a technical loophole in the arm wrestling rules (which has since been amended), I was able to continue with the competition, only this time using my other arm. I made it all of the way to the final round, where my lack of concentration caused the loss of my second limb. With both arms now in the back alley dumpster, I turned my back on the sport  never to compete again.<br/><br/>I am a big believer in universal equality. From each bad thing, a good thing must come. As such, I am pleased to announce that next month, the ""A.R.M.S. Around America"" campaign will launch, and will run from Dec. 5/05 to Jan. 8/06. (A.R.M.S. : Arm-wrestling Rehabilitation Missionary Services) is a not for profit reach-out program, aimed to support those who suffer directly from arm wrestling related injuries.<br/><br/>It is our hope, as an organization, that a campaign like this (or similar), will be made available each year in order to let those in need know that we are there for them. More information about A.R.M.S. or the ""A.R.M.S. Around America"" campaign can be obtained through your local A.R.M.S. chapter (see local listings).<br/><br/>I hope my above story opens ""closed eyes"", and educates those who find themselves wandering down the dark path of professional arm wrestling. Although I cannot physically reach out and hold your hand, spiritually I can as you travel your journey.<br/><br/>God bless America"
"bob the moo","Null","1","3","23 August 2004"," Has some good moments but is basically just a clichéd and sentimental 'father/son bonding' drama that fits in well in the daytime TV schedules
","Lincoln Hawk is a lonesome trucker who is trying to get his life in order having walked out on his wife and son about twelve years ago. With his ex-wife in a terminal condition, she asks Lincoln to collect Michael from his military prep school and come to see her  hopefully allowing them to bond at the same time. Despite the resistance from Michael's grandfather and a less than happy Michael not interested in his dad, the journey begins in Lincoln's truck. Along the way they win money through Lincoln's arm wrestling and gradually father and son start to develop a liking for one another. <br/><br/>After Rambo and Rocky movies, Stallone must have seen this film as a way to showcase his acting ability with a more sensitive and thoughtful family piece but really this film is far from being anything new and is just a fairly clichéd and uninspiring sentimental drama. The plot sees a snotty brat teamed up with his working class father and, after initial reluctance, they gradually win each over. In each movie like this something needs to bring them together and here it is a road trip and arm-wrestling. The arm-wrestling produces some muscle-bound action for Stallone's traditional fans as well as being the plot driver. However it never manages to rise above the clichés of the genre and it is all a little dull and overly sweet.<br/><br/>The film has regular 'pop video' moments that up the saccharine count without adding emotional involvement but at times the script does allow actual chemistry between father and son. A heavy handed subplot about Michael's Grandfather trying to steal him back seems out of place.<br/><br/>Despite the sentimentality the cast do well enough for an average film. I've always considered Stallone to have determination if not talent; here he tries hard but he plays Lincoln as far too worthy and nice  the script even helps him by simply brushing over the reasons for him leaving his family in the first place. Mendenhall is rather annoying at the start but this is part of his character and he does work away from that well. Loggia is just there to provide a 'bad guy' to simplify the film for Stallone's fans and Blakely simply talks quietly in her few scenes. None of them really do that well  partly because the material is too basic but at least Stallone and Mendenhall have a sort of chemistry.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fairly ordinary film that seems to be trying to be too many things but just ends up being a clichéd sentimental father/son drama that, 15 years later, has found its natural home on daytime television. Worth a watch once as long as you can accept it on these terms but otherwise it ain't much cop."

First, the custody fight for Michael Cutler between by Hawk and Michael's grandfather could stand alone without the arm-wrestling.  But this is Stallone we are talking about and his fans won't accept a movie without action.  It is like Arnold without the catchy one liners.  So enter arm-wrestling.  This is where the movie falls apart.  As much as they tried to show the unique culture behind these competition, we don't get to know much about techniques or strategies except for the ""over the top"" move.

The tyrannical grandfather (Robert Loggia) still wants Hawk out of their lives, but the awfully acting boy is slowly developing a love-bond. Aww.

Stallone learns that while he's on the road heading towards the big wrasslin' tournament that his estranged ex-wife is ill and she wants their child (a snotty little kid)to bond with daddy. Nothing to recommend in this picture. Besides being a real bad movie, there's nothing worth mentioning. Another ""winner"" from Cannon Films.<br/><br/>D-"

","Over the Top sees Sylvester Stallone returning to the sporting arena in an attempt to hit the box office heights of the Rocky series. Boxing is not the sport in question here, though. This is an arm-wrestling movie, and believe me when I say there's not much to get excited about when two big, strapping guys hold hands and try to out-muscle each other.<br/><br/> Stallone plays trucker Lincoln Hawk. He's estranged from his young son, but when the boy's mother falls terminally ill, Hawk takes him on a cross-country road trip to be with his ailing mom. En route, Hawk tells the kid that he plans to make his fortune as a world champion arm-wrestler. At the end, he goes to Las Vegas to take on the other contenders. Oh yes, and the boy's grand-father (who hates Stallone) spends the film trying to drive a wedge between them.<br/><br/> This film is quite painful. It can't decide whether it wants to be sensitive or tough; it can't decide whether to focus on the relationship between Sly and his son, or the impending arm-wrestling tournament. It goes through ludicrous mood swings, with a tender scene one instant during which the mother dies, and a destructive scene the next as Stallone drives his truck through his father-in-law's house. The arm-wrestling contest at the end is filmed like an MTV pop video, with a zooming camera, staccato editting and a thunderously headache-inducing soundtrack poured over the action. <br/><br/> Fans of Stallone will probably find something to enjoy here, but not much. Those who aren't a great disciple of the actor and his work will probably see right through it and recognise it for what it is: mindless, cheesy junk!"

","Ridiculous little film that has truck-driver Sylvester Stallone attempting to get to Las Vegas to win a new rig in an arm-wrestling competition and trying to get custody of his young son (David Mendenhall) after his ex-wife passes away from a long illness. Naturally there is the evil Robert Loggia, Stallone's former father-in-law, who will do all in his power to keep the youth with him. It is as silly as it sounds. A film that tried to intrigue with Stallone's star-power and a would-be smashing soundtrack. Typical 80s junk. 2 stars out of 5."

","There were a great number of things to hate about the 1980s, the Reagan administration, Iran/Contra, ""We are the World"" and movies like this one, one of the projects that helped to kill Sylvester Stallone's career. At the time, Sly was the highest paid actor in Hollywood and he netted twelve million dollars for this film, a sum that raised eyebrows at the time, but is conservative in today's overblown price tags for celebrities. Still it's a shame he got all that money for a film about arm wrestling, yes, arm wrestling! Stallone is an arm wrestling trucker who wants to win the big tournament in order to prove himself to his son. I wonder how long the writers took coming up with this stroke of genius? I'd say less than two minutes. You wonder why in the world Sly wants the kid's love anyway, he's such a pompous, little brat. In other words the typical 1980s movie kid. You pray that Sly will run the snot nosed bratling over with his truck, this sadly doesn't happen. Sure would have made for a more interesting movie though.<br/><br/>Watch for the ridiculous ""interview"" segments that appear during the final tournament, little slices of life that allow us to see what makes the arm wrestlers tick. You'll get a chuckle out of them. Also look for pro wrestler Terry Funk in a small role as an evil bodyguard. These things might keep you awake.<br/><br/>Over the Top makes one wonder how Stallone ever made a comeback. If he could survive this dreck, then he may just yet come out of his current slump smelling like a rose."

","This wasn't boxing, there was no Adrienne, there was no Mickey, there was no Apollo Creed. Heck, there wasn't even a Clubber Lang, or a Drago.<br/><br/>This was all about arm wrestling. Who knew that arm wrestling was so big in the 80's? I didn't even know that when I first watched it back in 80-whatever. Just to warn you--if you're looking for a movie that's all arm wrestling, then just skip to the last 30 minutes. The first hour or so is Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) trying to reunite with his 12-year-old son, Michael (David Mendenhall), after a ten-year absence. It was some real sappy stuff--Michael gives him the cold shoulder, hours later they are best buds, he teaches Michael how to drive a truck in three minutes, Michael wins his first arm wrestling match with the power of belief--some real after school special type stuff.<br/><br/>Then there was the hyper-drama between Hawk and his father-in-law, Jason (Robert Loggia). Jason was the quintessential rich bad guy. He hated Hawk (presumably because Hawk grew up on the wrong side of the tracks), he was never seen without his goons and sycophants, and he wanted to keep Michael away from his father. He was extremely possessive of Michael and very unyielding about allowing Michael to see his own father. As if the very sight of his father would extinguish his years of rich culture and turn him into a provincial idiot.<br/><br/>Eventually they got to the popular yet unknown world of arm-wrestling. It was essentially WWE (or should I say WAWE). The characters were wild and crazy hulking figures that probably had no social skills. But judging by the prize money for this arm-wrestling competition this had to be a fairly popular sport. I wonder what channel I can catch it on? Maybe it's on ESPN 12 or OLN.<br/><br/>Predictably, Hawk won the competition against his much larger foe. He used his patent-pending hands-over-the-opponents-thumb move like that somehow gives the wrestler an advantage. I failed to see how that physically gives anyone an advantage. Furthermore, why wait until the hour of desperation to use it? Why not use that grip from the beginning?<br/><br/>I guess you could say it was a cool moment when Hawk won and hoisted up his son who now wanted to be a part of his life. It was cool, just not cool enough to call this movie good."

It's rebellious without rebellion, confronts the high society without losing them and thus remains pretty harmless. The son is like out of a cartoon and quite exhausting.

It's unreasonable for him to crash his truck through the gate. He hasn't shown himself to be a violent man. It would be better if the guards start a fight which he ends by crashing his truck.

","Sylvester Stallone plays an underdog athlete getting his shot at the big-time and also a chance at redemption. No, this isn't Rocky Balboa. It's the story of Lincoln Hawk (an awesomely fake movie name), a truck driver/amateur arm-wrestler. In what is likely the worst ""sports"" movie of all time, Stallone tries to win back his son and win a big arm wrestling completion at the same time. Said competition is hilariously filled with 80s style professional wrestling types of characters who seems to grunt and sweat more than speak human words. Even more ridiculous is Stallone's secret arm wrestling move where he repositions his hand to defeat his opponents, which begs the question, way aren't all of the other arm wrestlers using this same move or coming up with some sort of counter move after having seem Sly go ""over the top"" several times during the picture? Whoever had the idea that audiences were clamoring for a film about the world of competitive arm wrestling was quite mistaken. That person was likely producer/director/studio head Menahem Golan. ""Over the Top"" has added entertainment value for me, having recently watched the documentary ""Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films,"" which documented the rise and fall of Canon Films, including how this film's excesses contributed into Canon's eventual demise. Featuring wall-to-wall cheesy rock music (by the great Giorgio Moroder, no less) and non-stop product placements (everything from Alka-Seltzer to Pennzoil to BRUT cologne), this film is the typification of excess (or over-the-top, if you will) at it's most ridiculous. However, in the film's favor, I did get a lot of ironic entertainment value out of how mind boggling awful it is. I'll also say that I do honestly think Stallone is a good actor, despite what his detractors may say, even if it's hard to see it in this film. Although I gave this film two stars out of five, it really deserves much less. If your film is beat out at the box office opening weekend by ""Mannequin,"" ""Outrageous Fortune,"" and ""Platoon,"" your film is likely not going to be a big success. Overall, if you're in the mood for a movie that's so-bad-it's-good, you might get ironic enjoyment from this nonsensical film."
"zardoz-13","7","0","1","30 April 2014"," Father & Son Reunion Tearjerker with Stallone as the Dad
","""Over the Top"" qualifies as one of Menahem Golan's better movies. This Sylvester Stallone arm wrestling saga casts the lean, muscular ""Rocky"" hero as a humble but defiant trucker named Lincoln Hawk. Jason Cutler (Robert Loggia of ""Scarface""), Hawk's villainous father-in-law, who drove him out of his daughter's life will stoop to anything to get his way. Now, Cutler's daughter Christina (Susan Blakely of ""The Towering Inferno"") is dying, but she wants her twelve-year old son, Michael (David Mendenhall), to get acquainted with her estranged husband. Naturally, the father-in-law doesn't take kindly to Hawk's intrusion. Cutler has been more of a father to Michael than Hawk could ever be over the last ten years. Meantime, when we aren't dealing with this contentious family custody battle, we find ourselves drawn into the world of arm wrestling. Hawk is hauling loads and working his way to the arm wrestling championship in Sin City. As a film, ""Over the Top"" doubles not only as a father and son reunion tearjerker, but also as a sports themed fantasy about arm wrestling. Noted scenarist Stirling Silliphant of ""In the Heat of the Night,"" and Stallone penned this thinly plotted but engaging chronicle. Appropriately enough, Stallone plays a ""Rocky"" like underdog character, but it is Stallone at his most colorless. The road to reunion is pretty rocky for our protagonist and his long, lost son. Aside from Blakely's cameo from the hospital, ""Over the Top"" doesn't dwell on romance. This is strictly a father-in-law versus his son-in-law epic with predictable but heartfelt results. Of course, Hawk and Michael come together in the long run, but they seem to be constantly at odds until the youngster discovers that his grandfather has been manipulating him from the start about Lincoln Hawk. Basically, Stallone doesn't perform any spectacular feats, and ""Over the Top"" is believable. He steers an eighteen wheeler and arm wrestles. Stallone delivers a sincere performance and Loggia is believable as his antagonist every step of the way. When Hawk isn't tangling with Cutler, he competes with a number of colorful arm wrestler who look straight out of a heavy metal melodrama. The gorgeous scenery, ""Delta Force"" lenser David Gurfinkel's cinematography, and Golan's polished direction bolster this lethargic but meaningful fodder. Golan does everything that he can to make the arm wrestling scenes appear intense with Sergio Leone-like choker-close-ups of the participants clenching their teeth and gritting it out."

Being a trucker, Stallone takes his long lost on a trucker's journey...where they bond through arm wrestling strangers, thwarting kidnappers and learning the ropes of driving big rigs. Dad & son have their ups and downs on said journey (to the Arm Wrestling Championship in Las Vegas), but Robert Loggia as grandpa doesn't want his grandson hanging around old Sly, who he kicked to the curb years ago to keep him from his daughter....But only one thing is keeping Sly from his dream of starting a new life with his re-connected son. That's right folks...not being the ARM WRESTLING CHAMPION of the WORLD! So now LINCOLN HAWKES (yes his last name changes from HAWK to HAWKES for no reason whatsoever) must win the big cash prize and the respect of his ex-father-in-law by taking the title home. Oh, and he gets a shiny new truck if he wins, too. Pretty sweet set-up, huh? Overall I say this movie is at least worth 1 viewing, mostly for the 80's cheese factor.

Filled with so many montages and soft rock tracks it's impossible not to think of Team America: World Police while watching it, this is stellar entertainment at arguably the lowest peak of Stallone's career. <br/><br/>After having achieved the not-so-mean-feat of making the genuinely decent Rocky and First Blood laughing stocks with ridiculous sequels (IV and II respectively) and turning in a dreary MOR flick in the form of Cobra, this is a wonder to behold. Like Rocky IV, any potential laughable scene is turned into a full laugh riot with the use of slow motion and OTT (no pun intended) music.

Also there is a small matter of a an Arm Wrestling contest in Las Vegas to contend with. Its a hell of a lot better than it sounds to be fair, Sly has some touching moments with his son and the kid is played by a pretty good child actor who is a lot less annoying than most. Also as they journey across the USA in Slys truck some of the scenery is stunning. Its just a little hard to get excited about an Arm Wrestling contest though, couldn't they have had a more interesting sport like Pool or something? Still there is plenty of great 80's music to keep things flowing. This is certainly worth picking up on DVD if you get it for about five quid (like I did)."

","Sylvester Stallone stars as Lincoln Hawk, an arm wrestling trucker who must not only arm wrestle muscle-bound truckers but wrestle his ex-father-in-law for the love and companionship of his son Mike (David Mendennhall) much arm wrestling ensues in this failed attempt to wring rah-rah cheer from the sport of arm wrestling. I didn't know arm wrestling was a sport but apparently it was an important enough sport to have Sly Stallone sign to rework Rocky out of it. Over The Top is honestly what you would expect from a movie with such a ridiculous premise. Some have called this one of Stallone's worst but I disagree, the movie is fun in spurts and isn't dull. Indeed I admit that the climax kept me amused. Especially since Double Elimination is explained at least 40 times through out, to which we are then reminded when Stallone loses once, that he has one more chance! The movie is very cheese-ball but it delivers what it promises and basically anyone watching this, knows what to expect.<br/><br/>* * out of 4-(Fair)"

","The poster for Over the Top features a picture of Sylvester Stallone thrusting his fist aggressively towards the observer. And then next to this there's a picture of a big rig and its lengthy trailer, which leaps off the page like a giant metallic phallus. Could it get any more suggestive? Well, there's also a picture of a hawk that lingers behind Sly's giant head, which is undoubtedly meant to cast him as a tough, uncompromising, macho angel- type figure. Yep, we're talking about another gay 80s film.<br/><br/>But what makes Over the Top different, what differentiates it from films like Top Gun, Rocky III and Commando, is that the manlove is of the NAMBLA variety. Yes, it's Lolita with prongs.<br/><br/>However, the film would like to delude the viewer into thinking its about father and son bonding. You see, it features an arm-wrestling trucker (Stallone) who for the first time in his life is looking after his twelve-year old son  Stallone walked out on his family for some unspecified reason. But because the kid's mother is dying, she thinks it's a good idea for them to spend some time together. But complicating matters is the kid's grandfather, who disapproves of Stallone.<br/><br/>Grandfather's disapproval isn't explored in any great detail (he's a bit of a git and thinks Stallone is a loser for walking out on his family), but under the surface you can detect his secret despair. He knows that Stallone is leading his grandson into a life of sweaty bear-like men and swollen muscles. He knows that at the end of the long, lonely highway lie oiled butts aplenty. So the fight for Stallone's son isn't only a fight for custody, but for his heterosexuality, too.<br/><br/>But from the opening frame it's clear that grandfather's fighting a losing battle. The kid is a cadet and no sooner has he jumped into Sly's cab than he's fanning himself with his cap  he's a prissy little bastard. And then when he goes to a hick bar with his father he orders a tuna salad and gives his dad a lecture on nutrition. Sly rolls his eyes, but only because his son may end up more like Liberace than Fabio.<br/><br/>One of the most astounding scenes in the film is when father and son fight over the radio. Sly wants to listen to some girly power ballad, but his son, resisting his new lifestyle, keeps turning it off. Sly responds to this battle of wills by saying: ""Mike, I think we're wearing out this knob here."" I laughed for a good two minutes at that.<br/><br/>After this, Sly ups the ante. During the night he pulls off into a lay-by and suggests that they stay in the cab for the night. ""A lot of truckers do it,"" he says. And then he says that his son can rest his head on his shoulder if he gets uncomfortable in the night. Mike declines this offer, but when the morning comes we see that Sly has sneakily placed his head on his son's shoulder. And immediately following this we see a slow-motion montage of father and son working out in the sunset with another power ballad playing  Sly also turns his son's cadet jacket into a sleeveless number; you know, to make him look tough.<br/><br/>More grooming takes place when we see father and son working out in the cab (Sly has a mini gym in his truck!). Mike appears enthusiastic, but after a while he begins resisting again. ""There's more to life than just muscles,"" he says. You can see Sly desperately resisting the urge to say, ""No there's not."" <br/><br/>But queasier than this scene is the one where Mike visits his father in jail (Stallone loses his son to Mike's grandfather and then he drives his rig into the guy's mansion to try and get his son back!). They talk more like lovers in a second rate romance than father and son. ""If I went with you, where would we go?"" Mike asks. ""Where would we end up?"" ""Together is all I can guarantee."" ""You say this now and then you leave."" And later Sly says this: ""I've got something inside that I want to give you in person."" Jail does strange things to a man. Or as far as Sly's concerned, it does nothing at all  he remains a homosexual, spaniel-faced Humbert Humbert.<br/><br/>However, if the first two thirds of the film are all build-up, the finale is the orgiastic pay-off. Here we see Stallone enter a national arm-wrestling competition. Everywhere you look you see bulging arms and orgasmic faces. Plus there are bear beards everywhere. This is what grandfather was scared of.<br/><br/>But somehow Mike manages to disobey his surly guardian and turns up at the tournament. And no sooner are father and son reunited than they're hugging and declaring their love. And it's his son's love than enables Sly to triumph in the most uncinematic sport in film history. Really, where's the drama in two overgrown imbeciles locking hands and trying to outwrestle the other? All you see are grimaces and hands going up and down. It's dull.<br/><br/>But although the final section is tedious and the 'love' story is queasy, I can't write off Over the Top completely. I mean, it has Terry Funk in it. That's got to be worth something. And although I frequently laughed at the film's expense, I was never bored. But still, I can't help but feel that Michael Jackson watches it religiously."

","Re: doyles' review - I have seen Over The Top and have found it to be a somewhat unrealistic portrayal of life in the arm wrestling world.<br/><br/>A more in-depth heart-felt portrayal of the trials of a professional gripper may be ""P.K. and the Kid"", released in 1987 starring Paul Le Mat and Molly Ringwald. I can understand your connection to Over The Top, considering your occupation as a big rigger (and I am sorry to hear about your poor wife). I also turned to arm wrestling after tragedy - I lost one of my arms in the 1990 Gulf War and have been on the amateur arm wrestling circuit since 1999.<br/><br/>I felt Stallone offered only a half-effort in this flick, an uninspired performance which seemed to indicate that he performed very little background research into the world of wristwrestling. The only saving element for me was the soundtrack which included ""Meet Me Half Way"" by Kenny Loggins, my favorite performer."
