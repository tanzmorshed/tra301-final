","I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr.Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!"
"elvircorhodzic","10","43","51","29 July 2017"," ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.""
","DR. STRANGELOVE.... is a satirical black comedy or rather an ironic approach to decisions and information in the Cold War madness. The smart choice is the mother of all wisdom. It is loosely based on Peter George's novel ""Red Alert"".<br/><br/>A crazy American general has ordered, due a bizarre reason, a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. A bit absentminded captain has realized that a general has lost his mind. Meanwhile, a President meets with his top Pentagon advisors, including a passionate super-hawk general, who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism in general and Russians in particular. However, the Russians have an ""automatic"" response...<br/><br/>This film loses all touch with the reality on the one side, and yet, it directly affects an image of a disturbed political reality on the other side. The irony stems from human stupidity, irresponsibility, suspicion and arrogance. Mr. Kubrick has created a satirical hopeless situation, through a conflict of mentality and a sense of patriotism, after which, a bizarre - moral winner rises. The highlight of satire is that world diplomacy rejects itself on multiple occasions.<br/><br/>However, there is a lot of questions. Why give so much power in hands of a few people? One of them, I mean all, are mostly crazy. Why use energy resources to build nuclear weapons? Probably because we do not have better things to do. Is it wise to make fun of a defense system of the strongest force in the world? Of course it is, one day, we have to stop being afraid of each other.<br/><br/>That's why this film is a satirical warning in an universal time, because we live in a time of a political satire with very serious consequences.<br/><br/>I am thrilled with a fact that this film does not have a trace of cynicism. Of course, there is plenty of satire, sarcasm, irony, perhaps exaggerated caricature, but there is no cynicism. Mr. Kubrick, you're a genius! The characterization is excellent.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers (Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove, the wheelchair-using nuclear war expert and former Nazi) is simply awesome as a kind of voice of reason, incompetence and insanity at the same time. It is a strange kind of patriot, savior and avenger.<br/><br/>Sterling Hayden (Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper) is a paranoid ultra-nationalist, who shows his madness through a serious facial expression.<br/><br/>George C. Scott (General Buck Turgidson) is the personification of chauvinism. He expresses his anger and paranoia of communism in a very comical way."

","Spectacular and chilling to watch Dr. Strangelove in May 16, 2017. I'm not going to talk about prophecy not even coincidence. Art has a way to warn, express or simply entertain in a way that its relevance will always be renewed. That opening with George C Scott's secretary, in her underwear, answering the phone for her boss in the most professional tone imaginable, is a masterful way to introduce us to the normal absurdity we're about to embark on. Terry Southern's extraordinary script (sharing credit with Peter George and Stanley Kubrick himself) is a masterpiece of intention and execution. The film doesn't have a moment of emptiness nor a single cheap shot. Everything works with the irrational logic of tradition and set standards. How can something so serious and ultimately terrifying can be so funny. I think that's the definition of film art. I don't want to sound pompous but that's exactly how I feel. I've seen a 1966 movie by Stanley Kubrick in 2017 that's better, more relevant, ingenious and even revolutionary than anything we've seen in a long, long time. Peter Sellers, fantastic three times over (and he was also going to play the Slim Pickens part) George C Scott in one of the greatest comic performances ever put on film and Sterling Hayden in a frighteningly credible show of abuse of power, complete the pleasures of this remarkable film."

","This movie is possibly the best comedy ever made, only with one fact against it: it's not very ""comical"". Hilarious? Yes. Comical? Absolutely not. The horrors of the nuclear war caused by a simple mistake materialize before us, directed with skill by the late maestro, Kubrick.<br/><br/>There are simply not enough words to describe Peter Sellers's BRILLIANT performance in three roles: A british officer, the U.S president and Dr. Strangelove. He is hilarious as the british officer, with his wonderful accent, gloomy and neurotic as the president and simply insane as Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>Also note that this movie includes a performance by very young James Earl Jones, who we now all know as the voice behind Darth Vader.<br/><br/>The ending scene is also a masterpiece."
"Ignorant Bastard","Null","205","302","26 June 2001"," Truly, an incredible and innovative movie
","Stanley Kubrick's first and only comedic masterpiece is still the finest ever made. I love everything in the movie: the brilliant acting, sensational script, flawless direction, and even those quirky visual effects. Not only was this film hilarious, it was a breakthrough for the entire film industry when first released. In addition to it's amazing satirical basis, the film also played a major role in how films were advertised and marketed... as if Peter Seller's performance wasn't enough! The sets were also very convincing and just plain great! So realistic in fact, that the FBI almost investigated how they got the B-52 Bomber replicated to near perfection!<br/><br/>In the end, 'Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is the best comedy.

"nickykelly-65134","10","21","26","7 September 2017"," Dr. Strangelove: A Masterpiece of Satire and Drama
","Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is cited as one of the director's best films, and one of, if not the best satirical comedy in cinema history, and with very good reason.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove exceeds exponentially in many ways, the three main being the direction, writing and the unforgettable performances from George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and of course, Peter Sellers. <br/><br/>Kubrick's direction is perfect, the film is perfectly paced, no scene overstays it's welcome and the editing and camera angles do their jobs greatly at conveying a time of nuclear crisis but at the same time remaining darkly humorous. One of the more obvious factors of the film is that it is shot and presented in black and white which works perfectly with the film, the dark representing the terror of the situation and the white representing the comedic side of the film. Kubrick also manages to assist in the comedic side of the film, he achieved this through using 'rehearsal' takes and allowing Peter Sellers to improvise. The level of film making is exquisite, Kubrick uses mostly steady camera shots when in the War Room, and hand-held camera shots when inside the B-52 bomber, he also frames each image with perfection and creates incredible compositions. He never cuts too often or ever drastically changes the angle, thus never confusing the viewer and allowing the scenes to flow. The B- 52 models on real life footage backgrounds may look dated, but oddly enough it still works well with the overall tone of the film, in fact it could be argued that it even adds a small comedic aspect to the film.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film's writing was quite underrated, many people remember the genius unforgettable lines that were likely ad-libbed by Peter Sellers, but overall the film's dialogue and plot is incredibly well written. The plot goes that the general of an air force base goes mad and without-authority, commands a large number of B-52 bombers to attack their targets in Russia, and the men and President in the War Room, desperately attempt to prevent this from happening. This plot is outright brilliant and is executed brilliantly, there is no outright exposition in the dialogue, and any exposition there is, is not jarring or comes of as lazy at all. The film does an incredible job at creating an environment of sheer crisis, with George C. Scott's character explaining that there are very few options in resolving the matter, and the reveal of Russia's top secret 'Doomsday Machine' which adds an almost unbearable amount of tension to the film. The film reaches it's inevitable end of Nuclear Annihilation, after one of the B-52 bombers manages to hit one of it's targets, thus triggering the Doomsday Machine and ending all life on Earth. I found this ending not only to make sense, but also to fit perfectly into the film's tone, there is also a great comedic value to the end, with it coming so suddenly and playing classic music over the footage of many nuclear bombs detonating.<br/><br/>Overall, I hope it is clear that I see this as simply one of the best comedies ever made, or even perhaps one of the best films ever made. The film is incredibly unique and although the more satirical points of the film may not be quite as relevant now, they are still hilarious to experience. The film holds up incredibly well even with it's clearly dated visual effects and somewhat dated humour, but Peter Seller's performance alone will allow for this film to be seen as one of the funniest satires ever made even long after the events the film is poking fun at have ended. And even if you don't find the film particularly funny, you can still be in awe of the genius film making and incredibly suspenseful plot."

","'Gentlemen. You can't fight here this is the war room.'<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is not someone who immediately comes to mind as a director of an absurdist black comedy. Yet he co-wrote and directed Dr Strangelove at a time the cold war was raging in the real world.<br/><br/>General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who sees a communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid. He has executed a plan that allows him to override the American president and launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>In the war room, the hawkish General Turgidson (George C Scott) sees a tactical advantage on a nuclear first strike against the Soviets. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to placate the Russian president in a phone call and prevent an all out nuclear war. Although the conversation is always one sided, we never see the Russian president.<br/><br/>Colonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British executive officer attached to Ripper tries to stop him but Ripper has gone bat crazy.<br/><br/>Finally former Nazi German Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers) now a scientific advisor to President Muffley has an idea to survive in underground mines and eventually repopulate the planet.<br/><br/>It is spooky to think that there are several people like Ripper and Turgidson about serving in various governments around the world. Even Dr Strangelove comes across as real, even with his arm trying to do a Nazi salute. Many ex Nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after the second world war.<br/><br/>It is a grim black comedy about paranoia and it works because everyone is playing it straight. Slim Pickens as Major King Kong was not even aware that this was a comedy.<br/><br/>George C Scott plays it broad but still makes Turgidson scary and silly at the same time. He gives a great performance, Sellars gives a better one in three different roles.<br/><br/>The film has some great lines, wonderful set design such as the iconic war room and well known scenes such as Pickens sitting on a bomb as it is dropped from a plane."
"justusmcqueen","10","250","380","16 February 2001"," The Ultimate Black Comedy
","Few films are able to take a deadly serious issue and place it within the context of a broad comedy successfully.  Dr. Strangelove does exactly that. Kubrick's masterpiece illustrates in brilliant fashion the idiocy of nuclear war and the idiots who are orchestrating it. What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individual characterisations of Sellers, Scott, Hayden and Pickens. To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With names such as President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed ""war room"" set, the hand-held camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black and white cinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of ""Strangelove.""  Quite simply, the greatest American film by the greatest American director."

","This movie is absolutely brilliant! It might not be THE best movie ever made but it certainly is one of the most entertaining and fun movies ever made. It isn't even Kubrick's best but it certainly is perhaps his most accessible and entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The movie its story and humor are subtle and perfectly makes fun of the whole Cold War situation in the '60's. With some subtle dialog Kubrick perfectly makes fun of a very serious and relevant topic. I mean, the story of this movie isn't that unlikely and could had actually really happened. As a matter of fact, it could still happen today. It's frightening but thanks to Kubrick's directing the movie never really becomes serious and remains fun, hilarious and entertaining from beginning till end. It is the only movie that makes you laugh at the end of the world.<br/><br/>The actors are also what makes this movie fun to watch. Peter Sellers is nothing short of brilliant in the three different roles that he plays; Group Captain (G/C) Lionel Mandrake/President Merkin Muffley/Dr. Strangelove. But also George C. Scott is comically brilliant in this movie as Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and he perhaps plays his very best role. Other actors that stood out were; Slim Pickens and Peter Bull. This movie also marks James Earl Jones his very first appearance in a movie.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the most subtle and 'darkest' comedies ever made. Everything about it is shear brilliance and even now 40 years later, it hasn't lost any of its power. The movie still looks like it could had been made a couple of months ago. A movie that will never feel outdated or too 'old fashioned' to watch. In 50 years from now, this movie will be just as good and hilarious, as it is now. Mark my words.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with some truly classic long sequences and has countless unforgettable moments and dialog in it.

","Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven't seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clichés... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick's most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I'm not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. I know I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10"

","When US General Jack D. Ripper orders wing attack plan R into operation he sets his plane on an irrecoverable bombing run into Russia.  Powerless to stop them with the relevant three letter access code the President of America and his advisors plan to warn Russia as best they can to prevent as many of the planes reaching their targets as possible.  However when the Russian Ambassador warns of the doomsday machine  a machine that will destroy all life on earth in response to a nuclear attack things become desperate.  With one plane making a desperate run to it's target things look bleak.<br/><br/>Now well respected as a superb satire on the arms race this is one of my favourite Kubrick films.  It is less cold than some of this later work and is genuinely funny without losing it's point.  The story focuses on three main areas of the attack  the military base where one crazed man launches the attack, the war room at the pentagon and the plane making the bombing run.  All these have comedy inherent in them  although thew war room is by far the best.  The story is an satire on the futility and danger of the nuclear deterrent while also scattered with fantastic dialogue.  It may not sound funny but trust me  it is.<br/><br/>The characters are all great and well done by the cast.  Peter Sellers excels in each of his roles and shows his quality.  As Mandrake he is funny in a very British way, as The President he has great one sided conversations with his Russian counterpart as well as great dialogue including the legendary `Gentlemen you can't fight in here  this is the war room'. However as Dr Strangelove he is hilarious  the character himself is a swipe at those who change political sides but maybe still hold onto their old ideologies.  Sterling Hayden is great as General Ripper  he delivers his madness with a straight face throughout (or maybe no-one told him it was a comedy!).  Slim Pickens is good and has the most famous scene from the film that has been copied in many things including Homer's fantasy in The Simpsons.  However for me the standout is George C. Scott  not exactly a comedy actor he is frantic and over the top with his communist paranoia.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic and deserves to be.  It is sharp today as it was then and even more relevant.  The comedy is still fresh and the dialogue is great  quite simply, when Scott implores the president to act quickly as `we must not have a mineshaft gap!' then you've arrived!"

","Entertainment Weekly called this one of the funniest 100 movies ever made. It also happens to be one of the most disturbing movies made. The humor is right there in your face, however, there is always an underlining political critique under every character, every line, and every government representation. Slim Pickins is the never quit Airman. He is a representative of our entire military system of the time. The president, played beautifully by Peter Sellers, is a demure, calm presence trying to deal with the Russian premiere. His perfect counterpart is a war hungry General, ready to accuse the Russians of any small infraction. This leads to one of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Sellers also plays a British airman who has to deal with the crazed general in the usual polite British manner. Seller's third role is that of the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a former nazi and weapons designer for the Americans. He represents the scientific community of that time period; those who worked tirelessly to build a better bomb. These characters, all of them strongly parodying a cross section of society make for an odd story. The final scene, while played for laughs, is actually a frightening image of a communist future. The final moments are frightening in their truth leading one to put themselves in a position of the characters. Dr. Strangelove is the funniest disturbing film I've ever seen."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","14","19","11 May 2017"," Better laugh at absurdity than cry
","This film has become a cultish film because of the subject of course but especially because of the tone that is really entirely conveyed by two actors, Peter Sellers and his three roles and George C. Scott. We could add Slim Pickens in the batch with his phenomenal dive into nuclear annihilation at the end. <br/><br/>The subject is central in our post WW2 world since it has to do with nuclear weapons and war. These weapons have only been used once, in fact twice, by the USA against Japan in 1945. The deterring effect of the possession of such weapons is supposed to keep the world as peaceful as it can be, though we all know it is not exactly true since wars have been going on practically constantly since 1945, for oil, for uranium, for who knows what other resources or tribal heritage from the centuries of slavery imposed onto black Africa, or the centuries of rife between sects in some religions. But they were always limited geographically. Most of these wars, apart from the direct colonial wars of Great Britain (not so many) and France (essentially two in Indochina and in Algeria) were the deeds of the USA: Korea, Vietnam, and the Middle East, and should I not mention Granada and Panama? The Soviet Union only had one in Afghanistan and they stepped out of it in front of the resistance from the Taliban and the Mujahedeen, armed and financed by the USA and the CIA. These movements gave rise to Al Qaeda and later ISIS. <br/><br/>In 1964 just after the missile crisis in Cuba the world had just gone through a terrible scare and Stanley Kubrick wanted to produce a film that would make the world realize how dangerous these weapons can be and how little we can stop them when they are already in the air. He decided to make it a comedy by using Peter Sellers in three different parts in which his improvising was able to make a real hit on the psyche of an audience. And it is a success and it is still valid.<br/><br/>The argument is that there will always be some crazy guy who will be able to bypass all limitations and firewalls to play a trick on the world, on the USSR at the time and Russia nowadays, or even China for the more reckless, and manage a bomb and today a missile to reach the other side and start the ABSOLUTELY AUTOMATIC responding defense that would become a tremendous back-attack or act of final justified but lethal compensation. As the one who started the scare in this film, and the final holocaust, says so well just before committing suicide ""I believe there is another life on the other side!"" That is in the drastic situation the most humorous, a very black humor indeed, remark you can utter.<br/><br/>The mad Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove is the most frighteningly hilarious character you can imagine, selling his nuclear knowledge and knowhow to the USA with only one intention: to get to the nuclear holocaust he had been preparing in Germany for Hitler and he was not able to perform or achieve. He is mad, he is deranged, he is physically handicapped, he is erratic and his artificial arm is only remembering his glorious Nazi time and is taking over from time to time to salute his leader, Heil and Heil again. <br/><br/>All that is dealt with humorously but it is dramatic and today in the situation of two wars, in Afghanistan on one side, and in Iraq- Syria on the other hand, plus the Korean situation that is poisoned by the unpredictable erratic attitude of President Trump in front of a young leader in North Korea who is either right to resist American imperialism or wrong to endanger the survival of the whole planet, today we can feel it resonate with strength and power. <br/><br/>Can there be any reasonable tempered, and well-tempered at that, moderate and realistic compromise to find a solution to the problem without having the USA continuing in their unacceptable track of dictating what one man, one president wants, even when this is purely unethical and absurd? No one in the world, and certainly not any god in existence, has the right to dictate to other countries what they have to do and what norms they have to respect and implement: the one size fits all of the Monroe Doctrine has to be once and for all sent back to the prop-store of an out-of-use theater.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU<br/><br/>TO DIE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, WHAT A JOY! Amazon February 11, 2001<br/><br/>Kubrick touches a very sensitive subject in this film, a subject that should remind us of man's supreme ability at destroying himself and surviving his own destruction. He points out how any nuclear protocol has a hole somewhere or a loophole to go around any kind of security precautions. Nuclear weapons are our unredeemable doom. They can only lead to a catastrophe. <br/><br/>And humanity is such that it will enjoy destroying itself and then mobilize its intelligence to just survive in order to start again. There is no hope what so ever. Kubrick deals with this subject in a very humorous way but every detail is there to show that the patriotic motivation of any man justifies in his mind any possible crime or just folly. Man is a fool and his foolishness can know no end. <br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."

","Stanley Kubrick always likes to try something new with each movie he does, and this proves it. This is truly one of the grittiest, and best dark comedies I've ever seen with some crude moments and some odd ones (who'd think to have Slim Pickens riding a bomb on it's way down). It turns into a flat out masterpiece though with the spectacular acting by Peter Sellers (in three separate roles), George C. Scott (his facial expressions are a crack up every time), and a supporting cast of crazies in a government of loons, the most impressive of these being the incomparable Sterling Hayden in his best dramatic/funny role. It contains a resonance as well that sticks till today, as corruption and pig-headedness rules in all sorts of governments, but most of all in those with the most power.

I laughed modestly a few times, but mostly, the humor consists of lazy military stereotypes. The premise was interesting. I could've done with less cockpit and gun firing scenes.

It's the story about one general ( with the very appropriate name Jack D. Ripper) gone mad and he launches an attack on Russia all by himself. He's mad, but still smart enough to prevent that anyone can stop him. He's got this strange ( but very funny ) theories about body-fluids, but his men respect him and do everything he says. So 34 fully-armed plains are sent to as many targets. Meanwhile his Colonel, Mandrake, tries to talk sense to him and the president and another General are trying to warn the Russian prime minister. You can have nothing but great respect for Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film and every single one of them is flawless. The doctor Strangelove character is hilarious and creepy at the same time. His appearances as the doctor are, along with the telephone conversations between the president and the Russian Prime minister the funniest moments in the film... Also the classic bomb-ride of Major Kong off course. George C. Scott is clearly having fun in his role and the debut of James Earl Jones is also definitely worth mentioning. Like I said already...a must see film if you're a film lover in general."

","Stanley Kubrick's wickedly hilarious end-of-the-world black comedy gem about an impending nuclear war caused by human error straddles a fine line between being fiercely funny and genuinely chilling throughout: As evident by the gross behavior and arrogant attitudes of various high-ranking officials in positions of power that they are neither smart nor mature enough to properly handle, the greatest threat to mankind's safety isn't the existence of nuclear weapons; instead it's such all too real and unavoidable human foibles as pride, stupidity, and incompetence that we should all be more worried about.<br/><br/>The savagely mocking script by Kubrick, Peter George, and Terry Southern pulls zero punches in its no-holds-barred satirizing of said foibles and offers numerous uproarious moments of inspired dark humor: The meek and ineffectual President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers in one of three bravura performances) informing the drunken Soviet premier over the phone about the nuclear strike, the hysterically loony speech made by unhinged paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (robustly played with snarly aplomb by Sterling Hayden) about preserving his precious bodily fluids, gung-ho redneck bomber pilot Major 'King' Kong (a marvelously spirited portrayal by Slim Pickens) riding a nuclear missile like a bucking bronco on its final drop while whooping it up, and the gloriously insane plan for survival that batty ex-Nazi adviser Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again at his most sublimely deranged) proposes to President Muffley.<br/><br/>Moreover, the zestful acting from the first-rate cast keeps this movie humming: Sellers pulls off a terrific troika of impressive and highly distinctive turns as Muffley, Strangelove, and uptight RAF group captain Lionel Mandrake, George C. Scott has a field day as bellicose commie-bashing hawk General 'Buck' Turgidson, Keenan Wynn does his usual sturdy work as the gruff Colonel 'Bat' Guano, Peter Bull likewise excels as the shifty Russian ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, Tracy Reed briefly steams things up as sexy secretary Miss Scott, and James Earl Jones handles himself well in his film debut as the thorough Lieutenant Lothar Zogg. Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's sharp black and white cinematography and Laurie Johnson's rousing military marching band score. Worthy of its classic status."

I like intellectual material but I have never found this movie very gripping or perhaps its satire like much of sellers is too broad for me. I appreciate his work - but I always find him a bit flat.

"markmuhl","9","3","3","24 July 2018"," The irrationality of cold war rationality
","The film definitely is a masterpiece if it comes down to demonstrate the irrationality of cold war rationality. How better to illustrate that cold war rationality only works out if all players involved always act rationally. Should we really be surprised about someone getting paranoid with all the ongoing propaganda involved?<br/><br/>Also the action that follows the lonesome and paranoid decision of General Ripper to launch a nuclear attack is strongly influenced by emotions and human weaknesses that are hardly compatible with cold war rationality. In the Pentagon war room General Turgidson (great performance by George C. Scott) wants to return as quickly as possible to his girlfriend, the Soviet president turns out to be drunk, commander Kong of the decisive B52 bomber is taking his decisions based on a Texan cowboy attitude and Dr. Strangelove, the scientific advisor to the US government, turns out to be a left over screwy Nazi, just to name a view. This may seem to be a bit overdone but when watching the movie it does not seem to be completely unrealistic, especially when compared to some actual political narcissisms and in the end, the movie is meant to be a sharp satire. Only be aware that the laughter may get stuck in your throat.<br/><br/>The only safe harbors with concern to rationality seem to be the American president Muffley and the British Group Captain Mandrake, both convincingly plaid by Peter Sellers. Unfortunately this will not be enough to prevent the catastrophe, also owing to the safety precautions that were originally designed to correct lonesome misjudgments but which are paranoid in themselves.<br/><br/>Quite remarkable is also the fact, that the movie is almost entirely restricted to 3 locations, i.e. military air base Burpelson, the war room in the Pentagon and the interior of a B52 bomber. This is enough to tell the whole story, in which also a Coca Cola vending machine plays an important role besides the fluoridation of water, but see for yourself."

And in those days were the American film industry was launching movies about spies and Russian espionage, one of the greatest (if not the greatest) movie director of all time creates also a movie about nuclear war only this one is a bit... different. ""Dr. Strangelove"" is not a film that glorifies America neither Russia. Is a film that satires both this countries and the ""ideology"" of war in general. Peter Sellers is doing one of the best performances of his whole carrier in his triple role in the film; As group captain Lionel Mandrake a British RAF exchange soldiers who has the bad luck of being locked in the same room with the maniac that launched the attack, as President of the United States Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove a former Nazi and now nuclear war expert. All three of this roles are presented excellent from one of the most talented actors ever. All of them are caricatures and are mocking the principles that each one represent. Also we have an amazing performance by George C. Scott in the role of General Buck Turgidson an aggressive and jingoist Chief of Staff. But this is not a movie which is only worthy for the performances. The topic is so modern even for today's standards that makes this film so accurate is almost scary. While it's a comedic film it is not funny. It's hilarious of course because of the characters and the amazing dialogue, but in the back of your mind you know that it's not the characters that you are laughing with but the human stupidity. And there's a lot of human stupidity in this film. Watch it, have fun, but above all think."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","3","5 December 2017"," The enduring genius of ""Strangelove"" is its hilariousness combined with deeply real satire
","No film has so brilliantly combined broad comedy and sharp satire to the degree of ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" — before or since. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick made many incredible films in his lifetime, but none of them have the unique, distinctive edge of ""Strangelove."" The prodigious auteur made plenty of anti-war films both prior to and following this film, but it's ""Strangelove's"" manifold comedic gifts that elevate it to the level of classic.<br/><br/>Anchoring the entire film is comedic genius Peter Sellers playing three vastly different characters with impeccable prowess, a feat that still has no equivalent. He loses himself complete into the roles of Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove — it would be no surprise that if shown to large number of people without any previous knowledge of the film or Sellers, that a large percentage of that group would not realize all three characters were the same actor. He's brilliant, on a whole other level.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" imagines a ludicrous doomsday scenario in which a rogue Air Force general, Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) sends codes to initiate a massive nuclear offensive on the U.S.S.R., enacting a plan/loophole that would allow him and only him to send the codes that could abort the mission. Ripper holes himself up in his base with Mandrake, who is subjected to his wild conspiracy theories and warped world view. Meanwhile, in the Pentagon War Room, Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs the president and they weigh their options.<br/><br/>The script, written by Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George (based on George's non- satirical book ""Red Alert"") expertly skewer the Cold War mindset at a time when nuclear war was still a paralyzing concern in the world, especially America. The strength of the writing lies in the way the characters behave and say things that are exaggerate but don't feel implausible. Turgidson talking about the benefits of killing 20 million people as opposed to 150 million has both validity and absurdity to it and proves that such drastic matters are better off out of the hands of men. And how deep the trenches of distrust and machismo go in regards to the arms race and other ""races"" against the Soviets is both insane and reflective of how some people probably felt.<br/><br/>The action of ""Dr. Strangelove"" is largely contained to the deck of a B-52 bomber, the War Room and the military base where Ripper and Mandrake are hunkered down, so Kubrick has to flex the more subtle filmmaking muscles to tell this story in a compelling way. He balances both long takes from a single, wide angle and meticulously strung together, more suspenseful sequences with lots of close-ups. He manufactures a good amount of tension considering the humor of the entire film prevents it from being a thriller like its equally excellent (but for different reasons) cinematic peer, Sidney Lumet's ""Fail- Safe."" Nevertheless, ""riveting"" isn't among the words that best describe ""Strangelove.""<br/><br/>Instead, ""hilarious"" and ""sad"" are more apt. The film's biggest action sequence takes place at the base in a battle between American forces — the ones ordered by Ripper to protect the base at all costs and the ones ordered by the president to stop Ripper. Kubrick doesn't shy from filming an all-out war scene and the result is comedy at its absolute blackest. The ""Peace is Our Profession"" billboard is delightful (and sadly non- contrived) irony.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" can be interpreted in the more academic sense countless ways, but it really comes down to the comedic achievement. Most films that insist on big performances and other over-the-top elements don't have the intelligence in the writing and storytelling to buoy that kind of swing for the fences. ""Strangelove"" does thanks to Kubrick's meticulous direction, Sellers' other-worldliness and a comedic conceit that's dead on for its time and place.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Stanley Kubrick's political masterpiece ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is a brilliant satire on the cold war as we follow absurd characters trying to deal with a rogue general and his order to bomb the enemy. While this isn't Kubrick's first impressive work, this one did separate himself as a filmmaker who genuinely and courageously follows his vision without much regard for outside opinion or public reaction. <br/><br/>A daring and controversial picture, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a satirical and darkly comical take on a potentially genocidal war which could understandably anger audience members at the time. The film is filled with situational, tonal, cosmic, and dramatic irony that make this film anything but a casual time at the movies. In fact, it's best to see this film more than two or three times to pick up on new jokes and humor that normally go unnoticed. <br/><br/>Peter Sellers and George C. Scott offer ridiculous and characterized performances that feel so cartoonish we can't help but laugh. Together, they paint this picture of politics in the most absurd way. Yet at the same time, we feel that it could be plausible given the clearly defined character needs and wants. Kubrick helps us believe in the characters (notwithstanding their unbelievable behavior) by placing them in relatable circumstances and exposing them for their basic human needs and desires despite being in grave danger: survival and sex. Yes, the drive to survive and the constant subtle and obvious situations of reproducing as a means of not only distraction, but actual motivation for characters. <br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" remains a brilliant satirical piece that's wonderfully written, engaging, and eternally re-watchable. While the humor may be too subtle for most audiences to pick up on first viewing, ""Dr. Strangelove"" deserves a chance by the new generation of moviegoers. It's fantastic and while not easily accessible to everyone, worth the effort to try and understand because it will not disappoint."

It was gripping. I was physically distraught at the thought that one man's foolish actions could destroy the world, and even watching it without growing up in the Cold War, I still felt fear at the thought that a pitiless machine could right then destroy life as I knew it. But despite this anxiety, I still laughed several times during the film. It was the best of satire, portraying something as both real and absurd.<br/><br/>No film is perfect, though, and some parts do move slower, and some juxtaposition by George C.

Most of the jokes are completely silly, which sometimes irritates me a bit. But hey, it is a comedy, so who cares if it is completely silly now and then. The speed of this story might be way to slow for some viewers, but acting is really great and hilarious, so that evens things out a lot, for me personally.<br/><br/>The good:
Despite all of these minor flaws that are mentioned above, ""Dr Strangelove"" is still an impressive movie about the total madness of nuclear war. However silly this comedy might be, it has got a serious message for all us viewers: a nuclear war will mean the end of all of us. There are no winners, only losers in a nuclear war, however hard some try to convince us folks of the opposite. This movie is about all those people who think that nuclear war can be good IF we strike first. Because IF WE DON'T have nuclear powers, THEY will have them. These twisted paranoid ideas could mean the end of the world as we know it and director Stanley Kubrick made a great classic comedy about it.<br/><br/>When watching this classic movie, one must not forget that the director made this movie in an era in which the americans came close to nuclear war with the russians during the ""bay of pigs"" conflict in Cuba during the sixties. However silly this movie might be, it has got a very serious message about the dangers of nuclear power. THAT particular message is what makes ""Dr. Strangelove"" a timeless classic."

Peter Sellers, playing three distinctively different roles is nothing short of amazing. No less impressive is George Scott, whose performance in the hands of a less capable actor might of come across as hokey but Scott pulls off one of the great comic performances in film history.

","Did this movie fueled hippies with motivation and passion to do what they did?
Nevertheless, as a citizen of the former Soviet Republic, it was simply hilarious to watch an American movie (made during the pique of Cold War, which deserves additional applause to the crew) portraying that the situation and people's common belief was nearly the same even overseas: the belief that the ""enemy is near and is gonna kill all of us one way or another"". 
Jack Ripper reminded me so many acquaintances of mine who lived back in days!:D Impervious, harsh, brutal, passionately believing in his own truth and sort of a satiric character for all of the listed above. The only difference is that their favorite line was: ""It's all America again"", but in the movie you can watch the vice versa.
Great movie, yet, the question got me thinking: did both parties actually enjoy dropping another war using force and guns less than a couple of decades after the hell on Earth called WW2?
P.S. The fictional president of the US being the most sane character of the movie probably ""saved"" its reputation back in times IMHO:)
P.P.S. Spoiler: get ready for the then existing post-WW2 stereotypes about super cold and *still-kinda-nazi* Germans, cynical yet *cowboy-minded"" Americans and always up for a drink Russians :D"
"tieman64","Null","23","42","26 July 2008"," Ethnic cleansing
","Stanley Kubrick directs ""Dr Strangelove."" The plot? General Ripper, a manic US general, orders a nuclear attack on Russia. He believes the ""purity of his essence"" has been contaminated by the enemy, the mere existence of whom threatens his gene pool. To maintain the purity of his lineage, Ripper thus initiates ""Attack Plan R"", an order which results in the 843rd bomb wing leaving their fail safe points and proceeding into enemy airspace. In response, the Russians reveal that they are in possession of a ""doomsday device"". Throughout the film, Americans and Soviets will attempt to defend and propagate political ideologies that mutually define the other as a danger to purity.<br/><br/>Ripper, like most of the film's characters, is sexually dysfunctional. He misinterprets his post coital fatigue (or erectile dysfunctions) as a Communist plot and believes that ""the enemy"" is sapping his ""sexual essence"". To reassert both himself and his masculinity, Ripper sees it as his duty to deny or destroy Russia. As he gains power, Ripper munches on phallic cigars and unsheathes huge, eroticised machine guns.<br/><br/>Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to stop Ripper, but is himself too weak and effeminate to overpower the psychotic general. Mandrake, a nervous flight commander named after a flightless male duck, has a broken leg, frequently stammers and proves not ""masculine"" enough to overpower the deranged Ripper. This tension between masculine/feminine/creation/destruction permeates the entire film.<br/><br/>Enter Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), a warmonger who seeks to capitalise on Ripper's sneak attack. The ball's already rolling, he says, so let's roll along with it. Buck's name is symbolic of sexual virility (Buck: vibrant male, turgid: swollen).<br/><br/>But once again, Sellers plays the effeminate foil to his hyper-masculine counterpart. He's President Merkin Muffley, a bald and small man, unable to commit to combat and constantly seeking to ""work with the enemy"". ""Merkin"" and ""muff"" are slang terms for pubic wigs and female pubic hair respectively.<br/><br/>On the other side of the Atlantic we join Major Kong, a George Bushesque Texan warmonger. His B52 bomber is making a run for a Russian base at La Putta (the whore). Unfortunately, a Russian missile damages the aircraft's radio and they are unable to receive the recall code. Kubrick's films frequently deal with systems, machines and communication networks breaking down. Here, a bizarre and complex series of freak accidents - impurities or oversights in the system - essentially leads to Armageddon.<br/><br/>The recall code is itself discovered by Captain Mandrake. An acronym for ""Purity of Essence"" and ""Peace on Earth"", the code points to both party's fascist mindset: for peace to arise, there can only be one pure lineage. The Other must be eradicated. <br/><br/>When Kong reaches his target, he rides a bomb down to ground zero. This activates the ""doomsday device"", blanketing the earth in a series of atomic explosion. Like most Kubrick films, the film climaxes with a system failure. The irony here is, not only that base human drives result in intrinsically corrupt and inherently stupid systems, but that it's precisely a series of fail safes and precautions, a neurotic desire for total control, that kill us. Once an irrationality (or rather, super rationality) is introduced via the psychotic Ripper, the system self destructs.<br/><br/>Before the film's iconic finale, its cast of world leaders listen as Dr Strangelove, a wheelchair bound ex-Nazi professor, describes the steps ""necessary"" to preserve life. With passages equating US presidents to ""fuhrers"" and with world leaders discussing fascist policies and eugenics, its clear what power and ideology has ultimately triumphed. The film ends with bombs going off in tandem with the ""newly risen"" capacity of Strangelove and his Nazi affiliations.<br/><br/>With ""Strangelove"" Kubrick recognised the inherent beauty of the mushroom cloud as well as its horror. Spectators often embrace apocalypse, or unconsciously desire some idealised notion of it. But rather than the arms race, it is libidinal drives which Kubrick satirizes. Think Major Kong straddling a 20 megaton thermonuclear bomb as it plummets towards a soviet ICBM site, hollering inane Texan war whoops as he falls. If violence always has a sexual element, and vice versa, this is warfare as a kind of sexual hysteria, Kong whipping his bomb in a masturbatory frenzy, hat in hand, before the screen is engulfed in the brilliant over-exposure of nuclear detonation, the perfect oneness of pleasure, where the intersecting vectors of sex, death and speed collide headfirst in an orgasmic explosion of fission, fcking and fallout. <br/><br/>The great black joke of ""Strangelove"" is that war stems from the phallus and that nuclear stalemate is a kind of sexual frustration (or strange love) to the technocratically evolved male; there are forever strong, dangerous unconscious drives conspiring to launch the ultimate attack. No surprise then that the film is awash with sexual imagery. Phallic Guns, cigars, swimsuits, playboy centrefolds, dominant young bucks, sexually dysfunctional wheelchair bound degenerates and a narrative book-ended by copulating aircrafts and an atomic ejaculation...the film's entire semiotic language is a consistent ballet of creation (sex) and destruction (war). This is combat out of obedience to the crotch, war as the drive to dominate and possess (there is a ""mating-warring association"" deep in the male brain, dominance associated with the phallus; think how phrases like ""f*** you up"" and ""get some action"" have double meanings), man seemingly raping/pillaging to create space for his dark cycles of creations.<br/><br/>The film is also unique in the way it blends genres (comedy/thriller/documentary). Kubrick's camera is initially detached, godlike and methodical, coolly milking the suspense, while the film's second half, with its outrun missiles and nervous faces awaiting annihilation, plays likes a precursor to contemporary ""ticking clock"" action movies. Kubrick changes aesthetics styles once again for the film's (now much copied) ground battles, which incorporate urgent documentary-like war footage. The rest of the film swings between comedy/satire, and straight drama. This results in strange and complex juxtapositions.<br/><br/>10/10 - Masterpiece."
"ironhorse_iv","9","8","12","28 January 2016"," It might be a little dated, but Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is still da bomb. A fun watch.
","The topic of nuclear apocalypse might be a dark and chilling subject, yet, it doesn't mean we can't laugh about it either. This 1964's political satire black comedy film showcase, not only the dangerous of atomic weaponry, but also the pure human stupidity that comes with it. Directed by fame director, Stanley Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb tells the story of the President of the United States, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), and his staff, trying to recall a squadron of air-force bombers heading toward Russia, after an unhinged United States Air Force general, Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) declare nuclear war on the Soviet Union. Can the group save the world in a last ditch attempt to prevent a nuclear apocalypse or will we all, be listening to the tune of 'We'll Meet Again' by Vera Lynn in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, as a Cold War nut, I found this movie, very interesting. Instead of creating, a serious drama of author Peter George's thriller novel, ""Red Alert'. Stanley Kubrick chose to take a more escapism route than a oversaturate melodrama route at the time. I guess, he can already sense that a lot of Americans at the time, were already on the edge because of the threat of Nuclear War, and people need a laugh, more, than being put into fear. However, Stanley Kubrick was face with a few problems. First off, Columbia Pictures would only finance the film if actor Peter Sellers played at least four major roles. I guess, they like Seller's performance in Kubrick's previous film 1962's Lolita, because the fact, that he assumes a number of identities. In my opinion, having Peter Seller onboard was the greatest thing, this movie could had done. He was hilarious as the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Royal Air Force (RAF) officer, Captain Mandrake. All of them, were very different characters, and none of them, seem like it was played by the same guy. However, his performance as Dr. Strangelove was a bit, over the top. Despite that, I still found it, to be amazing. That's how great, he was, in this film. I just glad, he only did, three roles, rather than four. I really didn't see him, playing the Texan, Air Force Major T. J. ""King"" Kong, the B-52 Stratofortress aircraft commander at all. In my opinion, Slim Pickens was a better choice. Glad, they went with him, instead of Sellers in this case. Another key character in this film, had to be George C. Scott as uber-jingoist, General Buck Turgidson. Wow, just wow! He was laugh out loud, funny. He really had that sense of command in his tone. Ever since then, a lot of war comedies, have use his sense of tone as a comedic general. The movie dialogue helps the acting, a lot. There were a lot of clever funny jokes and memorable lines, throughout the film, like 'You'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company ', 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"" & 'Mein Führer! I can walk!' It was all very well-written. I just glad, they stick to the ending, we got, instead of the pie fight ending, they originally wanted. However, the effects of the Kennedy assassination on 1963, did change a few parts of the film. Any mention of the city of Dallas was clearly cut from the film. Another problem that Stanley Kubrick had to face, was 1964's Fail Safe, a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although Fail Safe was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film's box office potential, especially if it were released first. So, a lawsuit was filed by Columbia Pictures and himself on Fail Safe. Kubrick argued that Fail Safe's own 1960 source novel Fail-Safe had been plagiarized from Peter George's Red Alert, to which Kubrick owned creative rights and pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between certain characters, despite Dr. Strangelove being loosely based on Red Alert. The plan worked, and Fail Safe opened eight months behind Dr. Strangelove. Fail Safe open up to mediocre success, while Dr. Strangelove open up to mostly success with people, but a few controversy and mixed opinions from certain critics calling it a 'juvenal satire'. Yet today, this film is considered to be one of the sharpest comedy films ever made, and I have to agree with today's standards. Indeed, Stanley Kubrick's deserve the praise. This is my favorite movie of his. I love how it's shot. The whole Black and white feel to the film, remind me of the 'black and white' views of the Cold War, so much. While, most of the sets, visual effects and action scenes can seem a bit dated. Comedy films like these, are one of the very few comedies from the 1960s that I can still laugh at. Overall: It's an outstanding, timeless masterpiece that must be seen for anybody looking for a good hoot! An explosive of laughs."

","In all the years of film making, Peter Sellers never disappointed an audience. No matter what the part, he always seem to find the perfect voice and therefore, his character. If you put him together with other equally great character actors like, George C. Scott who plays maniacal Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and Sterling Hayden as the insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Jack The Ripper?) and the Slim Pickens as Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong, James Erle Jones as Lt. Lothar Zogg, the bombardier and Peter Bull as the Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, then you not only have an award winning film, but the secret formula for a Classic. The story is set in the sixties, during the Cold War and a lunatic Air Wing Commander intentionally gives the ""Gold Code Signal for his wing to attack Russia. What follows is a dramatic minute ticking film, designed to illuminate the military's ignorance, stupidity and final acquiescence of the doomsday, 'Fail-Safe' device. The entire movie is a comedy of errors and one reflected of Standly Kubrick's genius. The one sequence where Major Kong rides a nuclear missal to its target is synonymous with the mentality of the pentagon. Through the passage of time, this superb movie has not only become a Dark Classic, but a possible statement of the future reality of the human race. ****"

","Mutually assured destruction is inherently absurd because no sane person would trigger it. Only a crazy person would do that, and once that happened all the sane people would try to prevent it. That's the basic premise of Dr. Strangelove, and Kubrick takes the concept to its absurdist end with the kind of ironic humor that obviously tickled him (with a healthy smattering of Peter Sellers, of course).<br/><br/>General Ripper sends his air wing to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union using Wing Attack Plan R, a plan that gives him authority to strike Russian targets without presidential authority in the event of an attack that incapacitates the president. Except nothing has happened save that the conspiracy in Ripper's head has reached a point where he feels it's necessary to begin a war to wipe out the Soviet Union and preserve the purity of his bodily fluids. He's obviously gone off his rocker and out of line because only a crazy person would start a nuclear war in a place of mutually assured destruction.<br/><br/>These actions bring the president, his cabinet, and the top brass of the military to the war room in the Pentagon. They discuss the situation, any methods to recalling the bomb wing, and how to get to Ripper to force him to recall the attack. The president also invites the Russian ambassador who reveals that the Soviet Union has created a doomsday device that detects a nuclear explosion on Soviet soil and destroys the world (the premier was going to announce its presence to the world on Monday).<br/><br/>They do manage to get the code after overrunning the base except for one plane that has damaged communications equipment and ends up going to a target not their own where they release the bomb and initial world destruction.<br/><br/>I've never really appreciated how funny this movie is until this viewing. Yes, Peter Sellers does have his moments (I think he's best as the British officer Mandrake), but, in terms of performance, it's George C. Scott that gets me chuckling the most. His facial expressions are wonderful acts of cartoonish emoting that fit marvelously well with the absurdity of the situation in the movie. Slim Pickens' oversized personality meshes really well with his character Major Kong.<br/><br/>Outside of performances, the movie really embraces absurdism and irony as modes of comedy in the face of world ending consequences. The scene around the Coca Cola machine is emblematic of that. Mandrake, freed from Ripper's office where he's been trapped for some time, needs to call the president and tell him the recall code. Only the regular telephones work, so he has to come up with the change to make the call. He runs through with the operator about connecting him to the president in the Pentagon and the different options to make the call (person to person, collect, and station to station). He doesn't have enough for person to person. The Pentagon refuses the collect call. And Mandrake doesn't have enough for the station to station call either. So, he convinces the American officer escorting him to shoot the lock off the nearby Coca Cola machine for a few more cents to make one of the most important calls in world history. There's an expectation around how that sort of call should happen, and it does not involve pay phones, haggling with an operator, and getting change from a nearby soda machine. The contrast is where the funny happens, and the contrast in that situation is purely absurd.<br/><br/>One of the things that I only really appreciated on this viewing was the absurdism at the movie's core. I used to take the film far more literally and specifically as an attack on American policy and I would quibble with it. Once I got the reading I got, everything slid into place. The very idea of mutually assured destruction is absurd and only a madman would trigger it. Once done, the rest of the sane world would come together to make sure it didn't happen. That's one reason that the calls between the American president and the Russian premier are so funny. It's two adversaries suddenly thrown together to prevent what they had been actively building up to.<br/><br/>The movie's slyly funny in several ways, great to look at, and with some wonderfully iconic imagery. That sight of Major Kong riding the bomb to the ground is just so fantastic. There are obvious sexual metaphors everywhere, implying a Freudian connection between war and sex, that heightens the comedic value as well. This movie is a classic for good reason."

","What can be said that hasn't already been said? The dark humor is still as funny and satirical today as it was in 1964. The madness of Nuclear War and politics is on full frontal display. The whole ""gap"" and ""race"" ideas (missile gap, mine shaft gap - arms race, space race, ""peace"" race) are played up to their irreverent best. Military intelligence versus common sense.<br/><br/>The part that I found the most indicative of military thinking / strategy that was just as prevalent then as it is now was when Dr. Strangelove is speaking of how survivors would have to go below - where there would be alot of time and little to do - and he describes the ""repopulation"" efforts that must take place, and the Soviet embassador pipes up with ""You have an astonishingly good idea, Herr Doctor.""<br/><br/>And then, of course, realizing his newfound need for prodigious virility, Dr. Strangelove stands and exclaims his iconic line.

","Marvelous satire from Kubrick, and one that clicks on all cylinders - visually beautiful, lots of funny moments, and sharp commentary on the military, cold war, and threat of nuclear annihilation. A perfect encapsulation of the period, and yet ahead of its time as well. Brilliant performances from Peter Sellers in his three roles, George C. Scott, and Slim Pickens. The imagery is so biting - that cowboy hat, ""peace is our profession"", and the third reich salutes. The sexual overtones throughout the film add another layer of commentary, starting with the plane refueling and in many references to virility, signaling an aspect that has always been part of the military and those who would make war (perhaps the ultimate 'toxic masculinity' ... and making me think of the George Carlin bit about it not being manly to 'pull out' of Vietnam).<br/><br/>We see the risk to humanity from our own selves in various 'big' ways - someone going rogue, the depraved indifference over 'only' 10-20 million dying, and the irrational fear of the other side being ahead, of there being any kind of ""gap."" We also see it in our little foibles, like pettiness, jealousy, and lust, and in the ignorant belief in conspiracy theories like that around fluoridation (which was a real thing). And interestingly, we also see the risk to humanity from automation and computers getting into an irreversible, destructive state, perhaps prefetching HAL in 2001, and the concerns of AI decades later. Mostly of all though, it points out the idiocy of the arms race, prompted by living in fear - messages which are still so important today - and it does this in way that is both delightfully over the top, but also includes the essence of truth."

","Stanley Kubrick's pitch black satire about the nuclear threat and the ends of which mankind is capable of going to prove its superiority.<br/><br/>The plot goes that a US general has gone rogue and ordered a nuclear attack against the Soviets. The radios have been disabled and there's no conceivable way to call off the attack. Men in the War Room argue back and forth, assigning blame, getting desperate, getting emotional. While on the skies the planes march towards Soviet airspace - undetectable, unstoppable.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful scenario, made even more poignant by its sheer absurdity. It tells something about a movie when it opens with a message from US Air Force, stating that the thing showcased in the movie could never, ever, under no circumstance, no way, no how, happen. Now please crawl out from under your beds.<br/><br/>And this could be an unbearably heavy movie. But Kubrick helms it as a satire. The characters are amazingly out there, as are the lines of dialogue, the sets, the music. But the subject matter is still so large, so huge, so scary, that horror lurks underneath all the comedy. It underlines every scene, every moment. Most of us now have grown up in a world where nuclear war has always been a possibility. And in this film that fact can never be forgotten.<br/><br/>The acting is also superb with the MVP award easily going to George C. Scott, playing the role of one the president's military advisors.<br/><br/>Fantastic scenario, fantastic film making, fantastic actors. You'll laugh, while also feeling the cold sweat dripping down your spine."

","I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat ""over-constructed"" and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr. Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century."
"robfwalter","10","4","5","3 March 2018"," A sizzling, soaring satire that hasn't aged a day.
","This film is scintillating, excoriating, scorching...think of any violent word you can and it will describe this film. Forget action movies with their death counts of dozens or thousands of people. The stakes in this film are as high as they can be, with the world on the brink of nuclear war. The mechanics of military command are ruthlessly exposed and somehow I found the procedural details on B-52 bomber horribly enthralling. <br/><br/>Oh, and it's very funny. Peter Sellars plays three roles and nails them all. The sequence of events is wonderfully absurd, except that there was a short talk before the screening I saw and the academic who spoke explained that declassified documents have revealed that the only false thing in the whole film is the disclaimer at the start (demanded by the airforce?) that says it couldn't happen. Alert to the prospect of a strategic strike on Washington that would destroy the only people capable of authorising a nuclear attack, the US government implemented a system just like the one in the film whereby individual generals could launch a nuclear strike.<br/><br/>Similarly, the paranoia rings true - if the US had launched a nuclear attack, of course Soviet intelligence would have had every incentive to deceive those carrying out the attack into believing the order had been rescinded. And the fear of being left behind in any technological race rings true as well.<br/><br/>Also it's hilarious: that music that plays every time the scene is on the B-52 bomber! But poignant and beautiful. The mountains sticking up above the clouds at the beginning are breathtaking and somehow sad and, particularly early on many of the shots of the plane flying are gorgeous. And the war room is such a brilliant set.<br/><br/>So although satire can sometimes be distancing or alienating, with this film be prepared for lots of feelings."

","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a 1964 movie directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is a brilliant dark comedy depicting the paranoia and fear surrounding the nuclear proliferation at the heights of cold war.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie revolves around the arms race and cold war between USA and erstwhile USSR resulting in a nuclear fallout throughout the world. The movie starts with United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) giving the go code to B-52 bombers of his wing for a nuclear attack on USSR without any provocation. He goes ahead and seals himself in his air-base and cuts off all communication knowing fully that it is impossible to recall the bombers without his recall codes.<br/><br/>An emergency meeting is called by President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) of high profile generals of US Armed Forces at Pentagon. General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs the President about the impending 'moment of truth' and tries to convince him for an all out attack on USSR which is ignored. Meanwhile back at the airbase, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) finds out that General Ripper issued the go code for no good reason other than 'the commie boogeymen trying to pollute the natural fluids their enemies' and struggles to recall the bombers.<br/><br/>People at Pentagon are also informed of the unstoppable Russian Doomsday device by Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) built to wipe out all life on earth in case Russia is attacked by Nuclear weapons. The combined efforts of Russians and Americans to stop bombers from reaching the target and the American adviser Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) talking about steps to take in case of doom make the climax of the movie.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Peter Sellers without a doubt shines brightly throughout the movie. He managed to play his three characters with equal finesse. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden did full justice to their respective roles of General Turgidson and Brigadier General Ripper.However this movie solely belong to its director. Kubrick has managed to highlight the absurdity of the unfounded contempt of one towards the other and its consequences. He also brilliantly depicts the dangers of lack of credibility of elements of a power structure.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely among the best political satire movies of all time."
"abhijith-alpha","10","5","7","20 April 2019"," THIS IS THE FUNNIEST FILM I HAVE SEEN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!
","I was born in the 90s. As such, I can never truly appreciate the climate people lived under during the Cold War, how much ever I read about it. I wasn't grown enough at the time of the Kargil aggression to understand the implications of two nuclear armed neighbours going for all out war. With the current atmosphere in the Indian subcontinent being of warmongering and terrorism, watching of Strangelove, a movie that I had been meaning to see for half a decade, seemed appropriate. And after watching I'm struck at how it has remained relevant.<br/><br/>Kubrick is awesome. I have seen just two of his films, Eyes Wide Shut and now Dr. Strangelove. He seems to have an innate knack of making people uncomfortable, simply by showing them the possibilities of human behaviour, what people can do, when blinded by ideology, propaganda and a generous dose of hubris and stupidity. This biting satire and socio-political commentary of the 1960s' cold war and military-industrial complex doesn't hold back on its punches.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers excels in his three roles. As an increasingly worried and exasperated yet unflinchingly British Captain Mandrake, he has to deal with Sterling Hayden's excellent macho nutjob General Jack Ripper, who is the embodiment of every toxic wannabe-alpha-male faux-military man you have ever seen, IRL and on screen. As the unintentionally funny yet very straightforward President of the United States, he turns in an excellent job. The phone conversations with the Premier of the Soviet Union had me laughing out loud. Finally as the sinister Dr. Strangelove, the mad genius scientist, the kind that never goes out of work because every government would want him, he is excellent. Other characters include the General Turgidson, Major Kong, and a whole host of minor military characters that do their part well to round out the cast.<br/><br/>The film is mostly in three locations: the iconic War Room, the inside of a B-52 bomber, and the Burpelson AFB located somewhere near Russia. The screenplay is very wordy and I have no problem with that at all. This is a filmmaker at the height of his powers delivering different types of comedy through scenes, characters' actions and dialogue delivery, and the dialogue itself is enriched by the extemely clever writing.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Kubrick is A GENIUS. 10/10.<br/><br/>Stray observations:<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove's black-gloved right hand seems to be deeply loyal to Herr Hitler."

","I've watched this multiple times before. Once as a child, a few times in university, and this was the first time since. Every time I've enjoyed it more than the last.<br/><br/>One of the times I watched it was for a joint event I organized for the MTSU Cinema Club and MTSU ACM Siggraph. The plan was double features that thematically paired a classic film with an animated film. I paired this movie with The Iron Giant, the theme being Cold War science fiction and paranoia. <br/><br/>I had a disagreement at the time with the faculty advisor who felt I was essentially trying to turn Siggraph into Cinema Club, though no other officers of the club felt that way, nor did members. The event was actually quite a success. I'd have done more of them, but the advisor went behind the backs of the officers and canceled its advertising. As I'd said at the time, the point was to show that animated films could handle complex thematic material that we are comfortable admitting is in classic movies. I at one point nearly shouted at him that if it had been a purely cinema club event, I'd have paired Dr. Strangelove with Inglourious Basterds, the themes instead being black comedy and American xenophobia.<br/><br/>And for years I couldn't get that movie pairing out of my head. So last night, finally, my partner and I watched them together. Both movies try and explore, in hyperbole, the ways in which we Americans have caricaturized the people's with whom we've had political strife.<br/><br/>My major complaint about the film is one I shared with my partner, though she was the only one to verbalize, there are essentially no female characters. Well, there's one. Scott's character is sleeping with his secretary, and so she is in one scene. I'm uncertain where one could have been, given that the plot essentially all takes place in a few ""boy's clubs"".<br/><br/>The best actor in this movie is certainly Peter Sellars, though George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden were excellent as well. Sellars plays multiple roles with different accents, costumes, and hair. (The first time, when I was a child, I didn't even notice they were all the same.) But the main reason I keep coming back to this movie is the morbid humor."
"adrian-43767","10","5","7","10 June 2018"," The greatest truths are told in jest
","Director Stanley Kubrick made three films of absolute genius: PATHS OF GLORY (1957), DR STRANGELOVE (1963) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The first two were on the subjects of war and treason, but while the former was extremely serious, DR STRANGELOVE is a dark comedy which tells many truths about the delicate balance of the nuclear bomb and peace, in contrast with FAILSAFE, a film which came out on the same year but which approached the subject of nuclear conflict from a much more factual and formal angle.<br/><br/>I can safely say that DR STRANGELOVE made me far more aware of the world's perilous balance, because my guffaws at some of the film's funny lines caused my mind to imagine the real consequences much more realistically than the serious-minded FAILSAFE ever could. To that end. the acting was first class: Peter Sellers is very good as a feeble US president, a powerless British commander, and the mentally disturbed Dr Strangelove, who reminds me of Werner von Braun, with his SS past and trip to the Moon future. Sadly, Sellers gives Dr Strangelove a distracting Indian accent, otherwise he is a joy to watch. George C. Scott is marvelous as the US Armed Forces commander with side interests and an eye always firmly tracked on the military solution, conveying suspicions about the Ruskies and sending shivers down your spine with his mad eyes and his confidence in US military capacity; Keenan Wynn does well with a tiny part and his quip about Coca Cola Company's power is so outlandish that it is frightening; Peter Bull is superb as the Russian ambassador called to the War Room, who uses the opportunity to take spy shots; Slim Pickens, as commander of the aircraft which delivers the bomb, is memorable in his desire to serve his beloved country, to the extent of going down with the bomb; and Sterling Hayden is also at the top of his form as the base commander who loses his marbles and orders the air attack on Russia, and then takes the coward's way out.<br/><br/>Great photography, special effects, fitting soundtrack, and fantastic dialogue, full of sharp one-liners, always pursuing the absurd and darkly comic angle, complete the bouquet.

You can't ask for more if you've been amused, thrilled, shocked and forced to reflect on a giant issue!<br/><br/>The question I suppose now is what we should take from this today. The bombs are still about, the arguments for having them seem the same, and politicians seem just as ready to reach ridiculously extreme positions very easily. Plus, we still have 'fail safe' systems to stop them from launching, don't we? Well, don't we? It's awfully frightening when you think about it. The bombs might be targeted elsewhere for now, but lets not forget about them.<br/><br/>This must have been a real eye-popper in 1964.

"gab-14712","10","2","2","11 October 2017"," Brilliant Dark Comedy!
","Dr. Strangelove is my second review of a Stanley Kubrick movie. Earlier I posted a review of his 1960 film, Spartacus which I generally liked, but did not love. Spartacus was a mainstream, straightforward film that he adapted from a novel. For this movie, it is an entirely different story. I loved every single bit of the black comedy which was written by Kubrick himself (which he adapted from the Peter George novel). This is actually one of the best films to come out in the last fifty years. It was a timely movie (for 1964's audience), and it remains hilarious for the duration of the film even though Kubrick told his actors to play it straight. It was the talent of Kubrick that turned this film into a film he wanted, a quirky black comedy.<br/><br/>Kubrick is known to be a perfectionist in all of his films. He is involved with every detail including sound, editing, etc. He even has his own sound equipment and his own cameras. Because he wanted to be so perfect, it created tension between him and his actors. For example, Kubrick never got along with George C. Scott who played a major role in the movie. Kubrick used some trickery to get Scott, a very hard actor to work with, to get what he wanted and Scott vowed never to work with Kubrick again. Scott, however, did admit he respected Kubrick due to his chess skills, which they played on set every day.<br/><br/>The movie plays out like a spoof, a spoof about the Cold War. At the beginning of the film, General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes bananas and he orders his bomber planes to annihilate the Soviet Union. He has some crackpot idea that the communist nation is conspiring to destroy the Americans via their bodily fluid. Over in America, in the ""War Room,"" President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) meets with his advisors to figure out what to do, and they are informed by the Russian Ambassador that if the Soviet Union is destroyed, that would unleash a machine called ""The Doomsday Machine"" and that will destroy all of humanity.<br/><br/>There are some interesting themes presented in the movie. The main theme is the Cold War, which was a silent war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The early 1960's was a tense era due to such events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cuban Revolution, in which the Soviets had a hand in. The movie is particularly interested in satirizing MAD, or the mutual assured destruction. Both sides wanted to destroy each other in a nuclear standoff, but they were deterred in doing so because all human life would be destroyed regardless. Another theme presented is a sexual theme, which Kubrick later admitted. The beginning with the airplanes going in to Russia is meant to be the start of the sexual process and Kong's (a character in the film) ride down on the missile and detonation is meant to be the ending of the sexual process.<br/><br/>The film is famous for a variety of reasons. One of those reasons is Peter Sellers playing three roles. He played President Merkin Muffley, who was based off an American Midwesterner and a has a balding figure. He spoke in a tone that suggested he had a cold, an underlying weakness that Sellers wanted to give to that character. Muffley was played straight by Sellers, but I felt his character was actually hilarious. Sellers also portrayed Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only man accessible to the mad General Ripper. Finally, Sellers portrayed Dr. Strangelove, my favorite character in the movie. Strangelove is an ex-Nazi scientist who serves as Muffley's scientific adviser. I loved the accent Sellers used to portray the wheelchair-bound eccentric. I also loved how he had this thing called the ""alien hand syndrome"" I just couldn't stop laughing when Strangelove randomly used the Nazi salute and called the President ""Mein Fuhrer"" several times over the course of the film. I found it hilarious the Americans would employ former Nazis in the movie. Strangelove appeared to be a menacing antagonist of the movie, and a great one at that.<br/><br/>There are also great supporting turns, mainly in George C. Scott's character, General Buck Turgidson. He was the adviser who alerted the President to the news and he was really funny. I loved the use of his facial contortions to display his emotions. He reminded me of Jim Carrey, who is famous for his extreme facial contortions as part of his comedy routine. There is one scene where the General was running in the War Room and slipped, then picked himself up again as if nothing happened. According to Kubrick, the scene wasn't planned but it worked perfectly with the movie. Sterling Hayden had a rather small role as General Ripper at the beginning, but it was a very memorable role. Finally, there is Slim Pickens who plays Major Kong-the leader of the airplane in charge of throwing a bomb on the USSR. Pickens reportedly wasn't told the film was a comedy, and he played his role straight. With the use of the heavy Southern accent, his role was still funny. His role was actually meant for Peter Sellers, but Sellers didn't want to do it because he had trouble with a Southern accent and he sprained an ankle and wasn't able to sit in the cockpit of the airplane.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is seen as one of Stanley Kubrick's best films and it is very easy to see why. Well, both this film and 2001: A Space Odyssey are his best films,and they share common themes. Manmade machines attempting to destroy humans. Nonetheless, this film was very fun to watch and it made me laugh constantly. As a Cold War farce, the movie does a wonderful job.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","This wartime comedy is built on the contrast that rises from serious situations and absurd behavior - the US president small talking with the Soviet premier over an imminent airstrike, the sign that says ""Peace is our profession"" at the assaulted airbase, and many other details such as ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"" The main characters are caricatured - Dr Strangelove is a physically diminished but brilliant former Nazi scientist, the anti-imperialist Soviet ambassador happens to be a spy as well, the US bomber pilot talks with a harsh Midwest accent and wears a cowboy hat. This coarse self-mockery is tempered by the sharp and exquisite dialogues of Peter Sellers who plays three roles - a phlegmatic British military, the US President and Dr Stangelove - and George Scott as a bold and gross American General."

","Most people like me who are reaching their mid-thirties are likely to have watched thousands, or maybe even tens of thousands of movies. Unlike my parents, we are part of a generation brought up on television. That being the case with so many fine movies around it is difficult for me to pinpoint one as an absolute favourite. But this film would certainly have a good shot.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers and George C Scott probably give the performances of their rich careers. After having now watched the movie 30 or 40 times I still find myself laughing at the deadpan and stiff English Officer Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. Sellers as the President is entirely believable and as the German scientist Strangelove both funny and frightening. Scott is hilarious as the paranoid war-mongering General. The scene where the President asks him ""have they got a chance?"" will live in my memory forever. Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens, Stirling Hayden and the lovely Tracey Reed are all simply excellent in support even though Wynn and Reed only have cameos. The fact that some of the jokes are obvious and telegraphed and that it sometimes descends into slapstick, only adds to the effect.<br/><br/>It is funny and a parody but it quite accurately portrays a number of serious points. 1, The paranoia of politicians and the military. 2, The fear that technology was starting to rule men rather than the other way around. 3, The well known, but not talked about much reliance that the American military placed upon recruited former German scientists.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is a parody and meant as a comedy I believe it hurt the American political and military establishment so much that they banned it in the States for a while. Fail-Safe, that other excellent nuclear accident film was released around the same time and suffered by comparison to Strangelove.<br/><br/>The film is a salutary reminder that at almost anytime our future and safety could possibly be in the hands of people who are unstable, or machines that are far from reliable."

Most of the humor is dry which may not get everybody's attention but if you really listen to the jokes, you'll get them.

The extreme views of the characters aren't fiction, I can remember debates about 'acceptable' civilian losses in the event of a bomb being dropped.<br/><br/>Kubrick satirises this wonderfully, capturing the insanity of a world gone mad. Sellers is at his peak. His performances controled and acurate; his best films are from this era.<br/><br/>That the Dr Strangelove should be working for the American Government is not far fetched, many escaped nazis' found refuge in allied counteries where their particular 'skills' were used. In fact all the characters are real, they were around in the 50s' and can still be heard today!<br/><br/>The message of the film really is: Who's running the mad house?

"ken_vandenbussche","1","84","209","20 December 2001"," How I learned to stop watching and love other Kubrick-films
","Regardless of the many classic films Stanley Kubrick made over the years, he started out his career with a very bad one.  The same goes for James Cameron who, after his debut with a disastrous Piranha-sequel, only made superb films since the year 1984.<br/><br/>Even though I respect everybody's opinion regarding this film, I find it very hard to believe that ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a brilliant and hilarious masterpiece.  Personally, I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen.  And since there wasn't a single joke in this film that amused me, it simply has to be one of the most boring comedies ever made.  The acting was below average, but that's because the film is filled with many tiresome characters.  Peter Sellers, normally a good actor, also fails in saving this picture.<br/><br/>I've tried to watch and enjoy this film twice, but in both cases it was too monotonous to finish it.  It would have been so much better if Kubrick had left out those stupid jokes that ruin the movie and make a war-drama instead.  The one and only interesting thing about this film is Kubrick focusing on how it's possible for one man to start a war after going completely insane.  Unfortunately, this quite original idea does not work well in a bizarre comedy such as this one here.  With a slightly better storyline and less boring characters, ""Dr. Strangelove"" truly might have become worth watching.<br/><br/>And that explains the very good reason why this is Kubrick's first and only comedy.  He's one of the best directors of all time, but he's not capable of making a decent comedy; so much has been proven here.  Of course you can't blame the man for trying out different kinds of genres.  As far as I know, Stanley Kubrick is one of the most varied film directors of all time."

It is not entertaining. Its satirical poke at the cold war and the arms race isn't anywhere near as clever as you'd expect it to be.<br/><br/>Kubrick is hit and miss. This was a miss."
"Arangalad","10","7","12","10 January 2002"," Best movie ever made

Do not miss this movie.<br/><br/>I like everything about this movie. Peter Sellers, Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott are all supreme actors and do excellent performances. The story and the script are wonderful. And what can go wrong with Stanley Kubrick as director? Nothing. Yet I am surprised.

","Yeah, yeah, funniest comedy ever.  Uh huh, whatever you say.  Sorry to break it to you, folks, but this isn't a very funny comedy.  Sure, it said some bold things about the nuclear arms race during the height of the cold war, but that's about it.  During my third time watching it, I concentrated on counting the actual funny parts of the movie.  There's less than 20 instances in the entire movie where there's a conscious effort to be funny, and I'm counting instances of dry, backhanded humor as well (such as the president's straight-man deadpans and absurdities of calling the president on a pay phone).<br/><br/>The problem is there are too many scenes that are completely devoid of humor, black or otherwise.  Virtually every minute of the bomber scenes are without a chuckle, unless we're supposed to delight in hearing Slim Pickins' drawl for its own sake.  How many times do we need to see establishing shots of the bomber?  There must have been over 20 shots of the bomber's exterior, altogether burning up about 10 minutes of movie time.  How hilarious!<br/><br/>There's about 10 really memorable funny lines/moments in the entire show. I'm sure this film was really shocking in 1963 for its audacity, but of all Kubrick's work, it shows up as the most dated; about all that works in it anymore is Sellers' mugging (which is really just a tiny bit of film), and a couple of good one liners (""Gentlemen!...War Room!"", the prez bickering with the premier like a married couple, answering to the Coca Cola corporation)."
"c-m-etc","4","18","39","10 June 2005"," It does not live up to its hype
","I had heard much about this film over the years so I was looking forward to seeing it when I purchased the DVD. It does not live up to its hype. For one, it is not all that funny. Yes, there are some absurd things that happen and yes, there are some characters who are somewhat funny, sometimes, but that's it.<br/><br/>Although much of the acting was credible, the characters were neither funny nor satirical. Kubrick simply did not understand how people in high power act and how decisions at that level are made. He didn't understand the dynamics of the cold war. Most of all, he didn't understand satire. Read the book Catch-22, if you don't believe me (I know there is a film, but I haven't seen it so I can't recommend it). The author based most of his satire on Army bureaucracy of which he must have been acquainted. He knew the things about which he wrote and he also understood them so he could show them in a truly satirical light. The essence of satire is that it provides insight into what is currently happening or what is likely to happen. Kubrick based this film, not on what he knew, but on what he felt might be funny based on the bits he had researched and that is why the few bits of satire and comedy in the film come off as being remote.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are those that take place in Kong's bomber. This is, in part, because the bomber and its crew look very real and in part because of the character of Major Kong. Silm Pickens did a brilliant job playing Major Kong. The character was not only plausible, but the few comedic situations involving his bomber arose from his character and his interaction with events and other characters. He was at once a professional pilot and a down-on-the farm (or ranch) human being. His reaction to the contents of the survival pack, for example, fit the character: he methodically listed the contents, as any professional would, then comments that they would make for a nice night out in Vegas (actually, in the original cut, he said 'Dallas', but that was changed after Kennedy's assassination, according to the short documentary DVD extra about how the film was made). It is not at all surprising or shocking or implausible that Major Kong would, inadvertently, end up riding the bomb as it fell to its destination. It's an evocative image he presents: that of a cowboy, riding a bronco - one final, wild ride.<br/><br/>What's more, the scenes in the bomber were filled with genuine tension. Was the bomber going to be hit by the Russian missile? Was it going to crash because of the damage the missile had caused? Was something going to stop it before it dropped a bomb? Were the bomb doors going to open? I was very much caught up in the action on the bomber. If the rest of the film had been this way, it would have been a great one.<br/><br/>The scenes outside the bomber just don't follow through, though. They aren't very funny and they aren't very satirical. It is, at most, a very mild satire. In particular, the character of Dr Strangelove falls flat. I don't know why the film is named after this character, except that he has a strange name. He is just a stereotypical German. He didn't send out the bombers and he didn't call them back. The only thing he does is to confirm that the Russians could make a doomsday weapon, and any character could have done that. He certainly does not turn his obvious intelligence to trying to figure out how to stop Kong's bomber. The character isn't funny or sinister: he comes off as being pathetic and irritating, particularly when he can't control his hand.<br/><br/>The film just doesn't catch my imagination and I don't know why so many people think highly of it. It is probably that people expect that they will like it: it is one of those films that is probably famous for being famous. I wish it had lived up to its hype, but there we have it."

It was even better than I remembered it. It tackles the ultimate serious subject with perfect deadpan humour.<br/><br/>The first time I saw it, I was tied up in the plot, and my frustration with all these idiots refusing to behave sensibly to save their skins. The second time I focused more on the human foibles it poked fun of, people reflexively concerning themselves with looking good, or seeking a petty advantage, even if the face of nuclear war. I carefully watched every gesture and eyebrow twitch, all as controlled as a renaissance painting.<br/><br/>The first time, the scene that haunted me most was Colonel Bat Guano refusing to shoot a coke machine. The second time it was Mandrake trying to humour the out-of-his gourd Brigadier General Jack Ripper, and Dr. Strangelove selling his plan to live in mineshafts.<br/><br/>The plot is brilliant. Everything crazy thing that happens comes with an airtight, plausible explanation. The technical mumbo jumbo and the ""advanced"" 1950s technology stands up very well. I was only jarred once by an erroneous explanation of half-life.<br/><br/>This time I noticed a young James Earl Jones playing Lothar Zogg, one of the bomber crew.

"ExpendableMan","9","9","17","17 April 2007"," A dark comic masterpiece
","Beginning with the most famous auto erotica shots in film history and ending with a nuclear Armageddon serenaded by Vera Lynn, Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb) is a movie that hasn't aged a day. Even now, forty plus years after its debut, it retains a satirical bite that still horrifies and amuses in equal doses. As a parody of the arrogance and insanity at work during the arms race, it rewards repeat viewings and should rightly be considered as one of the director's masterworks. Whether it is better than the likes of Paths of Glory, 2001 or A Clockwork Orange is down to personal choice, but as far as I'm concerned, Strangelove is the moment where Kubrick proved his worth without question.<br/><br/>What makes Dr. Strangelove so enjoyable is the combination of the horrific and the hilarious. Nuclear Armageddon was the most terrifying possibility of the Cold War and yet Dr. Strangelove is a comedy. Of course, the idea of all life on earth being blasted into atoms is so terrible it is painful to think about, but Kubrick's film doesn't tackle the subject with kid gloves. Rather, it shows of the folly of human nature that would lead to such a catastrophe which provides a lot of black comedy to the proceedings. Mercifully, rather than mugging the camera, the cast play it straight all the way through and to see the straight-laced Sterling Hayden declaring his resolve to prevent Communism sapping America's precious bodily fluids is just the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>Everyone in a position of power is mercilessly ripped into. The President (Peter Sellers) is a fussy individual, almost completely unaware of what his own staff are up to and prone to chatting idly with the Russian Premiere as atomic weapons hurtle towards his country. The Generals in the shape of Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) and Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) are paranoid, gung ho conspiracy nuts. The bomber pilot Captain Kong (Slim Pickens) is a decent enough good ole boy but so determined to follow orders that he will embrace genocide and the chief of defence, the titular Doctor (Sellers again) is a former Nazi who has changed his name but not his ideologies. All of them are foolish men, full of pride and ambition but whose shortcomings are all too apparent, an ensemble cast this strong has rarely been matched.<br/><br/>Admittedly, Kubrick's anti US military bias is a little overbearing (notice the only man in uniform with any sense is a British RAF Officer) but it doesn't matter in the long run. One sided it may be, but Dr. Strangelove isn't a documentary by any means, it's a satire rooted in reality but sufficiently distanced from it enough to raise smirks when millions of people are consumed in a fiery inferno.<br/><br/>If you take anything away from Dr. Strangelove, it's most likely going to be either Peter Sellers embracing three roles at once or a man riding a falling H-bomb to his doom, cheering all the way, but it's well worth watching multiple times as each viewing opens up new layers. The incredibly quotable script is one such joy (""Gentlemen, you can't fight here, this is the war room!"") as are such instances as machine gun battles in front of peace signs or the barely contained delight on the staff faces as the ""ten females for every male"" plan unfolds.<br/><br/>In short then, a parable of fear that somehow became one of the most powerful comedies of all time. It taps into the political anxieties of the Cold War with aplomb and can teach even a casual viewer a thing or two about the period. Highly recommended and if you've already seen it, just watch it again."

","Classic black anti-war comedy with magnificent acting by all-star-cast , lavish production design by Ken Adam and masterfully realized by the always original Stanley Kubrick . It deals with an insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden was patterned after Gen. Thomas S. Power, LeMay's protégé and successor as Chief of the Strategic Air Command) triggers a path to nuclear holocaust that a war room full of politicians and generals frantically try to stop . There intervenes a motley group of offbeat characters such as a scientist (Peter Sellers was paid $1 million, 55% of the film's budget ,Stanley Kubrick famously quipped ""I got three for the price of six"") whose artificial arm repeatedly makes Heil Hitler sign as an involuntary reflex action , a hawkish general named Buck Turgidson (gunchewing militarist excellently performed by Geoge C Scott , this character was patterned after the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. Curtis LeMay, who was renowned for his extreme anti-Communist views) and the US President Merklin Muffley (inimitable Peter Sellers , this role was patterned after Adlai Stevenson II, who lost two presidential elections to Dwight D. Eisenhower )to deal with consequences a nuclear attack .<br/><br/>This splendid film contains unforgettable scenes such as a soft drinking vending machine dispute , sketches involving a phone call to the American President and the movie's funniest the notorious Slim Pickens's wild ride on the bomb . Based on the novel ""Red Alert"" by Peter George, and originally conceived as a tense thriller about the possibility of accidental nuclear war. Stanley Kubrick was working on the script when he realized that many scenes he had written were actually quite funny , he then brought in Terry Southern to turn the story into a satire . This was the final collaboration between controversial Stanley Kubrick and his producing partner James B. Harris , as he left to begin his own directing career. Harris was involved in the early development stage of this production. It was during this stage that, according to Harris, Kubrick began to toy with the idea of turning it into a comedy .<br/><br/>Very good acting by Sterling Hayden as a crazed general initiating a nuclear attack on the Soviets and George C. Scott was reputedly annoyed that Stanley Kubrick was pushing him to overact for his role , while he vowed never to work with Kubrick again, Scott eventually saw this as one of his favorite performances and many fans consider it some of his best work on-screen . And of course, the great Peter Sellers who plays a tour-de-force triple role , as he improvised most of his lines . Sellers plays Dr. Strangelove , a wheelchair-bound adviser who apparently suffers from agonistic apraxia, also known as ""alien hand syndrome¨ , an useless President and General Ripper's assistant . As Columbia Pictures agreed to provide financing only if Peter Sellers played at least four major roles , in their eyes, Sellers playing multiple roles was one reason Lolita (1962) was so successful. Peter Sellers was the first actor to be nominated for a single Academy award , best actor , for a film in which he portrayed three different characters in the same film . Furthermore , an awesome support cast with triumphant acting from Keenan Wynn as Col. 'Bat' Guano , Slim Pickens as Maj. 'King' Kong , Peter Bull as Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky , Tracy Reed as Miss Scott and film debut of James Earl Jones. <br/><br/>This was apparently one of the first films in which the US Air Force's new B-52 Stratofortress bomber was featured. It appeared in a number of films afterward, notably A Gathering of Eagles (1963), and By Dawn's Early Light (1990) and the first Bombers B 52 (1957) . In fact , in the early 1960s the B-52 was cutting-edge technology. Access to it was a matter of national security , the Pentagon refused to lend any support to the film after they read the script , as set designers reconstructed the B-52 bomber's cockpit from a single photograph that appeared in a British flying magazine. Atmospheric musical score by Laurie Johnson , including some classic songs . Brilliant Cinematography in white and black by Gilbert Taylor , being Stanley Kubrick's last black and white film. . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Stanley Kubrick , as research, he read nearly 50 books about nuclear war . This is probably the most famed picture -with the possibly exception of 2001 A space odyssey- of the relatively infrequent movies directed by this extraordinary filmmaker."

","King of Comedy and A Clockwork Orange used to be my favourite black comedies but now I have found THE ONE. Doctor Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is directed by Stanley Kubrick, the greatest and most influential director of all time! Stanley Kubrick was a young controversial director who had met with topics of World War 1, Boxers, Robbers, Spartacus, A man going out with his daughter, so he had his fair share of controversy and did even more so in the years to come. Stanley Kubrick's dark sense of humour works so well in this movie, Peter Sellers plays three roles, one as a British executive officer for Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper, the American President Merkin Muffley and Nazi Scientist Doctor Strangelove. He was originally going to play a fourth role but was replaced by Slim Pickens.
It is so strange that this movie is PG, the mentions of bodily fluids, dirty sense of humour between Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and his 'assistant' (totally nothing else) Miss Scott. Malcolm McDowell said Stanley Kubrick had the dark and most sick sense of humour that most people can get, but select few don't, and this is where it shines. Peter Sellers' Nazi voice impression is so great and hilarious, and this movie is so believable like most of Kubrick's work.
The cinematography and script are on point. Kubrick's direction and production design is once again beautiful like it is with any other Kubrick movie. Not only is this my favourite war movie, it is also quite possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen!

"truemythmedia","10","3","4","18 July 2019"," A Gut Busting Laugh Bomb
","This movie is a megaton nuclear warhead of comedy with three pieces making up the main elements of this cacophony of ludicrosity.<br/><br/>The first piece is Peter Sellers (""The Pink Panther Strikes Again""). One of the greatest comedians to ever live, many in the United States may have forgotten him with a tragic amount of expedience due to a few factors. He's British so Americans tend to think of him as somehow outside of mainstream comedy history if the even think of him. He passed away in 1980 and thus was never in any pop-culture movies in the way that we think of them today. In addition, comedy tends to age poorly so many assume old comedies aren't worth watching.<br/><br/>This is tragic because none of those ideas really stick when you try to label Peter Sellers with them. He may have been British but he is not merely a 'British Comedy' phenomenon. His talent as a comedian is so rare that he is frequently referred to as ""The Greatest Comedian of All Time."" Keep your EGOT. As for pop-culture, how about ""The Pink Panther"" series/franchise which he headed up? How about influencing Eddie Murphy and his performance as the Klump Family in ""The Nutty Professor."" Oh yeah, and when Stanley Kubrick, a man often credited as the Greatest American Film Maker of All Time, wanted to make a satire he tapped Sellers for the task. That's got to say something.<br/><br/>As for comedy not aging well, it is one of Seller's greatest qualities, and Kubrick's for that matter, that he seems timeless. His humor , while at times requiring knowledge of some context, is remarkably sharp and poignant even today, maybe even more so today.<br/><br/>The next element of the comedy in ""Dr. Strangelove"" is George C. Scott's (""Patton"") performance as General Turgidson, an advisor to the President throughout the crisis. This performance is the best in the film and that is saying a lot considering the presence of Peter Sellers in the movie.<br/><br/>Scott's wildly gesticulating performance is a symbol of every human reaction to a crisis when your only solutions to a problem are violent ones. In the end you find yourself cheering for how effectively you cause your own demise. Scott's ability to play both the panicked hysteria and the confidence of the military is one of the greatest examples of satire I have ever seen."

In loony jest, it even suggests our leaders might be no better (maybe even worse) than the perfidious Soviets. Needless to say, that appeared unpatriotic to many. Nevertheless, it's the inspired lunacy of the acting and writing that makes this bitter pill go down. What stays with me is the movie's obsessive attention to technical detail, whether switch flipping in Kong's bomber, communication set-ups stateside, or the War Room's big board. Lying at the core is that utter contrast between technological expertise, on one hand, and mocking lunacy of the guys in charge, on the other. What the movie seems to say, if you will, is that the same collective intelligence that can create technical marvels is too wacko to use them intelligently. I suspect the lesson still applies, as the movie cleverly implies."
"geo-76409","10","3","4","5 April 2017"," The Magnum Opus of Disaster-Comedy
","A classic Kubrick movie with a plot so absurd it had to come from reality. This movie fits perfectly with director Stanly Kubrick's iconic body of work. Dr. Strangelove carries Kubrick's signature brand of storytelling: combined with tongue-in-cheek humor over a background of looming unthinkable disaster. Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece of the disaster-comedy genre. The movie brings in stars both famous then and famous now such as George C. Scott, James Earl Jones, Slim Pickens, and of course, Peter Sellers, Peter Sellers, and Peter Sellers. <br/><br/>The thing that makes Dr. Strangelove so unique is how Kubrick puts such an absurd and hilarious movie over the dark, terrifying idea of nuclear catastrophe. The movie almost doesn't seem like a comedy with the tense ""World teetering on a knife-point"" atmosphere; only to be broken by character names like ""Alexi de Sadesky,"" ""Jack D. Ripper,"" and ""Bat Guano"" to list a few. <br/><br/>The story unfolds when General Ripper exceeds his authority and sends bomber squadrons to attack Russia as he believes they are polluting America's fluids because the Communists only drink vodka. He holds out on his base while one of his senior officers - Peter Sellers - tries to talk him down. Meanwhile, President Merkin Muffley - Peter Sellers - gathers a council in the war room with top military officials, the Russian ambassador, and a disabled ex-German scientist – Peter Sellers – who keeps referring to him as, ""Mein Fuhrer."" All while a mysterious ""Doomsday Device"" threatens to obliterate civilization. Hilarity ensues, 10/10."
"talisencrw","10","3","4","23 August 2016"," Excellent one-of-a-kind work from Kubrick!
","Kubrick is such a remarkable director that only he could make a movie so revolutionarily hilarious about the Cold War and yet it's so difficult to even place it in my Top 5 of his works (and yes, his next film, '2001: A Space Odyssey' would be my favourite movie ever made), though for Peter Sellers, a rare actor whom Kubrick would work with more than once, this would have to be up there with 'Being There' and 'The Party' in terms of my favourite works of his.<br/><br/>Slim Pickens often noted that this film established his career. Unfortunately, many so-called film aficionados of today won't bother either with black-and-white movies or films made before 1970, which is a shame, because this is clearly a wonderful work that more people today should see.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and watch it if you haven't already done so. Since 9/11 I always wonder if something of this ilk could, in this era of political correctedness, ever be made about the present state of things."
"Gideon24","9","3","4","9 December 2015"," Black comedy at its Zenith...
","Never has the absurdity of war been so bitingly and accurately skewered as it was in the 1964 classic Dr. Strangelove: Or How Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. a scorching black comedy that sheds a very unflattering but unfortunately probably spot-on look not only at war, but the mental capacities of the people who have their hands on the button.<br/><br/>Director Stanley Kubrick has created his masterpiece here, chronicling what happens when a clearly insane military general who triggers an attack on the Soviet Union that could lead to nuclear holocaust and how the President of the US and his advisers try to deal with the repercussions.<br/><br/>Released during the infancy of the Vietnam War, this film probably ruffled a lot of feathers in Washington, though I don't know for sure, since I was only six year old at the time, but the film can now be cherished for the scathingly brilliant satire that it is.<br/><br/>Kubrick's masterful direction is only surpassed by the brilliantly tongue-in-cheek screenplay by Kubrick, Terry Southern, and Peter George, that was clearly robbed of an Oscar. As for casting, it's perfection...Peter Sellers' powerhouse performance where he effortlessly brings three different characters to life is a joy to behold. Sellers, too, was robbed of an Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actor. My personal favorite of his three characters was President Muffley, who is given the best line in the movie and whose first phone conversation with the President of the USSR (Dimitri) to explain what's going on had me on the floor. Sellers has never made me laugh so hard, and I've seen most of the Pink Panther movies. Kubrick pulled the performance of his career out of Sterling Hayden as the insane general as was George C. Scott's bigoted military leader who is possibly as crazy as Hayden's character. Scott is brash and funny and was Oscar-worthy as well. <br/><br/>Kubrick's attention to detail in bringing this epic story to life works on every level. The black and white photography only adds to the realism and there is impressive art direction and inventive camera- work, but it is the Oscar worthy work by Kubrick, Sellers, Scott, Southern, and George that make this one sizzle and earn it the well-deserved reputation of a classic."

","The film opens with a simple printed disclaimer: `The US army claims to have safeguards in place which render the following events impossible', or words to that effect.  Well, I'm willing to believe that.  Besides, that was 1964. Things have changed since, and the chances of an accidental nuclear exchange - between the United States and Russia, at any rate - have dropped considerably.  But `Strangelove' STILL gives me a small thrill of panic. Kubrick plays on our nerves masterfully.  At one moment it seems as if the forces of sanity are going to win, the next minute it seems as though they don't stand a chance: I won't reveal all the cleverly constructed reversals of fortune, but part of me is itching to.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers's performances (all four of them) are gleeful fun to watch. It was a stroke of genius NOT making the president a buffoon.  In fact he's a decent and intelligent man, by no means a weak leader, and his relationship with Dmitri (the Russian general secretary) is almost touching - not that any of this helps him very much.<br/><br/>I've noticed that a number of people who say they aren't fond of Kubrick in general make an exception for this film.  I can see why - even though I AM fond of Kubrick in general."
"Amyth47","6","4","6","27 October 2018"," No fighting in the War Room!
","My Rating : 6/10<br/><br/>Led by the always zany Peter Sellers this film takes a satirical look at the cold war and the threat of nuclear war. A general (Sterling Hayden) perceives a false threat from the USSR and sets planes carrying nuclear bombs to attack soviet targets while politicians as well as high ranking military men try to stop it from escalating. With a supporting cast coming from a lot of fantastic actors, most memorably from George C. Scott, this film will keep you laughing from beginning to end while looking at the absurdity of those who are in charge of the worlds fate. There may not be fighting in the war room, but there are laughs aplenty."
"brianberta","9","4","6","10 April 2016"," Brilliant
","In mine and many other people's opinions, I feel like Kubrick is one of the best directors of all time. He has made many films which are widely considered to be the best of their genre. ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) is widely considered to be one of the best war films, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is widely considered to be one of the best sci-fi films, ""The Shining"" (1980) is widely considered to be one of the best horror films, ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) is widely considered to be one of the best violent films, and ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) is widely considered to be one of the best comedies.<br/><br/>After an insane general named ""Jack D. Ripper"" triggers a plan to start a nuclear holocaust, a room full of generals and politicians desperately attempt to stop him before it's too late.<br/><br/>Before watching this, one would not expect for it to be a comedy since it's about a nuclear holocaust, a serious topic. However, I was very impressed with how Stanley Kubrick went and did it anyways. I feel like this is actually a very good topic to make a film off of. With that being said, it succeeds on different aspects of comedy.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why the comedy in this film works so good is how they get delayed so much. While President Merkin Muffley is warning Russia of the attacks, their conversation gets drawn out, and it makes the audience ask ""Shouldn't they be trying to hurry?"" In most other films, this would be a flaw, but since this is a comedy, this can be excused as it represents more about the comedy. Another great scene is when the U.S. army tries to take over a base with Ripper inside in hopes of finding the recall code to get the planes to abort their mission. Kubrick takes advantage of every single way how this scene could be drawn out, and it leaves the audience laughing at how unlucky everyone is getting. I'm not going to spoil how this film ends, but it's a really great scene which uses this concept.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this film is some of its dialogue. My favorite line from the film is: ""Gentlemen, you can't fight here! This is the war room!"" It's a simple line, but it's very effective. Also, some of the one-liners kind of take into effect its comedy where it delays scenes. For example, the scene where Gen. ""Buck"" Turgidson explains Ripper's plan to Merkin Muffley is full of many funny quotes like: ""Well sir, I would say that General Ripper has already invalidated that policy!"". Also, there is the classic ending quote.<br/><br/>Finally, there are some jokes that you have to think about in order to get what they mean. Some of them are even left up to interpretation for what they mean. For example, the scene at the end where the Russian ambassador steps away from everyone, and does something with his watch takes a bit of thinking to determine what he's doing, and how that ties in with another scene. Also, the classic quote at the end: ""Mein Fuhrer, I can walk"" has a ton of interpretations that can come from it. Another ambiguous joke is the increasing level of ""Alien Hand Syndrome"" that Dr. Strangelove experiences throughout the film. Finally, there can even be discussion for what the title of the film, and its alternate title mean, and why Kubrick chose those 2 titles for the film.<br/><br/>One thing I really like Kubrick for is how he tells simple, yet grand stories with his films. The comedy in this one represents that real well because the more I think about the comedy in this film, the more impressive and mind-blowing it seems.<br/><br/>Another great thing I got to mention about this film is its great acting. It is actually very easy for me to decide who my favorite actor is in this film, and it seems like a very obvious choice. My favorite actor from this film was Peter Sellers. He plays 3 different characters (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove). I don't think that his performance was weak for any of these characters, and he gave a magnificent performance for all of them. However, my favorite character that he played was Dr. Strangelove. He is able to act in a weird and goofy tone without ever being annoying. It's hard for an actor to successfully accomplish this, but he did it exceptionally well. His other 2 roles were also great and believable as well. Without a doubt, he stole the show.<br/><br/>While Sellers is clearly the best, that's not to say that there weren't any other actors who blew me away. In fact, if I could give almost equal credit to another actor who did a great job as well, it would be George C. Scott as General ""Buck"" Turgidson. He also gave a convincing performance, and he stood out a lot as well. Other great actors include Slim Pickens as Major ""King"" Kong for his consistent, upbeat attitude that he maintained throughout the film; even at times of despair, Sterling Hayden as Jack D. Ripper for his way of sounding like this was a real life, serious film; not a comedy film, and Peter Bull as Alexi de Sadesky because of the suspicious tone he had which unintentionally gave him some charm.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is another masterpiece in Kubrick's brilliant body of work. It hits numerous layers of comedy that can sometimes be pretty deep - this evokes Kubrick's talent of making simple, yet grand stories. Also, the acting is really good as well, especially coming from Sellers who played 3 roles exceptionally. It's no wonder why Kubrick is considered to be so good by his fans, and he continues to impress me even more every time I watch another one of his films."
"fischer-bill","10","4","6","2 February 2016"," A classic by a genius
","This classic by Stanley Kubrick is not only a cracking good story but reflects the times in which it was released. A stellar cast combined with silky black and white production, this film has so much going for it, it is hard to know where to begin. This is satire at its best. Each fully developed character is played with gusto, especially Peter Sellers who has no fewer than three roles. George C. Scott as General Buck Turgeson is also granted some terrific lines that he delivers with a almost child like awareness, completely oblivious of the import of what he is saying. The film switches between artfully crafted, beautiful composed cinematography and a rugged hand held documentary style. There are scenes in a b-52 bomber that are so realistic that you feel you are right in the airplane. Anyone who wants to see a group of actors and a brilliant director, all at the top of their game, will enjoy this movie."
"deepakahlu","9","4","6","27 January 2016"," Glorious madness...
","Shooting the breeze with some close friends and fellow film enthusiasts a few evenings ago, talk turned to the cinema of Stanley Kubrick. Due obeisance was paid to 2001 A Space Odyssey, the possible long term psychological trauma induced by watching A Clockwork Orange at the age of 14 (as my son claims to have done) was chewed over, and 'what the hell went wrong' with Eyes Wide Shut was debated. <br/><br/>My personal favorite from the Kubrick stable — the sharply intelligent and insanely hilarious 1964 cold war spoof — Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Three Peter Sellers, one George C. Scott, a loony general obsessed with contamination of bodily fluids to kick off the glorious madness, and the most hysterically funny phone conversation you will ever hear between the President of the United States and the Premier of USSR. <br/><br/>The film is rated #49 in the top 250 films of all time on IMDb, so I'm not kidding!"
"bross3","10","4","6","6 November 1999"," You're going to have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company.
","This film must require a certain sense of humor combined with an understanding of the cold war and the nuclear arms race.  It always strikes me that people that don't quite ""get"" Dr. Strangelove and I'm not really sure why.  There is a lot of subtle humor inserted into this black comedy and I suppose you have to be paying attention to really find it all.  During my first viewing I thought it was fairly slow and while there were clearly moments of genius, they seemed to be relatively far apart.  Now when I watch it, it's a series of ridiculously perfect scenes put together without a single wasted frame.  <br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is the strongest indictment of war and militarism that I have ever seen.  Kubrick somehow created for us a film that sums up the absurd peril that the world faced during the cold war and also allowed us to laugh at the men who were responsible for keeping the world from falling into chaos and destruction.  The fact that this film seems somehow plausible and possible makes it all the more scary."

"matlefebvre20","10","7","13","2 July 2007"," The darkest comedy of them all... and one of the funniest too!
","When ""Full Metal Jacket"" was released in theaters in 1987, it was said that the timing couldn't have been worse because of the huge success of the movie ""Platoon"" the year before, without adding the quantity of Academy Awards picked up by the Oliver Stone film. However, in January 1964, it was the exact opposite that was said about ""Dr. Strangelove"".<br/><br/>Today, the Cold War issues remain present, but they're far less important than the scenario that was being drawn at the end of the year 1963, that is the moment where this classic Stanley Kubrick comedy was shot. It was the time of the ""Freezing War"", the scary Cuban Missile Crisis was still fresh in the collective mind and the young President Kennedy was just being assassinated.<br/><br/>That's when arrived this movie, which dared to show a nuclear apocalypse with a comic eye. But what could have been funny in there? It's possible to laugh of the mishaps of somebody other than ourselves, but when everybody is concerned, it's far less funny. Just remember the 9/11 aftermath, when rumors of WWIII surfaced...<br/><br/>But Stanley Kubrick, being a master of virtually every genre, conceived an astoundingly funny comedy, skilfully mixing the suspense from a man-made end-of-the-world with the absurdity of the characters who act in, sometimes without knowing it.<br/><br/>Kubrick worked with a talented screenwriter in the person of Terry Southern, but especially with prodigious actors. I'm evidently referring to Peter Sellers, whose three roles entered into the legend, and George C. Scott, whose role quality rivals with his Oscar-winning performance of General Patton in the movie ""Patton"", released six years later.<br/><br/>Based on the theme of the failure to communicate, the movie is set in three different places. Primo: the Burpleson Air Force Base, headed by General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a psychotic obsessed by fluoridation which ""saps and impurifies all of our precious bodily fluids"". His aide de camp is Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Sellers), a timid but highly competent English officer who doesn't buy Ripper's theories.<br/><br/>Secundo: a B-52 piloted by Major ""King"" Kong (western star Slim Pickens). We see Kong and his crew (which includes young James Earl Jones) preparing themselves to the nuclear strike and composing with unexpected difficulties which will provide even more thrills.<br/><br/>Tertio: the Pentagon or more precisely, the War Room. It's there that the three most interesting characters of the story are located: President Merkin Muffley (Sellers), General Buck Turgidson (Scott) and hilarious mad scientist Dr. Strangelove (Sellers). They try to communicate with drunken Soviet president Kissoff, but in vain.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" is among the greatest comedies ever made, but this statement isn't based upon the quantity of laughs that the movie unfolds. In fact, the first time I watched it, I only laugh wildly twice: when Turgidson stumbles in the War Room and when Dr. Strangelove is struggling with his uncontrollable alien right hand.<br/><br/>Instead, ""Dr. Strangelove"" plays on tongue-in-cheek humor and the absurdity of the characters, as well as some subtleties. The best example is the impossible names of the characters, which have almost all a sexual connotation. There's a list: Merkin Muffley, Turgidson, Kissoff, de Sadesky, Bat Guano and Jack D. Ripper. We also laugh of improbable messages or writings, like the post in the base on which it is written: ""Peace is our profession"", at the moment where soldiers are fighting each other. There's also the useless "" NUCLEAR WARHEAD – HANDLE WITH CARE"".<br/><br/>It is obvious that the movie wouldn't have been so successful without the exceptional performance of its three main actors. Peter Sellers is remarkably all-round and he's an unequaled master with different accents. His Dr. Strangelove role is probably the greatest of his career, even if the character himself appears on-screen for about ten minutes only.<br/><br/>George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens are the other mentionable actors. Scott is very funny with his character who spends most of his time at chewing gum, making ridiculous facial expressions and insulting the ""Russkies"". Hayden is disturbing with his perpetual cigar and his monologues about fluoridation and ""Commies"". The orders he gives to his troops before the base attack are particularly absurd, especially when he says: ""Don't trust any man, except if you know him personally"". As for Pickens, he will always be remembered for his idiot but enjoyable-to-hear speeches and for his cowboy hat which he wears until the end, during the most memorable scene, where he rides the bomb like a matador riding a bull in a rodeo.<br/><br/>Not only is this movie very funny, it's also very pessimistic. How many times do we speak of prejudices and no-confidence between people? Even at the end, when doomsday is unavoidable...<br/><br/>And I've almost forgotten to mention the precious aid from production designer Ken Adam. Without him, there wouldn't be no War Room, this fictitious but pop culture-iconic room. The interior of the B-52 is also well-made.<br/><br/>However, the plane exterior is the main problem of the film. To suspend a plane model in front of the camera with a Russian land background is a big disappointment, especially when we know how fussy director Kubrick is.<br/><br/>But from the opening title sequence, where a plane refueling looks like a jumbo-size sexual act, to the final scene, where a sequence of nuclear explosions is accompanied by the famous Vera Lynn song ""We'll Meet Again"", it's guaranteed that ""Dr. Strangelove"" never bores. Even if universal peace happens someday, we'll watch this movie with a large smile and a satisfied mood. That's what we call a timeless classic..."

Today the cold war is dead - as is Kubrick, Sellers and Haydon - but this film's skill and brilliance lives on.<br/><br/>Only Kubrick could have chosen to make a comedy film that used such a harsh backdrop as the very future of the world. This makes the film even better - counterbalancing the ultra dark nature of the film. Thankfully he did not end the film with a food fight as he originally planned.<br/><br/>(That explains the long table in the war room. In reality no food or drink is allowed in war room locations in case it is spilled in to the sensitive equipment.)<br/><br/>Strangely a more straight version of the ""ultimate nightmare"" Fail-safe (1964) is generally forgotten, although it is, perhaps, better plotted and more true-to-life.<br/><br/>Kubrick's admiration for Sellers allowed him to be cast in four roles (he only played three in the end): An RAF officer, the US President, the mad German scientist (Strangelove) and one of  the bomber pilots. He dropped out of the last role, mostly because he feared one of the stunts -  that could not have been doubled - that features at the end of the picture.<br/><br/>(A picture - with Sellers dressed in pilots uniform - is still in circulation suggesting that filming of him in the role had even started. Replacement Slim Pickins was, allegedly, not told that it was a comedy, although it is hard to say this effected an actor not noted for his variety of delivery.)<br/><br/>Seller's position in these three roles saved quite a bit of money on a film that required elaborate sets (that suffered from constant overheating). The film was only a modestly budgeted affair and therefore didn't feature Kubrick's over-the-top perfectionism that often grinds the actors to dust. At one stage George C. Scott falls over (clearly from losing grip on a shinny floor rather than a stunt) and the accident was left in. On the Shining (1980) Kubrick wanted 50 takes to get a door slam right!<br/><br/>Despite having three shots at the prize Sellers doesn't come out of the film with the best comedy performance award. That goes to the constantly under-rated Sterling Haydon as the mad general who believes that fluoride in the water is responsible the world's plight!<br/><br/>Dr Strangelove is in every way a classic and has another small footnote in history: It was Elvis Presley's  favourite film.

","It can safely be assumed that DR. STRANGELOVE could not have been made in the Eisenhower years. Even after Senator McCarthy's fall from public support, Ike and the Republicans (and the Democrats) were too involved in the politics of the Cold War to consider the ultimate point of containment and confrontation of the Soviet Union and the Communists as a subject worth laughing at. I can only think of one film, THE ATOMIC KID, that appeared in the 1950s, and somewhat spoofed nuclear disaster. In that film Mickey Rooney stumbles into a cabin stocked with supplies when he and his friend/partner Robert Strauss are looking for assistance (their car broke down). Rooney is at the site when a nuclear bomb is dropped on it (it is the target). He survives, and the only rationale for it is that he was eating peanut butter sandwiches. The antics of American and Russian agents get involved in that film, as does the American habit of looking for the main chance (Strauss sees Rooney as a potential gold mine in the advertising world). But it is pretty lightweight stuff - and miles away from the real sense of dread surrounding STRANGELOVE.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about this darkest of comedies. For all the humor involved, it shows the human race is so paranoid and so stupid that we will stumble very easily into our own obliteration at each other's hands. It's hard to argue with that view. And note that two years before Stanley Kubrick's film was released, the world came very close to a politically caused nuclear Armageddon in the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film remains potentially true.<br/><br/>General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden's role; I love that name) orders a secret nuclear attack on Russia because he has become convinced that the Russians are using fluoridation to undermine our virility. He has shut down the Burpleton Airforce Base (it has a great sign - ""Peace is our Business"" - on the field), so that nobody can reach him to order the planes back. Only his British military aide, Major Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers in his first of three roles) is available (despite Ripper's overwhelming presence) to try to undue the damage.<br/><br/>In the meantime other U.S. military forces tip off the Pentagon Brass and President Merton Muffly (Sellers in his second role) about the launching of the attack. The leading adviser on the Air Force, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) comes into the meeting from enjoying his bodily fluids (he tells the girl to say her prayers). Scott is taken to task by Muffly about the failure of a comprehensive psychiatric test for upper level officers that failed to reveal General Ripper was insane. Turgidson suggests that one failure does not disprove the system doesn't work. Muffley is also turned off by Turgidson's suggestions that rather than stop Ripper's attack, we should go fully ballistic on the U.S.S.R. ""I can promise,"" Turgidson rattles off, ""thirty million U.S. casualties tops!"" Muffley tries to prepare the Russians - he invites their ambassador De Sadeski (Peter Bull) to the Pentagon War Room, and he tries to warn the drunken Russian Premier, Dimitri Kissoff, but has to reduce his serious warning to almost a fairy tale (""Well...one of our generals went a little funny in the head."").<br/><br/>The contemporary serious film FAILSAFE had similar problems emerge when a computer system erroneously triggers an attack. The President there (Henry Fonda) was not confronted by as many forms of idiocy as Seller's Muffley (including his own). Fonda actually does reach the planes but they refuse to believe he is President. Muffley too gets to the planes (once he gets the correct code used) but one plane has a busted radio and never hears him. That is the plane of Major ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens), who has the most famous last fatal ride in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Most of the figures in DR. STRANGELOVE are based on real life figures. Muffley was based on Adlai Stevenson, a well-intentioned man who twice ran for President, but couldn't sell himself (against Eisenhower, who could?). Ripper (forgetting who his name is based on) is based on General Edward Walker who openly espoused anti-fluoridation and John Birch politics in his job. Turgidson is based on General Curtis LeMay, a great Air Force figure from World War II, but too openly anti-Russian in the Cold War. De Sadesky (who shows a sneaky side twice in the film) seems based on Andrei Gromyko, the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. in the Missile Crisis. Kissoff may be based on Nikita Khrustchev.<br/><br/>And then there is Strangelove (Sellers in the best of his three performances). A neo - Nazi scientist transported to the U.S. (a beneficiary of ""Operation Paper Clip"" at the end of World War II, where scientists like Werner Von Braun ended up in the U.S. for our military's purposes), he has elements of Von Braun and Edward Teller, the Hungarian-born scientist (so-called father of the Hydrogen bomb) who hated the Communists or anyone who might start defending them (he did a number on J. Robert Oppenheimer). Anyone else? There has been a persistent suggestion that Strangelove is based on Henry Kissinger, but this seems not to be true. Certainly the crippled madman, with his mechanical arm that won't behave itself (it keeps ""heiling"") is one of a kind, suggesting a sexual paradise in the future within the abandoned gold mines and cold mines of America. At the end he rises from his wheelchair without thinking, and suddenly announces, ""Mein Fuhrer...I can walk!"" In the thermonuclear age as Armageddon advances our leader shows he has barely stopped being a crawling baby!!<br/><br/>For the sake of that performance alone the film is worth seeing.

It's so easy to mock the '50s that one can hardly be too amused by the jokes. Also, while the image of the cowboy pilot riding the bomb has become a cultural icon, it's pretty stupid when you think about it and it's so predictable when you watch the movie that it can really be all that funny. This is simply a precursor to Chevy Chase movies, where everything goes wrong all the time and even though the viewer knows that it's still somehow supposed to be funny. Ignore Kubric's and Sellers' names for a minute and you'll realize that this isn't really that great."

"mstomaso","10","6","11","28 March 2008"," The Ultimate Cold War Film Set in Kubrick's Disorienting Pace
","Directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by the brilliant Terry Southern, Dr. Strangelove is a landmark film in many ways. While the film is normally classified as a dark comedy, it really consists of a hell of a lot of darkness made light of.<br/><br/>There are plenty of great films which, in one way or another examine or evolve from the context of the cold war. Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is one of the best. A deranged paranoid General (Keenan Wynn) shuts down all communication at his base, orders his men to shoot at anything which attempts to approach the base and orders the dozens of B-52s under his command to drop nuclear bombs all over the Soviet Union. The rest of the film is mostly about how the United States' bumbling bureaucracy and megalomaniacal military attempt to 'contain the situation' while practicing the usual ass-covering.<br/><br/>Sellers plays at least three disparate and challenging roles, and, not surprisingly, has most of the truly comedic scenes. George C. Scott and Keenan Wynn are frankly incredible as a couple of deranged generals respectively attempting to make the best of the situation and end the communist threat of fluoridated water. There are very few LOLs in this film. The humor is, in fact, somewhat uncomfortable most of the time, though it is definitely humor nonetheless. And yes, everything about this film is intentional and calculated.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick used pacing in a somewhat unique way in many of his most well-known films. He sometimes created visual phrases with Shatner-like dramatic pauses attached to either end, and the result is always jarring and always disorienting - making the quotidian seem odd. Strangelove is the earliest Kubrick film I remember seeing this visual style in, but he took it to a new level in 2001 and Eyes Wide Shut. A Clockwork Orange exploits it as well. In Strangelove, he complements the alienating pacing with spectacular camera work and over-dramatic lighting. Visually superb film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Different things characterize a Kubrick film: cold style, a languorous deep camera, intellectual humor. But for me, all of these pale compared his primary concern: investigating who the narrator is.<br/><br/>He hated `Sparticus' and struck out to do intelligent work. His collaboration with Brando failed, so he bought `Lolita,' the most adventurous narrative literary experiment til then. It featured a narrator who is obsessed, possibly mad and surely not to be trusted. Kubric (rather radically) translated that layered presentation into the POV of Quimby, who assumes multiple characters, either driving or populating Humbert's worlds.<br/><br/>He would later hit paydirt in `2001' with the idea of three battling narrators (human, machine, alien) for control over what we see. And later with `Orange' about a film that indocrinates itself through film.<br/><br/>Along the way, he tried this: four narratives all provided by Sellers. The idea was that each man imposed or reported his own reality and you really wouldn't know which to trust. Our man Peter broke his leg though and the whole thing shifted, but it was changing character throughout based on other accidents as well. Yes, I know there is a story, but it really doesn't matter. In fact it matters so little it changed every day, and so did the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Scott turned out to be comically stronger than guessed. The president morphed into someone less fey, the pie scene (which was to be a Marx Brothers tipoff) failed. <br/><br/>So I see this as minor Kubrick, a failure of what he intended. It is a great Sellers film for the Von Braun/Ed Teller bit, and for that it is appreciated. But if you want to see a master succeeding at something only he seems to be able to do, you'll need to look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"HotPot","4","18","44","23 September 2010"," My mistake
","I do apologise: I'd somehow got it into my head that comedies are supposed to be funny. Then I remembered our greatest playwright's comedies and assumed that must be what Mr Kubrick was going for with this 'comedy'.<br/><br/>I suppose he started off on the right track, getting Peter Sellers involved, but sadly (for a modern comedy at least) you tend to need a funny script rather than just a funny actor, and the script was certainly not funny. I'm sorry to say that Sellers' Dr. Strangelove came across as over-the-top and self-indulgent. He did as well as could be expected with the President character, given the mediocre script. I quite liked his English airman though: suitably snooty without being offensive.<br/><br/>Many of the other actors (notably excluding James Earl Jones) were fairly rubbish, I thought; lots of overacting, presumably under the mistaken impression that this is what makes a good comedic performance.<br/><br/>The story was original enough, although it basically fizzled out at the end, not knowing quite where to go and instead just stopping. It could have reached the end much more quickly too, if it hadn't been so flabbily edited; many was the scene I thought yeah, I get the point, let's move on...<br/><br/>I'm trying to work out why I gave it as much as 4/10 now. It's ""of its time"" I suppose, so I shouldn't judge too harshly now.<br/><br/>I realised, on reaching the end of the film, that I vaguely remember seeing it before at some point, but I suspect the vagueness of my recollection simply underlines what a forgettable film it is.<br/><br/>I accept that far more people seem to like it than don't; I just can't work out why. But then I also can't work out why people think Kubrick is anything more than a below-average director. Sorry, Kubrick fans, but I'd have to recommend giving this one a wide berth."

","Maybe there is something wrong with me. I have watched this film twice and I still don't get what all the hoopla is about. I'm not saying that this isn't a dark comedic masterpiece with a first rate cast, director and writing but I don't think it is as funny or dark as it could be. It takes a lot to watch it without being distracted. George C. Scott is brilliant as is Peter Sellers CBE. Sterling Hayden, James Earl Jones ,and Keenan Wynn are also great in the cast. Kubrick was known for his perfectionism and I'm not surprised by this film. It's short and maybe too short. There is a lot going on in the film.

"WriterDave","10","9","19","29 December 2005"," You Can't Fight in Here! This is the War Room!
","Just about everything in this brilliant satire of Cold War politics is perfect. Kubrick created his first template masterpiece with this hilarious comedy that sees military bureaucracy as a comedy of errors and a hot-line conversation between the President of the US and the Premier of the USSR as a snippy fit between quasi-lovers. You have everything you could ever want here: great dialogue, fantastic acting, flawless directing, cool sets, and timely political farce (that could still ring true today in this age of Bush America, Institutionalized Fear, and the War on Terror).<br/><br/>Everyone deservedly raves about Peter Sellers in his multiple roles (as Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove), but I dare you to find a funnier performance than that of George C. Scott as the slapdash over-zealous General ""Buck"" Turgidson, especially when he falls over backwards in the War Room and gets up and continues his speech without missing a beat. Also of note is Sterling Hayden as Jack D. Ripper. His riffs on the purity of essence, bodily fluids, and Communist infiltration through fluoridation are laugh-out-loud funny. With characters like Colonel ""Bat"" Guano, and Slim Pickens' Major Kong, great scenes naturally flow forth, and Kubrick's one take on pure comedy is simply genius. He was wise never to touch the genre again fully (although ""A Clockwork Orange"" will always be a comedy in my book), as he made the perfect example of the form here."
"MartinHafer","10","7","14","15 November 2006"," This gets better with repeated viewings--what a film!
","I saw this film originally when I was about 12 and I wasn't super-impressed by it--particularly since my father was a bit like George C. Scott's character in the film!! However, years later (long after the threat from nuclear annihilation from the Soviet Union has greatly diminished), I was a lot older and experienced and thought the film was brilliant--and not the ""Commie Plot"" my Dad had envisioned!<br/><br/>The film features some amazing performances that are absolutely mesmerizing. Sterling Hayden is excellent as the schizophrenic general that orders a first strike on the USSR--he's gruff, weird but pretty believable. However, his performance is unfortunately overshadowed by two other actors. My favorite of these was George C. Scott. Although he didn't need to do the amazing multiple roles that Peter Sellers did (the man was AMAZING), the one character he played was hilarious and chilling. He was the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and you just have to see and hear him to believe him. Although technically NOT schizophrenic like Hayden, he was a totally insane general that actually seemed to look forward to a nuclear war with the ""!@&%@# Ruskies!"". His swagger and bravado was perfectly balanced with all the truly stupid things the character unintentionally said--again and again.<br/><br/>Now as for Sellers, he was such a great character actor but all too often, he was remembered more for Inspector Clousseau (a good character, but only one of MANY the man was capable of doing) or he was remembered for all the BAD movies he did in his lifetime. It seems for every great film he made (such as THE MOUSE THAT ROARED or BEING THERE), he also made crap (such as THE PRISONER OF ZENDA or THE FIENDISH PLOT OF FU MANCHU). His lack of discernment tended to hide his brilliance. And, in Dr. Strangelove he was absolutely brilliant--playing three totally different roles. As the British Colonel, he was quite believable and underplayed the role. As the President, he was a little more comical and yet pretty convincing. And, as Dr. Strangelove, he was an over-the-top ex-Nazi (not all that ""ex"" if you ask me) madman. The variety was stunning and almost without precedent--except for a very similar multiple role situation Sellers also played in 1959's THE MOUSE THAT ROARED--another brilliant comedy about nuclear war.<br/><br/>In addition to the great acting and writing, I do have to take my hat off to Stanley Kubrick. In past IMDb reviews, I was not particularly kind to several of his ""masterpieces"" (I am one of those who actually disliked 2001, CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON). However, I hope I am intellectually honest enough to view his films individually (PATHS OF GLORY, THE KILLING and SPARTACUS were wonderful).<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is a great film and can be enjoyed by anyone who has a decent handle on world events and history. Unfortunately, for a generation that now is at times obsessed with Paris Hilton and SURVIVOR, I also believe that the film is quickly becoming one that is simply beyond the capacity of many to even comprehend, as they can't even remember the past and have no trouble living that way."
"ElMaruecan82","10","5","9","25 June 2011"," War's seriousness sacrificed in the altar of hilarious absurdity ...
","It was a time that probably most of the users who reviewed ""Dr. Strangelove"" didn't know or were too young to remember, a time where the fate of humanity was hanging by a thread.<br/><br/>The nuclear scare was a reality that history proved to be the radical solution to any political inconvenience. And at this very time where the atom could annihilate life and civilization, when the two blocks on both sides of the iron curtain had the nuclear weapon ready to be used, any human being could have legitimate reasons to look at the future with fatalistic eyes. This paranoid state lasted during almost one decade reaching its paroxysm with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Legend has it that the Soviets had indeed a nuclear weapon aimed to destroy the world in an extreme case. Anyway, the Cuba crisis, had it escalated to a no-return point changing the temperature of the Cold War, could have meant the end of humanity, or in the best case, World War III. I needed to remind the context because it's still very hard to believe that all these elements inspired one of the funniest and most classic cinematic comedies. But I guess, it's no surprise that the only film-maker who has successfully gone through this challenge is the one and only: Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>The first time I watched ""Dr. Strangelove"", I had no idea about what to expect. I knew it was a political satire but having the iconic image of Major Kong riding the bomb in mind, I thought the movie would be inhabited by such goofiness, it would deviate it from the level of sophistication I expect from the Master. How wrong I was! If one thing, ""Dr. Strangelove"" strikes by the seriousness of its humor. It's almost a psychological introspection into the ability of serious people to inspire our laughs. These are adult men, reasonable, moderately competent, who are confronted to a political crisis initiated by a lunatic Brigadier Jack Ripper. This man, between some solemn cigars' puffs, reveals the sacred mission he'd be entrusted with, preservation of precious body fluids. Sterling Hayden is so damn serious and believable, I admit I bought it. But when you go into the film in depth, a sentence that should be a motto with Kubrick's films, is there ever a reason not absurd enough to justify war? ""Dr. Strangelove"" doesn't use absurdity for comedic purposes but more to denounce with subtlety, its eternal dichotomy with War, as the highest level of absurdity human mind ever reached. Could something be more absurd than fighting and destroying one population for the survival of another, when contrarily to animals who do it for survival, both can technically live in peace? <br/><br/>Jack Ripper sets the tone that the rest of the film will never contradict. And it brought up one of the most classic ironical movie lines when the General 'Buck' Turgidson, a hysterically funny George C. Scott in an Oscar worthy comedic performance, violently confronts the Russian Ambassador: ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the War Room"", shouts an patronizing President Muffey. The Cold War is almost reduced to a bunch of adults fighting like kids. Indeed, all through the film, there is a disturbing feeling that war is playful and the political leaders are like playground monitors incapable of keeping the lowest instincts of their troops under control. ""War is too serious to be left to politicians"" precisely because they simply can't handle their military troops, while the planes are going with ""Johnny Come Marching Home Again"" as musical background. That's the irony of civilization, its excess can't handle the barbarity. The unforgettable Red Phone conversation is probably my favorite and funniest moment from the film. Muffey very casually tries to appease his Russian homologue as if they were talking of a simple incident, not something that would eradicate any trace of life on the surface of earth. Hilariously disturbing.<br/><br/>This psychological element is omnipresent in Kubrick's as to insist on one of the very paradoxes of our species, our ""dehumanizing humanity"": being so sophisticated, so powerful, so civilized that it alienates in the conviction that these accomplishments, science, power can be used to kill other people in the name of self-preservation. The iconic ending where ""Dr. Strangelove""'s arm raises spasmodically as to make a Nazi gesture reminds that the Cold War carries the worst aspects of whatever World War II has taught us. The lesson hasn't been learned obviously, and the way, the psychotic Dr. Strangelove talks and seems to be listened with interest, would be tragic if it wasn't so damn funny. Of course, I couldn't go on without mentioning the genius of Peter Sellers, who managed to capture the absurd roots of evilness through Strangelove, while portraying the straight man as Muffey, the symbol of civilization's impotence. Not to forget, his performance as Captain Mandrake, the unsung hero who symbolizes the eternal struggle of well-intentioned men confronted to the threatening competence of evil people and the pointless competence of good ones ""You'll have to answer to the Coca Cola company"" while the world is in danger. Certainly the role of a lifetime and Sellers is perfect in this, and should have won the Oscar  as usual, no respect from the peers, the only Kurbickian paradox that can't be explained.<br/><br/>The ending of ""Dr. Strangelove"" is the ultimate testimony of Kubrick's tremendous talent and capability to provide iconic images for cinematic posterity. Major Kong riding the apocalyptic bomb humanity is the powerful allegory of a world that lost it, and the moment is so hilarious, than it's better to think of the movie as a comedy, with its gags, its impeccable script rich of wonderful one-liners, and some hilarious characters' names that would've made the Marx Brothers proud ... and thank God that this is not real, without forgetting that it could have been, or that it could be"

"pgear83","10","6","12","28 June 2008"," Mocking Fear
","At the height of the Cold War came one of the bravest and most timely and timeless of comedic films. Stanley Kubrick's satire of blow-hard politicians, insane military men, conspiracy theories and the strategy of MAD (mutual assured destruction) blasted a perceptive hole in the madness of the time. This film is unmistakably modern in its comedy and was a forebear to the ultra-ironic sense of humor that is the bread and butter of all the popular satire of this era. Of course, most young people (myself included) will have already seen many of the famous scenes in Dr. Strangelove replicated on The Simpsons long before they ever see the actual movie.<br/><br/>The film's plot involves ardent anti-communist General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden; ironically a one-time communist sympathizer) and his plan to destroy the USSR. Ripper's sexual inadequacies have led him to the conclusion that he is the victim of a communist conspiracy ""to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids."" His response is to order a sneak attack against the Russians, in the hope that President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) will subsequently be forced to finish the job.<br/><br/>From here we see the desperate attempts to stop the attack (and the subsequent activation of the Russian doomsday device) in some of the greatest sequences of comedy in film history. Ridiculous and hilarious dialog abounds. Most of the characters in charge are shockingly petty and out of touch with the deadly reality of the situation. In addition to Sellers' three roles the most memorable performance comes from George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson. He is jingoistic, incompetent and cannot refrain from insulting the Russian ambassador, even with the fate of the world on the line. ""You can't fight in here; this is the War Room!"" scolds the president.<br/><br/>Thematically, two things stand out for me. The Kubrick theme of dehumanization is constantly present and Kubrick makes it very clear that humans are the problem. The technology they create does, for the most part, exactly what it is supposed to do, whether this means bombs that were designed to destroy the world doing just that, or Dr. Strangelove's Nazi-made mechanical arm acting like... a Nazi. Kubrick, at least in this film, has no inherent problem with technology, only with the very frail and flawed human beings that control it.<br/><br/>Finally, to put it simply, human motivation in this film can be summed up as follows: it's all about sex. Phallic images are pervasive from start to finish and most characters have sexually suggestive names. The men's faces light up ebulliently when Strangelove suggest that human beings may be able to survive beneath the earth in mine shafts and states that a suitable breeding population should include a female to male ratio of 10:1. I cannot shake the idea that that may have been their plan all along.<br/><br/>Never before or since has such an audacious comedy been made. As far as the current geo-political situations go (Iraq et al), we have only seen a series of somber, often didactic dramas that have received mixed reviews and universally poor box office. Will someone have the courage to make another great intelligent political comedy, for our time? Given the much lower overall threat of total annihilation today, surely we deserve at least as much dark entertainment as audiences in the sixties received."

","I read the novel, ""Red Alert, by Peter George, in the summer of 1963. Themes of nuclear Armageddon were quite popular, at least in my crowd, in those years.<br/><br/>The last thing that I ever expected from the book was a comedy, albeit ""black"", If played straight it would have been another ""Fail-Safe"".<br/><br/>In November of 1963 I was doing some routine comm maintenance at a Titan ll missile site in Kansas. Our comm team was getting ready to take our lunch break when the klaxon in the control center went off. Daily practice alerts were the norm so no one was alarmed until we tried to come up to the control center from the comm center (one floor below). The CO told us to get our asses below and stay out of the way. Thoughts of nuclear war and it's ramifications gripped us all. Our families in Wichita and no communications! About an hour later we were given the all clear. It was not until we got to our cars did we learn what happened that November day.<br/><br/>Sometime later I learned that ""Red Alert"" was to be made into a movie. Since the USAF offered no assistance production went to England. I think there were several re-writes on the screen play before a comedy came to the forefront. I wonder if ""Fail-Safe"", which was released in the same time frame, may have helped determine the direction the movie was to take?<br/><br/>""Alas, Babylon"", a nice little novel about the ""days after"" was a good read and would have made a nice little movie. Little would have been required of special effects since it's impact was more on the order of ""On The Beach""<br/><br/>I realize that this is not a typical review.

Kubrick was an obsessive perfectionist with his films to make them work just right and this film, like many others of his shows that. Clever framing of objects in key scenes, most notably a big banner that reads ""peace is our profession,"" which is in the background of a raging shootout, and the impeccably directed performances of key players in the film -- George C.

So you are left wondering why you just had to sit through 10 minutes of nothing. Then action scenes cannot redeem the movie, because the actors are not believable. Slim Pickens in particular made me roll my eyes in annoyance. Maybe it was supposed to have been funny - The only funny thing is that I couldn't tell. George C.

","The year is 1964. Communists are coming in at all sides, America's biggest fear is to succumb to the nuclear bomb and the Soviet Union. So a movie is made, and Stanley Kubrick is at its helm. The result is Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>A movie about a meglomaniacal general wanting to foster a war, it starts with its dark comedy right off the bat. I found Peter Sellers in all of his various roles in this movie on the top of his game, I was laughing with every line and thinking about every other line. The framing of each scene was also exquisite, I found myself rewatching countless dialog scenes just to take in all the ambiance.<br/><br/>The plot itself was a little tough to follow, with its abstract story structure. That being said, the plot itself I think was taking a backseat to all of the thematic structuring of the United States love affair with the atomic bomb and death and destruction.<br/><br/>A fantastic movie, worth watching for any history major."

","Amidst the flurry of Stanley Kubrick tributes following his death in 1999, there was one dissenting voice - ex-'Private Eye' editor Richard Ingrams. In his 'Observer' column, he called the director 'overrated'. He then admitted to having seen none of his films. <br/><br/>If I had to recommend only one Kubrick picture it would be 1964's 'Dr.Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying & Love The Bomb'. It started life as a straight thriller ( based on Peter George's novel 'Red Alert' ) but over time Kubrick came to view it as what he termed a 'nightmare comedy'. An American General ( Stirling Hayden ) has gone 'a little funny in the head' and ordered planes to attack the U.S.S.R. with nuclear bombs. What caused this upset? Said general is ( it is suggested ) suffering from premature ejaculation, for which he blames the Russians whom he thinks have been putting something in the water along with the fluoride. The general has instructed his men to open fire on anyone attempting to break into Burpleson Air Force Base. This includes the U.S. Army.<br/><br/>While American troops battle one another, in the White House the chiefs of staff work against the clock to find a solution. The President ( Peter Sellers ) even phones the Russian Premier. Another mad General - 'Buck' Turgidson ( George C.Scott ) - suggests the only way forward is to step up the attack, kill the enemy before he can hit back. The President rejects the idea.<br/><br/>Sound like side-splitting fun? That is where the film's genius lies. It takes the most terrifying subject matter imaginable - nuclear war - and makes it into one of the funniest movies of all time. It suggested that World War 3 need not necessarily start because of an act of calculated aggression by either side, but through human error. Peter Sellers is magnificent in three roles - President Merkin Muffley, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, and the Dr.Strangelove of the title, a crippled Teutonic genius whose artificial hand has a life of its own. The actor was allowed to improvise, and came up with wonderful ideas, such as the good doctor's hand trying to do a Nazi salute while he is advising the President.<br/><br/>George could not have been too upset at this bastardisation of his story, he collaborated on the script ( with Kubrick and Terry Southern ) and penned the novelisation. To emphasise the lunacy of the story, the characters have weird names like 'General Jack D.Ripper', 'Major King Kong', and 'Colonel 'Bat' Guano'.<br/><br/>Ken Adam, best noted for his work on the Bond films, designed the stunning War Room ( the story goes that when Ronald Reagan was taken to the Pentagon he asked to see the War Room, not knowing it only existed on film. He had one built ).<br/><br/>Originally the film was to have climaxed with a custard pie fight, but Kubrick deleted it - rightly so. The present ending is much more effective. The same year this opened, another movie with an almost identical plot - Sidney Lumet's 'Fail-Safe' ( starring Henry Fonda ) - appeared. The main difference was that it was not a comedy. Lumet begged Columbia to let his movie come out first, to give it a chance. They ignored his concerns. While 'Strangelove' was a big hit, 'Fail-Safe' flopped.<br/><br/>Many Sellers films are less than interesting, some are plainly mediocre, but a handful bear the imprint of genius. This is one of them. It was nominated for a number of Academy Awards, including Best Actor ( Sellers ) and Best Picture. In the final event, it won nothing. Hollywood, as ever, went for sentimentality over satire and rewarded 'My Fair Lady' ( starring Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn ) instead. There is no doubt in my mind which film deserved to win.<br/><br/>Funniest moment - as a brawl develops Turgidson and the Russian Ambassador ( the wonderful Peter Bull ), the President tries to intervene: ""Gentlemen, you cannot fight in here! This is the War Room!"".<br/><br/>Second funniest moment - Major King Kong ( Slim Pickens ) riding an atomic bomb as though it were a bucking bronco and whooping for joy as it drops on Russia. Like I said, the film made the unthinkable funny."

","""Dr. Strangelove..."" is such a unique movie for the 1960s. First, it was released in January of 1964. Second, the main subject of the movie is how to prevent a possible nuclear attack. Just less than two years prior to the release of this excellent movie, the Cuba missile crisis took place. Russia and the USA almost destroyed the world back then. OK, this was a very serious situation. But Stanley Kubrick did something unusual: he used a possibility of a nuclear attack and build a brilliant, smart, and very funny comedy on top of that. No details will be released in my review, but everybody should watch this movie. Yes, it was shot in 1964. Yes, it is white and black. But once you watch it, you gonna love it. Different critics and famous publications said that it is one of the funniest comedies ever made. I agree with them completely. 10 out 0f 10: excellent."

Maybe if you are into really really dark old comedies you might enjoy it but otherwise stay away! The only funny character is General Buck and he is only mildly amusing. Terrible!

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","7","15","22 February 2008"," ""Peace is Our Profession.""
","Dr. Strangelove is widely considered to be one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, if not THE best, and it's easy to see why. I remember watching it several years ago and not really getting into it, but as I rewatched it a couple nights ago I realized quickly what I had missed back then. It is a remarkably simple film, an actor's film, obviously, but the crackling dialogue and the stunning performances (most notably from Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, of course), are what really make the movie work so well.<br/><br/>That is, of course, a pretty powerful statement, to give so much credit to the actors, since the story itself is a compellingly realistic and plausible what-if tale that was released to the public in an atmosphere of frightening tension between the U.S. and Russia. So realistic, in fact, that they felt it necessary to including a disclaimer at the beginning of the film, in which the Air Force would like to assure the public that it has systems in place which would prevent such a thing from ever happening. <br/><br/>The film begins with something that was news to me, that America kept a given number of B-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in the event that their destructive services might be suddenly needed, which itself is a sign of what the times were like back then. <br/><br/>The story concerns a General who loses his mind and orders all airborne bombers to attack Russia, unprovoked. The men on board the planes are dumbstruck, of course, because they realize the meaning of this order. A brilliant Slim Pickens is in charge on board one of the planes, and there is a rumor that during the performance, he wasn't told that the film was a comedy, which may be one of the reasons his comic performance is so brilliant, because this is exactly the kind of comedy that Kubrick loves and excels with. As Roger Ebert once noted, a man wearing a funny hat is not funny. But a man who doesn't KNOW he's wearing a funny hat...<br/><br/>I have three favorite interactions in the film. The first is the isolated interaction between the crazy general and one of Sellers' performances, Colonel Mandrake, who is stuck with the general and forced to listen with increasing agitation and disbelief to the general's explanations for why it is so imperative to strike the Russians immediately (""A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual!""). This is funny to me because I have a close friend who's wife is absolutely convinced that the American government is doing this to its own citizens right now as I write this, in early 2008. She should watch this film.<br/><br/>The second performance I love is Sellers' portrayal of Dr. Strangelove, although I'll admit that I remain a little confused as to why the film ended with his sudden exclamation that he can walk. I know there is something going on there that I'm missing but I just can't think of it. And last but not least, George C. Scott as the fanatical General Buck Turgidson. Scott's performance is so brilliant and in such deep detail that it's impossible to see it all in one viewing. I rewound all of his scenes two or three times and there is always something new. I think his might be the best performance in the movie. <br/><br/>Watch, of course, for a young James Earl Jones on board the airplane, and of course Pickens' exit from the airplane and the movie, which is one of the most famous moments in film history.<br/><br/>And of course, since in China I especially appreciated this - listen for Mandrake's hilarious comment about his experience being tortured by the Japanese! Only Peter Sellers could make something as real and disturbing as Japanese torture this funny!"
"MaxBorg89","10","7","15","23 July 2007"," Kubrick's ice-cold satire: brilliant, sharp and still relevant
","The best satires are those that, while related to a specific period, may be applied to the modern days as well. One such film is The Great Dictator, which was explicitly aimed at Hitler but also works as a mockery of every kind of dictatorship; another example is Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, a cold-war satire which has lost none of its power considering nuclear weapons still exist and, albeit less than in the past, constitute a threat to the planet's safety.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (one of the longest titles in history, but also one of the most poignant) is set in a dystopic reality where the conflict between USA and Soviet Union has reached disastrous proportions, leading the mad Gen. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) to believe the Russians have poisoned the American soldiers'water supplies, contaminating their ""bodily fluids"" as he puts it, and orders an irrevocable attack on Sovietic soil: a series of nuclear devices will be dropped on the enemy's territory unless someone convinces Ripper of the insanity of his actions. This task is appointed to Capt. Mandrake (Peter Sellers), who desperately tries to reach President Merkin Muffley (Sellers again) while trying to persuade the crazy general to end the nonsense he has started. Muffley, in the meantime, having learned of the situation, attempts to have a peaceful conversation with his Russian counterpart (""Well, Dimitri, one of our base commanders, he had a sort of... well, he went a little funny in the head... you know... just a little... funny"") while his advisers, Gen. Turgidson (George C. Scott) and the titular scientist (still Sellers), think of what to do to keep humanity alive, given the Bomb on hostile soil will trigger a device called the Doomsday Machine (the name says it all).<br/><br/>The genius of Kubrick's masterpiece derives from the exaggeration of typically clichéd elements of other war movies: the officers' incompetence, the paranoid atmosphere, the soldiers' selfless bravery et al. All of these, especially the last one, flawlessly depicted by Texan Maj. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens in what was meant to be Sellers' fourth role), are funny because, although overblown, they look real thanks to each character's seriousness and commitment to the job. All the physical comedy performed by Gen. Turgidson would have looked silly if he were played by the wrong actor, but Scott manages to make even the most ridiculous gesture an organic, necessary part of his role. The same goes for Hayden: what could easily have been a low-quality parody of war-related madness becomes in his hands a realistic depiction of paranoia and (extreme) patriotism.<br/><br/>Neither of them, however, can match the brilliance and versatility of Sellers' triple act: the first (and one of the few) to get an Oscar nomination (Best Actor, more precisely) for playing multiple characters in the same movie, he successfully moves from pure slapstick (Strangelove) to typically British anxiety (Mandrake) and deadpan delivery (Muffley) without breaking a single sweat. Whether he is politely arguing with Hayden, discussing authority with Scott or struggling with his Nazi arm (one of cinema's most iconic images), he understands what will work in the right moment and shamelessly steals the whole picture. Without him, the film would not have been half as good as it is to this day, and that should be enough testament to his status as one of the greatest comedians of the 20th century.<br/><br/>In short, a must-see comedy and essential viewing for fans of either Kubrick or Sellers. Hell, it's so good it even makes the expression ""Mein Fuhrer"" raise laughs rather than cries of disgust."

","This film has always left me cold. Yes I do get it! No, I am no bored teenager with the attention span of a gnat.I am 59 and a lover of movies of all genres. When I first saw it I think I was too young to appreciate it and I have tried several times over the last few decades to see it with new eyes. However it just does not work for me. Peter Sellers is over used in this (and he is a favourite of mine) and it unbalances the whole thing. Slim Pickens and George C. Scott are great but cannot save this. Quite simply it bores me to tears, I find my mind wandering and am unable to enjoy it. I have seen most of Kubricks movies and find them cold and uninvolving with the exceptions of Spartacus(how much was him?) Paths of Glory and The Killing. Overrated is the term I would employ. I do think the cinematography is great and the sentiment of the whole thing is admirable. But as entertainment it falls down badly (and above all movies should be entertaining even when thought-provoking)."

","Strange. Kubrick is my favourite director but when it comes to this film - which is loved by critics and the public alike - I am not that impressed. It's not that I mind its politics; rather, the movie is simply dull. The humour doesn't work. A yokel-pilot riding a nuclear bomb over Russia and shouting ""yeeechawww"" is something that might be funny in a Bugs Bunny cartoon but simply comes off as a cheap sight gag out of ""Police Academy 12"". Kubrick is as ill-suited to do a comedy as Spike Lee is to make a masterpiece (in any genre). ""Lolita"" had humour, and it was good, but the movie was a comedy drama. Here Kubrick tried his hands on an all-out satire and the result is his easily weakest post-Spartacus film. The gags are somehow hollow and too obvious. If I hadn't known it was made by Kubrick I perhaps wouldn't have even guessed it."
"Jacques98","10","8","18","12 December 2008"," Eh, that's pretty cute I guess, but nothing else . . .
","In the sad little world of close-minded people who sip fine wine as they watch ""films"" but never ""movies"", Dr. Strangelove is a timeless classic. To the rest of the world (who actually have friends and watch ""movies""), Dr. Strangelove is nothing more than a somewhat amusing movie, and that's it. I think Kubrick himself never intended it to be anything but the latter.<br/><br/>I don't judge movies on their importance to cinema. If I did, any movie over fifty-years-old would have to earn a perfect score, despite what I actually thought of it. I think that is a cheap, dishonest way of reviewing. With that said, I am a fan of Kubrick, and I still found little in Dr. Strangelove that was worth viewing. The actually humorous moments are few and far between, and are almost always dry jokes that would make your grandfather laugh, but do nothing to the generation desensitized by American Pie and Superbad. Maybe Dr. Strangelove is simply a generational movie, which I could understand. I don't expect the next generation to love the same movies I love now.<br/><br/>So what makes this movie deserve the score I'm giving it? For one, the boring factor. The movie is an hour and a half, but it felt more like five. Scenes drag on to the point of ridiculousness, trying, I assume, to flesh out the paper-thin plot. There is barely enough content here to actually make a short film, much less a full-length movie. The characters all just seem like cartoon gimmicks, only there to drive the plot. The characters aren't like the characters in Pulp Fiction where they're realistically absurd, they're just absurd. And that gets old fast.<br/><br/>Also, there is nothing here that other war parodies haven't done before it and done better. The only difference here is that this one has a big-name director, whereas the others didn't. You've seen most of these jokes before countless times. Even the ones you haven't seen countless times are smile-worthy at most.<br/><br/>The ""genius"" of making a parody where we march happily to our own execution is really nothing special either. What else is there for a war parody to do? It takes little imagination whatsoever, even for 1964. Political cartoons did it years upon years before that date. That's why when I say there is very little, if anything, truly original or creative about Dr. Strangelove, it's overshadowed by the countless parody clichés. Does that mean it's less amusing? Yes. When you hear a joke more than once, it's hard to laugh at it again.<br/><br/>Overall, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is just a Disney cartoon done in like action with a prolific director at the help. Nothing more. Nothing less. The hype is absolutely ridicules, and I don't care how many ""not helpful"" votes I get for this. Someone needs to realize these pretentious ""classics"" aren't classics at all. They're boring, pretentious English essays with little to differentiate them from the countless others just like them.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick did much more important works in his lifetime than this.<br/><br/>3/10"

"freemantle_uk","10","5","10","29 March 2008"," Classic dark comedy
","This movie is one of my favourite films and a perfect example on how to make a dark comedy. The plot of the film was two American generals decide to attack the Soviet Union in a pre-emptive nuclear strike. This attacks start a major crisis in the American and Soviet governments, the U.S. president and most of the join chiefs did not want to start a war and matters take on more urgency when the Soviet ambassador tell the Americans that the Soviets had just made a doomsday device that would destroy the world if the Soviet Union was attacked. The film was originally meant to be a serious movie, but Stanley Kubrick felt with the way the film developed it would work better as dark comedy. The film starts very seriously but the comedy develops throughout the film, using some brilliant lines, good sight gags and great performances and some jokes such as the name Jack D. Ripper. Peter Sellers was great as the American President, Captain Mandrake, an RAF officer who was on loan to the USAF and Dr. Strangelove, a German nuclear scientist who was working for America. He was meant to play the B-52 bomber pilot as well, but he was going through a divorce at the time, so could only do THREE roles. The film has be referred and parodied in many comedy programmes, especially the Simpsons. Some of my person favourite bits in the film are the telephone conversations between the US President and the Soviet Premier, Dr. Strangelove talking the President and the Join Chiefs at the end of the film. This is excellent viewing and really funny. Kubrick was a master of his trade."

","Just watched Strangelove again for the Umpteenth time and still get a kick out of it. The writing is so spot on about the paranoia of the cold war and the arms race. I spent a career in the US Air Force and the depiction of the B-52, the crew, and even BGen Jack D. Ripper are eerily correct. Buck Turgidson's comment on a preemptive strike on the Soviet Union was supposedly the same thing Gen Curtis LeMay said immediately following the Cuban Missile Crisis, ""attack now while their pants are down."" If you've never seen the movie ""Fail Safe"", also released in 1964, you must as a companion piece. Same plot, but serious with Henry Fonda as the President. What makes Strangelove so hilarious are the little bits of ironic truth throughout. A bomber crew survival kit with condoms, fluoridation as a commie plot, an underground survival bunker/mineshaft for the heads of government, the Soviet ambassador complaining about ""the arms race, the space race, and the peace race,"" Turgidson saying ""the big B-52 coming in so low, jet exhaust on the chickens."" If this movie didn't kick start the anti-nuclear movement, it sure gave it a hard push with the clutch in. Young viewers may find the movie boring and miss the subtlety, but do a little research on the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis and watch ""Fail Safe"" and the cartoon ""Duck and Cover"". Then keep in mind there was a time that not too long ago the U.S. kept a dozen or more B-52s in the air at all times and 100 or more on ground alert (airborne in 20 minutes or less) fully loaded with nuclear weapons. For those under 20 who still need a comparison, think President Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfield sitting in the war room and talking about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and why it was so important to go to war. The same pretzel logic used by our current administration is pretty much the same as President Merkin Muffley and his cabinet used in the Cold War 40+ years ago. The quote used at the beginning of the movie ""Crimson Tide"" said ""the three most powerful men in the world are the President of the U.S., the Soviet Premier, and a nuclear submarine captain."" Ya gotta add BGen Jack D. Ripper to the list. Peace on Earth, Purity of Essence."
"Jimmy-63","10","5","10","11 February 1999"," ""Wow,"" is what I said after I watched it. Really.
","In my opinion, Dr. Strangelove is truly one of the best movies ever made.  It is such a great satire about the intrinsic insanity of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.  The genius of the movie is that it is not overtly funny - it conveys the situation in a plausible way in the context of the story, bringing out the lunacy of our doomsday scenarios and MAD policy against the Soviet Union, and theirs against us: the definition of the Cold War.  I also thought that in this movie, and I have seen a lot of movies, I saw the best acting of any movie I have ever seen.  Everyone played their roles perfectly, and I'm not just saying that casually.  I personally think that acting is very easy and nothing to celebrate, but Stanley Kubrick really found the best actors he could for those parts - they really could not have been acted better. Everyone was absolutely great, and I genuinely do feel that it should win the hypothetical best acting category for all-time movies.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove was ingenious and artistic AND very entertaining.  Its cinematic value is immense, and I consider it one of the best movies, if not the best movie, that I have ever seen.  I exemplifies what artistic moviemaking should be."

","Q: How do you know if there's a fighter pilot at a dinner party? A: He'll tell you. <br/><br/>Q: How do you know ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a brilliant work of comedic genius? A: The Makers will tell you.<br/><br/>Good performances by Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens (in the role of a lifetime) highlight this overrated comedy by director Stanley Kubrick. <br/><br/>Set in the left-wing la-la land where America is always the aggressor, amid them bombing of the USSR to forestall the communist plot to fluoridate water by a kooky general (named Jack D. Ripper, with all the smugness this movie thinks is subtle; another man is named ""Bat"" Guano. Ha-ha. That name might have come from the odor wafting over the script).<br/><br/>The script has the condescending superiority of someone who knows they are cleverer than anyone else in the room (whether they are or not).<br/><br/>The real saving grace in this movie is Peter Sellers, who essays three performances (and it would have been four but, depending on whom you believe, he either couldn't get the voice down or he hurt his ankle, poor baby).<br/><br/>Sellers is brilliant as the ineffectual (probably Democrat, since it was made under JFK) US president and as an English officer. His other great character, Mandrake, is really too good for this movie, and proves Sellers could act and was not just a brilliant mimic. On the other side of the scale, Sellers shamelessly hams it up as the bizarre former Nazi Doctor Strangelove, who only comes in at the end of the film. In the overacting category he is neck and neck with George C. Scott, who is probably terrified of being upstaged. But while Scott was a good actor when he had good material, nobody can overact with Sellers' aplomb.<br/><br/>The movie's glorious black and white gives it a documentary feel that is effective in getting across what little comedy actually works. For instance, the line (SPOILER): ""(I)f you don't get the President of the United States on that phone, you know what's gonna happen to you? . . . You're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola company.""<br/><br/>It's too bad the movie isn't just Sellers and Wynn exchanging side-splitting barbs. The viewer also gets to see people getting squirted in the face with soft drink and generals flopping around a ""war room"" in ways that would have suited the dumber movies of Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Word has it Kubrik either filmed, or wanted to film, a gargantuan pie-fight at the end. Cutting it out was at least one good decision he made, besides the b-&-w, though you get a glimpse of pastry early on and it sends chills down your spine.<br/><br/>I believe nothing is above being made fun of. I especially love ""black"" comedy like ""The Wrong Box"" and ""The Assassination Bureau"" where death is treated cavalierly. And the sad thing is, this overrated piece is probably the best thing Kubrik ever shot."

He says the meaning is ""water,"" but the low angle shots, almost as if the camera is in Hayden's lap, of Ripper sucking on a large cigar only scream of something more than just bodily water. I don't know what to make of that. As Turgidson debriefs the President, some of the best scenes of the film are shot in this one room- the War Room and let's be perfectly clear, there's no fighting in the war room. Turgidson informs the President that Gen. Jack Ripper has complete control and has shut off all communications to the base and the secret code, that only he knows, that can get in contact with the planes pilots have no contact with anyone. So, the President has no way of stopping the planes from dropping the bomb because Ripper has shut off all communications- sounds like some of the stories you hear from the 60s. This leads to a great, one-sided, phone call to the head of Soviet Premier, Dmitri, that might leave younger audiences thinking this is some kind of impersonation of President George Bush, but it's not. Peter Sellers best performance of the three roles comes as the President. The scenes between Scott and Sellers are both electric and very funny that hit on all six cylinders. President Muffley informs Dmitri that he's very sorry that 34 planes are on their way to drop a bomb that will ruin the entire civilization in the USSR, so he orders his own plans to be shot down and assists in the attack giving it the okay. Turgidson disagrees with the idea and would love to wipe out the entire Communist regime, but US policy is not to Nuke first. We Nuke second. It's only proper. ""I'm sorry, too, Dmitri... I'm very sorry... *All right*, you're sorrier than I am, but I am as sorry as well... I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri! Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are... So we're both sorry, all right?... All right."" President Muffley sounds very sorry. Quite panicked as well (Not really, which makes it all the more funnier).<br/><br/>I thought Sellers gave the best performances as the incredibly off-the-wall, enthusiastic General with more plans on his mind than destroying millions of people- like getting back to Miss Scott, who's in his bedroom on a countdown. Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove is exactly how you think he would look and act. Is it over the top? Yeah, very much so, but his ridiculous quirks and possessed right arm that seems to have a mind of it's own is very funny, especially when you couple that with his survival plan for when the ""Dooms Day Machine"" goes off. That's the really big nuke that will kill everybody on the entire planet if the USA pilots reach their targets and in order to save the human race, Dr. Strangelove says all the top generals and leaders of the world will have to live in a coalmine for about 100 years with a 10:1 ratio of women to men. This perks up the attention of General Turgidson and puts a smile on the face of Dr. Strangelove, even though he has a permanent smile on his face. The best scene in the film may come when the pilot of one of the planes is riding the bomb on it's way down to earth as if he's at a rodeo just living it up. That wonderful bomb has so many great advantages when you really think about it: A lot of sex with a lot of different women, you can ride on them like a cowboy, you can eliminate millions of commies there's just much good that can come of a bomb such as this. The fact that this was made right in the middle of the whole fire storm makes this film even more appreciable, now, more than ever. There are some great performances, good laughs, and a very engrossing look on annihilation and mass destruction as numbers are thrown around like numbers instead of human casualties. Other than the look of the airplanes resembling more paper planes on strings than actual airplanes, there's really not much to dislike. Very rarely do you see a refreshing comedy that was made over 40 years ago, but I've seen just that as ""Dr. Strangelove"" has some serious staying power. It's a near-masterpiece. This should be Kubrick's best film, but I certainly see why ""2001"" may be regarded higher."

","Unique as unique can be. This is probably one of the funniest movies with tons of thought provoking luggage. As I begin, one phrase comes to mind – they just don't make movies like they used to. For one thing, the cost of entertainment hubris is astronomical these days, and there is no way you could see this much star-power in one flick. This astounding cast is spearheaded by the sheer brilliance of Peter Sellers playing three key roles (including the 'evil' Dr. Strangelove); we also have; George C. Scott, playing the unstable General Turgidson; Sterling Hayden steps in as the nutty Jack D. Ripper, and Keenan Wynn as the frightening and somewhat dense Col. Bat Guano. All of these characters are playing a dangerous ping- pong game trying to control the flight-path of Col. Slim Pickens' fully armed B 52. End-result of all these shenanigans is either a safe and quiet earth....or poof. This movie pays real homage to Kubrick's brilliance – ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a concoction of sidesplitting humor, white-knuckled fear, and the very believable stupidity of the government - all this delivered on a platter of excellent acting and outstanding direction. The story's concept is pure genius. This fable should is amazingly funny, but at the same time it more than hints at a much scarier truth. The story centers around a cat-and-mouse game between powerful entities controlling the destiny of American Bombers. One minute they are sent to attack the U.S.S.R.; the next they are recalled and the next they sent back out. Eventually all strings are pulled beyond the breaking point and momentum takes over. Saddest and scariest of all - are that all the evil doers identified in the movie, the worst-of-the-worst is the government's love of red-tape. Who knows? I would think more so now than ever. I really enjoyed this old movie, and highly recommend it to everyoneespecially toe-scuffing politicians."

","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, more commonly known as Dr. Strangelove, is a 1964 political satire black comedy film that satirizes the Cold War fears of a nuclear conflict between the USSR and the USA. The film was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, stars Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, and features Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, and Slim Pickens. Production took place in the United Kingdom. The film is loosely based on Peter George's thriller novel Red Alert.<br/><br/>The story concerns an unhinged United States Air Force general who orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. It follows the President of the United States, his advisers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. It separately follows the crew of one B-52 bomber as they try to deliver their payload."

The tiny Minny details that is explained about the altitude the plane fly and how the bombing is going to take place,and after it got hit the way the pilot and soldier respond to it, made me think how the director is seeing this movie. He makes us see the movie in the exact way the movie was made for. Something worth to learn for other directors out there.More than Peter Sellers it was George C.

","""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.""<br/><br/>This is only my third Stanley Kubrick film, but so far it's my favorite. I can't imagine how funny this film must have been when it came out in the mid 60's during the height of the Cold War, because more than 50 years later this black and white comedy continues to resonate in today's modern political world. It's sharp, it's smart, it's dark, but above all it's funny. It seems after so many decades that we haven't learned a thing about the sharp ironies presented here through each character and situation because the story continues to be relatable. The script is hilarious and the delivery from each actor is perfect, with several characters standing out. Peter Sellers does an amazing job playing three very different characters, but I was especially a fan of George C. Scott's portrayal of Gen. Buck. The scenes in the War Room were by far my favorite in the movie, but almost everything worked to perfection in this sharp and tightly written satire. The effects are a bit over the top but I think it simply adds to the overall craziness of the movie. I know I still have a lot of catching up with Kubrick films, but I don't see how his other films will top this one, at least entertaining wise. Satires can become a bit heavy handed after its initial first half, but this film maintains the laughs throughout its entire runtime. I'm surprised that I found this political comedy hilarious considering I'm not into politics at all, but I found it impossible not to watch it with a smile on my face. Is there a better political satire than Dr. Strangelove? I doubt it or at least I haven't come across one yet. What makes this film so relevant is that we are laughing at a nuclear threat in a time when the fear was very eminent. <br/><br/>In the opening scenes we are introduced to General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who is giving his pilots secret orders to bomb the Soviet Union. Jack has gone mad and is overstepping his authority after discovering a loophole which allows him to order the attack without having to ask for permission from the US government. He has cut off all communication with the pilots so no one can stop his insane plan. Jack is convinced the communists are poisoning the world and he must stop them. When the President, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is informed of the General's plan he immediately calls his advisers to the War Room in order to try to put an end to Jack's madness. His adviser, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), informs the President how Jack was able to overstep his authority and in a hilarious scene through the big board shows the location of every plane as they are approaching the Soviet Union. Against Buck's advice, the President decides to invite Russian Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) to the War Room in order to discuss what is happening and to prove he isn't responsible for the attacks. Among the men in the room there is also Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), a former Nazi scientist who is a specialist when it comes to nuclear weapons. The interactions between these characters and their efforts to stop Jack's plan in order to avoid the world's annihilation becomes the focal point of the film. <br/><br/>Peter Sellers delivers outstanding work here playing the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Lionel Mandrake, who is Jack's right hand man and the only one who thinks he can stop him from executing his plan. He delivers three very distinctive characters and I honestly didn't recognize it was the same actor. George C. Scott is the standout however in his overly dramatic and serious delivery. His character was the one I laughed the most at. The things he says in such a serious tone are absolutely hilarious. I don't know how much of the lines were improvised or how much of it was actually scripted from Peter George's book, Red Alert, but all I can say is that every line was executed perfectly by these actors. This is one of those films that has transcended its time and continues to make audiences laugh around the globe. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I tend to avoid giving movies a ten, and while I gave this one a solid nine out of ten, I do wish I could give it a 9 and a half. Kubrick is without a doubt one of history's greatest directors and screenwriters, and until I saw Dr. Strangelove, I figured I knew the themes of any given Kubrick movie. This movie was no ordinary Kubrick film.<br/><br/>The film, based off a more stoic novel, was gut wrenchingly funny. The humor was unbelievably deadpan and dry, but that's intelligent, smart humor I thoroughly enjoy. However, if you scratch beneath the surface, you can see the multiple layers of the film. Dr. Strangelove is one giant critique of Cold War politics, American jingoism, and wartime political scenarios. Any movie that makes you laugh when the plot is about the end of the world is a truly amazing comedy."
"talexander12599","9","3","5","4 September 2015"," Comedy Masterpiece by Master Kubrick
","Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (I'll refer to it as Dr. Strangelove after this) is a political dark comedy directed by Stanley Kubrick (Clockwork Orange, The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey) and was written by he and Terry Southern (Easy Rider, Barbarella, The Cincinnati Kid) and Peter George (Fail Safe) from 1964. It stars Peter Sellers (Being There, The Pink Pather, The Pink Panther Strikes Again), George C. Scott (Patton, The Hustler, The Changeling) and Sterling Haden (The Godfather, The Killing, Asphalt Jungle)<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is about a mad general (Sterling Haden) who begins the start of a nuclear war against Russia and the president of the United States (Peter Sellers) and his right-hand man (George C. Scott) and a lot of other politicians, including Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), who try to stop it.<br/><br/>There are so many aspects of this movie that are great including the acting and writing, but I will talk about a man who does not receive enough recognition for his incredible work despite his two Oscars, this man is Ken Adam (Barry Lyndon, Goldfinger, Dr. No). Ken Adam did production design for Dr. Strangelove and he creates one of the best sets of all time in this film, and that is the war room. This set is enormous yet it is barely filled. It creates a powerful feel while being so simple. This set is so real that people thought it was an actual location and Ronald Reagen even thought it was real! When you watch this film you are in awe when you see the places they shoot. It is simply magical. <br/><br/>How can you watch a Kubrick film without admiring the directing? Kubrick takes a quite serious novel and subject and successfully makes it a comedy. Who would have thought in 1964 you could've made a comedy about the end of the world through nuclear holocaust? Kubrick saw this risk and took it. He does some interesting camera work that looks like it inspired Spielberg while making Saving Private Ryan. Anyway, he does a great job directing his actors especially Scott and will be looked at as one of his best films.<br/><br/>There is not much I can see wrong with this movie. It is hilarious yet portrays a serious lesson. This is probably one of the greatest dark comedies and comedies in general ever created."

","A movie that can make fun of nuclear warfare during the height of nuclear paranoia while being deliciously amusing certainly fills out the checklist of being a black comedy. Stanley Kubrick has not only made a movie that was great for its time but also is still funny, smart and memorable by today's standards. Still it remains one of, if not the bravest film productions to come out of cinema. The classic scenes, one-liners and performances from both Peter Sellers and George C.

Repeatedly I have came back to 'the hot line suspense comedy' and it only gets better."
"His_Dudeness74","9","3","5","2 February 2006"," I'm just as sorry as you are Dmitri ...
","After having the pleasure of viewing Dr.Strangelove for the first time, I felt compelled to comment on the sheer cleverness of it ...<br/><br/>I knew going in that I was in for a cold war satire, but little else - <br/><br/>The contrast between the serious, documentary-style direction with the at times over-the-top characters and dialogue works brilliantly to keep the movie in motion, and the sense of impending disaster is palpable, whilst still allowing the mostly subtle humour to play out. <br/><br/>Fairly early in the film, we're given a close up shot of General Ripper's brooding face from an unusual angle, the camera looking up at his visage as if his face were a huge, insurmountable rock - as soon as this superb shot revealed itself I had the uneasy feeling that Ripper might be a bit 'funny in the head' as President Muffley later explains.<br/><br/>In his apparent insanity, army base commander Ripper concocts a 'plan' to wipe out the threat of Communist invasion once and for all; unfortunately it involves nothing cleverer than tricking his men into nuking the unsuspecting Ruskies ...<br/><br/>The only person in a position to get through to Ripper through his apparent madness is Captain Mandrake (an English officer stationed via the 'officer exchange program'), one of the three characters to appear in the film to be portrayed by Peter Sellers. At one stage Ripper confides in Mandrake as to the extent of the conspiracy theory that led him to his drastic course of action : the Commies are contaminating our 'precious body fluids', most likely through fluoridation of the water supply. How had he come by this umm, interesting theory, Mandrake quite reasonably asks at one point ? - Here, I believe, one of the films key themes and elements are revealed - Ripper tells Mandrake that he first became aware of the Communist 'conspiricy' ""during the physical act of love"" - Ripper goes on to explain (in rather cryptic terms) that after failing to become aroused, or perhaps losing his erection, he came to 'realise' that his bodily fluids were being taken or contaminated. He then goes to some pains to make it clear that the problem had *not* happened again, and that women still found him 'powerful'.<br/><br/>In essence, Ripper's failure to cope with his own compromised masculinity led to his insanity and subsequent order to attack the dreaded Ruskies !! <br/><br/>So a madman has potentially started world war 3. No real surprise there, as the focus turns to larger-than-life character General Buck Turgidson - the General is at first unconcerned over a phone call from a base commander, accepted by his bathing-beauty 'secretary', and continues his business in the 'powder room' for a painfully long time before finally deigning to speak to the worried base commander himself.<br/><br/>Turgidson decides the situation is serious enough to warrant leaving his young, barely-clad lady friend in their hotel room whilst he puts in a little overtime in the War Room. In a later scene, Ms. Scott, his secretary, thoughtlessly rings Turgidson in the War Room - before hanging-up, Turgidson ever-so-briefly reflects upon the precarious situation at hand and thoughtfully advises Ms. Scott not to forget to 'say her prayers' ...<br/><br/>Hilarity and double-speak ensues throughout the entire first War Room scene, Turgidson's zealousness to turn the accidental encroachment on soviet airspace into a full scale strike is demented logic at its finest. Somewhat fortunately, the President, once again played by Peter Sellers, is less of a war-monger than the General, and he enlists the aid of the reluctant and shifty Russian ambassador to contact the Russian Premier, the apparently drunk Dimitri Kissoff. Sellers one-sided conversation with Kissoff is a side-splitter, desperate not to offend the Premier whilst still trying to gently break the news of the impending air strikes. The Russians go one-up on the Yanks though, when it comes to light that they have constructed a 'Doomsday device', which is deadly enough to pretty much f*ck up the world - if the rogue B-52's commissioned by Ripper accomplish their illicit mission, they will unwittingly be activating the Doomsday device ! This is when Sellers' third, and most bizarre, character is introduced, the titular Dr. Strangelove. As he 'helpfully' points out, a Doomsday device is an excellent deterrent for Nuclear War - er, provided the rest of the World is aware of the *threat* first ! However, as the Russian Ambassador points out, the existence of the Doomsday device hadn't been announced to the world at that stage as the Premier had planned to announce it at an upcoming conference, due to his love of 'suprises' hehehe. And so it's all set-up for a tense finale, as Mandrake tries to obtain vital codes from General Ripper to recall the B-52's, President Muffley and his cohorts try to work with the Russian government to blow their own men out of the sky to avoid mass destruction, and a B-52 flown by Major 'King' Kong attempts to deliver it's mother lode upon it's intended target before they're shot out of the sky.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this film, it's sharp humour, it's psychological profiles of the egomaniacs that would end the world, their sexual insecurity, the petty bickering over relatively insignificant matters while the fate of the world is being decided - but I'll wind it up here and just urge anyone who enjoys movies that encourage you to think to seek out Dr Strangelove : or How I learned to stop worrying and love the Bomb."

","When you look at the films of Stanley Kubrick, comedy never seems to make a appearance. The bulk of Stanley's films contain very serious and dark matter; a lot being very de-humanizing and so detached from being connected to actual reality. You can look at a Clockwork Orange and you call that a very black comedy, where the comedy walks in hand with perverse sexual behaviour. But Kubrick only has one comedy in his line of films, and its the greatest war parody to be ever made, and has no real equal.<br/><br/>A general sets out orders for his troops to make a nuclear air assault on the USSR, he believes that they are trying to hurt out 'prescious bodily fluids'; hence the theory why the Russians only drink vodka. His aide Mandrake trying to stop this assault tries to reason with Gen. Ripper, trying to get the recall code, but becomes painfully hard after the generals suicide. Meanwhile the president is on the hot line, telling a drunken Soviet Premier of the USSR that there has been a silly mistake and are about to be bombed; but so called friendship problem halt this. You never call to say hello the Premier drunkenly says to the President. The president's adviser, a crazed ex-Nazi, Dr. Stranglove brings forth bad news. He reveals that the USSR has a doomsday machines; capable of wiping out the inter human race; for good.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove, or how i learn't to stop worrying and love the bomb is a comedy classic. With subject matter that deals with nuclear Holocaust and doomsday, you wonder how this can be a comedy. The satire runs so thick though. Any movie that can say, ' you can't fight in here, this is the war room' shows this is a very forked tongue satire. The bases of the script was upon the book by Peter George, which was actually a serious look at war. Somehow when Stanley was writing the script, he turned a dramatic book into a full blown comedy. This does have some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history; the riding of the H bomb by Slim Pickens has been homaged so many times. Army men shooting out in front of a sign say Peace is our Profession. The compromise of intelligence if the Russian Ambassador sees the 'big board'.<br/><br/>The standout feature of Dr. Strangelove though is the acting. Peter Sellers is brilliant as all the characters he plays. Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and of course Dr. Strangelove, the standout is Strangelove. In the end where Strangelove rises from his chair in shock, you can see Peter Bull - the Russian ambassador laughing; they could not get a shot without him laughing.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, your missing out on Kubricks one and only classic comedy."

","Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick's masterful study of the foolishness of war and the incompetence of the men who start them, is blacker than pitch and funny in ways that most films can't dream of approaching.  Faultless direction, writing, and performing cemented the picture as a modern classic, making it hard to believe today that it was something of a wild card in its initial release during the chilliest days of the Cold War.  The incomparable Peter Sellers devours three roles, and is equalled by the sublime turns of Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott, never more brilliant or funnier than they are here (playing gum-smacking, belly-slapping, gung-ho dim bulb Buck Turgidson and paranoid, crazy as a woodpecker, ""precious bodily fluids"" loose cannon Jack D.

Fair warning?<br/><br/>Well, it may have intended to be a dark comedy, but it had few laughs and the storyline wasn't very convincing. Why wouldn't anybody at the base have long since determined that General Ripper was crazy? And the British officer with him, unless he were utterly blind, should have been easily able to see through and overpower him. And it was very hard to believe that a nuclear bomber plane could be located, shot at, and damaged, but still be able to fly all the way to its target without further interference. (When Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane was detected by the Soviet air defense force in May 1960, they threw everything they had available at it until it was brought down.)<br/><br/>A few laughs-""Don't fight, this is the War Room!"" and such, but overall hardly a good movie."

","Regardless of the horrendous movies that Stanley Kubrick has made during his disappointing career, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"", I still gave ""Dr. Strangelove"" an honest chance. And unfortunately, Kubrick failed to deliver once again. <br/><br/>My main problem with the film was that it's far too monotonous to be truly funny. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: every single attempt at humor in this movie fails. Every single one. Most of the blame goes to the poor script, and some of it falls on the actors on portrayal here. Peter Sellers fails to deliver his lines with wit or charisma, and it doesn't help that he plays three characters. It's bad enough he does poorly in one of the roles, but all three? Truly disastrous work. How he was offered roles following this movie is truly a wonder. <br/><br/>Moving on, I feel that the visual effects in this movie are a bit dated. Some of the sequences seemed totally unrealistic, and drew me out of the scene. If they had spent a little more time on the visual effects, and added some wit and humor to the script, they might have had something to work with. But there's truly nothing going on here. The narrative is a mess, and there's no sense of coherency or reason behind any of the choices that the characters make. <br/><br/>There's no reason to see this movie, and it's painfully sad to see a movie that could have potentially succeeded in the ways that ""All About Steve"" did, but unfortunately I don't think we can expect anything better than this at the hands of Kubrick."

","Goodness knows how the voters here can give this movie such a high mark. It is totally dated, unfunny, with Peter Sellers giving a slapstick performance as different characters which is so poor and ham-ish it would make participants in a school play blush.<br/><br/>The story is about a mad USA military commander who gives an order for fighter planes to bomb Russian, and the question is: can that order be countermanded or will their be a nuclear attack by mistake?<br/><br/>The only reason I give this picture 2/10 as there is perhaps maybe a couple of scenes mildly amusing like when a cola machine is smashed and someone gets coke in his face. But any humor is barely present as the film is really a vehicle to show how stupid and over rated that goon Sellers is, and much of the play seems to be ad libbed and made up as it goes along.<br/><br/>What a waste of time!"
"jimbo-53-186511","5","4","8","8 May 2015"," Very funny in parts, but sadly not all of this worked for me
","Dr Strangelove is a film that is sitting high up in the IMDb Top 250 films (it's currently sitting at number 49 on the list) and therefore it's clearly a film that is generally loved by the public - the critics also have a strong liking for this film. I personally found this film a little uneven if I'm honest....<br/><br/>I think where this film is at its strongest is once we get to The War Room; the scenes within the War Room are easily the funniest and best examples of satire. The phone calls between the US President and the Russian President did have me really laughing and I also liked the interplay between President Muffley and the militant Buck Turgidson and thought their various exchanges were absolute gold. Peter Sellers was fantastic in his three different roles although I must admit he was definitely at his best as the German Weapons Researcher. Sellers clearly had a lot of fun here and his performance(s) in this film do almost make up for some of the more tedious aspects. Likewise, Scott was great in his respective role and Hayden was good as the insane general and gave a real scenery chewing performance - did that cigar ever leave his mouth? I think the funniest part of the film was the scene where Mandrake is trying to get through to the President, but runs out of money and asks a soldier to shoot the Coca Cola machine so that he can get some more money in order to get through to the President. The soldier then utters the line ""If you don't get through to the President, you'll end up in trouble with Coca-Cola"". A very funny exchange and quite unexpected if I'm honest.<br/><br/>Where the film falters slightly is in most of the scenes outside the War Room. There were far too many scenes from within the war planes that were quite dull if I'm honest. I can understand the opening plane scene and the closing plane scenes, but the constant cuts from the War Room to the planes just seemed pointless. If there was any humour to be found in the 'plane' scenes then it was clearly lost on me. Unfortunately these dull scenes did drag the film down slightly for me despite the fact that the majority of The War Room scenes were very funny.<br/><br/>Dr Strangelove isn't a bad film, but it's a very uneven film that was both very funny and very tedious. Unfortunately the good and the bad pretty much cancel each other out hence the score of 5 out of 10."
"tomrito","10","4","8","21 August 2008"," One of the best movies ever made
","This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. Stanley Kubrick has an insight into human behavior that no other person can match. Peter Sellers is beyond genius and George C. Scott and Slim Pickens fit right in with the rest of the cast to help produce the greatest satire ever made. This is the key to the greatness of the movie, it is not a just a comedy, it is a SATIRE, that is also very funny. If you understand the use of symbolism, irony, and ridicule to expose the folly of human behavior, you will get how wonderful and smart a film Mr. Kubrick has given us to enjoy. <br/><br/>Anyway, I saw it again today and I have to say it is still one of my favorite movies and just great fun to watch. However, I do feel sorry for some of the people who are posting here that do not like the film. One person wrote; ""What the hell is this? Is it a comedy? It's not funny (at all). I did not even smile once, was I supposed to?"" Another wrote; ""real comedy to me is White Chicks and Nutty Professor."" <br/><br/>I can only say that the movie is not intended to be a true comedy, it is a satire, in which human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, irony, or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be funny, the purpose of satire is not primarily humor in itself so much as an attack on something of which the author strongly disapproves, using the weapon of wit. Maybe, before you see this movie you should read something about the time it was made, about the cold war and the real fear people had about nuclear destruction. Or you can read the review posted here by tieman64 from United Kingdom"" called ""Ethnic cleansing, 26 July 2008"". It is a brilliant insight into what Mr. Kubrick was trying to achieve."

","As a film Dr. Strangelove was so well received that a more serious film on the same topic, Failsafe, failed to find an audience. Yet Strangelove made you think as well as entertain which is the ultimate object of any great work of cinema.<br/><br/>General Jack D. Ripper has sent out the Strategic Air Command bombers and locked down Burpelson Air Force Base so that higher ups can't interfere. He's struck back at the dirty Communists for pushing fluoridation of the water supply which he feels has interfered with his bodily functions.<br/><br/>Ripper might want to have checked with the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Buck Turgidson who when we meet him seems to have all his bodily functions working just fine. A second opinion on Ripper's lack of bodily functions might have revised his reason on why his particular functions weren't doing well.<br/><br/>Of course his actions have created a crisis and President Muffley of the United States is busy trying to talk to Premier Kissoff of the USSR to prevent a nuclear war. That is in case those SAC bombers can't be recalled. One of the bombers commanded by Major Kong is anxious to do battle with the 'Rooskies'.<br/><br/>Director Stanley Kubrick went poaching on the black comedy normally that would be the province of Billy Wilder. But even Wilder in his wildest dreams never used those wonderful Dickensian names for his characters that Kubrick is so delighting in. My favorite however is the part played by Keenan Wynn as the army colonel commanding the tactical force that liberates Burpelson, Colonel Bat Guano.<br/><br/>Jack D. Ripper is played by Sterling Hayden a man consumed by his lack of bodily functions. This is a takeoff on Army General Edwin Walker who commanded US troops in Germany and was relieved when it was discovered he was indoctrinating his troops with John Birch Society propaganda which included their fears about fluoridation of water. Curiously enough that cause was actually taken up by other than fanatic right-wingers, people like Ralph Nader. Could Ripper have been right after all?<br/><br/>George C. Scott is cigar chomping, bodily functioning spoof of legendary SAC commander Curtis LeMay. He's having quite the difficult time in deciding just who to root for in this crisis.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers got an Oscar nomination for playing three different characters in Dr. Strangelove. Sellers is President Muttley, Colonel Mandrake of the RAF an exchange officer serving under Sterling Hayden and the crazed former Nazi nuclear scientist Dr. Strangelove. Watching the film, it's almost hard to believe this is the same man using three different voices and appearances that makeup alone could not explain. Sellers lost to his fellow British player Rex Harrison for My Fair Lady.<br/><br/>In fact Dr. Strangelove also lost as Best Picture to My Fair Lady. Of course George Bernard Shaw never put his legendary wit to the issue of mutual nuclear annihilation. Neither did Billy Wilder, but I have a feeling those two talents together couldn't have done any better than Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>The image that stays in your mind from the film I guarantee will be Slim Pickens as Major Kong riding that hydrogen bomb down to its 'Rooskie' target like a bucking bronco.<br/><br/>Hopefully we won't meet Major Kong again, who knows where and who knows when."
"drogers-18","10","4","8","17 June 2006"," satire as a success story
","Dr. Strangelove is a classic example of satire as an educational tool. When this film first came out, my gut reaction was that it was anti-American, disrespectful and a plaything of an elite, liberal movie maker. But, I was young, an Air Force veteran, and full of the conservative claptrap. Having the many decades of time between then and now, I view the film as remarkable in its structure, forceful in its message and memorable in the performances. As the B-52 is on its way to the target, for example, the litany of the crew as they prepare for the strike left goosebumps as my earlier experience in military aircraft of the time was nearly identicle is substance and complexity. We were then living on the edge of nuclear annilhilation and viewing this film, even as a satire, shows that the supposed ""Balance of Power"" concept of the time was in fact a ""Balance of Terror"". If Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" was satire that energized the Irish to their plight, Dr. Stranglove was our energizing message. Surely, this is one of the best films of all time."
"Elcasten","10","4","8","9 January 2006"," Best comedy about nuclear annihilation ever made
","One of my favorite films. I never tire of it. The dark humor and the zealous insanity of the protagonists to avoid the ""doomsday gap"" never cease to elicit an uncomfortable chuckle from me. It is also worth noting that it does not seem much of a stretch to imagine our current world leaders playing their equivalent roles in the film. All of Stanley Kubrick's work is brilliant in one way or another, but this is my favorite of all his films, due to its satiric wit and edgy humor. I personally believe that this film should be required viewing, just to hopefully avoid a real-life situation that would parallel the one in the picture."

","From the opening credits, I could tell that this movie was going to be a low budget piece of crap. It's so bad, they have to use the same, robotic actor for three uninventive, one-dimensional characters. Had he focused his efforts into one role, albeit one that this no-talent hack could handle, he might have been able to stumble through the film without drawing too much attention to his ineptitude. However, because he is forced into three roles, his completely uninspired 'acting' takes this movie down a notch from 'utter trash' to the realm of 'camp'. The completely unfunny dialogue gives a whole new meaning to the word 'boring'. The rest of the actors are just as bad as that three-role guy. Thank goodness they aren't tripling up on their duties as well. If, by chance, you can actually pull off sitting through this tripe, you'll wonder where the last couple of hours of your life went, and you'll wish you had done something more productive, like monitoring the growth rate of your lawn. The only funny moment comes in an ironic twist, when the man rides the bomb. It would seem that the entire crew of this film was riding a bomb the whole time. Don't let over-zealous pretentious wannabe eggheads and intellectuals convince you that this film is at all worthwhile. These people are intellectual midgets who think they can come off as intelligent by praising a film that in all respects should be disregarded. In all my years of watching and appreciating films, I have never come across such a worthless, putrid, vile, unintelligent, unfunny waste of celluloid as this. There are no redeeming values whatsoever. The only smile that will cross your lips is the one that comes when you can finally breathe a sigh of relief as the end credits role. I leave this film behind as one would leave behind excreta. What in God's name were they thinking when they made this film? That is a question that we should all ponder until the end of existence."

The room was constructed through several steps, built out of basic shapes like square, triangle and circle, that Kubrik had change him up several times... and the actors said it CHANGED them when they stepped into it. The whole matter of the story, of mankind and madness and arbitrariness condensed into a ROOM - that is genius. The oversized, tilted worldmaps, the iconic round lamp, the poker game table, the hollow-darkness of it (or the manmade madness? the human mind?)... it is strong.
The whole look / visionary style of it is.<br/><br/>Seller, Kubrik, Adams,... what an amazing combination. I loved the pace, the absurdity, the well-researched set- and print design... everything looked SO GOD DAMN REAL. And that is the essence of it: it is absurd and it is so 'REAL' we can't escape it's impact. That takes true skill to accomplish.
It says so much about American history, about the worlds view onto war, about the fear of men's madness and arbitrariness to start a war at any time... relevant as always, with Trump dangling above our heads.<br/><br/>If you watched it, you have a NAME and IMAGES for the madness and absurdity of mankind.

","""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the war room!"" One of the most quotable lines in movie history and also an encapsulation of ""Dr. Strangelove"" as a Cold War satire: abject buffoonery played with a straight face. This movie's a classic for great reason; the situations are absurd (and you know it's funny when the film's prefaced by an Air Force reassurance that it's all make-believe) and the best lines work so well because of the performances.<br/><br/>In that respect, it's fair to say this rests on the capable shoulders of Peter Sellers and George C. Scott. And here's the thing: Sellers deserves every bit of praise for his three different roles, allowing him to fully stretch his comedic wings. Mandrake and Muffley are amusing because of their restraint. That said, Scott's Buck Turgidson (man, what a name) has always been my favorite. If Scott comes off like a boob, it's because he's a true-believer to the point of oblivion.

Watching this on the Criterion blu-ray I was able to appreciate those wonderful Ken Adam sets but it is still the amazing performance of Peter Sellers, in all his roles, that marks this out as something exceptional. I know that Kubrick's original instinct was to play this straight but with Sellers on board and reputedly improvising much of his dialogue, this was only going one way and he had the sense to bring in Terry Southern and go with the black comedy. And it is funny to this day. The fact that all the B52 crew play this straight ensures that whilst there may be laughs in the airbase and the war room, there is nothing funny about this mission."
"joao_luis_921","10","2","3","18 January 2017"," Kubrick's cold war political satire is a masterpiece
","Although I haven't seen all Kubrick's movies, I dare to say that this is his magnum opus and probably one of the most brilliant anti- war manifest that art gave us. I feel that there's a lot to praise on this movie as a political satire: game theory reasoning of mutual assured destruction collapses due to a single insane individual whose power to destruct comes from a bureaucrat military protocol, that was supposed to insure the nation in case of a cataclysm; blinded military diligence leads to kamikaze and mass destruction; institutionalized hatred of the communists is exposed to absurd; the cold war leads to hysteria and self destructive behavior. The best thing is that such achievements are conjugated with an incisive literary content. Humor moments are abundant and each character seems to exactly fit its purpose. The story fails on cold war leading to nuclear holocaust but it is surely successful on capturing its dangers, its hysterical, tense and prejudiced environment and the disruptive political and military behavior associated with it. Since the early 1960's a lot of more visually and sonorously appealing movies were made, even by Kubrick himself, and cinema has assuredly evolved a lot since then but unfortunately, not many examples of such a brilliant combination of storytelling, artistic expression and art as a mean of intervention appeared since Strangelove."

"Ricc0","10","2","3","10 December 2016"," ""Mein Fuhrer! I can walk""!
","Considered to be one of the best dark comedies and political satires ever, Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is one of the most amusing and brilliant films I have ever seen. The plot is rather simple.. an ill-minded and psychotic United States Air Force general launches a first strike ""preemptive"" nuclear attack against the Soviet Union exceeding his authority. The United States president then tries to stop the attack from the war room, communicating with the Soviets and their president to try everything possible to prevent a nuclear war that would destroy the world.<br/><br/>One could say a lot about what makes this cold war classic among the best. The directing was ingenious with its various camera styles (Documentary, close ups, long shots - different styles for different locations)... cutting back and forth and keeping it consistent with the story... the varying pace (going faster and faster as the film gets nearer to its crazy, hilarious, and symbolic ending).<br/><br/>The screenplay clever, innovative, and witty.. The acting superb.. Sellers, Scott, and Hayden had remarkable performances (especially for Sellers with his three distinct roles).. memorable phrases and jokes: ""Gentlemen you can't fight in here! This is the war room"". The score lovely and fit.<br/><br/>Yet, the best thing about this movie is in its ideas, allegories, and metaphors. The film came in the mid 60s and that in itself is astonishing with what it held of its time's fears and the theories that all turned out to be true (as many critics and newspapers remarked).<br/><br/>The film's major theory was connecting war with sexual desire. This was shown through various images (mating airplanes, spewing coke machines, ""impotent"" bombs, playboy magazine..), spelled out through words and phrases (""loss of essence"", ""Bodily fluids""..), hidden behind symbolic names (Jack Ripper: a killer especially of prostitutes, Merkin Muffley: female pubic area, Desadeski: perverted sexual love in the 18th century, and the same in Strangelove, Mandrake, Kissof..), and even presented in the only female character (Miss Scott) with her bathing suit or presence on the cover of a playboy magazine.<br/><br/>Another important theme is how technology dominated human life. The film shows numerously how things are getting completely out of control and away from moralities. Also Capitalism gets its share of criticism through the memorable scene of Mandrake in the phone booth.. ""Shoot with a gun.. that's private property"". Moreover, the statement that has been used by many throughout history to justify massacres; ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks"", was brilliantly implemented in the plot.<br/><br/>By focusing on the relation between war and sex, the film in return shows how the human conduct is leading to a lack of love. The only woman (that is a symbol of love and affection) is presented by one character and by sexual means.. also the theory of Dr. Strangelove at the end adds to it. This leads us to talk about arguably one of the weirdest characters in the history of cinema. His Nazi approach only points out that Nazism may occur in any of our acts, whether on the governmental, corporal, personal or any other level (and it is significantly present in the act of war); ""Mein Fuhrer! I can walk"".<br/><br/>The anti-war (which is its overall theme) film succeeded in depicting the different aspects of the cold war from its politics to the paranoiac atmosphere that controlled the minds of nearly everyone. Throughout this feature Dr. Strangelove also succeeded in bringing philosophical theories that concern the human life. A masterpiece."

"tjgoalie13","9","2","3","22 October 2015"," A Hilarious, Biting Satire of the Cold War
","Out of one of the most tense times in U.S. history came one of the more crude and witty satires on the U.S. approach and policies. The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of America. In the mid 1960's, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of Vietnam. Looking at that maybe it's best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it's time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits. The film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn't lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it's easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it. As was mentioned earlier the film's cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick's opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn't shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries. Irony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading ""Peace is our Profession"", or Slim Picken's talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film ""Gentlemen you can't fight here, this is the war room."" All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated. Coming at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting. Considering the opinions of culture towards the military, and other satirized organizations, it seems obvious that Dr. Strangelove was drastically ahead of it's time."

The method of presentation itself is a socio-political message, but I won't elaborate any further to avoid the risk of spoiling it. A large part of the movie's genius is how it manages to function superficially as a comedy, an extremely dark satire albeit, but a comedy nevertheless. It also works quite effortlessly as a drama once you scratch beneath the surface; and finally, as a whole it is a masterfully orchestrated period piece, tiered with humor, humankind's gravitas to tragedy, and existential philosophy. It's brilliance is in its stratum, never mind the all star cast performances, writing, score and directing. <br/><br/>It's not often in art people have to agree on a great work, but in this case it stands apart from contemporaries and classics no matter how the movie's viewer approaches it.

","""Dr. Strangelove"" is a comedy of errors with tragic consequences. It's both a freewheeling satire and a suspenseful story about what happens after the paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) oversteps his authority and orders a nuclear attack on Soviet Russia. Little does he know that this will bring the world to the brink of annihilation because the Soviets have created a ""Doomsday Machine."" Disaster is narrowly averted, only to return again<br/><br/>And yet this is also one of the most uproarious, biting, ironic comedies ever made, a parody of apocalyptic scenarios. The fate of humanity depends on a group of oddball diplomats and soldiers who are obsessed with destroying the ""Russkies,"" mainly, it seems, as a way of compensating for their sexual frustrations. Gen. Ripper is fixated on his ""precious bodily fluids,"" a Texan pilot (Slim Pickens) reads ""Playboy"" in the cockpit, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) gets dirty phone calls in the War Room. The humorthose character names!is gleefully juvenile, but nothing better illustrates the absurdity of war. Hayden, Pickens, and Scott are all very funny, often playing their roles with straight-faced commitment.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers excels in his three roles as a common-sensical British officer, the well- intentioned but ineffective American President, and the ex-Nazi mad scientist Dr. Strangelove. The former two characters have some very funny moments, such as Sellers' parody of the British ""jolly good"" stereotype, and the phone conversation where the President treats the Soviet Premier as if he were an obstinate child. However, they are basically ""straight men,"" meant to be more sane and sympathetic than the crazy figures around them. But Sellers pulls out all the stops in creating Strangelove, what with his weird smile, his mangled accent, his misbehaving hand, and the maniacal glint in his eye.<br/><br/>Strangelove is actually a pretty minor characterhis first appearance must come about halfway through the movie. His arrival lifts the movie into new heights of absurdity, but it is always lively, sharp, and funny even when Strangelove is not on screen. And although he's not the central character, it's easy to see why the movie is named after him: he's the figure who most completely unites the hilarious with the horrifying."

I just can't get it how someone couldn't find the absurdity of the situation the protagonists find themselves in funny. Perhaps a slight spoiler to give you the idea : at one point in the movie, we have two regiments of the US army fighting and killing each other. That, of course, isn't funny. But if you watch closely, you'll notice that during the whole sequence, you can see a panel in the back. it's an advertisement for the US Army stating 'Peace is our Business'. If you don't think this is funny, then you won't get Dr.Strangelove's humour."

","The best black comedy ever made. I could watch it a thousand times and still laugh. Oh -- dated, sure. There no longer is a Soviet Union, although there are plenty of people willing to barbecue one another nuclearly -- as in India and Pakistan. I'd like to mention the writer on this, the late Terry Southern, who had lots of input into some pretty funny movies, not to mention his short stories or novellas. He's the guy who came up with ""pre-version."" Kubrik did a fine job. He lost his sense of humor afterward. <br/><br/>The acting couldn't be better. George C. Scott embeds himself in one's brain as the general. And Peter Sellers. ""Look, Mein Fuhrer -- I can VALK!"" They wanted him to play King Kong, the pilot, but it didn't work out. Doesn't matter. It's hard to imagine how he would have improved upon Slim Pickens. ""Two pairs a nylon stockin's. Two pair a prophylactics. Shoot. A fella could have a good time on this in Vegas."" Sterling Hayden as the mad general gives his best performance ever, even managing to inject a note of pathos into his delusions. For what it's worth, the final target they attack, ""the missile complex at Laputa"", comes from Swift's satire, ""Gulliver's Travels,"" in which Laputa is the name of a flying island.<br/><br/>After the Doomsday Device has gone off and begun to irradiate the entire globe, Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove, opines that it might be possible for selected humans to survive in the deepest of mine shafts. I wanted to make some reference to a Mine Shaft Gesellschaft but couldn't figure out an easy way to fit it in. So I'm shoe-horning it in here. Not that it makes much difference because so few will twig. <br/><br/>The final scenes. Credits roll. Atomic blast follows atomic blast whilst Vera sings ""Keep Smiling."" DO NOT MISS THIS ONE. If you miss it, you will miss something worth seeing."
"michaelsjmurphy","10","2","3","3 December 1999"," A film that works!!
","I find it difficult to recommend a film more highly.  Kubrick's vision of a world teetering on the brink of nuclear apocalypse is in every way a perfect film.  It captures the essence of a time, and yet it is not at all dated. It is as funny a film as you will ever watch, but at the same time its message is deadly serious.  The acting is uniformly brilliant, led by an incredible triple-threat performance by Peter Sellers.  While his characterization of the good doctor is most often pointed at, in my mind it is Sellers' portrayal of President Muffley which shows his true genius.  His flat, toneless, midwestern accent was a work of art, as was his ability to communicate  through non-verbal cues.  In addition, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden were never better than they were here.   But the special mention must go to Kubrick.  He took a huge risk with this movie - and turned it into a cultural touchstone. In watching this film, one is struck by the lack of ""jokes.""  Every image, from the ""copulating"" airplanes to the Nazi salute in the ""war room,"" was intended as a means to further the irony inherent in a comedy about the destruction of civilization.   I especially recommend this film to younger viewers, unfamiliar with the concept of ""duck and cover"" drills and back yard bomb shelters.  In this film can be found a valuable history lesson, as well as an object lesson in the art of unified filmaking."

","It was very refreshing to see some aspects of masculinity satirized so mercilessly by a male film-maker.  This film is in one sense very contextualized by the political milieu of a particular time: we would never be able to feel the realness of the threat of nuclear holocaust of the time when the film was made.  Nevertheless, its satirical thrust is still felt strongly.<br/><br/>By the way, why does the initial shots of the air-borne fuel-refilling scene seem more erotic than the sex orgy sequence of Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut?"

Did you notice how every characters' personality is defined by their sexual proclivities, which in turn is clearly identified in their name? General Jack D. Ripper is a misogynist who wants to start a nuclear war because he blames his impotence on a communist plot. Then we have President Merkin Muffley, General Buck Turgidson, Ambassador de Sadesky, Major ""King"" Kong. Can you look at those names and tell me who ends up having the biggest gun?

I do believe he should have received three oscar nominations instead of just one for this masterpiece.  His serious side is seen in his role as the RAF officer who tries unsuccessfully to weed out a needed three-digit combination to call back our B-52's. The insane base commander his hilarious with his talk of ""body fluids"" and the stuff about communist conspiracies. Equally funny is the general in the warroom who offers alternate ""solutions"" to the president.  Most funny is Dr. Strangelove himself, who just can't seem to get control of his Hitler saluting hand and shouts of mein Fuhrer! I was laughing hysterically as he spoke of ten women for every man and how they all needed to be beautiful and aryan while the general is left wondering, what kind of kraut last name is Strangelove.

","This film must have really stuck in a lot of craws when it came out. Kubrick's black comedy of the Cold War (right in the middle of it) is notable for a number of reasons. In many ways the film seems to make light of the menace posed by Communism, when later events proved that that menace was utterly real and extremely dangerous. There were tremendous acting performances by George C. Scott and Slim Pickens. It was interesting to see Sterling Hayden working with Kubrick again, some years after ""The Killing"". Some parts of the film dragged a little bit, and some were, of course, way over the top. A complete classic, though. And isn't it interesting how Seller's Strangelove was eerily evocative of Kissinger, years before he was widely known. Grade: A+"

","I love this movie. IMHO it the the best work that Kubrick ever did.  While the others all have great ""moments"". By this I mean that I can watch and enjoy every moment of it from begining to end - which is more than I can say about the rest of his works. The opening ape sequence of 2001 is too long and the ending is too ""enigmatic"" for me. Full Metal Jacket is a film of two halves, the first being far more interesting than the second. Clockwork Orange is overated, Eyes Wide Shut has Tom Cruise - hence I can't ever get beyond the the first few minutes, etc. etc. <br/><br/>I know that some of the model work is a bit shakey and that the special effects are somwhat suspect. Nevertheless, from the point of cast, performances, script, storyline, humour, intelligence, painfully funny imagery, Dr, Strangelove surpasses the rest. <br/><br/>Even though it is nearly 40 years old, the film is still relevant - the B52's are still flying and I could easily see Good Ole boy George W. sitting astride that bomb at the end.

","The absurdities of war, both to be taken literally and as a metaphor of life, have rarely been more eloquently displayed, in any media. The message is that we can chase invisible Commies and arms gaps all we like, but in the end, annihilation awaits Capitalists and Commies alike. The absurdity of the arms race is shown with amazing clarity twice. First, when the Russian ambassador says that they built the Doomsday device to close the ""Doomsday Gap."" Second, in the end, we are shown that nothing was learned, as nothing is ever learned, and that there is still talk of beating the Russians in the Coal-Shaft-Race. The coal shafts, of course, represent a return to primitive living. We are shown that parinoia is universal, in all societies, in all civilizations. The level of living is irrelevant. I also see a lovely parallel between the Nazis hiding in their bunkers, during the last days of the Third Reich, and of the American Leaders' desire to hide out underground. This is of course emphasized by Dr. Strangelove's compulsions (calling the President ""Mein FÃ¼her"" and his uncontrolled right arm). Was the Cheyanne Mountain Complex built/known of when this movie was made? If not, then I see a great deal of irony there. Also, when was the incident when the return codes to the Strategic Air Command were not sent (see my note in the goofs section)? Talk about prophecy, once again, if it was after the movie was produced. Oh, and the link I mentioned (Camus, Beckett, and Kudrick) is that of absurdism.

The humor still works: the womanizing general, the infamous war-room scenes, the precious bodily fluids.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone with a dark sense of humor or a pessimistic outlook on life.  Dr. Strangelove should brighten your day.  Though, the movie must be carefully studied in order to get the full effect.<br/><br/>We must all thank Mr. Kubrick for not going the serious route as originally intended.

I had heard of the strange title with its equally understated subtitle, but saw it for the first time in 1969.  I have watched it at least 20 times since.  There is so much.  The empty headed but patriotic Major Kong, played by Slim Pickens, is one of filmdom's most memorable characters.

This film is, I believe, Kubrick's masterpiece.  It is an integration of power and what can be done about it attitude.

Sellers delivers an absolute tour-de-force acting job in his triple role as bumbling US president Muffley, the stuffy-yet-courageous Col. Mandrake, and the lunatic genius Strangelove. And as with all great films, the supporting characters are just as strong, including George C.

","""I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion, and the international Communist conspiracy, to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.""<br/><br/>So says General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) in DR. STRANGELOVE, director Stanley Kubrick's ultimate Cold War satire. The film centers on Hayden's deranged general ordering a preemptive nuclear strike against Russia for those very reasons. Peter Sellers pulls off the impossible by playing three roles: President Merkin Muffley; RAF Colonel Lionel Mandrake (Hayden's executive officer); and the half-mad Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove. George C. Scott, in one of his two greatest roles (the other being PATTON), is hilarious as an equally committed (in more ways than one) anti-Commie general who speculates that a reduced retaliation strike against Russia would result in ""no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops!"" Factor in the soon-to-be-revealed existence on Russian soil of a Doomsday machine, however, and things become somewhat different.<br/><br/>All of these things come together in one chillingly hilarious package. So many great scenes and dialogue abound in DR. STRANGELOVE that this movie remains memorable. The exact political conditions that helped spawn the film no longer exist in the world now, but a new set of circumstances (the dangerous ideological divide between fanatical right-wing Christians in American government, and fanatical Islamists in the Middle East) still make this movie timely even today.<br/><br/>What I don't think really gets mentioned all that much in relation to DR. STRANGELOVE is that Kubrick is working on three different tracts. First, of course, there's Hayden's anti-Commie paranoia about the fluoridation of water (a belief actually cherished in reality by the far right in 1950s America). Second, there's the chilling irony that those who are in the best position to prevent a nuclear war are also the ones most willing to start one too. Third is the theme of technology (in this case, the Doomsday machine) that Mankind is either unable or unwilling to control. This last theme would be the subject of many superb sci-fi and suspense films in the ensuing decades, including WESTWORLD, COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, JURASSIC PARK, THE CHINA SYNDROME, A.I., and most especially Kubrick's next film, the magisterial 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.<br/><br/>The end result is perhaps the most corrosive political satire of all time, a consistently hilarious and cutting-edge film about the most frightening subject of our age, and its continued popularity with film buffs and political pundits alike is to be appreciated for all time."

A film like this should not be taken seriously quite simply because it evokes such strange insights that after you've seen it, you'd better bury them all again or a demented monster will emerge. But, god, is it funny!<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick follows his own code of originality. His films are meant to be original ways of looking at the world. They are not designed to be pieces of entertainment. He is like the most art house of all Hollywood directors. He has this inane ability to allow people to take things seriously, whether it be about a doomsday device or a bunch of monkeys bashing skeletons with a bone. Let's face it. If Kubrick hadn't directed those films, without the symbolisim he applies, they would have been absolute messes of gargantuan proportions.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is the most insane, stupid idea. It's a spoof movie. It's like the works of the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker company or the Austin Powers movies. The ideas evoked are just as silly. But Kubrick knows how to direct an idea like this. His genius makes this not only watchable, but one the best films I have ever seen. People underestimate movies like these, because they take well-known cliches and turn them into statling works of originality. Why do you think people like George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Krzystof Kieslowski and, yes, Stanley Kubrick, have never won an Oscar? The ones who are teased are the ones to watch, I think.<br/><br/>One other thing: Peter Sellers. Good god. Who can possibly deny his genius?"

Then he went ahead and plugged it up with these great absurdities that make you laugh at it all. SPOILERS: Just picture Slim Pickens riding a nuclear bomb like a horse and yelling ""Yeeehaw!"" There's Strangelove who is a psychotic former Nazi who now works for the US government. He has dillusions of seeing ""die fuhrer"" and saluting him. Even more absurd is that Peter Sellers plays three parts! Don't ask me why, it's just Kubrick having more fun. There's a classic scene where the President talks to the Premier of Russia on the phone and the main topic of conversation is how it's good to be feeling fine.<br/><br/>There are also sequences (particularly the ending) that can scare the heck out of you.

","Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) was directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. It was also co-written by Kubrick with the journalist and counter-culture satirist Terry Southern, transforming the conventional thriller Red Alert by Welsh author Peter George. The film stars Peter Sellers, George C Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens, Keenan Wynn and Tracy Reed. It has a Running time of 94 minutes. The film went on to earn four Oscar nominations at the 37th Academy Awards, including in the best picture category and over a dozen of other nominations and it won eight in total, including BAFTA Awards for Best Film and Best British film, Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, to name the few among the most prestigious awards it won.<br/><br/>The film opens with a eccentric General Ripper declaring a ""Code Red"", sealing off his air-force base, and ordering a nuclear attack on Russia. When his assistant, RAF Group Captain Mandrake, advises moderation, Ripper replies that he intends to launch a pre-emptive strike to stop a Communist infiltration which is ""sapping and impurifying all of our precious bodily fluids"". In Washington D.C., an emergency meeting is called to determine how to react to the crisis. Present are President Merkin Muffley, a man whose effete personality is adequately described by his name, General Buck Turgidson, whose least favorite color is red, Dr. Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist who is now head of the United States' weapons development program, Soviet Ambassador de Sadesky and the rest of the higher-uppers at the Pentagon. Meanwhile, aboard the bomber ""Leper Colony"", we are introduced to the crew led by Major ""King"" Kong that will play a vital role in the events about to transpire.<br/><br/>Originally, Kubrick envisioned Peter Sellers playing four unique roles. However, after filming three of them the actor broke his leg and was unable to complete the quartet. In his place, Slim Pickens was signed to portray Major ""King"" Kong, the commanding officer of the bomber that gets through to Russia. He is excellent as well. Peter Sellers is magnificent and exceptional in essaying a trio of roles. I am not disclosing the characters, you find it out and enjoy the every second of the brilliance of his quintessential acting. George C. Scott plays the role of General Buck Turgidson and we get to witness his jaw dropping performance. Sterling Hayden is cased as the Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, a paranoid SAC commander. Peter Bull is a personification of suspicion as the Russian envoy.<br/><br/>Production is handsomely mounted, with fine work by art director Peter Murton. Wally Veevers, special effects, Laurie Johnson's music, and excellent photography by Gilbert Taylor. Laurie Johnson's music is a major aid to the satirical tone. It is good because it does not try to be funny on its own, but is played straight and only becomes funny when contrasted with the action on film.<br/><br/>As the film races to its conclusion and simultaneously adding on to the satirical tone, situations become more bizarre, with a drunk Soviet Premier Kissoff whining over the phone to Muffley that the U.S. planes are flying too low and jamming their radar. Mandrake tries to put an emergency call through to the President, but the Pentagon won't accept the collect call, and he doesn't have exact change. And Dr. Strangelove, Hitler's best living ally, comes up with a plan to preserve the superior elements of humanity.<br/><br/>The film became a popular success, earning US $4,420,000 in rentals in North America during its initial theatrical release. Dr. Strangelove is Kubrick's highest rated film on Rotten Tomatoes.The film also holds a score of 96 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating ""universal acclaim"". It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 1994, the film was re-released.<br/><br/>Age has not withered that final petrifying nightmare of the mushroom clouds. The film ends with Vera Lynn's hopeful We'll Meet Again - underscoring how the certainties of the Second World War ceased to hold their meaning in the nuclear age.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is not an assault on American nuclear policy; it is an aghast look at the entire world, a world in which the word ""overkill"" is accepted as a logical point of discussion. The genius of Dr.Strangelove is that it's possible to laugh -- and laugh hard -- while still recognizing the intelligence and insight behind the humor. To conclude, this film is one of the best black comedy and a cold war satire that the film industry has ever witnessed in the history of film making.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, go and watch this movie. You won't regret it regardless of being a movie buff or not."

"sarkardeepashree","10","1","1","25 April 2020"," Dr. Strangelove: An Epic Cold War Satire
","In the modern world, we are often under the illusion that power is distributed among thehands of many people and each of us make a difference to the world. But real power rests on the hands of a few who fail to recognize its value and end up misusing it.<br/><br/>The Cold War is a perfect example of how much havoc is caused when a few men have the power to destroy the world. Dr. Strangelove is a satire of the Cold War which shows the absurdity of the technological arms race between Soviet Union and USA at that point.<br/><br/>The Russians have developed a ""Doomsday Machine"" which is designed to automatically launch a counterattack if Soviet Union is bombed, a counterattack that would lead to the destruction of the world. Nobody is bothered about the suffering of the common people. They are busy playing a sick game of revenge where both sides are trying to construct a weapon that would enable them to wipe out the entire human population from the face of the earth, so as to deter the other from attacking them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile General Ripper, an Air Force general who is convinced that the ""Commies"" are conspiring to contaminate his bodily fluids by fluoridating the water, single-handedly startsWorld War III by ordering one of his bombers to launch an attack on Russia. The American President is informed of this event by General Turgidson but when he tries to contact Ripper, he finds out that all communication has been cut so there is no way to recall the bomber. Eventually, he has no option but to call the Soviet premier saying ""One of our base commanders, he went and did a funny thing Dimitri...""<br/><br/>Captain Mandrake, the executive officer of Ripper, has guessed the code and tries to save the world by calling the president but he hasn't got enough change for the call. It is too late as the bomber has already launched a missile, with Major Kong riding it to the ground. The movie ends with Dr. Strangelove, the mad scientist giving his theory about how the human population could survive by living underground and the next generation returning to the surface 90 years later.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is a hilarious movie containing ironic statements like ""You can't fight in here. This is the War Room"". At the same time, it is a little depressing as it depicts the arbitrariness of the Cold War. It shows how a big an impact a few people could have on the entire world. Common population became the victims just because two men wanted to play with their power."

","Dr Strangelove does not take a breath from start to finish. At first you might think its a short or standard 1.5 hours but it covers a lot of content. The apparent dark humour is there amidst a very serious plot. It also shows the dangers that can unfold when people in command lose their minds. Also interesting that the President doesn't have as much power as you think. This is an intelligent film, great story and good performances. Peter Sellers shines in his 3 different roles. Kubrick carefully and meticulously shows the workings that lead to such conflict. A classic that can be watched again and a beacon of good film making. 8/10"

"grz-98-880629","10","1","1","7 April 2019"," Perhaps the Greatest Satire Ever
","This movie is perhaps the greatest satire (and dark comedy) ever written, filled with hyperbole, irony and clever wit. Simply genius and no way around it. It's a political statement, wrapped in wry clever humor. This is why Stanley Kubrick is, in my own view, the best director ever. It's so intelligently rendered. George C. Scott's manly ""Commanding General"" persona wrapped in childlike goofy expressions are simply classic."
"leplatypus","7","1","1","6 February 2018"," Courageous and acid (rental)
","In a cold war time and right after JFK assassination, what does Kubrick is indeed original: it's like if today we did a comedy about terrorism and while America keeps tight, only France did it so far with Youn and Vive la France.
Here the premise recalls what happens in Wargames (the human element to launch a nuclear attack) but in a reverse way (the attack is launched!): It's funny (and comforting) that the path to the actual detonation is very complicated and not limited as a single red button to push like we are told. The military sets and equipment looks very accurate and in this cold, serious world, it's very unusual to find indeed comedy: I remember Hot Shots but here there's no really patriot feeling but frightening humans behavior: the military mind to look for an enemy to attack, the amoral and amnesic use of Nazi scientists for the arms race... There is also a lot of hidden things to notice: I like the army tagline Peace is our profession because it parallels our french name of military forces: Defense Ministry while in fact we keep attacking!
Scott is really good as a obsessional general (wilder than Patton) and Sellers is indeed a master of disguise because I didn't get he was also playing the President (that's explain why I found this character a bit soft!). Watching him is a bit like watching another comedy genius, our french Les Nuls: he acts like Chabat with the look of late Bruno Carette."

","Originally this film was supposed to be marketed to college Audiences. I think that was a complete mistake by people who do not understand the film. First, General Rippers paranoia stems from his conviction that floridation of the US water supply is a communist plot to destroy his ability to have sexual intercourse with a woman. The proof is in the pudding, because he tells his exec RAF Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) that he tried and failed. The rest of the movie steamrolls from here. Suffice to say it is fantastic. It is so realistic that when the movie debuted in theaters the USAF showed a disclaimer on the screen to terrified audiences assuring them that nothing like this could ever happen. Just see the film."
"Tweetienator","10","1","1","12 October 2017"," Strange Indeed
","Stanley Kubrick really got some of my favorite movies done: Shining, Clockwork Orange, and yes, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. (Of course, I also like and recommend Paths of Glory, Spartacus, and Full Metal Jacket).<br/><br/>George C. Scott as the mad and paranoid Gen.'Buck' Turgidson, and Peter Sellers in his roles (Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove) on the road of destroying the planet (and first of all the Sowjetunion!) in a nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>Fine and lots of humor and a satirical sharp view on a world on the verge of madness and destruction - in its finest moments the movie reminds me of the notorious The Life of Brian.<br/><br/>That the scientist Dr. Stranglove, who is an adviser to the US President and the generals and maybe the last hope for mankind to stop the ultimate war is obviously an ex-scientist of the Nazi 3rd Reich, is just one of those fine jabs into societies smugness that make this movie grand."
"tdelaney1","10","1","1","8 September 2003"," Flawless
","I'd seen Dr. Strangelove a dozen times in the '60s and early '70s. Then, working in a theater in D.C. in '75, it was playing there for months. I got to know every scene like the back of my hand. It got to a point where I was looking for a flaw, any glitch or lack of any sort. None. I later read that Coppola had also called it precisely 'flawless.' Kubrick became renowned as a perfectionist to a nutty degree. In The Shining, for instance, Jack Nicholson threatened to walk off the set after more than 150 takes on one scene. The camera-work was crack-of-the-whip smart, yet unobtrusive. Black and White, the movie comes across as chromium. I think it is the very best Peter Sellers, playing three roles superbly, all funny. George Scott, also never better, imitating a bomber is priceless. Sterling Hayden as the crazed General with the 'precious bodily fluids' obsession is amazingly reality-based considering the fanatical rightwing's focus on fluoride as one of hundreds of elements of the 'International Communist Conspiracy.' Strangelove was certainly Slim Pickens high water mark as the atomic age bronc-buster.<br/><br/>It works both as a comedy and as an edge-of-chair thriller. The level of satire is profound: questionable if a major studio would risk such intelligently dangerous material in today's equally jingoistic atmosphere.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that any cinema cognoscenti anywhere would do a top ten list of directors without Kubrick well up on it. This is one of this un-prolific artist's very best, which, as the director of 2001, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Barry Lyndon; is saying a whole lot.<br/><br/>What's the fuss about? Great film art about as good as it gets."
"Lodaddy","10","1","1","4 August 2003"," Humanity's struggle toward ending itself is summed up by this brilliant, dark comedy.
","During the cold war a certain fear existed unlike that of terrorist attacks, it was stronger, due to the fact the attacks were possibly catastrophic, and it seemed always to be a possibility. To make a comedy about the world ending by the means most feared, and more importantly, most plausible, is genius. Everyone should respect this as one of the best comedies ever, as well as Kubrick being one of the best directors."

"Angry_Arguer","10","1","1","5 May 2003"," Ingenius
","Anyone can make parody (see Leslie Nielsen), but it takes a great deal of intelligence and wit to make a film like this.<br/><br/>Humor: the jokes are dead on, but you might need an American History textbook with you to understand some of the humor.  Kubrick knew what he was doing and up until the mid-90s, when the next generation that never knew the perils of nuclear war started taking over, this had to be the best satire ever made.  It still is.<br/><br/>Awards: The Academy is a bunch of nincompoops when they consistently pass over great art like this in favor of...Tom Jones and The Sound of Music? What is THAT?!<br/><br/>Sound: in low-budget, independent works like this, sound tends to be left out and considered a minimal priority.  Not here, every click and beep of the CRM-114 is authentic-sounding and the echoes in the War Room are dead on.  Even the gunshots maintain that Looney Tunes tune to them.  All I can say is ""wow"".<br/><br/>Cinematography: The camera is beautifully manipulated (in a rather straightforward) with no behest on Kubrick's part to keep things simple but effective.  ""If it's stupid, but it works, it isn't stupid.""<br/><br/>Acting: this film is all about over the top performances and every single act puts his ingredients into the stew.  Fortunately, unlike such efforts as Batman Returns, everyone gets a good amount of say while still being memorable. ""Hey! What about Major Kong?""<br/><br/>Overall: As a sci-fi film, Dr. Strangelove remains one of the best in depicting human error (a concept further elaborated on in 2001) and thus retains its placing in the classics of the genre.  Sci-Fi, after all, is not about slimy ALIENS or big bug battles, but rather the effects of mankind's existence on his own psyche.  Or so I see it.<br/><br/>A worthwhile film that has not aged as well as others.  You either will agree that it is incredible or find it loathsome, incomprehensible, and boring.  If the latter, get your head screwed on straight because XXX has decayed your brain."
"rzajac","10","1","1","28 April 2003"," Obligatory paean
","I'm not writing to say something about Strangelove as much as to chime in with my praise for the values, artistic and human, to which it stands as a monument.<br/><br/>Of course, that's a weird thing to say about a script that seems to walk a tightwire, using a balance pole with a gorilla sitting on one end and the archangel Gabriel sitting on the other, ten miles high with absolutely no safety net below.<br/><br/>An unknown mystery factor:  Along with the TV Rocky & Bullwinkle show, this movie just may have saved the world from nuclear annihilation.  But perhaps we'll never know, at least not until thoroughgoing research has been done in the Akashic Records.<br/><br/>A personal story.  I first saw this movie when I was about 6.  I was too young and innocent to understand any of the dialog or action; I certainly did not pick up on the plot.  But a minor miracle happened there in that dark theatre.  Col. ""Bat"" Guano, preparing to shoot the Coke(tm) machine, tells Mandrake that if they don't reach the President, he'll have to answer to the Coca Cola(tm) company.  People in the audience laughed.  I leaned over to my Dad and said, ""Dad, what's funny?""  He leaned over, said a mere handful of explanatory words, I got the joke and laughed.  I can't tell you what my Dad said, I don't remember.  I can only assure you that it worked for me, and I truly *did* get the joke.  That moment is forever locked in my memory.<br/><br/>Thanks, Stan, Terry, Peter George, all parties.<br/><br/>P.S.: Oh yeah.  I have seen the movie a couple of times since I was 6. B^)"

","I'm a huge Kubrick fan (Which has amused my mom and also disturbed her... since I""m also a huge fan of Clockwork Orange) And Dr. Strangelove is my favorite movie of his. Just the idea of making a comedy about nuclear annihalation during the Cold War was a bold move, and it paid off in full as perhaps my favorite Comedy of all time.<br/><br/>However, lets not forget who really steals the show in this movie, Peter Sellars taking the part of three roles, and he does all three well, with my favorite being of course Dr. Strangelove himself (Mien furhrer.... I CAN WALK)...... with the last line of the movie (Being the one I Just quoted) truly memorable and one of my favorite sound bites to quote when I'm in a goofy mood. George Scott also does a good over the top job. A Kubrick Masterpiece which was nominated for afew Academy Awards.. I don't think it won any which is really a shame. Maybe not best picture... but Sellars should've gotten the best actor nod at the last... now that I think of it.. best picture would've been nice also. It's all good though.<br/><br/>I've watched it with some of my friends and some have liked it and some have not. Regardless though.. I give this film a try.... Kubrick at his best"
"hausrathman","10","1","1","20 February 2003"," A true must see film
","A demented Air Force general, Sterling Hayden, orders the bombers under his command to attack the Soviet union as a number of other characters, three of whom are played by Peter Sellers, grapple with the situation.  This film, written by Terry Southern, Peter George and director Stanley Kubrick, is nothing short of a masterpiece.  It easily ranks with Kubrick's best films like ""2001: a Space Odyssey"" and ""A Clockwork Orange.""  Not only is this the best black comedy ever made, it does double duty as a very effective thriller as well.  The entire cast is excellent.  Peter Sellers is wonderful in his multiple roles and George C. Scott delivers his best comic performance.  However, it is Slim Pickens who steals the show as Major Kong, the cowboy pilot of the B-52 bomber.  This is a true must see film."
"lurch-17","9","1","1","14 February 2003"," Still a riot
","George Scott's best role and performance of all time.  Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Slim Pickens made this movie work.  After Strangelove, Scott took himself too seriously.<br/><br/>When I first saw Strangelove in 1963, my friend and I were alone at the matinee in a very large theater in the midwest.  We howled unabashadly throughout.  The next time I saw it was at a 1985 peace conference in Honolulu - the movie was evidently selected by someone who had never seen it (or a prankster who had).  I started laughing from the start and all the peaceniks looked down their noses at me as blasphemous.  Within twenty minutes they were howling too.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of exaggeration.  Don't bother with trying to make deeper meaning out of it.  It is pro- and anti- everything.  The names tell you that it is meant to be high comedy from the beginning - ""Burpelson"", ""Turgidson"", ""Kong"", ""Kissoff"", ""Bat Guano"", and ""Strangelove"".<br/><br/>See it. Again and again."
"lambiepie-2","10","1","1","2 February 2003"," I laughed, but now I laugh...until I cry.
","What an excellent film. I did not understand or enjoy this film when I was younger but I would hear folks talk about it throughout my lifetime. I saw it in bits in pieces growing up and it never appealed to me. Then one day after I watched Peter Sellers in ""Being There"", and Stanley Krubeck died, I decided to watch Dr. Strangelove, this time all the way through.<br/><br/>I laughed...then I cried. The opening sequence is a sexual as they come, and the satire of way the cold war was presented will make you snicker/laugh without you really wanting to. I am a product of ""after the cold war"" not quite fully understanding the ""who is superior"" ego of the two ""Super powers"" of Russia and the United States until it was over and I learned about it in elementary/junior high school history classes, this film finally began to make alot of sense now that I am older.<br/><br/>Besides the wonderful Peter Sellers playing multiple rolls, you had the wonderful George C. Scott who had many lines that made you laugh but in 2003, I am really wondering who wrote those lines for him with what we have approaching. Same with Slim Pickens and Sterling Hayden. Looking around the backgrounds the one thing that made me roll over with laughter was the Air Force bases with BIG signs declaring, ""Peace is our Business"". And of course the immortal line from Peter Sellers as George C. Scott was claiming that a Russian Ambass. was taking pictures of the war room and they got into a scuffle. Peter Sellers, as President of the United States tells them: ""Gentlemen, there is no fighting in the war room.""<br/><br/>This film depicts a past fear of a bomb that shouldn't have been directed to be shot, and the retaliation of the country being shot of. I say past, since this was 1964. I am writing this in 2003 and the past, has sadly become a fear of the present. A must see brilliant film. One of the 10 best of all time."
"ProperCharlie","10","1","1","19 January 2003"," Bourbon and pure rainwater
","Dr. Strangelove is my favourite Kubrick movie.  It still has something of that detachment found in his other movies.  However it manages to connect with the audience in a way that the others don't.  It's not just the humour, the film rattles along with a narratively-linked sketch-like structure. Each scene is memorable, of the perfect length and has perfect timing.  It shares this quality with films like Pulp Fiction and Withnail & I, perhaps even with material like The Goon Show.  Note that all of these films have more than their fair share of quotable moments.<br/><br/>This is the story of the Air Force Base commander who 'exceeds his authority' and sends off his bombers to bomb the Ruskies, the President who tries to get them back and the mysterious scientific advisor, Dr. Strangelove who has some interesting ideas.  The humour is a subtle shade of pitch black, finding it's comedy in the spectre of nuclear war at the height of the Cold War.<br/><br/>The acting is superb all round, Peter Sellers takes on three roles and plays them marvellously.  Even better is the support given from Slim Pickens, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden.  Kubrick uses some excellent lighting and camerawork, most notable in wonderful War Room scenes.  Some of the shots are wonderfully composed, between shoulders and across the War Room table, General Jack D. Ripper outlining his theories while we look up from below.  The scenes of the attack on the Air Force base are the forerunners of films like Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan with their shaky, handheld camerawork as if we're invading with the troops.<br/><br/>Some have argued that the film has aged along with the Cold War.  It is certainly a savage critique on war and the confrontational politics and posturing of two barely concealed enemies.  I think these themes are just as relevant today as they were at the beginning of the 1960s.  Just for a moment imagine as the camera looks up at the dramatically lit face of General George W. Bush as he chews on a pretzel and says the following 'I can no longer sit back and allow terrorist infiltration, terrorist indoctrination, terrorist subversion and the international terrorist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious...bodily fluids.' It has a certain, awful sense of familiarity doesn't it?<br/><br/>If you're serious about watching film, this is one that you cannot afford to miss.  A classic."

I love the movie My Fair Lady as much as the next musical enthusiast, but considering the strong (triple!) performances he gave in Dr. Strangelove, it was simply a travesty that Peter Sellers did not win the Oscar that year. This film is one of the best, if not the best, of Sellers' career, and my favorite of Stanley Kubrick's. It's definitely a thinking person's film; masterfully executed dark humor and satire.

","my only criticism of this otherwise perfect masterpiece from kubrick is that i felt that the mandrake character played by sellers could have been a bit better. what i mean is that i felt his scenes with the insane general jack ripper were really designed as a ""staging"" ground for the audience to hear from and learn about the general's psychosis with bodily fluids.<br/><br/>however, the scenes could have been a lot better if **in addition** to learning about the general's theories we also were to see mandrake trying to wrest the key from the general, or trying to get to a phone,<br/><br/>trying to kill the general, trying to jump out the window. in this manner mandrake would have been an interesting contrast to president muffley's calm handling of the crisis or scotts eagerness to go to war.<br/><br/>instead, most of the time is spent just listening to the general and waiting for the soldiers to come. witness for example how wonderful the mandrake character becomes when he tries to interact with the ""bat guano"" lieutenant trying to convince him to get some change for a phone call to the president. more of that kind of silly ""nervous tension"" would have pushed mandrake's character over the top i think, and put it in league with the other dr. strangelove and president muffley personae played by sellers."

"susansweb","10","1","1","10 September 2002"," A great comedy that almost wasn't
","Thank goodness, Stanley Kubrick changed this movie from being a straight drama to what is considered one of the greatest comedies of all time.  This movie is chock full of great bits and one liners that one could watch it over and over and never get tired of it.  My favorite scene has to be Peter Sellers' President's phone conversation with the Soviet Union President over who is more sorry.  The line, ""Gentlemen you can't fight in here, this is the war room!"" belongs right up there with ""Nobody's perfect"" as lines that need no clarification.  One of the top five comedies in my opinion."

","Best dark comedy I've ever seen? Yes. Absolutely.<br/><br/>Best ""anti-war"" movie? Probably. It does strike a lot of nerves. It'll make you feel strangely uneasy at the end.<br/><br/>Best Peter Sellers' movie? Yes, without a doubt.  Best Kubrick's movie? Yes, indeed.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies? You bet it is.<br/><br/>I had heard a lot about M*A*S*H and Dr. Strangelove. From all the comments, it seemed M*A*S*H was the better movie, and Strangelove was the more serious take on war of the bunch. So I watched both over the weekend. My final take? M*A*S*H is a fake, a travesty, an insult for all the people who ever fought a war. It tried to capitalize on the drug craze of the 70's by presenting a bunch of surgeons getting drunk and drugging themselves and having a good time. That's the extent of its ""anti-war"" message, I guess: ""make love, not war"".<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove, is, OTOH, a cinematic masterpiece. It presents a series of questions to the viewer in the form of a parody. The fact that nuclear holocaust could start because of a human error, and the very specific and detailed characters who would intervene in it. The powerless president. The crazed general. The alarmed russian president. The obsessed texan pilot. It all comes together perfectly - there's no filler here. From the first shot of the bombers flying to the shocking conclusion, this movie never lets your attention drift and instead keeps on questioning the viewers' sense of right and wrong. And all of this is presented in the form of an hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>I'm actually grateful about the comedy aspect of the film, because it makes it all the most impressive that, when the credit rolls, you end up feeling quite nervous and unsettled. This is a film that raises many questions, answers them with the particular point of view of Kubrick, and leaves you to ponder them.<br/><br/>Truly, this is a great film. Highly recommended."

","This is my all time favorite film. Absolutely brilliant on all counts. It's the most biting satire of the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been screened. You're seeing actors at the peak of their form. I would rate George C. Scott's performance here on a par with his work in Patton. His comic timing is wonderful - not to mention Sterling Hayden (how did he keep a straight face saying some of those lines), Keenan Wynn (Mr. ""Prevert""), Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones just starting out (even back then he was reciting every line like it was Shakespeare).<br/><br/>
There are so many great moments and memorable lines, right up to the closing montage and song. And what can I say about Peter Sellers. The man was a true genius. It's a bit eerie watching him disappear into those three characters. His phone conversation with the Soviet premier is hands down the finest monologue I've ever seen on film (""I'm sorry too, Dmitri"").<br/><br/>If you've never seen this film, please do yourself a huge favor and check it out.

","Stanley Kubrick is a God at writing/directing movies, and this one is a great example.  Peter Sellers is one of the greatest actors ever!

","I can't begin to say enough GOOD things about this film! I love the whole black comedy genre (which are movies that place a comedic tone to a rather morbid premise). First of all, each of the actors does an amazing job of acting out their roles (with the exception of Slim Pickens, whose character can get down-right annoying), the performance of the ultra right-winged psychotic General Jack Ripper played by Sterling Hayden was Oscar-caliber, Peter Sellers does an exquisite job playing three different characters including the title character role of Dr. Strangelove and I was deliriously amused by the part played by George C Scott. Though it may seem a little taboo to poke fun at the notion of a nuclear holocaust brought forth by the Cold War, this film is a drop dead funny and entertaining compilation of great acting, a superb screenplay, excellent directing and a FABULOUS ending sequence. Some of the scenes in the fighter jet with Slim Pickens can lag and make you want to hit the fast forward' button, but the highly entertaining scenes in the war room do more than make up for it. It's no wonder that this film was placed at #3 on the American Film Institutes 100 greatest comedies of all time. This is a must see for anyone studying film, or planning on being a movie critic. This movie is truly a classic and I could watch it another 16 times."
"leex1214","10","1","1","12 August 2002"," The greatest 'black' comedy, if not the greatest comedy ever
","Peter Sellers was a comedic genius, pure and simple.  Although this term has been horribly overused in recent years, it is the only phrase that can aptly describe his wonderful abilities.  You would be hard-pressed to find a performance of his that did not reveal some subtle fact about the human condition, or a performance which did not simply overshadow every other actor in the film.  Dr. Strangelove was, I feel, Sellers' greatest achievement on screen, a performance for which any sane person would have given him an Oscar (but who said the Academy Awards made sense?).  All three of the characters he portrays are done to perfection, but the character of Dr. Strangelove, the crazed, former Nazi nuclear scientist that calls the President ""mein Fuhrer"" and has battles between the left and right sides of his body, will forever live in our collective conciousness. Aside from having the greatest performance of arguably the greatest film comedian of all time, this classic has a perfect supporting cast, from George C. Scott as the crazy Air Force general Buck ""I'm not saying we won't get our hair mussed"" Turgidson, to Sterling Hayden as general Jack Ripper that decides on his own that we have to annihilate all of the Russians to stop them from stealing and polluting our ""precious bodily fluids"", to finally Slim Pickens, the gung ho captain from Texas that wears a cowboy hat in combat and rides the bomb like a bronco (that moment is, I think, the greatest moment in the film, perhaps one of the greatest moments in film history).  Also, there is superb directing on the part of Stanley Kubrick, who after making this masterpiece, unfortunately, went over the deep end with 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. This mighty team of artists brought together a plot which is at the same time both poignantly tragic and completely hillarious (if only the 'comedians' out there could take a lesson from this film, Hollywood would be a far more cultural, sophisticated place).  The basic premise is nuclear annihilation: Ripper wants to annihilate the Russians, while the Russians have just completed a domesday machine that would automatically kill all life on Earth if any foreign power attacked Russia.  How could such a dark premise be so funny, you ask?  I say, watch the film, and you will find out while busting a gut."
"stephenksmith","10","1","1","6 August 2002"," one of the greatest black comedies of all-time
","Dr. Strangelove is one of the greatest black(and white) comedies of all time.  It explores with humor and spine-chilling grace: will mankind survive its own madness? or are our collective flaws so great that we will wink out in an evolutionary instant?  But these questions are explored in a farcical, dark work that, I suspect, will live for quite a long time in film history. Terry Southern's dark vision mixed with Shakesperean bawdiness of Peter Sellers et al makes for fascinating and delicious humor.  Although this was produced at the height of the cold war, what makes this work of art a timeless classic is that it transcends its immediate theme and prompts in us in our time to view our collective madness.  Do we depend too much on our technology and think-tank rationalizations to propell us in directions we would never go as a rational individuals.  Do we rationalize to life shibboleths that will propel us into immolation?  What a movie that asks these questions of us, ourselves, and at the same time entertains us, makes us gut-laugh and cry at the on-screen farce.  Wow.  Shakespeare and B-52's. Crazed generals with phallic cigars stickying jauntily out of mouth. Pentegon brass calling on secure phones to their paramours.  And Peter Sellars.  This is a tour d'farce for him.  His multiple portrayals of the president, a British miilitary attache and Dr. Strangelove are comic masterpieces.  This is a movie for the ages.  If you haven't seen it, bring your brain and your tears, for you'll laugh and cry as your intellect is entertained, and that's really sho-biz, folks."

And who can forget our own, lost Mandrake, Colin Powell, the outnumbered voice of reason. <br/><br/>This film will never age because ultimately it is not about the Cold War; it is about the stupidity of absolute power. Why do humans feel the need to invest the power to destroy the world in anyone, let alone someone who yells about ""Mine shaft gaps"" or for that matter, one who thinks he was a small business growth. <br/><br/>Kubrick, no idealist, understood the nature of evil better than most. He knew that evil does not eminate solely from charismatic individuals but rises like smog from the collective stupidity and madness of many people, some of whom may not be evil in themselves. <br/><br/>In the knife-edge political climate of today, certain administrations would do well to heed his message."

","I had heard a lot of things about Dr. Strangelove before I saw it. For some reason I do not really know I got to postpone watching it until April 2002. Since then, I must have seen it at least 10 times. <br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is one of those movies that make movie watching a trully enjoyable experience. It combines irony, humour and criticism on a very serious matter, such as nuclear combat between the two superpowers of the 20th century in a daring yet remarkable way. <br/><br/>Peter Sellers, who has three roles to his own in this one, is clearly at his best and so is George C. Scott whose talent radiates at all times. The casting in this movie is among the best I've seen. It is hard to make serious movies about 'the Bomb'. It is much harder, to make a comedy about it, and while at it a comedy that manages to defy not only the fear of the era in which it came out, but also convey several important messages to the rulers of this planet about their actions. <br/><br/>I believe there's not much one can say about this movie. Everyone should see it and try to imagine how daring and amazing a feat this movie is in the near-fascist political climate of the 60s in the Western world, where Communist fear brought the nuclear threat into everyone's life. It is, in my opinion, Kubrick's best."

","Pitch black comedy that finds humor in the unimaginable, due to its outstanding direction, great performances and tight, witty script. This is director Stanley Kubrick, at his best. The use of tight angles, eerie B&W photography and great pacing are key assets. The menacing aspect of such a situation, treated with such over the top style by Kubrick, will solidify this film as ""one to watch"" for generations to come.<br/><br/>The performances are super, with Scott and Sellers leading the way. The script is a stellar piece of brilliance by Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George (who wrote the original novel). The balance of subtlety and mind-zinging absurdity empowers a raw, distinctive genius to the screenplay.<br/><br/>
Those who don't pay much attention to the dialogue, will be crinkling their noses and mumbling, ""What's so funny?"" The intensity of this farce lies as much with the spoken word, as it does the physical. The humor pokes fun at bureaucracy, blind patriotic zeal, hypocrisy and human nature.<br/><br/>DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB was courageous, landmark film making for it's time. The USAF was going to cooperate with the making, until the brass read the script. It was simply too much for sterile defense department types, which alone should let you know, it's a great movie. A definite classic, worth ringing up the boss to call in sick for. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","The first Kubrick movie I saw was 2001 and it made me think of him as a director obsessing so much about what he thought was innovative filmmaking that he would readily forget about all sense of dramatic timing, humor and decent storytelling. I thought I'd never bother watching any of his other movies, well.. until I ran into this one. If you're into movies like Brazil or Mars Attacks, you will recognize quite a few of the patterns and techniques employed there, only that this one here is decades older.

","I am a little confused in regards to the people who complain that ""Dr. Strangelove"" isn't funny enough.  But I suppose it's not surprising that some people would feel that way considering that nowadays, most people's idea of comedy consists of movies that rely mainly on shock value and gross-out-factor, with little, if any satirical or commentary value.  In my opinion, Dr. Strangelove is far more daring, controversial, and witty than anything the Farrely brothers have ever put out, especially you view it in the context of when it was released, at the height of the Cold War in 1964 when people were paralyzed with fear at the idea of nuclear holocaust and the end of the world.  Competely brilliant, and still very entertaining today, although obviously not in the over-the-top shock your senses way that so many people seem to be used to...More like a subtle shaking-your-head-and-smiling kind of way. :)"
"WriConsult","10","1","1","7 June 2002"," My favorite movie of all time, bar none
","One of the funniest and yet most poignant movies I have ever seen. Kubrick is at his best here, as usual showing what can happen when a finely tuned system built by humans (in this case, the tremendous infrastructure of Mutually Assured Destruction) just doesn't work.  As usual, Kubrick's point is that the system is only as good as the people running it, and here the people running it are hilariously bad.  Career-peak performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and of course Peter Sellers, Peter Sellers and Peter Sellers.<br/><br/>Despite many of this movie's hilarious moments having entered general popular culture, when you watch it they are still funny enough to make you laugh out loud.  And there are yet many more comic gems to delight the unfamiliar viewer.  I've seen Strangelove twice in theaters in the last couple of years ... I was stunned to find packed audiences screaming with laughter and delighted to learn that I'm not the only one who finds it hilarious, even decades after filming."
"ericjg623","9","1","1","29 May 2002"," Classic Cold War Comedy
","While this movie isn't quite in the same league for all-out hilarity as such comedy icons as ""Airplane!"" or ""Clerks"", it nonetheless is a classic in its own right. Quite simply, this film asks the question - what could possibly be funny about nuclear war? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. We have an Air Force general who flips out and, on his own authority, sends his bombers to attack the USSR. At his side is an RAF officer who doesn't seem to know quite how to deal with the whole situation. On a larger scale, the president and his men are assembled in the War Room as they attempt to placate the Soviet Premier (who just happens to be drunk) in an effort to avoid Armageddon. Not that it matters, as it turns out, one lone American bomber gets through, thus triggering the Doomsday Device, and ending all life on Earth. Well, not entirely, for it seems that a mysterious Dr. Strangelove has concocted a plan in which all virile males can hide out in the nation's deepest mineshafts and reproduce (at a ratio of ten women to each man) so as to assure the continuation of the human race despite all the radiation on the planet's surface.<br/><br/>On the surface, this sounds like a recipe for a mess, yet director Stanley Kubrick makes it work. To be honest, this is really Peter Sellars' movie; it is he who deserves the lion's share of the credit for this film's enduring success. For example, when I first saw this movie some 15 years ago, I had no idea that Sellars played the three leads in this film, I had him pegged only as the veddy proper British officer Lionel Mandrake, not having the slightest clue that he also played the geekish American president as well as the nutcase German scientist Dr. Strangelove. It is to Sellars' credit that he managed to play such different characters while making each utterly convincing. In addition, much credit is due to George Scott as the bombastic General Turgison. The scenes where he stares down the president while stuffing gum in his face are definitely priceless. And, last but not least, is the Soviet ambassador DeSadeski, who alternates from being menacing to being ludicrous. There are rumors that Slim Pickens (the B-52 pilot) was never told this was a satire, and was requested to play the role straight. This I find hard to buy; anyone who recalls the part where he reads off the contents of the survival kits, which include such items as lipstick, condoms, and nylon stockings, will find it hard to believe he could do that scene with a straight face without being in on the joke. Also, there are a number of acts of sheer farce, such as when Mandrake is forced to order Col. `Bat' Guano to shoot open a Coke machine in order to get change to phone the president to put an end to the nuclear crisis. There are some ""Airplane!"" style sight gags, most notably when the B-52 is flying low over Russia but its shadow is that of a World War 2 B-17. And the pacing is also dead on. At first, there is little evidence this is actually a satire, one could easily watch the first half hour or so and fully believe they were seeing a serious (albeit, rather corny and low budget) war film. But, in time, the humor builds, such that, by the end, the president and his men are contemplating the advantages of being holed up in a mineshaft with hordes of women chosen primarily for their sexually stimulating attributes when all the while Strangelove is trying (and failing) to suppress his rabid love for his `Fuehrer'.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, this movie has a lot going for it, but it also has its flaws. Most notably, it is politically dated. Apparently the impetus behind Gen. Ripper's plan to attack the USSR is that he thinks the `Rooskies' have plotted to contaminate our water supply with fluoride. I guess, back when this movie was released, people could relate since the notion of flouridization as a `Commie plot' was popular among conspiracy theory nuts at the time, but to a modern audience, the reference just seems out of date. Also, it seems to suggest that opponents of communism were nothing more than paranoid knuckle dragging Neanderthals, a notion that has hardly withstood the test of time. Finally, there are the silly names and sexual innuendo. I guess having names like General Jack Ripper and Premier Kissoff has a certain entertainment value, but at the same time they seem childish, like something I'd have called my teachers behind their back in 5th grade. Quite honestly, Beavis and Butt-head came up with funnier names when they tried to join the army as Major Woody and Private Parts. And having Ripper ramble on about the loss of his precious bodily fluids was no doubt sexually risqué in the 1960's, but by today's standards it just seems, well, icky. But these are nitpicks. On the whole, this movie has stood the test of time and remains a classic from its era.<br/><br/>9/10"

Every actors here have really done themselves great justice.<br/><br/>There are many great moments in this movie.  Try to keep a straight face during the scene when president Dmitri freaked out on president Muffley who tries to calm him down over the phone.

I still can't get over the fact that a Colonel kept saying ""prevert"" - it was just so funny.

"DaLlama","10","1","1","7 January 2000"," No equal
","How often do you watch a film that, when you hack past the glitz and all the symptoms of Hollywood-Syndrome, is a flat-out masterpiece? Not just a great film, but a flawless one, one that moves far beyond 'I wouldn't change a thing' to one you gape in awe over, countless times over countless viewings, because you cannot comprehend how it could be so perfect. I don't usually gush like this. I admire, praise, vociferously shake my fist and rant, but never...gush. I am gushing now.<br/><br/>Whether it's interpreted as oedipal suckling or sexual gratification, I love the kindergarten-scrawled credits juxtaposed over the imagery of the mid-air refueling (the transfer of essence?), suggesting the ubiquitous role of sex throughout our lives. From there, the film unfolds brilliantly, playing Who's-In-Charge-Of-National-Defense? to the double standard of the water-as-semen euphemism (Ripper's strategy to stop the communist plot is avoiding ejaculation while Strangelove's solution to the impending nuclear disaster is to ejaculate at will to replenish the human race.). But that's its true beauty: Dr. Strangelove works on so many levels. If you're hard-bent on the sexual angle, the whole film can be as Freudian or Masters and Johnson as you want, from the more obvious touches (General TURGIDson, and nearly every other name) to the subtle (The homosexual undertones of ""You with the old gun and me with the belt and the ammo, feeding you Jack. Feed me you said, and I was feeding you, Jack.""). But it could be about the ludicrousness of the arms race or the ludicrousness of the armed forces or the ludicrousness of the most powerful men in the world. It could be about the biting irony of the quest to promote peace by the threat of war (so appropriately summed up by, ""You can't fight in here, this is the war room!""). It's about all of that, and then some. Winning the Triple Crown of accents by Peter Sellers; George C. Scott and the tantric Sterling Hayden; the meticulous attention to detail (Hey, if the special effects aren't there to convincingly depict a flying B-52 from the outside, the next best thing is to show it from the inside (and, of course, to further emphasize all the useless ""safety"" measures the Air Force employs to avoid dropping the bomb by mistake.).).<br/><br/>There are few films as completely satisfying as this, especially after repeated viewings. Kubrick's very best...and that's saying a lot."

That means I'm in the ""target audience"" of the likes of ""American Pie""(I haven't seen this and I don't want to).  Now that I've said that, this is the funniest film ever conceived!  The plot?  General Jack Ripper (named after a serial killer of prostitutes) goes a little funny in the head and does a silly thing..he orders a wing of 34 planes to attack Russia.  Naturally the Premier is, err, upset.  His Executive Officer, Lionel Mandrake( I can't recall what this means now, but I know this is a double entendre!) is one of the few sane characters in this and the only man who can stop the bombers before the plaster Russia.  In the War Room, President Merkin Muffley tries the sort the mess out with Dmitri Kissof on the hot-line.  General Buck Turgison strongly believes that we should immediately conduct a full scale nuclear strike against Russia to cripple their defenses.  When Muffley declares that this is mass murder, Turgison replies ""I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, I am sayin that there will be no more than 10 to 20 million dead..tops..depending on the breaks!"".  The rest is a hilarious tour de farce as Mandrake, Muffley, The Russian Ambassador Alexei Da Sadeski, Kissof, The People's Central Air Defence Headquarters, and the rest of the world tries to stop the planes.  What makes this film so good? ""Austin Powers"" dealt with global destruction, right?  I'm too young to remember, but this film was made just after the Cuban Missile Crisis, when everyone was worried that the other side would do a silly thing and start a nuclear war.  The jokes are great.  I must say that the sight gags are witty, instead of tired slapstick.  For example, when Group Captain Mandrake is trying to put a call through to the Pentagon and demands that Colonel Guano shoot the lock off of a Coca-Cola machine and find some change, he replies ""That's private property"" and ""I'll get you your change but if you can't reach the President you'll have to answer to the Coca-Cola company!"". After he shoots the lock off with a bullet, soda splashes all over his face. There are several others I won't disclose.  The bomb ride with Major King is the most memorable moment in cinema history.  The film sticks true to its conviction: Nuclear war is absurd!.  I'm certain that today's filmmakers would have had the Doomsday Machine not go off.  Another plus is that acting is top notch.  If only Myers could act anything like Sellers I would have nominated Austin Powers to the AFI!  Did anybody notice that everyone was panicking except Major Kong and his boys who were just about to end civilization, who are eating sandwiches and reading Playboy?  The fact that Kong is wearing a ten gallon hat as he about to go into nuclear combat toe-to-toe  and is determined to bomb something if it's the last he literally does just makes a perfect film only better.(Spoiler?)  This is a film that has to be seen again and again if only for the ""We'll Meet Again"" as the world explodes!"

However, it is a very good war movie, which makes you think with its grim satire. This could have been made into a somewhat unoriginal war protest movie drama, but Kubrick and friends have put a spin on it--making it seem so unbelievably absurd, that it takes a global-thermonuclear holocaust and makes it seem light, which takes on an absurdity of it's own. And the final scene, where there is classical music amongst the destruction, is a last touch of political message.

"Dr.Mike","10","1","1","1 September 1999"," POE: Purity of Essence
","Dr. Strangelove is purity of cinema.  Contrary to popular opinion, Kubrick never made a bad film, and this is one of his best.  The performances are certainly the best that he ever got from his actors, The photography is typically brillant, and the script is better than some of his others.  The film has so many layers that one viewing simply isn't enough.  It is about the Cold War.  It is about masculinity.  It is about insecurity.  It is about insanity.  And in the end, I think it may even be about hope.  Sure, Kubrick points his camera at his subjects as objectively as possible, but I believe that his films always have some element of hope in them.  In this film, the hope comes from the song over the closing montage of destruction. Even if we destroy each other, the human spirit will continue on.  Kubrick's obvious hatred for the military is never given a better display than here, and his attacks on research scientists should not be ignored either.  We must all remember that a system that man has set up must still be run by man.  When good sense vacates a system, the system will fail.  This pattern happens over and over in his films, and Strangelove is no exception.  The military is a rational set-up, but if one part goes wrong, it can detroy the whole thing.  Of course, I think that Kubrick feels that the ""rational"" way the military is set up is a lie and that it is made that way so that men can forget that they are killing other humans, just like them.  In the end, all of Kubrick's films are fighting against inhumanity.  In fact, Kubrick's greatest legacy will be his humanism."
"LouisFriendWA","9","1","1","12 August 1999"," Damn good.
","All I can say is...damn, what a movie.  Comedy, suspense, action...this one has it all.  Perhaps this is one of the few movies that show us the true nature of mankind and its constant attempt to safeguard itself against total annihilation.  But then again, it may be an attempt to show us just how close to extinction mankind really is.  Kubrick's vision of war and the Cold War in particular allow the viewer to step into the War Room and experience, first hand, the horror and the comedy of battle.  He allows us to see the decay of the human spirit in the military and the joy of an end with the final ride of Slim Pickins. Typical Kubrick, the movie fails to give closure.  Following in the tradition of ""Full Metal Jacket,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" he lets us, the viewers, decide for ourselves what happens at the end.  The ending of the movie allows us to conclude what our imaginations will allow us to conclude. I know that this movie will continue to give its fans and its viewers hours of entertainment and joy.  Just remember...it's all about the fluids. Ciao, Clyde"

Peter Sellers portrayal of Dr. Strangelove has got to be the best movie character ever seen.  George C. Scott was also dead on funny and gives the best acting performance of his career.

"Arkaan","10","1","1","12 August 1999"," Madly hilarious
","Easily the funniest movie I have seen, on par with Some Like it Hot.  It takes a situation that would be perfect for a drama, nuclear disaster, then Kubrick turns it into a satire.  He decided that what he wanted to tell the audience was crazier than the book it was depicted on, so he made the movie a comedy.<br/><br/>  What performances?  Peter Sellers was amazing in his triple role, as the British military officer, the president of the USA, and as a wierd Scientist, Dr. Strangelove.  The scene where he is talking to the Russian premier (?) is devastatingly funny.<br/><br/>  A true classic, and Kubrick's best (along with 2001: A Space Odyssey)"
"SamuraiNixon","10","1","1","9 July 1999"," A great film.
","Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant piece of social satire that was partially based on the Peter George's novel Red Alert. There was also a film that was produced amongst the same time titled Fail-Safe. This film was analogous to Dr. Strangelove but was a much more serious piece, although it is a good film. Both films portray the paranoia of the possibility of a nuclear attack. The message for both -- as long as there are nuclear weapons there is always the possibility of them being used. No fail-safe is safe enough. This film was especially scary coming off the nuclear missile crises of Cuba and Krushchev.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick was in his prime in the sixties. He directed this (1964) and 2001 (1968), both are amongst the top films ever made. Peter Sellers was in his prime too. He plays three roles (originally he was supposed to play the Slim Pickens role ""King Kong"" too) with such sagacious skill that you believe all three characterizations: President Muffley as the obsequious wimp, Dr. Strangelove as the strategic advisor who cannot control his hand, and Capt. Lional Mandrake as the only person with any sense.<br/><br/>Another reason I love this film so much is the sublime writing. Everything that happens in this film is possible. The comedy does not overshadow the seriousness. The dialogue is brilliant with metaphorical connotations (like the casts names) and word play -- ""The auto-destruct mechanism destroyed itself"". Hell, even the sets are beautifully constructed.<br/><br/>Originally, there was supposed to be a pie-fighting scene at the end. However, that would have been too contrived and distracting. Some critics say that the end war room scene does not work. I disagree though it could have been moved earlier before the wild-ride. Technically, they would have had a few minutes before the bombs dropped on them anyways.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers and Stanley Kubrick would make a few mediocre films and some brilliant films, Dr. Strangelove is definitely one of the great ones."
"silly-7","10","1","1","9 June 1999"," Pure genius!
","Dr. Strangelove is perhaps the funniest and most creative movie to ever come out of the film industry.  The parody of the cold war and the supposed ""doomsday device"" pokes fun at a serious issue in global politics at the time, yet manages to steer clear of actually criticizing the idea of nuclear warfare.  The main characters, Jack Ripper(the psychotic general infatuated with preserving precious bodily fluids), Chief of Staff Ingridsen(a crazed politician afraid of ""commies""), and Dr. Strangelove(an insane nuclear scientist with interesting ideas about man's future), are all crucial in turning this interesting story into a memorable film event.  Kudos to Kubrick, who also co-wrote the screenplay, as well as producing and directing the film."
"Chuck-149","10","1","1","1 June 1999"," The unbeatable black-comedy on the cold war.
","What a movie this is.  This movie is a true group-work because the actors make the screenplay twice as perfect as it really is but Kubrick's editing, filming and writing helps the cast be perfect. Peter Sellers is terrific in his three roles but is by far the best as Dr. Strangelove.  George C. Scott is also excellent as the totally anti-communist American general trying to find a solution to question wether the bomb must be dropped or not. This is a hilarious movie and a work of art by a true genius who calls himself Stanley Kubrick.  By far his best movie from my point of view, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is excellent and nearly irreproachable (don't forget the scene when Slim Pickens rides the bomb all the way down)."
"""Manos!""","9","1","1","18 May 1999"," truly a classic
","Yes, this film is one of the all-time greatest black comedies.  Yes, it was painfully realistic and scary enough that the only possible reaction is to laugh (in my case, guffaw while rolling around on the floor doubled over in pain from the stitches in my sides).<br/><br/>The one thing that all of the other reviewers failed to comment on is the (albeit brief) *romance* in the movie.  This has without a doubt the most entertaining & fulfilling love scene ever caught on film.  I'm talking about the opening credits.  The aircraft ""refueling"".

","In my opinion, Dr. Strangelove is the best film ever made. In no other movie is Peter Sellers acting extraordinary acting talent apparent as it is here.  Stanley Kubrick outdoes all his other brilliant films with this one.  George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden give excellent performances as well.  This movie is hillarious, yet scary and it is completed by the best ending in movie history.  The characters are memorable and the direction is great.  This is, without a doubt, the best movie ever!"

","I have never seen a movie that excelled in as many different ways as Dr. Strangelove.  It has some of the best characters, best lines, best situations and one the best ending of any movie ever made.  No actor has ever pulled off 3 completely different, but fascinating roles like Peter Seller's does in this movie.  Slim Pickens is perfectly cast as the pilot, George C. Scott is hilarious as Buck Turgenson and Sterling Hayden is brilliant as the insane Colonel Ripper (precious bodily fluids).  No other movie has ever combined story, characters, dialogue, humor and a frightening message better than this.  Score another one for Kubrick because this is the best movie I have ever seen."
"PIST-OFF","10","1","1","22 April 1999"," Nuclear Annihilation is funny.
","Unquestionably the funniest pre-Zucker Brothers movie.....EVER! So many great things about this movie. It is well acted by Peter Sellars in the role of three parts. The funniest of those being the title character. But the show is stolen by Slim Pickens in the classic sowboy ride on the nuclear bomb as it crashes toward earth. And also by Sterling Hayden as the battle obsessed general gone off the deep end. George C. Scott also does his job well as the equally battle obsessed but sane general. So many classic lines and classic scenes. A great score. Young James Earl Jones in a bit part. My personal favorite scene in the movie is the trooper who is more worried about the Coca Cola Company then nuclear fallout. This movie is exteremly funny on such a dark topic. It laughs at the entire insanity and trivialness of nuclear combat. This movie is unlike any other ever made. Unique in every fiber. See it, but be sure to keep a bottle of rain water handy. Wouldn't want to risk losing those precious bodily fluids."
"Philbert","10","1","1","15 March 1999"," If only all performances were that good...
","I have seen ""Dr. Strangelove"" five times now, and it seems to get better with each viewing.  Kubrick was a master filmmaker, and the script is both hilarious and bitingly honest (and probably a good deal more foreboding at the height of the Cold War).<br/><br/>What I love the most about the film, however, are the performances and the characterizations.  Peter Sellers, one of the greatest comedic actors ever, plays three roles just as easily and brilliantly as if he was doing only one; George C. Scott manages to be lovable, hilarious, and almost irritatingly stubborn--all at the same time; Sterling Hayden is a lesson in quiet, calm insanity (think Anthony Hopkins thought of Ripper while playing Hannibal Lecter?); Slim Pickens, even if he was fooled into playing it straight, IS the American, gum-chewin' cowboy; and Keenan Wynn provides a hilarious supporting performance.<br/><br/>I especially love these characters.  Dr. Strangelove, the brilliant (yet mechanically inept, so it would seem) Nazi scientist is the old bumbling genius, who tells his superiors exactly what they want to hear (""Ten females to every male"").  President Muffley is a benevolent leader who goes to all extremes to ""promote peace""--even if it means shooting down his own men. Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake, the stuffy, good-old-boy, English fighter pilot tries to save the world in the stereotypical British, foppish manner:  ""Tell you what, Jack, I'm going to guess what the code is, and you tell me if that's it.  Okay?""  And Jack (Colonel Ripper) is a confused, emotional wreck:  After a profound ""fatigue"" during the act of making love, he surmises that the Commies (of course) are poisoning the water supply with this ""fluoridation"" scheme.  Major Kong is a hilarious patriot; he's also extremely frustrating, because he's just so darn DETERMINED.  A lesser man might have turned back, might have saved himself and 86'ed the mission; unfortunately, we train them to think objective first, and it bites us in the butt in this scenario. And, of course, Colonel ""Bat"" Guano (if that really is his name):  the typical ""orders are orders"" soldier; sure, the world might be ending, but if Madrake doesn't get the President on the phone, and if he tries any ""preversions,"" well, he's just going to have to shoot.<br/><br/>The only movie that I think is a perfect 10, Dr. Strangelove is the ultimate black comedy, with the ultimate in satirical characters."
"Jeff-151","10","1","1","10 March 1999"," From beginning credits to end, a masterpiece.
","From bombers refuelling mid-air to ""Try a Little Tenderness"" to nuclear armageddon at the end to the tune of ""We'll Meet Again"", Dr. Strangelove is faultless satire. There are just so many hilarious touches - how about going from a missile-gap to a mine-shaft-gap for one. The thoughtful looks on all the men's faces when they considered the duties of procreation they would have to endure with their quota of ten beautiful women each. It's all truly priceless, and if I had to pick my favorite film of all time, this would probably be it."
"yoyodinepropulsion","10","1","1","13 April 2002"," Best satire of all time?
","I wanted to add comments here in response to some detractors. Truly, I see this film as almost impossible to fault. However, there are commentors here who are quick to say the the film is ""not funny"". I think that all depends on your expectations. ""Dr. Strangelove"" is satire, not straight comedy. In that sense, if you try to compare this film to something by the Farrely brothers, it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I'll say it again: Satire. The greatness behind the humor here is the chilling logic behind it. What's funny about this film is how disturbing and timeless it is. A great satire makes you come away angry, because there's usually a cynical message behind it. <br/><br/>In fact, with our great president's dubious current inititatives to start up another arms race, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is once again proving its relevance.<br/><br/>
Along with ""The Player"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" is one of the best SATIRE'S of all time. And Peter Sellers would never be better."
"IanTheGenius","10","1","1","9 April 2002"," Possibly the best film ever?
","Well, I suppose that would be a matter of opinion. But this is one my all time favourites. There is just nothing wrong with this film. I can't think of one moment in this when I am not laughing out loud, no matter how many times I have watched it.<br/><br/>This is probably Kubrick's most focused film. His other efforts are generally mixes of whatever good idea comes to him next. This still has his wildly fluctuating style but this never strays from its major focus point... Peter Sellers. When working on Lolita, Kubrick had grown fond of Sellers and loved to watch him perform. This is very apparent here as most of the film consists of hilarious monologues for Sellers's three characters. Sellers doesn't disappoint either. He brings to the screen a wonderfully restrained performance for these three characters, which makes it even funnier when he dives into a physical act of hilarity. He even gets all the best lines such as ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War room!""; ""I'm sorry, Jack. The string has gone in my legs"" etc. He even manages to make his three characters so physically different from each other that it's hard to believe that they're the same person; he seems to change the shape of his face and even the way they hold a phone (As Muffley he comfortably rests the phone in his hand but as Mandrake he clings onto the receiver nervously with both hands, ready to hide the mouth-piece). Sadly he didn't win the oscar he was nominated for.<br/><br/>The laughs don't just end with Sellers though. The script - written by Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George (author of source novel ""Red Alert"") - never lets us rest, chances are we will be laughing so much at a great line that we won't hear the next one. Also, Kubrick frames each shot to unmatched perfection, comedy has never looked this good. Everything, right down to the whimsical special effects are perfect.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are brilliant too. Slim Pickens (If that is his real name) was never told that he was starring in a comedy. Kubrick wanted him to believe that it was a drama as he thought it would make his performance funnier. He was right. George C. Scott battles with Sellers for the best lines in the War room scenes whilst Sterlyn Hayden battles for the best monologues in Ripper's office.<br/><br/>The film was originally set for release in 1963 with an ending that burst into a custard-pie fight in the War room and the president being knocked down by a pie. Due to the Kennedy assassination this was removed and the film was released in 1964. Ironic, considering this was released right in the middle of the cold war.<br/><br/>So watch and enjoy."
"dvdauthority","10","1","1","28 March 2002"," One of the greatest movies ever made!
","Ranked as one of the American Film Institute's Top 100 movies of all time, Dr. Strangelove remains a classic even today in the post cold war atmosphere.  In my opinion, this is Kurbick's greatest movie that he made (and that's a difficult selection).  The humor is still applicable even today and no matter which way you cut it, you'll find Peter Sellers at his very best in no less than three roles.  George C.

","Stanley Kubrick directed the greatest dark comedy of the 20th century. Amidst the height of the Cold War and the assassination of American President John Kennedy only months before, Dr. Strangelove is an exaggerated view of the Cold War to see how ridiculous it could really be. America and the Soviet Union were really going to use all those nuclear weapons on each other?! That would destroy the whole world in one day! That's the point Kubrick wants to make. Kubrick always at the dark side of humans throughout his films. The cynic, satirical, and heartless humans that are always depicted in his movies. Even if they don't start like that (The Shining, Full Metal Jacket), the characters already have the potential to go berserk. That happens in Dr. Strangelove, which is a comedy. It doesn't matter what genre Kubrick covered, may it be drama, war, science fiction,or crime movies, Kubrick always got his message across. Who would believe he would create another masterpiece four years later in 2001:A Space Odyssey?!"

","I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 25 years old. I didn't truly get it then. I saw it again recently at 59; I think I got it this time. The story tells us how totally out of control a military  situation can get in spite of all the official safeguards that may have been put into place. All it takes is one wacko with enough influence for  total chaos to be unleashed. Sellers is superb as the polite English officer dealing with the insane American superior officer. He is equally wonderful as the unflappable president of the USA. His rendition of Dr Strangelove with his relexive Nazi salute is also memorable. Slim Pickens as the obediant bomber aircraft commander is terrific. His dedication to follow orders is indeed, total. George C Scott is equally wonderful in his role as top military adviser to the president. Although enthusiastic to the point of obsession, he seems to have no grasp whatsoever of the gravity of the situation in which the world powers find themselves at that moment."

And whether you like Kubrick or not, you have to respect the fact that the man was fearless in the director's chair.<br/><br/>I'll never know how Kubrick had the nerve to make a black comedy about nuclear annihilation while the Cold War was at its zenith, but I'm glad he did it.  Dr. Strangelove is an absolute joy to watch if you are the type of person who appreciates films that take chances and dabble in the bizarre.<br/><br/>The performances by Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden are as good as you will see.

This movie is the best ever, it manages to take a topic is black as nuclear war, and make it hilariously satirical. It takes satire, and combines it with some all out silliness. It captures the characters (although quite exagerated) perfectly, and makes you think that these people were really experiencing a cold war.<br/><br/>
The suspision and parinoia of general Ripper and general Turginson are portrayed perfectly by Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott, and Peter sellers is perfect in all 3 of his roles: As captain Mandrake he manages to be Neurotic, yet occasionly pompous, as President Muffley he manages to seem worried yet sometimes over confident, as Dr. Strangelove he manages to be insane, and in all 3 he is all out hilarious.

Despite director Kubrick's black-comedy approach, the dedication and professionalism of these men can't help but come through.<br/><br/>While Sellers undeniably shows the most versatility (and sheer acting genius) of this great cast, it's hard not to fall for Sterling Hayden as the whacked Base Commander.

"damonovich","10","1","1","17 October 2001"," Why This is One of The Greatest Ever
","I have not watched this movie since the events of 9/11, but I suspect this could be a good time to review it. Not since the the middle of the Cold War has our society known the kind of fear and panic that we are inundated with now; the mechanisms are different, but the stakes and paranoia levels are the same.<br/><br/>Whatever its place in socio-political context, this movie ranks up there with my truly most favorite of all time. It's flawless: every stroke, from the broad to the hair-thin, is perfectly placed and executed. Kubrick, I would say on the sole basis of this film alone, ranks with Hitchcock as one of the few filmmakers that can hold up to repeated critical analysis.<br/><br/>
Taken as a whole, I say Dr. Strangelove is a masterwork of irony, subtlety, ingenuity, morality, horror and gut-busting humor. Even the base cynicism underlying the film is balanced by the presence of endearing humanity (primarily in the person of Col. Mandrake, one of Sellers' triple-threat performances). Every shot is calculated and executed for maximum weight and effect. Example: How many of you noticed the fact that General Ripper's famous speech about Communist subversion sapping our precious bodily fluids was shot from the exact perspective of his own CROTCH? Sterling Hayden's desperate, unconscious nursing of that fat stogie throughout would have made Freud proud.<br/><br/>Such self-aware direction may actually have come across as extremely heavy-handed if it had not been for the incredible perfomances within drawing attention to the story. Much has been said about Peter Sellers in this film and I have nothing else to add except this: of all of the ""presidents"" I have seen on film, none have been as ""presidential"" as Sellers' performance here (including Henry Fonda's in Failsafe). I say this even in the face of the fact that this is satire here; his anger and waning patience with 'Buck' Turgidson is fully palpable, underscored by his awareness of his responsibility as the most powerful man in the world, and of his possible role as history's greatest mass-murderer. George C. Scott presents a comic performance that should go down as one of the best ever (did Kubrick lend some audio-enhancement to that punctuative slap on his chest while talking on the phone in Miss Scott's boudoir? It sounds like a cannon shot). Sterling Hayden is deliberate and absolutely insane.<br/><br/>
Dr. Strangelove also has to rank as one of the most quoteworthy films of all time. ""Shoot, a guy could have himself a helluva weekend in Vegas with all this stuff!"" There are at least a hundred moments that are sheer pleasure to replay in my head. There are dynamics between characters that underlie the basic story in ways that add delicious subtext to just about every scene.<br/><br/>
Dr. Strangelove has it all. It has everything that I love about good movies: excellent writing, acting, direction, camerawork, and editing. I'm delighted to see so many young people commenting on it.<br/><br/>10/10."

At least as impressive is Peter Sellers in three different roles, each of them brilliantly distinctive and amusing. Pay special attention to Sellers' scene in the phone booth. Also noteworthy are his telephone-conversations with prime-minister Kissoff. In addition i would like to add that the cynical opening and closing credits-scenes are sensational.

","The best cold-war film there is.  It's a hilarious nightmare about the escalating arms race (and its consequences), in which Peter Sellers is obviously brilliant and George C. Scott is hilariously funny.  Is it a coincidence that the book 'Red Alert' was written by Peter George? (could it have been Scott Sellers who wrote it?) Also, this is the best performance by Sterling Hayden (Asphalt Jungle, The Killing) I've seen so far.  He has to be one of my favourite villains ever.<br/><br/>  I saw this film by accident at 2 a.m. on my own and I couldn't control my (hilarious) emotions and imagination, so I probably woke up some neighbours by laughing.  I simply watched it in one breath and dreamed about mushrooms. Those where black dreams about black sheep I assure you!<br/><br/>  BTW 'Two hours to doom' doesn't apply completely to this satire, because the film unfortunately only takes 93 minutes, but those were the best spent 93 minutes of my life.

","Dr. Strangelove is filled with the charming, cute, hilarious comical character of Peter Sellers, brought to the precise degree of properness by the master director Stanley Kubrick. The film has just as much to say about the societal clash in power as A Clockwork Orange, but does so with such a clever attitude that it adds an extra layer: comedy. The portrait of patriotism, post-traumatic stress, guilt, greed, misconduct, international panic, even the apocalypse are brought to screen with such immense humor that it even escapes the viewer's attention outside of intense analysis.<br/><br/>It's stunning when a film can be watched over and over and over again and each time discovered for a new time in a new way.

First of all the movie is hilarious, exciting and fun to watch because of the great directing of Stanley Kubrick wich is the greatest director of all time. The names of some of the characters were very funny like: President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Peter Sellers played three characters in the movie: Capt. Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove, they were all very funny but Dr. Strangelove was the funniest . The movie was black and white despite it is made in the year 1964 but I don't think the movie would have been better in color. But the thing that made the film so great was the scene when the guy fell down on a nuclear missile and landed on the soviet missile base in the end of the movie."

"Duck_of_Death23","10","1","1","26 March 2001"," Who doesn't love this bomb?
","George C. Scott is the best thing about this film.  He makes me crack up every time the camera focus upon him.  The reason he is so funny is because of the atmosphere he creates.  He behaves like a child, not knowing the serious crime they have committed or are going to commit.  He never takes himself too seriously or the whole situation about the United States beginning an apocalyptic war between Russia.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is my personal favorite film.  I am a big Stanley Kubrick fan and this one is his best in my opinion.  Kubrick knew how to get an audience to laugh, shriek or simply sway their hands by presenting the unbelievable.  In Dr. Strangelove, he achieves this height by making a world of all three. He has us laughing at characters so twisted and comedic that you cannot help but laugh. He has us shrieking from the terror and dread of an actual nuclear war breaking out.  And he has us swaying our hands at the absurdity of these characters and situation that we are viewing as an unbelievable satire of this government struggling to save us from doom.  <br/><br/>Peter Seller's performances as The President, the British officer and of course, Dr. Strangelove are brilliantly blazed onto the screen.  Sterling Hayden gives deranged generals a brand new meaning as Jack the Ripper, the man who starts the mess.  And of course, George C. Scott as General ""Buck"" Turgidson.  Scott gives one of the most hilarious performances in motion picture history as a man bent on worldly destruction.  He doesn't care how many people die, he wants his nation to win the cold war.  Chaos is what makes this man go around, with facial expressions that are non-approachable from even the greatest comedian.  I love this movie because it fits my style of comedy, and it's characters are so relentlessly funny that it is irresistible.  Its truly not a serious film, yet it has a serious subject."

"Keyser Soze-12","10","1","1","2 March 2001"," One of the funniest movies I have ever seen, that manages to work on an intellectual level too
","I love this movie.  This is my favorite Kubrick movie, Spartacus coming in second with Full Metal Jacket at a distant third.  This movie is so funny. Many people (teens and college kids mostly) may not get all of the jokes. But it's the subtle things, things like the expressions on George C. Scott's face, the phone conversation between the US and Russian presidents, and let's not forget Dr. Strangelove himself: the ex-nazi mad-scientist who's hand seems to be possessed by Hitler.<br/><br/>This is not a goofy funny movie.  This is not a feel good funny movie.  This is a movie that doesn't seem too funny at first.  But trust me, watch it a few times and you WILL laugh. And like all Kubrick movies, the ending doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie.  But, it works!  I won't give it away, but the ending is the only possible ending that could exist.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is not what's so funny about it.  In fact, it's quite serious.  In fact, it's quite good.  For such an old movie, the plot has the complexity that most modern movies try to mimic and fail.  Part of the comedy lies in the fact the movie takes itself so seriously.  To quote some genius philosopher whose name escapes me:<br/><br/>Two men walk into a bar.  Both men are wearing funny hats.  Man ""A"" knows his hat is odd and is constantly says, ""Hey! Look at this hat! Isn't it funny?!"".  Man ""B"" sits at the bar, drinks his drink, and doesn't even notice his outrageous hat.  When asked about his hat, he replies with a simple, ""What is so funny?"" and returns to his drink in silence.  Which man is funnier?  I think you know.  Dr. Stranglove... is man ""B"".<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant.  We have Peter Sellers at his finest multiple-role movie.  Who else could be heir Doctor?<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite movies.  I highly recommend it to anyone, especially those of you who can take dark humor.<br/><br/>9/10"
"DavidPumpkins","10","1","1","2 March 2001"," Kubrick's Best Film
","Being a great fan of the late, great Stanley Kubrick it is difficult to try and single one film out as being better than any other.  However, I do firmly believe that nothing he ever produced ever bettered this 1964 (or maybe 1963 depending on which source you believe) offering.  Made during the height of the Cold War, with everyone fearing nuclear combat, this was certainly a daring project and one that could have met with harsh criticism, it is a comedy after all.  Thankfully, it is now regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and quite rightly so. The story is alarmingly plausible in a number of ways; General Jack D. Ripper (played with aplomb by Sterling Hayden) loses his mind and immediately orders a nuclear air strike against Russia.  He then proceeds to lock himself inside his military base and tells his soldiers - unaware of his mental deterioration - to kill anyone who approaches.  Locked inside with him is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (played by the awesome Peter Sellers), a nervous, unassuming chap who tries desperately to convince Ripper to give him the three letter code needed to recall the planes.<br/><br/>At the same time, the leading American military figures, along with the President and his entourage, meet in the War Room and try to work out what their course of action should be.  Amongst the group is General Buck Turgidson (the hilarious George C. Scott in what I regard is his best role), an edgy and excitable fellow who cannot wait to begin fighting the ""Rooskies"".  He tries desperately to convince US President Merkin Muffley (Sellers again) that violence is the best course of action, but is met with little support.  It isn't long before the Russian Ambassador is called in and is told the news.  He is met with suspicion by General Turgidson who is soon grappling with him, which results in one of the finest lines ever heard in cinema (""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the War Room!""). With the planes approaching their targets, the Russian President is contacted by phone (""Could you turn the music down a little, Dmitri?"") and it is revealed that Russia has a secret plan which will have huge implications for the future of the planet.  Enter the mysterious Dr. Strangelove (yes, that is Peter Sellers again) who has his own plan which could conceivably save mankind.  But will there be enough time to put it into action?<br/><br/>A joy from start to finish (and what a finish it is), I just love this film, and I know many others do too.  If you haven't seen it, please do so and see just how witty and ingenious cinema can be, and if you have seen it, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say that this film is Kubrick's best and also one of cinema's very best.  They truly do not make them like this anymore."

Third, ""Gentlemen you can't fight in here, this is the war room!""  Nuff said.

"Zerth","10","1","1","24 January 2001"," 80 minutes of immense suspense
","When you mention Stanley Kubrick, almost everyone even remotely interested in film will know who you're talking about. If you ask what movies he has made, most people know about 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and perhaps The Shining. But most people I know have never seen or sometimes never even heard of Dr Strangelove. I find that kind of sad, because in my opinion it's easily Kubrick's best. Although it's hard to decide a favourite among all great movies that have been made, this one is definitely top ten material.<br/><br/>Dr Strangelove is a rather short movie of only around 80 minutes, but it's really intense and things happen all the time. Peter Sellers stars in three different roles with dazzling accuracy (my favourite being Dr Strangelove himself).<br/><br/>Everyone should see this movie. And I don't only mean people who like other Kubrick films, because this one is good in a completely different way. This is one of the few movies that I've felt to be exciting, intense and still having a great plot, no mindless action and a supreme ending."
"bmluvera","10","1","1","1 January 2001"," Better every time
","The first time I saw this movie I didn't really get it all that much. I took it much more seriously than Kubrick probably ever intended it to be.<br/><br/>However, the second time I watched this movie I had a mindset set that this was a sardonic, witty, and most importantly humorous take on war. One can even over-generalize and say that the film was taking pot-shots at conflict as a whole (eg. USA vs. USSR, Lt.Mandrake vs. Gen.Ripper, the B-52 bomber and the obstructions of it's mission)Anyhow, I found myself laughing out-loud on numerous occassions upon subsequent viewings.<br/><br/>
Peter Sellers is so amazing in the versatility and depth that each of his characters in the movie portray. It's the one-liners of General Turgedson (George C. Scott) that steal the show though. It's amazing to think Scott could play this character so well and then years latter pull-off a completely opposite viewpoint of another general in ""Patton.""<br/><br/>I believe this movie should be seen by everyone multiple times. It's themes and acting are absolutely timeless and and it should go down as Kubrick's finest overall work."

","Without a doubt, Stanley Kubrick was one of the most original (and controversial) filmmakers of his generation.  He chose to deal with subjects that other avoided, from pedophilia and incest in Lolita to violence and rape in A Clockwork Orange.  But perhaps his greatest work in regards to controversy would be his satirical take on nuclear war.  Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, is one of the poignant studies into the age old fetish humanity has with death.  It pokes fun at the absurdity of the matter and doesn't care who is offended in the process. Yet, what makes this movie even more incredible is the fact that it was released at a time when nuclear annihilation was a very real threat.  It caused uneasy laughter among the audience, as they contemplated that what was entertaining them today on screen might mean their death tomorrow. Only Kubrick could have pulled this one off."

A fool general orders to his airplanes to go to launch the Atom Bomb on Russia and while an English captain tries to change his mind, all the military chiefs of USA are reunited to try to solve the problem with the Russian Ambassador and a strange and pro Nazi scientist called Dr. Strangelove. Kubrick puts on a tragic satire on the Cold War, showing us the anti communism and the foolish paranoid of the militaries, especially Buck Turgidson (played by a restless George C. Scott) and Jack D. Ripper (which sounds as Jack The Ripper, the famous English serial killer), which Sterling Hayden plays with great intensity. In his face is impressed all the hate and the rage of a stupid man, who became paranoid. Then, there is the wonderful performance by Peter Sellers, which plays the reasonable Captain Mandrake, the stupid and impotent President Muffey and the terrific Doctor Strangelove, a man on a wheelchair with a hand rebel to the rest of the body and who, at the end of the movie, jumps on with the right hand up revealing his Nazist origin. This movie is very funny and cruel, a reflection against war and human madness, which can only guide world to the ruin and the destruction."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","1","1","7 September 2000"," A Classic and Brilliant Satire
","Stanley Kubrick's acclaimed dark comedy about nuclear holocaust is among the greatest film satires ever produced.  To truly appreciate this film it is necessary to remember its historical context.  It was produced right after President Kennedy was assassinated and just two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The whole world was gripped with a profound paranoia about nuclear annihilation.   Average Americans were spending their life savings to build bomb shelters in their basements.<br/><br/>A strong anti nuke sentiment was building in the U.S. and anti-nuke protests abounded.  This film was one of two anti-nuke movies made in 1964.  The other was `Fail Safe' starring Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau which was a heavy handed drama that depicted an accidental breakdown of the Fail Safe system that resulted in a nuclear attack on Russia.  `Fail Safe' conveyed its anti war message through a realistic dramatization of an accidental war that frightened the most cavalier of viewers.  `Strangelove' accomplished its purpose through brilliant satire, turning strident generals and politicians into absurd caricatures.  The dire nature of the topic at a time when real fear was at its height produced a catharsis that made this film even funnier when it was first released than it is today.<br/><br/>Kubrick's direction was nothing short of genius.  The film is laced with so many subtle innuendoes and ironies; one could see it twenty times and still not find them all.  For instance, most of the names had sexual connotations. Strangelove (perversion), Mandrake (a root to used to promote conception), Merkin (slang for female genitalia) Muffley (same), Buck (stud) Turgidson (distended with swelling).  The battle to take over the air force complex took place with a sign that said, `Peace Is Our Profession' in the background.  Then there is President Muffley's great line, `You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!'<br/><br/>The entire ensemble gave superlative performances.  Peter Sellers was marvelous playing three parts.  As the President, he was deadpan and serious while delivering one hilarious line after another.  As Mandrake, he was the gentlemanly Brit trying nervously to reason with a madman.  Finally, his best performance was as Dr. Strangelove, a crippled immigrant German scientist who kept inadvertently calling the President, `Mein Fuhrer'.  This was Sellers at his zaniest, and it was some of the best physical comedy I've ever seen.<br/><br/>George C. Scott was perfect as the gung ho war hawk.  He brayed, strutted, and played the butt kicking military man to the hilt and beyond.  This part was a harbinger of his most famous role as Patton, where he played essentially the same character without the tongue in cheek embellishments. And who can forget Slim Pickens, who is shown on the cover of the video box riding the nuke to ground zero, in one of the funniest and most famous scenes in the history of film.<br/><br/>This is one of the most creative, witty and effective lampoons ever done. It makes its point effectively by poking fun at people who take themselves all too seriously, and making us laugh at that of which we are most afraid. I rated it a perfect 10.  `AAAAAHooooo!'"

The greatest achievement is to make a truly horrific concept (the end of the world) absolutely riotous without being trivial.  From the names (Col. Bat Guano) to the red-phone scene (""I can be as sorry as you can, Dmitri""), to the depraved answer to the end of the world devised by Dr. Strangelove and accepted by the War Room crowd, the film is poignantly funny because the characters (who mirror common attitudes of the time and play it absolutely straight) have no idea how ridiculous they look.

After a paranoid general launches a full-scale nuclear attack on the USSR it becomes clear the ""commies"" have developed a Doomsday retaliatory device that can wipe out all life on Earth. Peter Sellers steals the show taking three roles (that would have been four if not for illness) including the concerned President of the US. But it is as the title mentioned Doctor Strangelove with which he will be most remembered; a wheelchair bound former-Nazi with an uncontrollable mechanical arm. Highly recommended for the greatest cinematic example of black comedy."

But back in the early 60s people had a genuine right to worry about the bomb, since this was the era of Vietnam, Cuba, Kennedy assassinations and a rapid build up of nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>However, rather than play a straight bat with loads of doom & gloom, moralising & hardnosed anti-war messages etc, Kubrick goes off at a tangent and plays for comedy - black comedy in fact.<br/><br/>And what we are rewarded with is a superb anti anti-war film. The messages are still there but they're not shoved in our faces. Instead they are subtly written into the humour which makes the film even more accessable because you then realise that even the people supposedly on ""our side"" do not always have our best interests at heart.<br/><br/>Sellers is of course a total revelation - better than the Pink Panther roles, this time he as three characters to stretch his considerable chameleon talent and not one of them is weak.<br/><br/>But it's not entirely his film, he is ably supported by George C Scott and Sterlin Hayden  - two American Generals who both seem to have their own agenda. The latter is the one who actually starts the attack on Russia because he is worried about his ""bodily fluids!"". While Scott is just as mad because he actually condones the other's actions, which says a lot about the mentality of the armed forces!<br/><br/>Slim Pickins, also deserves a mention as the pilot sent out to bomb ""those Rooskies!"" I especially loved the scene with him riding a nuke, which just adds to the dark humour.<br/><br/>This film is also quite superior to the other anti-war movie that came out at about the same time - FailSafe with Henry Fonda as the Prez. This film does play a straight bat - there is little or no humour, just serious expressions and lots of doom mongering. A very absorbing film, but perhaps not what the audiences of the time wanted in light of the all the real threats of war that hung over their heads.<br/><br/>Instead, they chose Dr Strangelove, the same message but coated in humour which at least gave some light relief for a couple of hours!<br/><br/>Sellers' best film by far. Kubrick's second best after 2001<br/><br/>

"brandonyork","10","1","1","16 June 2000"," Kubrick's _Strangelove_ is an imperative must see.
","In no other film has Kubrick displayed his deft use of irony and wit. While few of Kubrick's films could be considered ""klunkers,"" _Strangelove_ stands as his greatest work.  It examines many deeper philosophical questions, most notably the ethical question of mutually assured destruction."

","This is at once a comedy, a satire of the cold-war, and a chilling look at the politics underlying all wars.  It draws on the hysteria that was alive and well shortly after the Second World War, and the fear that was generated in the McCarthy era just as we defeated the Nazi Regime, and now faced the impending dangers of Communism. (As if this is a dead issue.  Just look at our Government's attempts at reviving the anti-missile missile program.)  I find this movie to be as fresh today as it was 36 years ago.<br/><br/>

The day after I saw it again, and suddenly it all became clear to me, and now I must say that this is his best movie, together with the incredible A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Just Dr. Strangelove himself is a classic. <br/><br/>                              Sellers is hands down incredible in the three parts he play and without the black & White coloring it wouldn't be the same.

"DeeNine-2","10","1","1","12 April 2000"," Kubrick's Best
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>This is the kind of film you can say is 'the best ever' and not look like an idiot, a comedy worthy of Voltaire or Cervantes, and a thriller to rival the best Hollywood ever produced. I'm willing to bet this movie will be remembered long after most of the movies of the Twentieth Century have faded to oblivion.<br/><br/>Kubrick's satirical masterpiece was made not long after, and keyed by, the publication of such serious, but absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's 'On Thermonuclear War' in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate. Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake. Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was discovered some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a 'nuclear winter' that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S. Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago. Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.<br/><br/>Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented. As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is wonderfully emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) philosophizing over his cigar on the importance of his precious vital fluids, and a frantic Capt Mandrake politely suggesting that what is going on is madness. This is followed by the out-of-change-for-the-phone soda machine scene with Corporal 'Bat' Guano (Keenan Wynn) who is more worried about the possibility of petty theft than the possibility of nuclear war.<br/><br/>Although this film would never have existed without the comedic genius of Terry Southern, major credit for its success must go to the actors, not only to Peter Sellars, who was magnificent, but to Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott who seemed to feed off of one another in a 'let's see you top this' flamboyant comedic style. Scott was later to win an academy award for his portrayal of Gen. Patton (Patton 1970)), but his work there owed a lot to what he did here as General 'Buck' Turgidson. By the way, all these 'meaningful' names and most of the hilarious dialogue are the work of Terry Southern, who also penned such sixties classics as Easy Rider (1969), Candy (1968), and The Loved One (1965), the latter from Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel about the funeral industry. Some memorable highlights:<br/><br/>Slim Pickets proving his intimate love for the bomb by riding down on it, like a cowboy breaking a bronco.<br/><br/>Russian Ambassador Sadesky (the name is, yes, an allusion to the Marque de Sade) explains why the Russians built the 'doomsday machine,' which would blow up the whole world: 'We couldn't keep up with (the expense) of the arms race, the space race, the peace race...' (Another prophetic observation, by the way.) We feared a 'doomsday gap' (a take-off on the then current buzz phrase, 'missile gap').<br/><br/>The scene at the hotel with Turgidson's girl friend/secretary in her bikini answering the phone and covering for him as though she is a producer's secretary warding off somebody he doesn't want to talk to. The audience knows the call's about impeding nuclear war, but she must pretend Turgidson is properly indisposed. <br/><br/>Peter Sellars as President Merkin Muffley talking to the Russian premier (Khrushchev) as an enormously patient, kindly father with a drunken son. Incidentally, Muffley's appearance was patterned after Adlai Stevenson, the democratic candidate for president who twice lost to Eisenhower in the fifties. Also note that a merkin is a toupee for the mound of Venus.<br/><br/>Gen. Ripper telling Mandrake how women sensed his power and wanted his vital fluids; and how a significant part of the commie conspiracy was to fluoridate our water and poison us (actually a real concern at the time by some fringe groups).<br/><br/>Second only to Pickens's bronco ride as a symbol of the movie is Dr. Strangelove's spastic salute to Hitler...<br/><br/>Finally I have to say that one of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that the concern was real. During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare. Kubrick, Terry Southern and cast are to be commended for showing us the incredible folly of the age of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction)."
"andreyev66","10","1","1","28 March 2000"," Kubrick's satiric masterpiece.
","A riotous, razor-sharp satire. Who knew (at that point) that Kubrick could be so funny? Peter Sellers shines in all three roles (although my favorite is Colonel Mandrake). Slim Picken and Sterling Hayden give the best performances of their careers. The only actor who refuses to play it ""straight"" is George C. Scott. Watching him bomb about the set as if he were in a burlesque sketch, one wishes Kubrick had reined him in and wonders why he didn't. Nonetheless, this film is a masterpiece and deserves to be seen and re-seen."

","Dr. Strangelove is probably the best comedy of the 1960's, possibly the best black comedy ever and certainly Kubrick's best film.

Kubrick has so many movies that are much better than this, in many aspects. If it was not for Sellers, I probably would not have finished watching it. The rest of the cast also contributed to my not giving it only 1 star. In short: mildly entertaining, but thanks to all of the highly praising reviews greatly disappointing."

I expect some colorful humor for an artist like Peter Sellers, the kind of jokes I'm used to enjoy from him, instead of this I just found some delirious characters without grace for my taste.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that you must feel identified with cold war, or feel somehow involved with military politics."

It is very difficult to appreciate the satire or message it tries to convey, when you don't live in a time of ""Cold War"", or constant Nuclear Threat. <br/><br/>You can imagine this being gripping indeed, coming off a scary historic incident like the Cuban Missile Crises, but it just doesn't hold that type of fascination in this day and age. <br/><br/>Finally, I must say the characters are annoying and the dialogue is painfully pretentious and irritating. <br/><br/>It is also a bit racist too, since the only person of color that I saw was James Earl Jones. I know it was 1964 and all, but that just underscores the irritating and never ending racism of America, and just adds another discredit to this painfully boring film."

","Dr. Strangelove must be the best political satire to have come out during the cold war era. As the president puts it to the soviet premier ""one of our base commanders went little funny in his head and did a silly thing"". Apparently the silly thing that president is talking about is that this commander ordered his planes to attack Soviet Union and drop the hydrogen bomb. As a deterrent, Soviet Union has a doomsday device which, if attacked, will automatically get triggered ending the world and both the processes are irreversible of course.<br/><br/>The conversation between the president and the soviet premier has to be one of the funniest that I have heard. The statement ""gentlemen, you cannot fight in a war-room"" should be taught in colleges as an example of irony. Peter sellers in a triple role is absolutely amazing. It is ominous, it is dark and it's hilarious."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","10","30","15 June 2006"," Overt Anti-Military Bias, But Funny
","Like ""Cool Hand Luke"" which followed several years after this and then other films of the mid-60s, this was another milestone in Liberal advancement in Hollywood movies. Here, instead the rebel, anti-authority hero exemplified in the above-mentioned film, here we see another theme that have been repeated endlessly since the '60s: the military as the enemy, as a bunch of gung-ho war-bent trigger-happy idiots who get sadistic pleasure out of needlessly killing the enemy. <br/><br/>Terry Southern, one of the big protesters of the '60s co-wrote this story with Stanley Kubrick and Peter George: not exactly three ""moderates."" The movie also pokes fun at those who opposed Communism, which helps explain why they investigated Hollywood in the first place.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, once you get past that agenda of the film, it's very entertaining thanks to funny characterizations by George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and others and by some excellent black-and-white cinematography. Peter Sellers plays three roles in here, but is best as the President of the U.S. <br/><br/>Scott, with an outlandish Patton-like performance (no wonder he got that role later on), is particularly good with his facial expressions as ""Buck Turgidson."" Hayden, meanwhile, was always a favorite from the 1950s film-noir days. There are some good facial closeups of him, too.<br/><br/>The ending of this movie is quite memorable, with Slim Pickens riding shotgun on a nuclear bomb as it descends. Now that is good, dark humor, punctuated by the tune ""We'll Meet Again"" as atomic bombs go off.<br/><br/>Very biased, but a funny and entertaining 93 minutes and photographed so well it's fascinating to watch for that alone."

He makes a ridiculous plot entertaining and enjoyable for an audience.<br/><br/>While it's never going to be one of my favourite performances from him (the Panthers and Being There take that position) this is a different side to him, and he excels.<br/><br/>Overall I'd recommend this film to people who have always wanted to see Peter Sellers in another role to that of the infamous Inspector Clouseau."

","I just watched this movie for the first time last night, after having heard for several years about how great it is. Obviously, you can tell by the title of the film that this will have a pretty strong anti-military and anti-nuclear bomb political stance.<br/><br/>Like another IMDb member said, it often seems that films that try to make a political statement are rated higher than they otherwise deserve to be. If Kubrick tried to make the opposite point (in favor of nuclear bombs, for example), I seriously doubt anyone would have seen this movie at all.<br/><br/>I tried to set aside my own political views as I watched this film so that I could better judge it on its own merits. Those who do the same will probably find out that this is only a mediocre film, filled with wafer-thin characters and overacting. The script is sometimes witty, sometimes funny, but often it misses the mark because it overshoots its intended target.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers' portrayal of the President of the United States seems to be the only characterization that makes its point without needing to go to the extreme. The rest of the actors (and characters) are way over the top in their performances, and I usually don't find this type of acting to be very funny or particularly impressive.<br/><br/>In summary, this film was just OK. I've seen better movies and better satires, and I don't agree with its current rating on IMDb. All things considered, I think this film deserves a 6/10."

","The side wanting peace and the side wanting war meets. Not really something we're not used to, but when it comes to attention to little details, such as two conflictingly subjected songs on the plane, it's quite clever of Stanley Kubrick. It might be the most sexual situations dropped into a war film, without becoming a Carry On film that was filmed at the same studio. I doubt Carry On has ever planned a film about nuclear bombs compared to space travel. Thank Peter Sellers for his experience from Goon Show? Overall, this film has some huge giggles, mainly involving some absurd situations. But even with the iconic and absurd shot of a pilot falling on a nuclear bomb, the drama therefore overshadows in a good way. Maybe the pie fight would have cheered up the drama, but that wasn't needed anyway.<br/><br/>Oh and how appropriate to include ""We'll Meet Again"" to stock footage of nuclear bombings.<br/><br/>This review is not dedicated to those funding Trident.

","The film opens with the most beautiful credits in cinema history - refuelling B52s as mating dragon flies. The satire starts with the descending chord sequence of the (hauntingly melancholic) orchestration of ""Try a little Tenderness"".<br/><br/>Biting cynicism informed by the rueful post-war scepticism and distrust of authority in British society gave rise in Britain to the zany humour of The Goons. Peter Sellers was a founder member of this group and is at the centre of this film in the 3 characters he plays. Sterling Hayden is unforgettable, as is George C. Scott and Slim Pickens. All of them deliver superb lines in one of the best and most humorous scripts of all time.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove himself makes one brief appearance just before the end, but it's the most devastatingly funny sequence of all in another matchless performance by Sellers, with maybe the funniest line in cinema history.<br/><br/>As a kid, I was haunted by the closing sequence. Apparently from a suggestion by Seller's fellow goon Spike Milligan, this takes a popular wartime song and gives it an altogether more poignant and sinister feel.<br/><br/>It's difficult to convey to anyone whose formative years came after the fall of the Berlin Wall just how paranoid the Cold War was. Everyone got on with their daily lives knowing that one false move and the world could be engulfed by nuclear Armageddon. ""Dr Strangelove"" attempts to reveal the insanity at the of the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction with mordant, biting satire. I like to feel that this film was part of a process which steered the world away from the apparent inevitability of Nuclear Conflict in the Cold War years, not least by pointing out just how banal and stupid it could be. Who knows? We made it this far, didn't we?"
"campbell-russell-a","10","3","6","19 April 2014"," It Never Dates and Never Will.
","This is without doubt one of the best films ever made. Its greatness can be gauged by the fact that it has never lost its punch even though it is set at the height of the Cold War. What keeps it so fresh?<br/><br/>Firstly, there is the performances of everyone in the cast. Sellers is astonishing and the rest of the cast also seems to have been inspired by the prospect of creating a masterpiece. George C. Scott was reportedly angry with Kubrick because he used Scott's over-the-top takes rather than his straighter ones but I think Stanley's instincts and understanding of the overall dynamics of the film led him to make the right decision. Scott's performance as the highly dangerous buffoon, Buck Turgidson, is unforgettable. Turgidson was apparently based upon a U.S. Air Force colonel, Curtis Lemay, and is a comment upon people who decide the fate of millions by relying on statistics. Slim Pickens replaced Sellers as Major Kong and this is indicative of how circumstances beyond even the control of the director can capture lightning in a bottle. Sellers had not relished playing the fourth role of Kong possibly because it required a Texan accent. After Sellers broke his leg after falling from the bomb, Kubrick sent for Pickens because he needed a real life Texan not just an actor who could pretend to be one. Pickens rides the bomb to its target like a rodeo rider whooping and waving his cowboy hat as only he could do it. He is the embodiment of a generation of ""cowboy"" generals and politicians and no doubt a percentage of the general public who seemingly relished the thought of ending the world in an orgasm of dimwitted enthusiasm for destruction of Ruskies and evil empires.<br/><br/>Perhaps what makes Dr. Strangelove most memorable and enduring is Ken Adam's sets – in particular, the war room. Adam was master of producing slightly ahead of their time sets and ones that isolated the subjects. They were little worlds which distanced their occupants and the audience from the rest of the world. Under the huge ring/dome of light the generals play a game of poker with the world at stake. <br/><br/>I would suggest that it is the script, written or improvised, that keeps people coming back to this film. The one line that jars with me is the one most people like to quote: ""You can't fight in here; this is the war room."" I find it the one obvious gag line in a film that never relies on gags. It relies upon most of the characters delivering the lines with a deep sense of belief. It is Major Kong's sense of duty and destiny that makes his line ""this is it; nuclear combat, toe to toe with the Ruskies"" at once funny and frightening. It is the mentality of those involved that needed to be seen in the light of comedy in order to see the enormity of the danger. It is this fine balance of dark comedy that is struck and maintained with no let up that is at the core of this masterpiece."

","Dr. Strangelove (1964)<br/><br/>Fail-Safe on crack, LSD, and steroids!<br/><br/>One secret to making a flawless movie is to make it so idiosyncratic you can't tell flaws from insights, weaknesses from flashes of innovation. Surely this movie has its weaknesses, and I know people who have seen it who like to point them out. Yes, it has sexist moments and silly ones, and maybe even a couple of slow ones. But really, it's so audacious and funny and tragic and ironic, who can say what is what, and why, taken whole?<br/><br/>What you can be clear about about is whether it succeeds, whether it stirs you. I know I'm moved and tickled every time, even if I groan sometimes, too. George C. Scott's performance is sometimes just too much, but then he does a backflip and my faith is restored. Hayden is such a stiff actor at his best, he is cast in the role of a lifetime here and comes through with dark absurdity. And Peter Sellers? Which one? Hilarious.<br/><br/>Made the same year as Fail-Safe (both are from 1964, the height of the Cold War), Dr. Strangelove, shows the further evolution of the insane directing genius of Stanley Kubrick. This is the first of his three great breakthrough movies that seem to be shamelessly new and fresh--2001 and A Clockwork Orange followed--and it really is breathtaking for its audacity. Dr. Strangelove is so utterly different in tone and yet so parallel in intent and background to Fail-Safe, it's just weird. Does it make light of annihilation? Does the military, and the President, look foolish? And Peter Sellers? Which one?"

","I have read many comments for this movie. Many of them say this movie is not funny, others say the movie is too confusing. I don't follow them at all, I say this movie is both.<br/><br/>The movie takes a very serious situation at the time of its release (nuclear war) and turns it into a satirical comedy.<br/><br/>The plot was interesting enough: A general goes crazy and sends planes to bomb the USSR. The problem is that if that happens, a doomsday device will trigger and destroy the world.<br/><br/>The characters were all well played and funny. Peter Sellers was particularly good in his 3 roles: As the nervous Captain Mandrake, the serious-toned President Merkin Muffley, and as the former-Nazi with the possessed hand, Dr. Strangelove. George Scott was particularly hilarious as the commie-hating General Buck Turgidson. Sterling Hayden was wonderful as the crazy, overly-determined General Jack D. Ripper. Keenan Wynn was hilarious as the suspicious, leader of the attack on Ripper's base, Col. Bat Guano. Slim Pickens was hilarious and well placed as the cowboy-type pilot, Major King Kong. I could keep going with all the great performances but I don't want to make this comment pages long.<br/><br/>The effects were excellent providing this was in 1964. Many cannot appreciate the effort gone into making such a movie as this.<br/><br/>Kubrick has created a classic and it will always remain so.<br/><br/>10/10."

","Dr. Strangelove is one of the rare movies that are so well done that they become great movies despite their astonishing simplicity. A simplicity that reveals by the same time a subtle complexity. The movie, part of Stanley Kubrick's most remarkable work, is gorgeous by the intelligence of the direction, the scenario and the cast.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick had just begin his career of director/producer in the industry when he did Dr. Strangelove and, even if he was young at the time, we can feel the incredible genius of the director by the way he conducts the story along the movie. The shots and especially the lightnings make the scenes of that picture unforgettable and rich of quality.<br/><br/>The tale is pretty simple, it turns around the situation of an unwanted nuclear attack of the USA in USSR. A situation pretty funny but that was realistic in those years and this is what make the movie so blackly funny. Many sides of the situation are shown with different settings and characters which is brilliant. Globally, the scenario is gorgeous, a so intelligent tale despite as it been said it's simplicity and subtlety.<br/><br/>One of the major remarkable points about that film is the performance of the actors, all of them are astonishing including of course Peter Sellers, who is playing for me the greatest performance(s)of his whole career. James C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also leading well played roles and are both wonderful.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is a movie that looks to get better by each passing year and, more than 40 years after it's release, we can still laugh and admire that wonderful movie that won't take a ride for the next hundred years. It is truly a universal masterpiece of cinema, and arguably one of the better movies of the cinema history."

Shot with specially hand grounded film lenses in Black and white is shot with exquisite cinema-graphic effect and masterful blocking of scenes and editing characteristic of direct and cinematographer Kubrick is set in the early sixties, when the film is actually made, and contains state of the art military technology of the age of the classic cold war between Russia and the United States of America.<br/><br/>A general Jack D. Ripper, the late Sterling Hayden, in charge of an American Military Air base which controls the tactical strategic nuclear armed bomber air squadron invokes a special clause in the USA strategic defense policy which sets off a pre-emptive nuclear strike against Russia.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers plays several very memorable in not now famous roles in the film one as the president of the USA, Merkin Muffley, who desperately tries to recall the attack with the assistance of the Russian president from the safety of the USA war room. Sellers also plays a British Officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, at the military air force base who tries desperately to contact the President with the recall code needed to prevent the attack caused by his Commanding General Ripper. Sellers also plays an ex Nazi Scientist, Dr StrangeLove advises USA president of how the human races will endure and survive a nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>This film is outrageously hilarious and at the same time a completely serious study of the inherit problems of a fail-safe Nuclear arsenal in those troubling times of the Cold war arms race. A very memorable film for those who grew up in the shadow of the Nuclear Mushroom cloud and still relevant to the current generation. Like most of Kubrick's films its worth seeing repeatedly and if you don't get a little chuckle from it or even intellectual stimulation then I suggest you stick to Australian films. Truly Great Cinema."
"Tweekums","10","3","6","16 June 2008"," A Cold War Classic
","The cold war may have ended years ago now but this film seems both as funny and as dark as ever, with a great cast that includes Peter Sellers playing three different characters; RAF Group Captain Mandrake who is on attachment to the US Air Force, President Merkin Muffley and the eponymous Dr Strangelove, a former Nazi scientist now working for the US government.<br/><br/>The action starts when General Jack D. Ripper orders the B-52s under his command to attack the Soviet Union, he does this because he believes that ""the evil commie plot of water fluoridation"" caused his impotence.<br/><br/>Once the authorities learn what he has done they assemble in the War Room to discuss how to prevent the planes dropping their nuclear payload on Russia. This includes both attacking Gen Ripper's airbase in an attempt to force him to give the recall codes and inviting the Soviet ambassador to the War Room to warn the Soviets and assist them in shooting down the planes.<br/><br/>When the Russians are called we learn that they have just built the ultimate deterrent; a doomsday machine that will automatically detonate if Russia is attacked, unfortunately they have neglected to tell the world as they wanted to make a surprise announcement at a party conference in a few days.<br/><br/>The other location in the film is one of the B-52s flying into Russia, it is captained by Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, played by Slim Pickens in wonderfully over the top form.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't sound likely material for comedy but it works wonderfully as almost all the characters appear to be slightly insane yet somehow it is possible to imagine that people like that could rise to positions of power as their insanity only shows after the attack has been launched. This is particularly true of General ""Buck"" Turgidson played by George C. Scott who is more worried about the ""Commies"" seeing the war room than at the prospect of global Armageddon.<br/><br/>While the film is almost constantly amusing the ending will send a chill down the spine of most people as we see the nuclear detonations while Vera Lynn sings ""We'll Meet Again"". These detonations aren't special effects but real footage of explosions which as the film is in black and white look almost as if they were done for the film."
"Rumjal","10","3","6","29 January 2008"," Dooms day machine is not a joke
","I saw this movie when it was in the theaters as the opening show to the main feature which was ""From Russia with Love."" At the time, I did not realize that its characters were describing a real dooms day device that could be and perhaps has been made. I see from the comments that your readers do not realize this either. Mankind now has the knowledge to build a device to destroy the Earth forever.<br/><br/>This film is NOT about a nuclear war: it is about a nuclear war in which a nuclear doomsday machine has been detonated, hence the end of the world. Further, it is clear from other comments that IMDb readers do not realize this distinction and do not realize that the world can be destroyed: I quote: Times Online August 08, 2007 Dr Strangelove and the real Dooms day machine by Christopher Coker P. D. Smith DOOMSDAY MEN The real Dr Strangelove and the dream of the super weapon 552pp. Allen Lane. £20. 9 78 071 399815 3 ...Smith's study is the gripping, untold story of the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, which first came to public attention in 1950 when the Hungarian-born scientist Leo Szilard made a dramatic announcement on radio: science was on the verge of creating a Doomsday Bomb. For the first time in history, mankind would soon have the ability to destroy all life on the planet. The shock wave from this statement reverberated across the following decade and beyond.<br/><br/>What Szilard had in mind was the third of the ""alphabet bombs"" that came to characterize an entire age. The first, the A-bomb, had been used to incinerate two Japanese cities. Teller's H-bomb blasted its way into public consciousness a few years later. Finally, there was the ultimate weapon: the C-bomb, a hydrogen bomb that could ""transmute"" an element such as cobalt into a radioactive element about 320 times as powerful as radium. A deadly radioactive cloud could be released into the atmosphere and carried by the westerly winds across the surface of the earth. Every living thing inhaling it, or even touched by it, would be doomed to certain death. In the autumn of 1950, Szilard's fears were given independent validation by Dr James R. Arnold of the Institute for Nuclear Studies in Chicago. Arnold, slide-rule in hand, had started out to debunk Szilard's arguments. He finished by publishing a set of calculations that showed that a Doomsday device, perhaps two-and-a-half times as heavy as the battleship Missouri, could indeed be built...<br/><br/>The Cobalt bomb was largely forgotten after the Cuban Missile Crisis came and went. So too disappeared the fear of a Doomsday machine that could not be overridden by human intervention. Only after the Berlin Wall had been breached and the ice of the Cold War had begun to thaw did military analysts realize the Russians had actually built a version of the device. The details of this top-secret Soviet system were first revealed in 1993 by Bruce G. Blair, a former American ICBM launch control officer, now one of the country's foremost experts on Russian arms. Fearing that a sneak attack by American submarine-launched missiles might take Moscow out in thirteen minutes, the Soviet leadership had authorized the construction of an automated communications network, reinforced to withstand a nuclear strike. At its heart was a computer system similar to the one in Dr Strangelove. Its codename was Perimetr. It went fully operational in January 1985. It is still in place. Its job is to monitor whether there have been nuclear detonations on Russian territory and to check whether communications channels with the Kremlin have been severed. If the answer to both questions is ""yes"" then the computer will conclude that the country is under attack and activate its nuclear arsenal. All that is then needed is final human approval from a command post buried deep underground. It would be a brave officer, adds Smith, who, having been cut off from his superiors in the Kremlin, could ignore the advice of such a supposedly foolproof system.<br/><br/>Bruce Blair has speculated that President Bush's September 2001 proposal for a new generation of weapons, including the robust nuclear earth penetrator, or ""bunker-buster"", might be intended to knock out the underground command post that controls the system. The Bush administration withdrew its request for funding for the program at the end of 2005, after facing fierce domestic opposition. Some military analysts, nevertheless, believe that research is continuing into these weapons. We all face the prospect that, if Russia were ever attacked, its strategic nuclear warheads could be launched by a computer system designed and built in the late 1970s. Those of us who think Dr Strangelove to be the most telling commentary on the nuclear age should not be surprised. To paraphrase the novelist J. G. Ballard, old or not, the system remains a vivid demonstration, arranged for our benefit by the machine, of our own as a species. http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25350-2648363,00.html See also http://www.slate.com/id/2173108/pagenum/all/#page_start In addition to this, there is the problem recounted in an article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that when scientists created the atomic bomb, they calculated the odds at about one chance in a million that such an explosion would end the world by starting a chain reaction in which sea water would separate into hydrogen and oxygen and ignite, turning our planet into a star and our solar system into a binary star system. But those calculations are now old and should be redone with a modern computer.<br/><br/>These details need to be included in a special features section of the DVD so that viewers will not assume that this film is a mere cold war relic with no modern relevance."

"Hannibal_Chigurh","10","3","6","28 October 2007"," The Greatest Comedy Ever Made
","Dr. Strangelove came at a time when the Cold War came closest to turning hot. Both the United States and the USSR kept building more and more missiles in case of attack. Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film pointing out the insanity of the Cold War. While adapting the novel Red Alert, he realized the best way to do so was to make a comedy out of it. Stanley drafted satirist Terry Southern to help turn the thriller into a black comedy. What resulted was the greatest piece of satire ever put to film.<br/><br/>As if Terry Southern wasn't enough, Kubrick managed to secure Peter Sellers, the most talented and versatile comedic actor since Charlie Chaplin and perhaps ever. Sellers played three roles (it would have been four if he hadn't broken his leg trying to play Major Kong): the RAF officer Lionel Mandrake, US President Merkin Muffley, and the mad German-born scientist Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>The film begins with General Jack D. Ripper (see if you can spot that joke), played by Sterling Hayden, sending the planes under his command to nuke their designated targets in Russia. He can do so thanks to a provision that allows officers to ordering nuclear bombings instead of relying on the president. Meanwhile the President meets with chiefs of staff in the War Room to countermand the order. The only general who really speaks is Air Force General Turgidson, played masterfully by George C. Scott. The only downside of having Peter Sellers in the movie is that Scott's work goes often unappreciated. His facial and body language is so animated, hilarious and perfect that I devoted three viewings to focusing on it.<br/><br/>The film adds a third setting: one of the bombers sent into Russia. The captain of the plane is Major Kong, portrayed by Slim Pickens, who filled in when Sellers couldn't pull it off. To my knowledge Kubrick never told Slim it was a comedy, so he plays the straightest role in the film. The film constantly switches from the plane, the War Room, and Ripper's base, which is under fire from US troops trying to arrest Ripper.<br/><br/>While the film has only a few quotable lines (chief of which being ""You can't fight in here, this is the War Room), every scene has something, either spoken or visual, that gets laughs. As Us troops fire upon fellow soldiers at Ripper's base, a giant sign that say ""Peace Is Our Profession"" stands behind the action. When the president brings the Russian ambassador into the War Room early on, it sparks many gems (including the aforementioned quote). He also sets up the phone conversation between the president and the premier of Russia, which is one of the funniest phone calls ever put to film. Taken out of context, none of it is amusing, yet when presented against the backdrop of the threat of nuclear holocaust, the trivialities and pleasantries are hysterical.<br/><br/>While Mandrake and the president have more lines, the best character Sellers portrays is Dr. Strangelove, a former Nazi scientist who has since become an American citizen and a weapons researcher for the US. Sellers' mannerisms and inflections will have you gasping for air.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove does retain the thriller aspect of the film's original intent. However, as the comedy darkens one can predict the outcome of the film. People call this Kubrick's only comedy, but I think that's not true. Stanley applied this kind of dark, vicious humor to nearly every film he made after that. Full Metal Jacket is loaded with it. A Clockwork Orange in a sense is a dark comedy, only one that deals with crime, punishment, and the government's symbiotic and mutually parasitic relationship with the media. Dr. Strangelove remains his pure comedy, though, and like all Kubrick films, pushed the genre it was made in to new heights. This was my first Kubrick film and I immediately became a fanboy after it. This remains my second favorite film behind Apocalypse Now. It's still just as relevant today as it was back then, and it's also just as funny."

","Comedy is the ability of man to laugh when all he can do is cringe in terror, and Stanley Kubrick's beyond-black, so-black-it-stings comedy is at the top of the list of the funniest films ever made. Considering its subject matter -- world annihilation -- this is pretty risky stuff, considering it was made at a time when the Cold War was no laughing matter and at anytime someone could decide it was time to see if those pesky missiles would work. It shot Stanley Kubrick to the position of a Director as God, and from then on, his sporadic work would produce masterpiece after masterpiece. DR. STRANGELOVE: OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB is a fantastically cold, ironic, and masculine movie, but it's precisely this kind of detached, deadpan humor that makes it so outrageous. There are few moments that can't be considered iconic in cinema history -- truly, Peter Seller's ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room! "" quote has gone down in history as one of the most absurd lines ever uttered, but his own little rendition as Dr. Stangelove, which hearkens to the mad scientist in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS who can't seem to control his cybernetic arm is comic genius at its most bizarre. However, Slim Pickens has the best exit scene in the entire film in a scene anyone familiar with Chuck Workman's VISIONS OF LIGHT or countless film montages detailing key moments in cinema in the Twentieth Century: his riding the bomb into destruction (that brings forth the end of the world as Vera Lynn sings ""We'll Meet Again"") is the stuff that nearly fifty years later has not been equaled."
"JamesHitchcock","10","3","6","2 June 2006"," A Brilliant Satire on the Obsessions, Vanity and Inanities of Political and Military Leaders
","General Robert E Lee allegedly said that it is well that war is so terrible, otherwise we would all become too fond of it. The first half of the twentieth century appeared to have proved him wrong; new forms of warfare were invented, more terrible than anything known in Lee's day, without diminishing mankind's love of armed conflict. Until, that is, the invention of nuclear weapons. Surely, it was argued, the consequences of a war fought with such weapons would be so terrible that only a madman would think of starting a war between two nuclear powers. ""Dr Strangelove"" identifies a flaw in this theory. What would happen if a madman were ever in a position to start such a war? <br/><br/>The madman in this case is Jack D. Ripper, a US Air Force General who orders the B-52 bombers under his command to attack the Soviet Union. By the time his superiors discover what he has done it is too late to recall the planes, which can only be done by sending a message using only a special code known only to Ripper himself. When it is revealed that any nuclear attack on the Soviet Union will trigger a ""doomsday machine"" that will destroy all life on earth, the President, Merkin Muffley, is forced to reveal the impending attack to his Soviet counterpart and to offer the Soviets all assistance in shooting the planes down.<br/><br/>As the names of the General and the President might suggest, Kubrick decided to treat this scenario as a satirical black comedy rather than as a serious drama. (Other character names include General Buck Turgidson, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, Major ""King"" Kong, Colonel ""Bat"" Guano and Dr Strangelove, formerly Merkwuerdigliebe, himself). The idea was to satirise not only the theory of nuclear deterrence but also those figures in the political, military and scientific establishments whose attitudes he saw as fuelling the arms race.<br/><br/>Three of the characters, the President, Strangelove and Mandrake, are all played by that great comic actor Peter Sellers. (The inspiration may have been the British black comedy ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" in which Alec Guinness also takes on multiple roles). The three roles are very different. President Muffley is an ineffectual liberal unable to control his military chiefs, well-meaning but essentially comic. Strangelove, the President's scientific adviser is a sinister, wheelchair-bound figure, an ex-Nazi with a strong German accent. He is said to have been based on several historical figures, including Edward Teller and Henry Kissinger, but to my mind he bears the closest resemblance to Werner von Braun, famously described by Tom Lehrer as ""a man whose allegiance is ruled by expedience"". Like Braun, Strangelove has difficulties in deciding whether his allegiance is to America or the Third Reich, and he has a similarly insouciant attitude to the military applications of his scientific work. ""If the rockets go up, who cares where they come down"".<br/><br/>Mandrake, Ripper's British liaison officer, is a caricature of the stiff-upper-lipped English officer and gentleman. He uses understatement to an absurd extent, describing his wartime experience of torture at the hands of the Japanese only as ""not a pretty story"". Although he may seem mildly ridiculous, however, Mandrake is the only military officer on display who is not barking mad. Colonel Guano is an obstreperous, thick-headed functionary of the ""only-obeying-orders"" school. Major Kong, the commander of the one plane to breach the Soviet defences, is a gung-ho Texan who sees himself as a flying cowboy, even wearing a cowboy hat in his plane. This role was originally due to be a fourth role for Sellers; in the event it was played by a veteran Western actor, Slim Pickens.<br/><br/>The two maddest characters are Sterling Hayden's Ripper and George C Scott's Turgidson (both brilliantly played). Ripper is the ultimate conspiracy theorist, the incarnation in military uniform of every saloon-bar maniac who tries to persuade you that Princess Diana, President Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were assassinated by the forces of international freemasonry. Ripper orders the attack on Russia because of his own pet theory, originally developed to explain away his own impotence, that Communists are attempting to ""impurify our precious bodily fluids"". Turgidson, as manic as Ripper, urges the President to order all-out nuclear war. Like Mandrake, he is a master of understatement (he describes the results of a nuclear war as ""getting our hair mussed""), but his understatement is not the result of emotional reticence but of a refusal to confront the awful reality of what he is proposing. Scott's performance seems to prefigure his portrayal of another obsessive General in ""Patton"".<br/><br/>Everyone will have their own favourite memories of the film. Mine is probably the scene where Mandrake, attempting to telephone the President with the vital recall codes, is hampered by a lack of small change and by Guano, who refuses to break into a soft-drinks vending machine, but there is also the punch-up between Turgidson and the Soviet Ambassador (""Gentlemen! You can't fight in here! This is the war room!""), the scene where the whooping Kong rides a falling bomb like a rodeo rider and the hilariously inappropriate use of music. (""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" for the bomber scenes, ""We'll Meet Again"" for the final shots of atomic explosions).<br/><br/>Kubrick was undoubtedly right to make this film as a comedy. A serious drama would today look like an old-fashioned Cold War period piece. (Who now remembers ""Fail-Safe""?) ""Dr Strangelove"" is both of its time and timeless. Although some of its shafts are aimed at the politicians of the day (Turgidson's concern about the ""mineshaft gap"" parallels Kennedy's attacks on the Eisenhower administration over a supposed missile gap), it remains a brilliant satire on the obsessions, vanity and inanities of political and military leaders. We can all think of examples of what happens to foreign policy when we allow it to be dictated by the Buck Turgidsons of this world. 10/10"

Ripper feels hat the Soviets first ant to corrupt the natural fluids or essences of the American people and then, when thats accomplished, take over the USA without firing a shot. Ordering the 843rd Air Wing, which Gen. Ripper is in command of, on a bombing mission in the USSR the General feels that he has to stop the Soviets for doing any more damage to those vital and precious fluids, that flow through the bodies of the American people, before it's too late. It takes a while for those in the US Government authority, from the president of the United States on down, to realize that Ripper has gone off the deep end but by the time they came to that realization it was too late to stop him. The 34 B52 bombers that he ordered to take off with 50 megatons of nuclear explosives each, are by then well on their way in igniting WWIII. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's terrifying 1964 black comedy, made two years after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, based on the little known book ""Red Alert"" by Peter George ""Dr. Strangelove"" is without a doubt one of the most effective anti-war as well as the most shattering movie about nuclear destruction ever made. When trying to recall the B52 bombers, after they passed their fail-safe points, becomes futile US President Merkin Muffely, Peter Sellers, gets in touch with the Soviet Premiere Damitri Kissoff. Premiere Kissoff who's drunk and partying, in what seems like, a bordello is asked to work together with the USA in shooting down the attacking B52's. This has to be done before they drop their payloads on his country's missile and defense bases. <br/><br/>Too drunk and agitated to do anything at first Premiere Kissoff agrees with Pres. Muffley to cooperate. By the time that the US bombers were to strike deep inside Russia all but one were either shot down or recalled. The recall order was discovered by RAF Group Captain Mandrake, again Peter Sellers, who was the British liaison officer at the Brupelson Air Force base. Mandreke discovered and deciphered the order after Gen. Ripper shot himself. Gen. Ripper feared he'd be captured and tortured in order to get the recall code out of him, when the base was overrun by US Airborne troops. <br/><br/>It later comes to light that the Soviet Union had developed a ""Dooms-Day Machine"" that is set to go off and destroy the entire earth with the force of 50 hydrogen bombs. All that's needed to set it off is for just one nuclear device to be dropped on the Soviet Union! Which the only surviving B52, that hasn't been shot down or recalled, commanded by Major Kong, Slim Pickens, is just about to do! <br/><br/>Tense and nail-biting final with everything being done to stop Maj. Kong's B52 bomber from succeeding in it's mission. With Maj. Kong and his crew doing everything to make it succeed. The ending will have you on the brink of a nervous breakdown like it does to everyone on the screen with the possible exception of crippled and mentally unstable Dr. Strangelove, Peter Sellers again for the third time. Dr. Strangelove a former Nazi scientist and now the Pentagon's director of weapons research is really looking forward to this once in a lifetime event. He's so excited by it that he actually gets up from his wheelchair and like he says, in a total state of euphoric hysteria, ""Main FUHRER! I Can VoK!"". <br/><br/>With all the great performances in the movie it was George C. Scott's General ""Buck"" Turgidson who really stole the show as the pragmatic and at the same time paranoid military man. Gen. Turgidson was always looking ahead first to obliterate the Soviet Union an now that the cats out of the bag, with no chance of stopping the runaway B52's from their mission, try to have the USA control all the worlds mind shafts; in order to survive the impending nuclear holocaust."

","I almost fell out of my chair when I saw the ratings for this movie. There must have been something I missed. I thought the movie was terrible. I didn't laugh once and what comedy was intended ended up being irritating to watch. To me, real comedy to me is White Chicks and Nutty Professor (Eddie Murphy version). The overwrought and over-the-top acting ends up being annoying instead of amusing. Although less than 100 minutes in length, it took me three nights to get through this garbage and even then I couldn't finish. With 4 minutes left in the film I thought I had enough. I really didn't understand what the movie was about. It is so dialogue heavy as to put you to sleep. I can't believe this is the same person who directed Spartacus and 2001.

","If ever asked to describe ÒDr. StrangeloveÓ one could sum it up in<br/><br/>one word, STRANGE!!!!  Although this movie expresses a great<br/><br/>deal of creativity, itÕs Cold War theories and strategically placed<br/><br/>sexual references may be hard to understand without the proper<br/><br/>knowledge of the Cold War. 	ÒDr. StrangeloveÓ is not a historical movie.  It was not made to<br/><br/>depict the real life events of the Cold War.  None of the events were<br/><br/>actual events that happened during that time.  Although many of<br/><br/>the movies events have strong links to the Cold War.  During the<br/><br/>Cold War J.F.K received a long, strange message from Nikita<br/><br/>Khrushchev, who seemed to be slightly drunk.  Although ÒDr.<br/><br/>StrangeloveÓ almost exactly imitates this historic event, the film<br/><br/>was made to poke fun at the nuclear problems America had<br/><br/>during the 1960Õs. 	ÒDr. StrangeloveÓ may be one of movie histories best films, but itÕs<br/><br/>like pulling teeth trying to watch it.  If someone had lived during that<br/><br/>era of time or understood the events the film was based on, Ò Dr.<br/><br/>StrangeloveÓ may seem appealing to them.  But for the others not<br/><br/>educated about important historical events and are born after the<br/><br/>1960Õs, they may find themselves asleep throughout the movie. <br/><br/>	This film may have been one of the  most clever and creative films<br/><br/>of itÕs time, but today it may be lost amongst all the action packed<br/><br/>movies, staring young pop culture icons, with gimmicky story lines. <br/><br/>This reviewer rates ÒDr. StrangeloveÓ a 4 out of 10 for a good movie<br/><br/>during itÕs time period.

","Dr. Strangelove I thought was an interesting movie. It was black and white, which was kinda boring but it did have a lot of very good points. The idea of this movie and its viewpoints were incredible. I believe that anyone that had lived in THAT time period would have understood the movie completely and gotten every situation of satire. However, me being 15 years old really didn't understand many of the jokes about government and about war. I wouldn't have found many of them funny/ironic if it wasn't for Mr. Black explaining them all. I would buy this movie, put and it away, and maybe watch it again when I'm older. I would probably understand it better then. It did keep my attention some of the time, mainly at the end. Dr. Strangelove was a very interesting character. It was funny how all of the the people in the government really thought that they would be able to work out this problem. Their ideas for survival were ridiculous and this is what made the movie much more entertaining. A lot of the movie was related to something sexual which captured a lot of peoples attention as well. The men in the government knew that if the bomb hit then the ""doomsday"" device would go off the whole world would be blown up. Still they were trying to think of solutions to what they would do if this did happen. When we as the audience all knew they would all die. This ironicness keep my attention for most of the movie. But again, if I was watching this myself on my own time I probably wouldn't have understood most of it. I'd give this movie about a 4/5ish rating."

","I came to ""Dr Strangelove"" after watching the alternative contemporary movie based on the same source novel, the super-serious ""Fail Safe"", which may have been a mistake on my part. It probably didn't help either that I've been lately tracking down and watching other Cold War political thrillers of the era. I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't quite get Dr Strangelove, heretic as that may appear given its prestigious reputation.
I understand too that its anti-war message perhaps had more relevance and resonance to its original audience which had just gone through the whole Cuban Missile Crisis scenario, but for me the message here overcame the medium with Kubrick using a bazooka to crack open these particular nut(case)s.
I love Peter Sellers and of course he ably demonstrates his comic versatility and mastery of his craft over the course of the three roles he plays but just like Slim Pickens, George C Scott and Sterling Hayden his fellow-crazies, the characterisations used are just too broad, blunt and overpowering. I also found the running gags centring on sexual innuendo just too crude and obvious.
I do recognise that some of the scenes have become iconic like Pickens riding the missile down to destruction and Sellers gradually more deranged title character at the end plus I love the last line of the movie even if I suspect more of Sellers improvisatory skill than Kubrick's directorial hand in it.
However I can't escape my conclusion that the movie seems overrated and more of a museum piece at least to my eyes."

","This is another timeless movie that will never lose it's relevance. From the opening sequence of the titles superimposed on a film of a bomber and a tanker performing the unnatural act of midair refueling, (Ask any Air Force pilot how difficult, dangerous and frightening it actually is!), to the final sequence of atomic explosions, (both with totally appropriate music), this movie is a joy to watch over and over again. From the great character names with their sexual and scatological overtones, (for those who don't know these things, guano is the word for bird or bat droppings, and a merkin is a hairpiece for the pubic area), to the sets, the cinematography, the music, the lighting, and even the props, this is Kubrick at the top of his form. As far as the performances of the ENTIRE cast go, I'm not sure there're enough superlatives in the English language to do them justice. Peter Sellers playing three entirely different roles, (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove), and making it look effortless takes center stage, of course, but the supporting cast is just as strong. George C. Scott (General Buck Turgidson) shows that he's one of the most versatile actors who ever hit Hollywood and almost steals the show in the process. Sterling Hayden (Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper) plays the scariest psycho ever put on film with impeccable deadpan timing. Keenan Wynn (Col. ""Bat"" Guano) is also superb, as is Slim Pickens (Maj. T.J. ""King"" Kong). Let's not forget Peter Bull, (Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadesky), who put just the right amount of wacky paranoia into his part. Even the bit players, Tracy Reed (Miss Scott, Gen. Turgidson's sexy, seductive secretary and mistress and the sole female), James Earl Jones (Bombadier Lieut. Lothar Zogg) in his first movie, and Shane Rimmer (Co-Pilot Capt. ""Ace"" Owens) add to the unique flavor of this masterpiece. So, for $1,800,000.00 plus Stanley Kubrick, the world got: Some of the funniest lines of dialog ever put in a movie, including words like ""prevert"" and phrases like ""Precious bodily fluids"", ""Now you listen to me, Colonel Bat Guano, if that is your real name!"", ""If you try any preversions in there, I'll blow your head off."", ""Gee, I wish we had one of them Doomsday Machines, Stainsey."", ""Well, I've been to one world fair, a picnic, and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I ever heard come over a set of earphones."", "" Of course it isn't only physical. I deeply respect you as a human being. Someday I'm gonna make you Mrs. Buck Turgidson. Listen, you go back to sleep. Bucky'll be back there just as soon as he can. All right?

Kong going over the contents of the survival kit and ending it by saying, ""Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff!"", Gen. Turgidson describing a B-52 flying at treetop level, with great body language, the Soviet Ambassador attempting to photograph the War Room with a spy camera, Col. ""Bat"" Guano shooting the Coca Cola vending machine and getting Coke sprayed in his face, and Dr Strangelove's ""alien hand"" alternately trying to strangle him and shooting up in a Nazi salute.

","At Burpelson AFB, Gen. Jack D.

Months of drinking nothing but rainwater and grain alcohol, not to mention denying the women in his life his ""essence,"" apparently went to his head.<br/><br/>On one of the B-52s Ripper sends out, Maj. T.J. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens) dons his cowboy hat and tells his men folks back home are counting on them to see this through: ""That goes for every last one of you, regardless of your race, your color, or your creed.""<br/><br/>As Kong's plane approaches its target, his progress is observed worriedly in Washington D.C. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries diplomacy with a drunken Soviet premier, while Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) suggests going through with a full-scale attack.<br/><br/>""I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolph Hitler,"" President Muffley says.<br/><br/>""Perhaps it might be better, Mr. President, if you were more concerned with the American people than with your image in the history books,"" Turgidson replies.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove,"" like the War Room where much of it is set, is a cold and imposing work of art, impressive though distancing. As a film of its time, ""Strangelove"" is arguably Kubrick's most important work, a cultural crossroads between nihilism and pop where anything goes, and everything does at the end. All that, and it's pretty funny, too.<br/><br/>Sellers plays three roles, though his antic comic energy is largely tamped down with two of the characters, Muffley and a RAF officer assigned to Ripper's base. His third character, the titular Dr. Strangelove, is a wonderful Germanic riff and the film's zaniest figure, though the farthest removed from events at hand. He's all for war, but whether that's because he's as mad as the others or trying to make the best of a bad situation is left unclear.<br/><br/>I don't love ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and there are things about it that grate, like the long inventories and protocols we see in the B-52. Scott has his great moments as the unwound Turgidson, but overacts shamelessly in others, which Scott blamed on his director. Keenan Wynn as a colonel named Bat Guano is stiff, too, but Sellers is very good and Pickens and Hayden even better, playing their roles straight with just the slightest sense of irony. (I think both knew they were in a comedy.)<br/><br/>For a film about mutually assured destruction, there is a nice MAD magazine sensibility to this film, in the goofy names and outré situations, that fits the mood of the times and makes this an enjoyable black comedy. The jokes hit their targets, and points are made without deference to a particular ideology, as hawks like Turgidson and doves like Muffley both take fire. Kubrick made films liberals love, but he himself wasn't a true believer of any stripe, and it shows here.<br/><br/>The best part of ""Strangelove"" for me is the titles sequence, showing B-52s refueling in flight. Even after you get the joke behind it, there's still something to those remarkable images, an aerial ballet perfectly synchronized with the Pablo Ferro titles and a violin-heavy rendition of ""Try A Little Tenderness,"" that strikes a chord deep inside.<br/><br/>Maybe the chord struck by the rest of the film is not so in evidence anymore, but ""Dr. Strangelove"" is still a good comedy and valid social commentary worth watching."

One person even complained it was not like a Mel Brooks film! May I suggest Austin Powers films for that person?<br/><br/>Folks, it's a BLACK COMEDY. That does not equate to slapstick. It's a -bit- more intellectual than that. The best black comedies contain material that is at once both comedic and horrific. And -every- 'joke' in this film contains a huge dollop of horror. Riding a bomb down to the ultimate explosion, declaring 'Gentlemen, there's no fighting here, it's the War Room!', discussion of the ratio of sexually stimulating females to males in coal mines, etc. All of these references are made in the spirit of black comedy - funny, yet horrifying and tragic. Even the alternative title 'How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is based on the terrible worry most people had about atomic war in the 60's. Kubrick knew this and played with it, and did it better than most.<br/><br/>As to the films impact, consider this: Every new US president since this film have asked to see the 'war room' soon after the inaugural festivities were over. There -is- no 'war room'. Kubrick/Terry Southern invented it. Sure, there is a 'situation room' at the Whitehouse, but no grand war room as seen in the film. No one can forget the 'war room' of Dr. Strangelove after seeing the film.<br/><br/>In typical Kubrick fashion, the details of this film are overwhelming. The B-52 that Kong flew was still very much classified in 1964. Kubrick hired the best avionics experts to design what they thought would be a nice replica of a strategic bomber, filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of control panels and real avionics devices. It was so real that Kubrick and Columbia had talks with the FBI about the release of the film. It was just a bit TOO accurate for the intel folks. Kubrick, Southern and Wally Veevers were determined to create a film that was as accurate as possible. 2001 continued this Kubrick tradition, with excessive attention to detail in every possible way.<br/><br/>So, if you are looking for slapstick comedy mayhem and hijinks, try another film. This film was intended for adults seriously worried about the possibility that the world would be incinerated in an accidental war, in a world run by kooks and ideologues. Black comedy allows us to look at a terrifying subject without leaving the theater in a total funk. If you want a film about this subject with no black comedy, try Fail Safe, a film that premiered at about the same time. It's a great film, but lacks the charm of Kubrick and Terry Southern."

","""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) is an iconic satire about the consequences of nuclear war and arms race. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>It is important to remember that Dr. Strangelove is a movie from 1964 and was thereby released soon after the culmination of the Cuba Crisis two years earlier. At its face value, it is a slow-burning feature filled with a unique, dark and time-stamped humor when all things are considered. Expect a lot of dialogue with over-the-top patriotism and prejudice against communists, with a few scenes and conversations sprinkled with a hint of sexuality.<br/><br/>Going deeper into the movie however, this was a very real threat that was closer to explode than what most people think, and it that light, Dr. Strangelove is... quite something. Some will find it tedious with clumsy special effects, and other will find it an intriguing reflection of a tense era, capsulated in an hour and a half.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a peculiar 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb revolves around the theme of war. The film presents the theme of war with sharp comedy coming from interesting and well-developed characters, all this provides for an entertaining experience in one of Kubrick's masterpieces.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove came out just after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the film presents the fear of MAD and just how easy it is for everything to fall apart. However the film is more about the way war is handled, we see those who are afraid and make decisions they think are right and suit their morals, however those decisions have greater ramifications for others. We see soldiers following orders, and how realistically the soldier is not the one who should be held to blame, but rather those who deliver the orders in the first place. And finally we see how the leaders of war handle war, Kubrick displays this in the war room, where he shows the audience that the leaders are not exactly capable of handling the situation at hand. Overall though, Kubrick displays the childish nature of war and how the actions of others lead to a much larger consequences and how it affects the innocent bystanders. On the other hand Kubrick shows the audience the reality of war and it's volatile nature. And this is what makes Dr. Strangelove so successful, it shows the two sides of war using sharp comedy along with interesting characters and a plot that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. <br/><br/>Peter Sellers and George C. Scott delivered superb performances, with Sellers playing three characters in the movie, George C. Scott is perfect in the film and everyone else was great as well. The directing from Kubrick is amazing and he writing is excellent. Dr. Strangelove is a superb comedy classic everyone should watch. 10/10."

","A movie that's insanely satirical and extremely poignant even 50 years after it's making.<br/><br/>Wow, firstly mention of the great genius Stanley Kubrick who perceived this film like no one has including the writer of RED ALERT, the novel on which the movie is based on. He created a character of Dr. Strangelove that is not there originally in the book and took it to a level that only Kubrick can be attributed the credit.<br/><br/>Now, this is a war movie with a part of war being shown in reality and in fact the whole war crew terminology is shown in heavy detail especially by those in that warplane who communicate mostly in numbers. So even how they speak is made fun at. Having said that, this movie has a serious undertone which I believe was kept aside to ensure that this was comical more than being serious. The tone is a threat of the cold war and what if USA and Russia come to war, it would be a loss of whole humanity itself. <br/><br/>Now, this is taken on it's own by Peter Sellers, one of the best comedians who has held the silver screen post the Chaplin-era and he plays not just one, but three principal characters all of them, extremely different in terms of looks, accents, roles and even the way they walk. Now, to take it up as a challenge and to bring in subtleties and portray them as they are is something that only Peter Sellers could have pulled off. Oh, what a great cast this was by using Peter Sellers for 3 roles. <br/><br/>The whole set design is just authentic and so is that airplane cockpit design that has too many details to make us feel even silly to be listening to pilots slang. It was all intentionally done by Kubrick and yes it was a laughter ride all through, even when explosion took place. <br/><br/>It's stupendous in all departments and thanks to Stanley Kubrick, the master for giving us a film as great as this. It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest satirical war movies that how many ever satires can come on war, this will hold it's own place and way above from others."
"Desertman84","10","2","4","27 February 2012"," A Timeless Cold War Movie
","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, commonly known as Dr. Strangelove, is a black comedy film which satirizes the nuclear scare. It was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, starring Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, and featuring Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, and Slim Pickens. The film is loosely based on Peter George's Cold War thriller novel Red Alert, also known as Two Hours to Doom.<br/><br/>The story concerns an unhinged United States Air Force general who orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. It follows the President of the United States, his advisers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. It separately follows the crew of one B-52 as they try to deliver their payload.<br/><br/>In 1964, with the Cuban Missile Crisis fresh in viewers' minds, the Cold War at its frostiest, and the hydrogen bomb relatively new and frightening, Stanley Kubrick dared to make a film about what could happen if the wrong person pushed the wrong button -- and played the situation for laughs. Loaded with thermonuclear weapons, a U.S. bomber piloted by Maj. T.J. ""King"" Kong is on a routine flight pattern near the Soviet Union when they receive orders to commence Wing Attack Plan R, best summarized by Maj. Kong as ""Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!"" On the ground at Burpleson Air Force Base, Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake notices nothing on the news about America being at war. Gen. Jack D. Ripper calmly informs him that he gave the command to attack the Soviet Union because it was high time someone did something about fluoridation, which is sapping Americans' bodily fluids (and apparently has something to do with Ripper's sexual dysfunction). Meanwhile, President Merkin Muffley meets with his top Pentagon advisers, including super-hawk Gen. Buck Turgidson, who sees this as an opportunity to do something about Communism in general and Russians in particular. However, the ante is upped considerably when Soviet ambassador de Sadesky (Peter Bull) informs Muffley and his staff of the latest innovation in Soviet weapons technology: a ""Doomsday Machine"" that will destroy the entire world if the Russians are attacked.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove's jet-black satire and a host of superb comic performances have kept the film fresh and entertaining, even as its issues have become less timely.This landmark movie's madcap humor and terrifying suspense remain undiminished by time.Stanley Kubrick's brilliant Cold War satire remains as funny and razor-sharp today as it was in 1964 - its year of release."
"sashank_kini-1","9","2","4","26 August 2011"," An American Classic shot in London
","Dr Strangelove is one of the comedies whose true potential can be realized only by the end of the film and perhaps after subsequent viewings. The movie starts off with a hummable tune and planes on the screen, before which a narrator briefs us about Russia's mysterious doomsday weapon. The movie gives a satirical spin to one of the coldest, most fearful times in history- the Cold War, specifically the Cuban Missile Crisis. However, not much is required to get an overview of the theme for those not knowing much about the crisis aka Me.<br/><br/>The film is about USA and USSR's deal to avoid any nuclear warfare as it may result in a cataclysm. Stanley takes a situation where the jingoism of the General, the lack of communication and procrastination in decision making leads to a cloudy end for all. It's highly avant-garde for a film of the 60s, and Stanley Kubrick executes it like a perfect soufflé that unfortunately has to burst since that's the ending- bleak and disturbing, resonating with the music 'We'll Meet Again'.<br/><br/>Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (named aptly after the famous serial killer) vehemently orders US planes to attack USSR, to prevent contamination of his bodily fluids by 'fluoridation' (!!) and this causes a panic in the Pentagon, with the US President trying to sort things out with an inebriated USSR President while being constantly jibed and detracted by General Buck Turgidson (again aptly surnamed!), who is a chauvinistic Nationalist with deep-rooted hatred towards Commie Russkies. This leads to a short brawl between him and the Russian ambassador which is so unparliamentary (or is it??) and chaos in the Pentagon. Jack D.Ripper meanwhile detains Group Captain Mandrake who has to listen to all his bull while trying to extract the three letter code that will connect them to the planes to detract them from taking offensive action. A parallel plot involves Major Kong trying to take down enemies with his crew in an immaculately constructed cockpit. One of the most beautiful aspects of the film is that the overacting is never overacted. Nearly every character is loony and yet has to be credulous enough to sustain the believability of the plot. In fact, Stanley Kubrick wisely decided to do away with the alien plot which would give the film a supernatural angle. Instead, we have a character displaying alien hand syndrome (Dr Strangelove), which makes him go berserk towards the end. <br/><br/>The performances by the actors are terrific. Peter Sellers has to sell 3 characters and throughout the film one never finds sameness in the three roles. The quivering President who has so much to do now and can't do much due to the rigid policies gives a more subdued performance. Yet, the funniest part is when he talks to the USSR President to say ""No, I'm more sorry"" ""I'm fine. We are all fine"" etc. The second is Major Mandrake who incredulously asks the lunatic General ""Sir, when did you come up with this theory of fluoridation?"" and the funniest is his exchange with the officer towards the end of his plot line, where the chemistry gels so well – ""Just shoot at the damn machine"" he says, with the other officer replying ""Okay, but if you can't get to the President, you'll be answerable to Coca-Cola!""LOLOL!!! Genius!!<br/><br/>The third character is the Nazi-sympathizer Dr. Strangelove who talks about the alternate plan where humans will have to live underground for 100 years and breed like dogs (1 man – 10 women!). I think Stanley wanted to kill the audience since I almost died with laughter by the end. And the best part is that all the characters are dead serious. Another scene-stealer is George C. Scott whose best moments are the facial contortions that he does to show fragrant disapproval and suspicion. Also his interaction with his fiancé in the midst of an important discussion is crazy hilarious. Sterling Hayden is great, and I wonder how he could control his laughter while speaking about fluoridation and 'bodily fluids'. Slim Pickens suits his character to a tee, and his classic line is the 'Vegas' one. <br/><br/>I wasn't particularly impressed by Stanley's The Shining, since I found it too verbose but the writing over here is fluid, humorous, brainy and inoffensive. Kubrick's direction is pitch-perfect and highly impressive since he didn't get much help from Pentagon. Since I have the DVD, I got the pleasure of seeing the making of the film and an appreciation of Kubrick. <br/><br/>Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is an American classic, and was rightfully included in many of the AFI's lists. In short, its bloody brilliant. 9/10"
"jzappa","9","2","4","26 December 2010"," For a Chess Player, He was One Hell of a Filmmaker
","Kubrick's cynical vision of the progress of technology and human stupidity assumes the delighted impression of a film that got away with something. LBJ was in the White House, the Republicans were priming Goldwater, both sides considered the Cold War with bleak gravity, and the world was learning to get used to the term ""nuclear deterrent,"" which meant that if you kill me, I'll kill you, and then we'll all die. ""Better dead than Red,"" several believed. Others believed the reverse. The options were not attractive. The Bomb eclipsed foreign policy.<br/><br/>Then the great BAFTA-winning expatriate's masterpiece of satire, paranoia and straight comedy released with the power of a splash of ice water. What Kubrick's Cold War send-up illustrated was not men reliant on machines, but vice versa, particularly the mad Gen. Jack D. Ripper.<br/><br/>Proceedings on Ripper's army base are interconnected with scenes aboard one of the B-52s, and with an urgent assembly in the Pentagon's War Room, still one of the most unforgettable sets ever built for a movie, with its immense world maps impending over a vast committee with an undaunted sphere of light above it.<br/><br/>The screenplay, by Terry Southern with Kubrick and Peter George, twists this premise into a black farce, clarified by bursts of sharp satire. Some of the dialogue has penetrated our lexicon. The scene at the telephone booth between Guano and the British ambassador, who doesn't have the correct change to call the White House and save humankind, is one of the movie's most exceptionally brilliant gags.<br/><br/>If Sterling Hayden creates a scowling, unreasonable Gen. Ripper, George C. Scott is inspired as his foil, Gen. Buck Turgidson, who chomps gum, gnarls his mouth, and discloses one statement of dire straits after another to the President. And Sellers, as president, has a succession of awkward hotline exchanges with the Soviet Premier that slashes nuclear annihilation to the degree of an excruciating social faux pas.<br/><br/>The defining passage on a subject so crushingly unpleasant that all one can do is laugh, Dr. Strangelove has the highest form of verbal humor: The self-destruct device self-destructed, we learn, and you can't fight in the War Room. And counter to the theoretical deliberations in the Pentagon, there's the uncomplicated nationalism of the B-52 pilot, Maj. King Kong, who assures his crew there's going to be upgrades and streamers everywhere. His departure from the story stays one of the most recognized moments in contemporary cinema.<br/><br/>The one part of the film, still one of the finest political satires, that doesn't quite succeed is the War Room sequence that comes between Pickens' rowdy ride and the ultimate nuclear montage. Sellers, as Strangelove, quarrels riotously with his disobedient bionic hand, yet the dialogue doesn't seem to go anywhere, and the scene feels peculiarly unproductive. In an earlier shot in the War Room, we've seen an elongated table covered with cakes and pies, and it's understood Kubrick meant to end the scene with a pie fight. Dr. Strangelove would've been perfect if he kept in the climactic pie fight. That's true brilliance. Without it, the film truly does feel as if it's missing a final scene.<br/><br/>Regardless, seen after over half a century, like a morbidly sick Looney Tunes short it feels extraordinarily crisp and unsullied, a lucid, impudent, treacherous lampoon. And its eagerness to pursue its scenario to its commonsense close has an integrity that today's spineless gift-wrapping mechanics would almost certainly sidestep. Its black and white photography aids, moreover, putting an unembellished visage on its lethal political absurdities. If movies of this derision, cleverness and rancor were still being made, the world just might be better at staying on its toes."

","There has never been a more biting and prescient satire on mainstream American film than Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, a black comedy about nuclear annihilation. In the face of this sober reality Kubrick and co-writer Terry Sothern's scenario provides an endless parade of petty buffoons in power played out by a veteran cast of actors who give career performances.<br/><br/>Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has gone rogue on his commanders and put into place a plan to attack the U.S.S.R. with nuclear bombs. When Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a timid British officer gets hint of the problem he brings it to Ripper's attention who locks down the area and shuts down communication with the outside world in order to assure fruition to his plan. In an underground bunker President Muffley (Sellers) debates with the Russian Ambassador on how to avoid mutually assured destruction. As ideas are tossed around Dr. Strangelove (you guessed it) offers the most radical. Meanwhile back at the base Ripper lectures Mandrake on the theft of precious bodily fluids.<br/><br/>Strangelove clicks on all cylinders in perfect harmony. The story is audacious in its presentation given perfect breadth by the darkly comic life like caricature richness of type with the cold dark oppressive neon light sets and compositions of Kubrick's claustrophobic and sterile world providing ironic staging to the serious and hilarious goings on.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers deserves the triple crown for his trio but George C. Scott, Peter Bull, Slim Pickens, Keenan Wynn and especially Sterling Hayden in the time they are allotted hold their own with him though it must be said Kubrick's wide angle and framing does decidedly add to each performance. <br/><br/>Acclaimed overwhelmingly as a classic upon its initial release nearly fifty years ago Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove has lost none of its luster over that period and I'd like to believe it says more about the flawless assembly of the film than civilization. But given these times with nukes in the hands of world leaders that literally match the caricatures created by Kubrick and Southern it is clear little has been learned in that time. It does show however that Kubrick was well ahead of us in realizing it."
"antonjsw1","10","2","4","15 April 2010"," An excellent comedy about the stupidity of nuclear weapons
","Our political leaders would be well served if they watched this.<br/><br/>It brilliantly highlights the stupidity of nuclear weapons. Kubrick's visual style is more obvious, but interestingly its performances that really shine. Sellers is truly magnificent, at his ad-libbing best. From the straight US President Merkin Muffley to the exasperated RAF Officer Lionel Mandrake, to the absolutely crazy Dr Strangelove. However, what is amazing about this film is the excellent performances by other actors, notably George C Scott as Captain Turgidson, Slim Pickens as Major Kong and of course Sterling Hayden as a hilariously unhinged General Jack D Ripper. Satire permeates the movie, from the character's names through to the whole situation itself of unauthorised use of nuclear weapons to the implied jingoistic attitude of the senior US Air Force officers such as the Turgidson character. The narration is clear and efficient, and the structure of the plot is incredibly well put together and moves along at great pace, with a variety of twists to keep the tension up until the films crazy climax.<br/><br/>Technical credits are impressive, bearing in mind the films modest $2 million budget, and the fact that the film was made entirely in England. It grossed about 4 to 5 times that amount. Laurie Johnston's music though used subtly works very well, Gilbert Taylor's Black and White cinematography together with Kubrick's trademark camera-work, is excellent, as is Ken Adam's production design and Anthony Harvey's editing. Most notably creation of the cockpit and interior of a B52 is really impressive. Smaller parts, particularly the rest of the crew of the featuring B52, come across well, as does the Russian Ambassador played by Peter Bull. Optical effects by Wally Veevers are also solid.<br/><br/>All in all a crazy but accessible comedy that gives you something to think about"
"trogdor74","10","2","4","28 March 2010"," The most horrific comedy film ever produced
","I remember the first time I saw a Stanley Kubrick film was 2001: A Space Odyssey. I was completely at a loss of words from the pure style of the film and it was instantly my favorite film.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick also became instantly my favorite director because his style was so genius. However, I felt it odd that he be my favorite director if I'd only seen one of his films so I hunted down some of his other ones. Then, I saw Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>The film is a black comedy where a man named General Ripper decides to send off a multitude of air-crafts to bomb Russia and kill them once and for all. These ships are unable to be recalled unless one has a special radio code to call them back with. General Ripper cuts off all communication with his base and throws the U.S. into a nightmare which they desperately try to avoid.<br/><br/>The thing that really hits home about this film is that everything that happens during its course is possible, especially during the Cold War, during which the film was fabricated. The entire time you're laughing your ass off, you are suddenly being interrupted by how extremely terrifying the situation is. Nothing could possibly hit home harder.<br/><br/>This film is brilliant on so many levels. One of its most notable aspects to me is how it so seamlessly the film blends absolute horror and absolute comedy. In fact, the film was so effective in its dramatic elements that I barely even recognized that it was a comedy at first. I mean, I knew that it was supposed to be a funny film but even today, everything in that film hit right at home and terrified me. When I saw it again, I felt like I was going to explode with delight and laughter. The gags are some of the most memorable of all film and for their time were extremely daring. Although, every time I watch it, there's still something about the pure situation that the story goes through that disturbs me.<br/><br/>The gags, as I've said before, are purely brilliant. Perhaps the most brilliant is the running gag of General Ripper (Sterling Hayden) and his obsessive quest to burn down the ""commies"" to stop their evil conspiracy to polute ""our precious bodily fluids."" This man is so insane that you can not possibly take him seriously. He is a parody of the standard politician who somehow manages to tie together completely unrelated things and form some kind of disturbed conspiracy, leading to pure idiocy and collapse. In all actuality, he reminds me of Glenn Beck in several ways or at least what Glenn Beck would've been like during the Cold War.<br/><br/>Another brilliant gag comes from the president trying to appease the Russian president while explaining to him that they've accidentally sent several ships to destroy their country. Not only that, the Russian president is completely hammered and unable to make reasonable judgments. The entire conversation proceeds like a train wreck from hell and is probably one of the most brilliantly written scenes of all cinema.<br/><br/>There are so many incredibly funny moments in this film that I could not possibly list them all and part of what makes this film what it is is Peter Seller's excellent performance, or performances.<br/><br/>Peter plays three people in this film; The President of the United States Merkin Muffly, General Ripper's group captain Lionel Mandrake and the hilarious Nazi Scientist Dr. Strangelove, from which the film derives its title. Every single one of his roles are funny for different reason. His president of the united states is just great as a mediator but a completely unsuccessful leader, him as Lionel Mandrake, the nervous officer who understands the complete absurdity of General Ripper but is unable to escape from it due to a lack of will and his memorable Dr. Strangelove is a ridiculous parody of the nazi scientists we paired up with during those times. Without him the film would've just been another comedy.<br/><br/>George C. Scott also does a terrific job as a disturbed Military General whose only goal is to cover themselves up so they aren't hated by the entire world (""I'm saying only 10-20million killed, tops!""). Most every performance in this film is of grade-a quality.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is brilliantly written, directed and acted on all levels and is one of the best comedies ever made. It is also an extremely intelligent satire on politics and the several political issues of the time which, to an extent, still mirrors the political issues of today. I highly recommend this film."

"truehammer","10","2","4","25 February 2010"," One of the greatest black comedies ever made
","Stanley Kubrick was a man before his time, his movies resonate years after he made them, particularly regarding A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey but although 'Dr. Strangelove' is also a film which has aged well and could apply to the ongoing global conflicts of today it must have been a much more terrifying prospect so shortly after the Cold War when the US and Russia were flexing their atomic muscle and appeared to be on the brink of all out nuclear warfare. Dr. Strangelove is a parody of that situation and a political and military satire.<br/><br/>The movie started out as a novel, 'Red Alert' by Peter George which Kubrick intended to adapt into a serious feature film closely following the book which was a drama/thriller rather than a comedy, however whilst writing the screenplay Kubrick found much of a story about two nations threatening to wipe each other off the planet so ludicrous the scenes were almost unintentionally funny. So he decided to tweak it into a black comedy which intentionally went out of its way to highlight how ridiculous the situation was.<br/><br/>In the film's plot an army general named Ripper (played brilliantly deadpan by Sterling Hayden) has lost his marbles and gone rogue, making use of the ill-advised 'Plan R' which has been created for the possibility that Washington is bombed and the country's leaders are killed allowing a lower ranked military commander to order a nuclear counter-strike. However Ripper has 'exceeded his authority' and gone ahead regardless.<br/><br/>The film mostly takes place in just three sets: Ripper's office where he's passively holding a British RAF exchange officer Lionel Mandrake hostage, a B-52 plane which has been sent on orders from Ripper to drop the bomb in Russia and 'The War Room' in The Pentagon, where the President Merkin Muffley is in conference with the country's leaders, including General Buck Turgidson (George C Scott), who's ideas include just starting an all-out offensive on Russia that will destroy 90% of their nuclear capability and will only result in 10-20 million killed, tops. Muffley is informed by Soviet Premier Dmitri that if the planes drop an atomic bomb on Russia it will set off a 'doomsday device' which will destroy every man, woman and pigeon on the face of the earth. The rest of the movie follows the inept leaders trying to figure out ways to avoid the nuclear Armageddon that awaits.<br/><br/>Peter Sellars plays three roles, the British RAF officer Mandrake, President Muffley and the films most eccentric character (and he has plenty of competition) Dr. Strangelove, from whom the title gets its name. All three are completely different and each played to perfection by Sellars. Mandrake is upper-class and terribly polite, his obvious discomfort with the insane Ripper is hilarious as Ripper tries to explain his theory of how the 'Commies' are trying to impurify his 'precious bodily fluids' by sabotaging the drinking water. Some of the punchlines are thrown out so deadpan by Ripper that if you're not concentrating properly on what he's saying you might miss the joke, which might be a problem for those without much of an attention span.<br/><br/>Muffley is a mostly seriously character although his extended monologue with the drunk Russian Premier (not heard) is one of the funniest bits of the film as they try to each convince each other how sorry they are. Turgidson plays off him well as the big kid who is finally getting to play war for real, apparently Scott was upset Kubrick was pushing him to overact but it certainly works in the context of the film.<br/><br/>Finally Dr. Strangelove himself, who provides some of the most obvious laughs and although in only two scenes is probably the most memorable character in the film. He is a former Nazi scientist who specialises in armed warfare, confined to a wheelchair he seems to have a bizarre case of 'alien hand syndrome' which causes him to occasionally give a Nazi salute during a moment of excitement, only for him to wrestle it under control with his other hand. He also calls the president 'Mein Fuhrer' mistakenly.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant satire and although not obviously funny it makes you laugh in a slightly disturbing way, like this is how we're all gonna die one day so lets have a good laugh about it while we're still here. Sellars should have won an Oscar here for me, I'm not certain who won it that year but they couldn't have done a better job than he did, he was given a free-reign by Kubrick and much of his dialogue is ad-libbed and its noticeable in some of the funnier moments where he appears to just come up with something hilarious on the spot, if you are extra observant you will notice fellow cast members struggling to hold in their laughter. George C Scott also shows his incredible talent which was later fully exploited in 'Patton'. As a self-confessed Kubrick fan, this isn't quite my favourite of his but its up there and one of the best black comedies you'll ever see.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Larry41OnEbay-2","10","2","4","31 December 2009"," 4 Star comedy & logic. If a ''nuclear deterrent'' destroys all life on Earth, what is deterred?
","The screenplay was written by Stanley Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George was based on the novel by Peter George named ""Red Alert."" You'll notice in the opening credits there is a typo where they accidentally left off the ""d"" so it reads """"Base on the book Red Alert by Peter George."" An early version of the script started with extra terrestrials observing earth in the wake of a nuclear holocaust, at that time the film was to be called THE DELICATE BALANCE OF TERROR. In 1964, with the Cuban Missile Crisis fresh in viewers' minds happening just 15 months earlier, the Cold War was at its frostiest, and the hydrogen bomb relatively new and frightening, Stanley Kubrick dared to make a film about what could happen if the wrong person pushed the wrong button – the result  DR. STRANGELOVE - is widely regarded as the screen's greatest satire, a film that superbly encapsulates the fear and paranoia of the Cold War. There is not a sequence in the film in which the dialogue is not quotable. But what really captured audiences was its depiction, however comic it may have been, of what many considered an entirely plausible scenario it could happen! As an inside joke Kubrick started his own production company and named it Hawk Films! Peter Sellers, our star or should I say three of our stars tonight. After serving in the Royal Air-Force in WWII he was only able to get a job in radio when after several failed auditions, when he struck upon the idea of calling a BBC producer, posing as one of the network's top actors. So Sellers gave Sellers an enthusiastic recommendation, and he got the job on the Goon Show! In 1964, his best year, he appeared in this film, THE WORLD OF HARRY ORIENT, THE PINK PANTHER & A SHOT IN THE DARK (a sequel to the Pink Panther.) Sellers was paid 1 million dollars to make DR. STRANGELOVE which was more than half of the films budget, he plays Group Captain Lionel Mandrake / President Merkin Muffley / Dr. Strangelove. Sellers actually improvised much of his dialogue as he developed each character. Major King Kong was intended to be Sellers' fourth role, but he was uncertain about the cowboy accent. Slim Pickens, a character actor from westerns, was brought in by Kubrick, who reportedly didn't tell him the film was a comedy. Pickens' patriotic speeches to his crew (and his promises of promotion and medals) are counterpoint to the desperate American efforts to recall the flight. Pickens was never shown the script nor told it was a black comedy; ordered by Kubrick to play it straight, he played the role as if it were a serious drama - with amusing results. ""Nuclear combat! Toe to toe with the Russkies!"" ''Dr. Strangelove's'' humor is generated by a basic comic principle: People trying to be funny are never as funny as people trying to be serious and failing. The premiere of Strangelove was moved from November of 1963 after JFK was assassinated and one line of the film had to be re-dubbed when Slim Pickens says, ""Heck a fella could have a good time in Dallas – you hear his voice say Vegas – but his lips still say Dallas. George C. Scott was reputedly annoyed by the fact that Stanley Kubrick was pushing him into an overacting performance, even though his work on the film is now regarded as some of his best work on-screen. Although he vowed never to work with Kubrick again, Scott himself came to regard this as one of his favorite performances. Paying special attention to the tics and twitches, the grimaces and eyebrow arching, the sardonic smiles and gum-chewing it's an amazing performance. Scott was an ex-marine, ex-fighter, big drinker, troublemaker so Kubrick invited him to play chess while the crew was setting up Scott got beat every time and learned to respect Kubrick and his strategy. Sterling Hayden plays Gen. Jack D. Ripper. Kubrick asked for the War Room's giant round table to be covered with green felt, Kubrick wanted the actors to ""feel like they were playing high stakes poker."" The only female seen in the film Tracy Reed is the stepdaughter of director Carol Reed and cousin of actor Oliver Reed. She plays Scotts secretary and can also be seen as the centerfold in the Playboy magazine the crew is looking at on board the B-52. And if you look quick you'll see she's covered by a copy of a book titled, ""Foreign Affairs."" The original ending was supposed to be a huge pie fight but after they filmed it Kubrick admitted it did not work so another ending was made using actual pictures of above ground tests, no mushroom clouds were created by special effects. Just a note about the character names used in the film (Ambassador de Sadesky, Col. Bat Guano, Premier Kissoff, Lt. Lothar Zogg) almost all of them have a double meaning and sexual connotation. Even the opening and closing shots of this film have sexual over tones, but what the heck we are all adults here and we know if we ever allow WWIII to happen we are all (fill in the blank!) Kubrick made what is arguably the best political satire of the century, a film that pulled the rug out from under the Cold War by arguing that if a ''nuclear deterrent'' destroys all life on Earth, it is hard to say exactly what it has deterred."
"gascichx5","9","2","4","26 May 2009"," Brilliant film
","This is an extremely funny film. But after my own analysis and reading some of the negative comments on here I came up with two reasons as to why people may not find this funny.<br/><br/>1.) It's outdated. This movie was made with the backdrop of the Cold War and impending nuclear holocaust, and is a satire about just that. Kids growing up these days, or even ten years ago, have no concept of what it was like during the 50's and 60's.<br/><br/>2.) It's such a great comedy, that other films and TV shows have stolen its jokes. Like all great works of art, they are imitated to some degree. Jokes from this movie have been used to death by other mediums, and I think that makes them lose their effect if seen in this movie.<br/><br/>Having said those two things, I didn't grow up with the threat of nuclear holocaust and I've heard the retelling of Dr. Strangelove's jokes, but I found this movie to be absolutely brilliant. Peter Seller's jumped to one of the top 3 of my favorite comedic actors. Every actor was fantastic. The writing was brilliant, and all the characters add the hilarity that ensues in this film. The story was great and extremely ridiculous, but still plausible, especially for that era.<br/><br/>Overall, a tremendous film by one of the greatest directors of all time.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"ambrosewriter","10","2","4","3 January 2009"," It's The End of America
","Most everyone in film, taking a film class, or a serious viewer knows the wonderful end sequence of this movie. For those of you who don't, I won't tell you, but suffice it to say it is a symbol of the death of the American and America. This movie is positively, absurdly hilarious, but comedy aficionados know that it doesn't contain any fantastic one-liners or puns, but it's a masterpiece of black humor. This film is one of Kubrick's best outings and it entertains. The more you watch it the better it seems, but like most movies it is best watched in one uninterrupted sitting. Great movie about MAD and a pessimistic social commentary (that makes you laugh). 'Dr. Strangelove' would be a good use of about $15 (depending on which version you purchase) and if you don't want to buy, rent!"
"johnnie0168","10","2","4","6 July 2008"," Fasten your seat belts
","I had the unusual experience during the mid sixties of seeing this movie and 'a hard days night' as a double feature, which were common in those days. What was less common was to see two outstanding movies in one setting. That night I became a Beatles fan as well as a Stanley Kubrick fan. I had never seen a movie quite like 'Dr Strangelove' before or since. This was style AND substance and a whole lot more. It was one of those rare cinema experiences that pulls you right into the story. You are THERE in the cockpit of that B52 making that unauthorized bombing run over the Soviet Union and you are THERE riding that bomb out into cold empty space with Slim Pickens. (who was, by the way, a highly unlikely but equally highly effective choice for that role). Kubrick had a storytelling style unique to himself and no other director with the possible exception of Elia Kazan. One device that comes to mind is, not only his use of the right music to fit the scene but his use of stony silence to fit other scenes. A silence that imparted a sense of awesome distance and space - a device that was to be used a few years later in '2001: a Space Odyssey', another Kubrick classic. This is not a 'happily ever after' ending and may be disturbing to some but fits very well with the uniqueness of the story - and the man."
"vovazhd","10","2","4","20 December 2007"," Satirical masterpiece
","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is one of Stanley Kubrick's most critically and publicly acclaimed films. It is a political and social satire about nuclear war. When a United States general orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, the President scrambles to cancel the attack and mutually work things out with the Soviet Union. Negotiations seem to work, until it is realized that there is a Doomsday Device implemented to automatically counter-attack any nuclear hits. Needless to say, things become complicated.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the greatest strengths of the film; all the characters are finely crafted and acted flawlessly. Peter Sellers does his legendary performance in three roles (Dr. Strangelove, the President, and Group Captain Mandrake). I do wish that Dr. Strangelove had more screen time; seeing that he was the title character, I expected a bigger influence from him onto the plot. Mandrake was a solid comedy character and the President had a believable, political image. Performances from other actors were also great. George C. Scott as General Turgidson was commendable; his paranoia and fights with the ambassador were classic. Slim Pickens was simply fantastic as the bomber pilot Major Kong, seething with a heavily pro-American mindset.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of Dr. Strangelove are also a strong point. The camera angles and cinematography are excellent. The scenes all have the same dark comedy mood in them. Although there was extensive dialog, it never felt overwhelming. The decision to use ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" as music for the bomber scenes (with no music used elsewhere) was a good choice. There are many nuances that fill even the smallest holes in the movie, and each character is meticulously detailed.<br/><br/>The message is perhaps the most important part of the film, especially when focusing in the context of its release date (during the height of the Cold War). It is basically a satire of mutual destruction, but carries other intriguing implications. There is a lot of sexual imagery, although it is hidden as a second layer to the main plot (although it is mentioned in Dr. Strangelove's ending speech). The whole conclusion was epic and hilarious, and wraps things up just like it should.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece that is rightly praised. In my opinion, it is Kubrick's second best film, and perhaps the greatest comedy movie ever."

","OK. I saw this movie ten- twelve times in my life. I bought maybe four or five copies in my almost 30-years-old life, because I used to borrow this movie often, to friends or to some girls that I thought they were interested to Kubrick. every time I spended my money good, and I am coming from an Italian region known for its ""difficult to spend money"" a kinda of Scottish-Italian situation. but I think that even the worst money keeper in the world could not resist to buy a copy of this movie. black and white, Peter Sellers covering three parts, doc Strangelove, the President of USA and an English soldier with honor and truth. the atomic bomb is the excuse to make a movie, a funny movie, a quote of brothers Marx lifestyle, everything, even the worst word in the world, war, is a joke. the movie before the release, was based on a non-funny book. but Kubrick is our father and brother, he did never hide is feeling, and I agree with him when fools generals and lieutenant over, stupid people with dangerous toys. this movie is pure entertainment, and is talking about human being, a kind of fortune teller that knew already the power of destruction that live in our mind. peace on earth use to write the general Ripper, played by that extraordinary actor who worked even in The Killing of Kubrick.there was an extraordinary noir, but strangelove is more than a movie. Is the voices of a director that did understand in the past how we stopped to learn and love the bomb. this one is one of that movie that I am gonna bring with me when I will live on a desert island"
"smorris-29","10","2","4","14 November 2007"," Dr Strangelove - a Masterpiece.
","The film is brilliant, upon several levels. Peter Sellers portrait of Group Captain Mandrake is excellent, he slightly distrusts the USAF officers, but his comments about the Japanese...'but they do make such good cameras!' still rings true, nearly 50 years later. The film needs watching a fairly large number of times - try to look at the file George C Scott has on his knee in 'The War Room' (OK, it's 'World Targets In Megadeaths), or goggle as Col 'Bat Guano' refuses to use his M1 carbine to blow open the Coke machine to allow Mandrake to get change to phone the White House to try and avert nuclear holocaust. 'That is the property of the Coca-Cola Corporation...' As to water fluoridation? Well, I'm a dentist, so I think it's all a Commie plot, and I'll stick to 'pure grain alcohol'. Trivia...they had to re-record Slim Pickens' listing of the contents of the B52 'emergency kit'. Originally, he quipped 'a pretty good w/end in Dallas', but JFK's assassination occurred B4 release, so he went back into the sound studio and dubbed 'Vegas' instead. 100% recommend. My favourite film of all time. Dr Steve Morris"

","Great dark comedies are few and far between, but we'll always have ""Dr. Strangelove"" to watch! It's easily one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Once again, Peter Sellers shows us why he's one of the great comedic talents to ever grace the silver screen. He plays three very different characters here, and each performance is brilliant. George C. Scott is also fantastic; he's perfect for his role.<br/><br/>What's so amazing about this film is that everything is equally funny and scary. The actions of the characters seem so ludicrous, but there's another side of me that feels like some of this could have actually happened during the days of the Cold War. ""Dr. Strangelove"" is one of the best films I'v ever seen, and it just might be Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece!"
"Heiniken","10","2","4","13 February 2007"," Gentlemen, you can't fight here, this is the War room!
","Where do I start? This movie is incredible, I loved every aspect of it. Kubrick really was a genius, and this is one of, if not THE best picture he made(ties with clockwork). The movie is filled with great acting and memorable quotes, and you can't do anything else than love it!<br/><br/>The story begins when general Jack D. Ripper gives the order of nuclear attack on Sovjet. He believes the communist are trying to destroy the precious bodily fluids with fluoridated water. To him everything is a communist conspiracy. He bases his belief on his recent impotence. Peter Sellers character(the British officer) is forced to stay with Ripper to get the call back code to the planes, which Ripper is in possession of and is the only one who knows it.<br/><br/>When the president(also played by sellers)finds out what has happened he gets the idea to call the Russian president up on the phone and have a conversation. This off course ends in hysterical bickering back and forth. Quote: Well I'm sorry to Dimitri! I'm perfectly capable to be just as sorry as you are Dimitri!!.<br/><br/>The very best part in the movie is the scenes with Dr. strangelove. Peter Sellers was a grand actor no doubt about it. Dr. strangelove is a nuclear expert and an ex nazi. He seems to have some disagreements with his fight hand which tries to choke him and shot out in nazi salutes. He is a hysterical character, and my favorite thing about the movie.<br/><br/>George C. SCotts character is really funny as well. Not all the credit should go Peter Sellers, Scott acting is almost as brilliant as Sellers.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is great. It takes a lot of talent to make a subject as serious as the cold war and make a comedy out of it, and a brilliant one at that. PS: please excuse my spelling, not the brightest of students!"

","The smooth, cool, and funny way that Kubrick made a real issue feel. the fact that it had enough seriousness to provide a deep and emotionally layered story, bouncing back and forth from character to character till Maj. ""King"" Kong rides the bomb. Other movies like ""Fail Safe"", directed by Sydney Lummet, basically had the same message, but it didn't have the cool feel that Dr. Strangelove supplied. This movie should have won at the Oscars. Kubrick should have been noticed as the great director he is, and Peter Sellers should have won for playing THREE roles!! I believe that everyone should see this movie, and any who doesn't should shut their pie holes!! 10 outta 10!!!!!!!"

","Kubrick's first major success. Staring peter Sellers in three roles, as Dr Strangelove, President Muffley, and group Captain Lionel Mandrake. The film tells the story of General Jack D. Ripper who seals off the air base he commands, and orders a fleet of B-52 Bombers to strike the Soviet Union. The army is forced to storm the base, and Ripper commits suicide, taking the recall codes with him. Mandrake manages to decipher the code from the General's papers. Unfortunately, one of the planes is damaged in the attack, and fails to respond. The Soviet Premier, Pistoff, tells Muffley that Russia has recently installed a Doomsday Machine, which will automatically set off all the atom bombs in the world if the Soviet Union is attacked. The bomb is dropped with an American cowboy riding it all the way down and mankind comes to an inglorious end. This is black comedy of the finest kind."

","What does this film not have? <br/><br/>Romance maybe, but in the meantime this Kubrick masterpiece, in collaboration with the quintessential Peter Sellers role of all time, delivers what could be said as a film that quite literally woke us up at time when the end was truly near. Absent this visionary creation, I have often thought that we may have not made it through the 60's, only to be now finding ourselves again facing the planetary peril of climate change, and sadly the very same dangers showcased in the film, still omnipresent and hair-triggered for the end of the world. <br/><br/>The first time I saw this in the 70's it gave me hope that we can survive. I no longer know if that is true, but there is enough hope in this one to go around amidst its brilliant satire.<br/><br/>This film is one that everyone who lives today should take the time to see."

","It is a mark of quality that this film is perhaps as relevant today as it was when it was made. Even more remarkable that it has such power at all considering how silly it comes across, yet there is surely no other film that gets its message to the viewer in quite such a brilliant way. It is the fact that the characters are portrayed as so stupid that makes the message so powerful, alongside the pessimistic ending of the film. Peter Sellars proves what an exceptional actor he was by playing his various roles with aplomb. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden back Sellars up with similarly impressive creations who last long in the memory. As for the late legend Stanley Kubrick, this - closely followed by Full Metal Jacket - is his true masterpiece. There is most certainly no other film like it and to attempt to make a film with such serious issues and film it as a farce is obviously a difficult thing to do successfully. Finally, every person in the world should see this film because it has the simple but effective message that politics of fear is a bad thing for the world, a message that still needs to made today, perhaps more than ever."
"classicsoncall","10","2","4","17 October 2006"," ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the War Room.""
","This film is quite literally a blast, with no pun intended. The Cold War paranoia of the Fifties and Sixties is personified in the character of General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), and will resonate with anyone who grew up during that time, especially if you had to go through those 'duck and cover' air raid drills as a kid. In my case, you had the frequent feeling that at any moment, we could be in 'nuclear combat toe to toe with the Rooskies'. <br/><br/>The brilliance of the movie has a lot to do with it's tongue in cheek observation of the five star military mind. Both Turgidson and General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) exemplify the 'get them before they get us' school of war strategy. I've never seen Scott play a role with such maniacal glee, his verbal sparring with President Muffley is hilarious, the more so because he's trying to tell it straight and he sounds absolutely absurd. <br/><br/>Peter Sellers is brilliant in each of his portrayals, I had the impression that his Dr. Strangelove characterization might have been the basis for the German police inspector in ""Young Frankenstein"". What's great about his performance is that none of his characters look at all like each other, and if you go in to the film without knowing it, you would think that Mandrake, Muffley and Strangelove were performed by different actors. <br/><br/>Without researching any of the background of the film, I would guess that the name of the Soviet Premiere was a parody of Nikita Kruschev, what loyal American during the time wouldn't have loved to tell him to 'kiss off'. <br/><br/>Though the movie is loaded with inspired comedic gems, one of my favorites has to be Mandrake attempting to make a call to the President. In totally illogical irony, he has to resort to using a phone booth at a high security strategic Air Force Base. And without the correct change - beautiful!<br/><br/>Even if you haven't seen the movie, the classic clip from the film everyone can relate to is Slim Pickens on that bucking bronco joyride to Armageddon in all of it's patriotic glory. It only reinforces the idea for me that somewhere out there, some crazed despot right now is strategizing emergency war plans and retaliatory safeguards, and is only too ready to drop the big one. Before that happens, let's hope that cooler heads prevail and work it all out ahead of time in the war room."

","I'll reveal my bias; I have always loved this film and I think I may even have loved it before I watched it because it is such a hugely irreverent and successful satire of what was and still is a very serious business. The film/book it is parodying, Fail Safe, is a good film in it's own right but has not stood the test of time in the way Dr. Strangelove has, despite its strong cast and script. I think this is because Dr. S delivers most of what Fail Safe delivers but adds to it with comedy and very well-observed satire - this film still provides food for thought about the sanity of high states of strategic nuclear readiness.<br/><br/>The script is very strong and is delivered, in the main, by two talented actors on top of their game, George C. Scott and Peter Sellers (who plays 3 characters excellently). I always find myself laughing throughout this film at the dialogue and the situation and this owes a lot to the genius of these two men and their on-screen delivery.<br/><br/>If you're at all interested in this film then I implore you to make it the next thing you watch!"

In light of what is coming out about the secret societal connections of the U.S. President, Britain's PM and all world leaders, the writers appear to be dead on, suggesting a residual Nazi influence on the powers-that-be. Instead of having childish custard cream pie fights in the ""war room"", the elite who plan to rule the world are secretly dressing up like Santa Claus and whooping it up at the Bohemian Grove.

","I think that I first saw this movie when I was about thirteen and back then I just got it. A lot of people don't get this movie and still don't but the people that get it really get it. The film is about this: At the height of the Cold War and a nuclear attack is launched by a psychotic bomb group commander and at the helm of the B-52 is the gun-ho, Major T.J. ""King"" Kong. Upon learning this the president meets with his generals in the war room. He then calls the Russian president to warn him of the nuclear attack and tells him to ""shoot down the American bombers"". After a series of angry calls, back and forth and discussions of how the inevitable will occur with Dr. Strangelove, it occurs and the world ends.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is the most brilliant filmmaker ever ,in my opinion, for this film alone. He was able to tackle on world leaders and show them how ridiculous they were. This is satire at it's best. Some people might not find this film funny but satire isn't always supposed to be funny. It's supposed to show the ridiculousness of what's going on. I completely recommend this movie to anyone. Anyone looking for a laugh or some entertainment.

I never had to grow up watching international tensions increase over such events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the launching of Sputnik. Although I wasn't directly impacted by America's unspoken conflict with the ""Rooski"" menace, I still consider Dr. Strangelove to be one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>In this cinematic gem, the audience sees events play out at three locations: on Burpleson Air Force base, where a crazy general has just launched a nuclear attack against Russia; in the War Room of the Pentagon as the President and his advisers try to bring back the errant bombers; and on one of the bombers approaching its Soviet target. Do not let the description fool you as this is only a slightly serious film. Dark humor and expertly crafted satire runs throughout this picture. Peter Sellers is fantastic in all three of his roles and George C. Scott gives a top-notch performance. Surprisingly, Slim Pickens also does an excellent job as the gung-ho bomber pilot.

I love the way the men on the base respond to the invading troops. ""Those Ruskies are really good. Those look exactly like our tanks."" I love the glee with which Gen.

Ripper (Sterling Hayden) executes a plan which commands the US Air Force to launch atomic bombs at more than 200 Russian targets. The President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) gets very troubled when he learns that the Soviet Union will protect itself against any attack with the Doomsday Machine that brings the 93-years-long nuclear winter to the Earth. The only man who can stop the General is a British 'exchange officer' Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers again).<br/><br/>The movie was released in the 1960s when the Cold War had become extremely tense. Using the nuclear weapon was not only possible, but even likely to happen. In the times when the whole world is afraid of terrorists and 'evil countries', it is very refreshing to see a comedy about nuclear war. Kubrick combines this serious matter with an absurd plot and a witty dialogue. Colourful characters with strange names make this film hilarious. Sellers also plays Dr. Strangelove, a German nuclear scientist. His performance is absolutely spectacular. The phone negotiations between the president and the Soviet leader is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of film.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" is a film that you should not miss. It will provide you with the escape to the Cold War and with a lot of laugh."

","I didn't see this movie for years, because the clips I had seen here and there didn't interest me. I finally saw it an realized I had missed out! What a brilliant, brilliant story. Very subtly witty and full of satire. Peter Sellers is amazing playing 3 different roles, each to perfection. One of the top ten best movies I have ever seen. I'm not Kubricks biggest fan, but for this one, he deserves all the praise he gets. Seemed to start a little slow, but stick with it. It gets more and more outrageous as the film progresses until you are mired in insanity. Peter Sellers has some of the funniest bits (although Slim Pickens has a great memorable moment himself) the one sided phone conversations of Sellers as the president talking to the premiere of Russia are a riot! a Must-See movie for any film lover."

","Stanley Kubrick's nightmare comedy always delivers with its acid-tongue lashings at military minds and portrays war as something big-wigs do to work off some adrenaline. From Slim Pickens riding the bomb down to a nuclear orgasm to George C Scott's portrayal of a murderous, war-loving general who would love to kick start the Apocalypse so long as he can spend 100 years deep underground with many women ""with highly sexually stimulating natures"". And the piece de la resistance was Peter Sellers as Doctor Strangelove, President Merkin (a name for a pubic hair wig) Muffley and Royal Air Force officer Lionel Mandrake. His improv not only on Strangelove's lines but also in the dialogue from the infamous ""hotline"" scene where the president has to talk to a drunken Soviet Premier to warn him of a nuclear strike against the U.S.S.R. are just brilliant. The fact that this movie is EVEN fresher now than it was back in 1964 when it was released shows the film's power. As if it would be allowed back into the American public. This movie lost the Oscar for Best Picture Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor to Becket and My Fair Lady proving that the Oscars really don't mean anything."
"nisitpav","10","2","4","6 September 2005"," The greatest comedy of all times
","Perhaps a comedy is made on purely extravagant levels. In making movies, and, evidently, watching them, I discovered that such pure emotions as: cry, laugh, fright, are quite easy to create. Comedies are made to make us laugh. Think of all the Billy Wilder comedies, like ""Some like it Hot"" and ""The Apartment"", great movies, with sharp, intelligent scripts and a stylish direction. But still, in a film like those, one laughs, but nothing more. There is no deep emotion, no symbolism, no major theme or thematology, and no thinking. In a sense, the only thing that makes us like those movies is the use of humor. Now, when it comes to Dr. Strangelove. What is it that elevates this film from all other comedies: it is not humor, it is wit. Never before have I watched a comedy where I am required to think as well. What I loved about this movie was the little details, the names, for example. Although I love 2001, ACO, Barry Lyndon and Paths of Glory, I think that DrS is the best Kubrick movie ever! Not only the brilliant, flawless script, of so many unexpected twists and turns, but the lovely satirical direction. Every aspect of this film has a humorous symbolic nature, such as the title sequence, with the two planes exchanging fluids. But one can't only view a film, and particularly this film, and like it as it is. One has to consider the time-frame in which it was made. In an era of desperation and general fear of a third world war, Kubrick dared to make fun of it all, reminding people to take it easy, and love the bomb."

"StanleyStrangelove","10","2","4","28 August 2005"," Kubrick's second best film
","Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is the ultimate black comedy. It's #26 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest movies. The movie is full of outrageous lines and scenes. On one level the movie is an exact depiction of a nuclear bomber on its way to attack the Soviet Union. On another level it's a satire of cold war politics. Kubrick throws in a generous amount of sexual innuendo both in the names of the characters (Buck Turgidson) and the visuals. You can watch this film many times and always spot something new.<br/><br/>Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes a little funny in the head and orders his bomber squadron on a full scale nuclear attack against the Soviet Union. Group Captain (G/C) Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to get Ripper to stop the attack by giving him the recall code. President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) and his advisors meet in the War Room trying to decide what to do. The conversation between Sellers and Soviet Premier Kissov - you only hear Sellers' end -- is hysterical. George C. Scott is Gen Buck Turgidson who is one of the main military advisors. Scott was never better than in this role. Dr. Strangelove (also Peter Sellers) joins them in the War Room at the end of the movie and Sellers gives his most famous movie performance. Keenan Wynn (Col Bat Guano) and Slim Pickens (Major Kong) are also good in the film.<br/><br/>The sets -- the war room, the bomber interior, the Air Force Base -- were by Ken Adam who worked on many of the Bond movies (Goldfinger, Thunderball, Dr. No, Moonraker) and with Kubrick again on Barry Lyndon."

"FrankBooth_DeLarge","10","2","4","19 August 2005"," Great Political Satire, Perfected by Kubrick's Directing and by the Hysterical Performances of Sellers
","Cold War tensions are very high, and US bombers have been ordered to destroy the USSR. The plan has been started by insane General Jack Ripper, who fears that the Soviets will destroy Americans' ""precious bodily fluids."" A war room full of Generals, Politicians, the President, the Soviet Ambassador, and wheel chair bound genius Dr. Strangelove, must stop Jack Ripper from succeeding in his plan. If the bombers attack the Soviet Union, a doomsday device that the soviets have will be triggered and it will ""destroy all plant and animal life"" on earth. <br/><br/>This movie's tagline ""The Hotline Suspense Comedy"" says a lot. There is a lot of suspense in this movie, and it is funny at the same time. This is a great political satire, as it pokes fun at the cold war and how Americans feared the Russians. While the movie is really funny, it is meant to be seen a couple of times. There is a lot of subtle humor present, that is hard to pick up on when you first see the movie. Much of the humor comes from the hysterical Performances by comic genius Peter Sellers. He plays three characters, but the most memorable character is the wheel chair bound Dr. Strangelove. One of the funniest moments with his character is when he has trouble controlling his hand, and it ends up choking him. Another character played by Sellers, The President, also has a memorable line, ""You can't fight here, this is the war room."" <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is a genius. This movie shows how he has a sense of humor, and he also displays his masterful directing skills. There is one scene in this movie which involves military combat. That scene is about 20 years ahead of its time. The hand-held camera movements are very realistic, and this was made 24 years before Saving Private Ryan. The special effects involving the bomber flying are also great. The model of the bomber is realistic looking, unlike the fake models that often plagued black and white movies of long ago. And the background effects are also pretty realistic. I'm surprised this didn't win an academy award for Best Effects. <br/><br/>The other actors are good, especially George C. Scott. It's kind of funny to think that he played General 'Buck' Turgudson, and then a few years later he played real life WWII General George Patton.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant movie. Peter Sellers gives great performances(he plays 3 people, which makes the movie even more fun), there are plenty of funny lines, the direction is great, and the story is very good. The humor in this is a lot funnier if you know more about the cold war. Those who are kids and haven't learned much about the cold war might not understand this, and might not find it to be funny. Otherwise, Dr. Strangelove is a classic that I highly recommend"

"evanston_dad","9","2","4","29 April 2005"," Mein Fuhrer.....I Can Walk!
","""Dr. Strangelove"" had to have seemed strange indeed to 1964 audiences. This came out in the same year as colorful, old-fashioned Hollywood fare like ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Mary Poppins."" Yet ""Strangelove"" is far from old-fashioned or even colorful. Kubrick's film is stark and cold with a documentary-like air to it. It's also riotously funny. Peter Sellers is a film treasure. This film is a an orgy for Sellers fans, since he plays no less than three different characters, stretching his chameleon-like acting abilities to the limit. The funniest of his three characters is the dead-pan president of the United States, and the film's funniest scene involves him trying to gently break to the Russian premiere that we are about to launch a nuclear attack on his country. His portrayal of the title character is also inspired, and the image of Sellers in that wheelchair wrestling his black-gloved hand into submission with that crazy shock of hair and crazier glint in his eyes is unforgettable.<br/><br/>The film also sports a great supporting cast, most notably George C. Scott as Buck Turgison, who discreetly takes calls from his bikini-clad girlfriend during war room briefings, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, who wields his cigar like a dangerous weapon, and Slim Pickens, as the pilot of the plane that is about to end civilization as we know it. <br/><br/>My only complaint with the film is its somewhat sluggish editing, especially in the scenes showing the fleet of bombers on its way to their Russian targets. At times, the movie actually drags slightly, even though it's only 90 minutes long.<br/><br/>But this is a minor quibble about a film that has rightly earned a spot in the cultural conscience of America. It will never be irrelevant as long as the ability to wage nuclear war exists, and it doesn't look like that problem will be going away any time soon."
"MovieAddict2016","10","2","4","29 April 2005"," George C. Scott is hilarious!
","I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that ""Dr. Strangelove"" owes a great portion of its success to George C. Scott. His performance in this film is hilarious and his constant facial contortions are funnier than what most comedians can accomplish in an entire career. (Hello, Jimmy Fallon.) Everyone's always raving about Peter Sellers; yes, he's very funny also, but in my opinion Scott is the best of the entire cast and manages to evoke more laughs than anyone else. He's also the one whose actions are responsible for the film's best line, and most famous. (I'm not even going to mention it again!) Stanley Kubrick's war classic still holds up to this day thanks to its hugely clever script and absurdly prescient aspects of warfare and politics. This movie still holds up over 40 years later and that's saying quite a lot, especially in a day and age when most people look back on films from the 1960s and frown because they were largely known for being optimistic, colorized and starring clean-cut wholesome leading stars who don't recognize a world outside their own sickeningly sweet borders.<br/><br/>Kubrick was always way ahead of his times and if ""Dr. Strangelove"" were made today it would still be considered edgy in some ways. It touches on certain areas of politics that, particularly right now, are fragile and easily upset.<br/><br/>On top of that the not-so-subtle sexual allegories must have slipped by the censors. The opening credits begin with phallus-shaped missiles that are a clear metaphor; they are also linked to the subject of battle which creates a sexual fetish regarding warfare. On top of that there is the General with his cigar and the ""precious bodily fluids."" The sexual symbolism has been written about before, in greater depth, but even I found it very clear and I rarely agree with the critics who find sexual innuendo in the most basic of films.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" is really funny and memorable, even still after all these years. Not many films can carry that honor. This is a classic whose reputation speaks for itself and doesn't outweigh its lasting effect; in essence, a must-see."
"Naoum","10","2","4","21 March 2005"," What a masterpiece!!!!
","I don't know how Peter Sellers does it but it's pure magic. It's like an ability to dive into the collective unconscious and take out gems. He plays three roles and he is absolutely brilliant in all three.<br/><br/>This is a dark comedy. I wasn't able to laugh since what was depicted was painfully funny and equally painfully true. The dialogues are absolutely brilliant although paradoxical but that doesn't diminish their value!!! Quite the contrary...<br/><br/>It's a milestone of an era (the cold war era) although it's not a reality that has come to pass. It's appropriate for this era also although the wars are of a smaller scale... Politics, the army, absurdity and lunacy all together in a worst case scenario! BRILLIANT!"
"trvpup","10","2","4","15 March 2005"," an absolute must
","Quite simply, this is the best film ever made on the potential absurdity of the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), which since the end of World War II has been the dominant mode of thinking of the world's foreign policy elite regarding nuclear strategy. As this film was made in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, it tried to make comic light of a very heavy handed topic, i.e. namely, as the title suggests, defending against another nuclear power with second strike capabilities in the event of an ""accident."" In this case, the ""accident"" is that one paranoid high-ranking General decides the time to strike the Soviets is now before they can attain nuclear superiority over the U.S., which since JFK was entering a period of detente. For those who have studied international relations, military strategy, and the history of war, this film is filled with biting insight and clever humor. For those without such predilections, this is still one of the most humorous satires on the Cold Wat around. In fact, this film is so good I have been using it in my class for years. Check it out! By the way, Kubrick had high level clearance to interview the top brass of the military and civilian think tanks to make a serious movie about the dangers of nuclear war. That is why much of the footage of military technology, protocol and methods are authentic for its time frame. Unbeknownst to them at the time, Kubrick decided to make a satire instead. This explains why the armed forces forced Kubrick to make the disclaimer at the beginning of the film, distancing themselves from the content of the film. Perhaps he was a little ""too accurate""!"
"jwunderl","10","2","4","9 March 2005"," A movie to watch on a yearly basis
","Not only is Peter Sellers brilliant in his triple role, but Kubrick is on top of his game. When you factor in the political context at the time that this was released, the black comedy becomes positively Stygian.<br/><br/>The madness of the SAC commander (Sterling Hayden) is the perfect complement for the MADness (Mutually Assured Destruction) of the the nuclear stand off and cold war. One might even say that the only rational response to madness is madness. Kubrick certainly did.<br/><br/>The perfect cold war trilogy may well be Dr. Strangelove, The Manchurian Candidate, and Fail Safe. All black and white, like the logic of the times."

Every time I gain some new insight and will continue to seek this movie out. Perhaps I should buy the DVD? There are nothing but excellent acting performances in this movie. Where do you start? To have multiple actors at the very top of their game, Peter Sellers at his best, George C. Scott matching his role as Patton and clearly this movie is where the idea of casting him as Patton came from, Sterling Hayden driving you crazy with his craziness, Slim Pickens over the top, and Peter Bull as a lovable Russian, is one amazing facet of this film. How no actor won an Oscar is perhaps the greatest injustice in Academy history. The editing is crisp, well paced, perhaps perfect. Cinematography is beautiful. And this film is Kubrick directing at his best. Not until the Shining and Full Metal Jacket would he see this level of directing again. Given that it may be the greatest comedy and one of the greatest movies of all time, speaks volumes for the quality of the screen play. Everything works in this film. I assume that only a great director like Kubrick could provide the motivation and energy for this to happen. This movie, more than any of his other's, demonstrates why Kubrick has to be considered one of the greatest film directors."
"thechildrenscrusade","10","2","4","29 December 2004"," Absolute Genius!
","Stanley Kubrick once again, dazzles and amazes. Dr. Strangelove is simply revolutionary, witty, entertaining, funny as heck, and of course, with a powerful message underlying it all. Kubrick felt that so many of the absurdities of nuclear war (etc.) had to be left out in order to make the film a serious piece, but he also felt that they were necessary in order to get the full message across, so he decided to make the film a satire, unlike the book, which it is based off of. The result of this, is nothing short of extraordinary! <br/><br/>Each character's name has sexual connotations and such. If one delves deeply enough into the matter, and begins to take notice, the entire film has a sexual underlining. From the first scene of the aerial ""re-fueling"" to the matter of ""precious bodily fluids"" with General Ripper to the ending idea of the underground society, primarily made up of men - sex is all around! Also at the center of the film is the idea of ""mutual assured destruction"" and the ""doomsday device"" - there is so much hidden between the layers of this film - its impossible to do it justice in a short comment. <br/><br/>I urge everyone to take notice of every aspect of this film, from the differing camera shots and angles, to the dark humor, and of course, the message that lies underneath it all. For, in a Kubrick, only if one does this, can one achieve the full affect! =) Peter Sellers does an amazing job in his three roles. The immortal line ""You can't fight in here, this is the war room!"" shall live on forever in every film buff's mind. And of course, Dr. Strangelove being hardly able to maintain his hail Hitler arm - simply fabulous and extremely funny. <br/><br/>The only fault might be in the fact that Kubrick cut out a final pie throwing scene which would tie up some loose ends (i.e. the Russian taking a secret picture of the large map on the screen) but Kubrick didn't like the final outcome, so he cut it from the movie. Still, this is movie magic and film at its best! Stanley Kubrick, master auteur, does it again."

It mixes black humour with contemporary issues like no other movie before it and since then, and has sustained the test of time by getting more hilarious and thought-provoking with each new viewing. This remains Stanley Kubrick's finest film. Particularly noteworthy as being the writer-director Kubrick's first and only venture into the comedic genre, Dr. Strangelove is one of the funniest films ever made. It appears that Kubrick got a bulls-eye on his very first shot.<br/><br/>Other interesting anecdotes: The sets for this movie, designed by Ken Adam, were so convincing that people, upon visiting the White House, asked specifically if they could see ""the War Room"" as shown in Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>This was also the screen debut of James Earl Jones, who plays a pilot on Major Kong's (Brilliantly portrayed by Slim Pickens) bomber.<br/><br/>This was Peter Sellers' second movie working with Kubrick. Sellers also delved into the roles of Clare Quilty/Dr. Zempf in Kubrick's equally magnetic 1962 film Lolita.<br/><br/>With Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick has created the masterpiece of the 1960's, and has hopefully created something that will be remembered in the annals of movie history."

It takes a bit of suspension of current reality and a good memory to get all the gags, but Kubrik's consummate attention to detail and methodical plot and character development still makes this a completely enjoyable black comedy. The humour in this movie is attended by a chill, as one realizes how very close to reality the fanatic red baiting of General Ripper or the clinical warmongering of General Turgidson are to the fact of the times. Strangelove himself is a peculiar dramatic construct reflecting the outrageous rationalizations of the Cold War gone completely over the deep end. The film is a little overextended in its comedy in parts, moving from intellectual satire, to sight and name puns, to some really obtuse character sketches. The great scenes inside the B52, though, or the battle sequence, which look like completely authentic newsreel footage, and the stark cinemetography of the War Room,  shows you what a perfectionist and what a finely crafted product this great film maker put out."

Slim Pickens as bomb riding Major Kong and Peter Sellars as Mandrake, the President, and of course Dr. Strangelove, whose right hand still holds allegiance to the Third Reich.

","Despite being in black and white and made in 1964 this remains a great film.
The cinematography is excellent especially of the bombers in mid air and the opening shot of refuelling is quire mesmerising.
It's classed as a comedy and there are scenes which are fairly funny though it's really a story of how things can go wrong with human ""error"" and lead to a nuclear bombing of Russia.
The main scenes are relatively few :-
The air base where a unhinged official plans to beat the safeguards and send a bomber on a mission to drop its nuclear bomb
The inside of the bomber with the crew receiving the shock command to drop the bomb
The presidents operational centre with the top level officials contacting the Russian leader ( Dimitry)
Peter Sellers plays three parts - An English soldier at the air base , the US president and Dr Strangelove - the obligatory mad scientist. Sellers is excellent in two roles but I thought the comedy of his wheelchaired Dr Strangelove was not particularly funny and fell somewhat flat ( otherwise I would have given it 9.0 )

","I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr.Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10."

","The subject of the film is a satire on the Cold War and nuclear deterrence strategies. But the film also contains many small themes, such as the destruction caused by uncontrolled power. In the film, the direct cause of the disaster came from a brain storm in General Ruipi. But the reason why his crazy plan was able to proceed smoothly was because he cut off all channels that could control and supervise his orders. He made his orders only from top to bottom, without horizontal checks and balances. From this, his madness was realized by the absolute power in his hands. And this one-way vertical power distribution has always been the traditional art of socialist countries. When a level of power is concentrated at one point, those in power at that point can easily deceive and conceal it, and this is often one of the main factors that cause the occurrence of disasters or the expansion of damage."

","This line from Gen. Turgidson perfectly captures the essence of this sublime, absurd, horrific Doomsday tale from Kubrick and screenwriter Terry Southern. Turgidson's answer to the President's inquiry -- can the remaining B-52 piloted by Maj. Kong reach their primary target in the Soviet Union? -- betrays an ingrained gung-ho optimism which then fades to horror when he considers the consequences of Kong's successful mission. To wit, the Soviet Doomsday Machine! Such lines are plentiful in ""Dr. Strangelove"". So full of satire, sidesplitting parody and irony that each scene stands on its own while sustaining the plot with its unique haywire logic. My favorite sequence is the phone call between the President Muffley (Sellers) and Soviet Premier Kissoff (gotta love the allegory!) as he explains the situation. It's a pitch-perfect satire on the whole Cold War mentality: ""I'm sorry too, Alexei... don't say you're more sorry than me ... I can be just as sorry as you, Alexei, I'm just calling to tell you something terrible has happened, did you think I was just calling to say hello? Of COURSE I like talking to you ... of COURSE I like to say hello ..."" Perhaps the greatest mark of this b&w film is that despite the end of the Soviet Union and the Cold War, ""Dr. Strangelove"" does not diminish with age. A film that defies age and categorization. In short, a masterpiece."

"csm23","Null","0","0","7 March 2003"," Kubric's Apocalyptic Vision Proves Prophetic: The Uncanny Similarities between Jack D. Ripper and Dubya
","Colonel Jack D. Ripper has a problem:  in the act of lovemaking, he experiences what he calls a `loss of essence.'  It troubles him, as it would any man, so he sets out to find the reason.  An observant and intuitive man, he notes that Russians never drink water, and that the fluoridation of water began in 1946, right about the time when the American and Soviet allies had their noisy falling out that ushered in the Cold War.  A natural born scientist, he decides to test his hypothesis that fluoridation of water had contaminated his purity of essence by drinking only pure grain alcohol and rainwater.  When his `essence' returns, he alone understands the enormity of the evil threat;  so, he orders a massive airborne nuclear assault against the Soviets in defense of our god given purity of essence. <br/><br/>
I know what you're thinking:  Kubrick's apocalyptic imagination is entertaining, but unreal.  Or is it?  Consider this:  it wasn't long after our president got a carpet burn on his forehead while privately gnawing a pretzel in the quiet serenity of the White House that he formulated is `axis of evil' foreign policy.   Hmmmm.  It makes me wonder if there isn't a connection between this event, similar in many respects to Colonel Ripper's loss of `essence,' and the president's comic book analysis of the world, complete with villains, super villains, and the Almighty's own sword of justice, which, by the way, always takes the shape of the US military. <br/><br/>
You see what I mean.  Kubrick was right on target with his prescient foray into the realm of chaos theory, where a chain of freak events can lead to world chaos.  So, for goodness sake, if you haven't seen the movie, which is pregnant with meaning as regards our current situation with that camel-fornicator from Iraq, crazy as old Nebuchadneezer, you've got to see it now.

"the_body18","Null","0","0","29 November 2002"," The only true satire of government ever made!!
","Dear Movie Afficiandos;<br/><br/>When you see Dr. Stranglove, you will never forget the robotic arm of the doctor, that just can't stop going Zieg Hail, whenever he speaks.<br/><br/>
Stanley Kubrick, a complex man who made even more complex movies, can easily be remembered by one word. Genius. As most fans of Kubrick know, he would shoot one scene roughly seven or eight times, so he could pick the best take in editing. He was also constanly pushing actors to become the charcter more, if ever they got tired of doing the scene he simply remarked, ""Don't you want to get it right?"" It becomes quite evident that the product of his pursiut of perfection in films, was Dr. Strangelove. This is the movie to which all the other Failsafe and Sum Of All Fears type movies were drafted from. Although failsafe was orginally a novel, it was Strangelove that inspired the movie to have three distinct scences in the movie, and also a twist semi-anti-climatic ending. The reason Dr. Strangelove has stood for so many years as a great film is because of it's real depictions of characters. Major Turgidson, Dr. Strange, the President, are all charcters that seem to be taken right out of a real life Cold War situation. Even the dim witted president is true to life, but don't call the president a moron or you may end up in jail. It is through excellent charcterization that Kubrick shows the fickleness of alliances, man's insecurity, and the nuclear weapons being an extension of the male appendige. Kubrick true to his form, never insults his audience by telling or explaining why a certain charcter or symbol is in the film. He let's you put it together, and it is in this putting together, that the film becomes transfixed in your mind. For example, Seller's third charcter's name, Mandrake, it actually the name of a natural aphrodisiac. Another example, when the U.S. war plane, manned by the crazed general, enters the Russian borders, it it described as ""pentetrating through the hard outer walls of the border and speeding down the narrow canal to the small center target."" Small dialouges like this reinforce indirectly the main theme's for this movie. Most movies made during this time in the 60's, that depict the time frame shortly after the war are pro-government. The government is all good in these movies, becasue it just whooped the Nazi's. Yet in Strangelove, the U.S. is working with a Nazi defective to defeat the Soviets. What an odd twist eh? It's small attacks on the government like this, that made the military not cooperate with Kubrick for any of his demands to visit the inside of an acutall base, or B-52 hanger. In short, see Dr. Strangelove and you will not be dissapointed. No movie will make the truth about humanity more clear; when humans try and solve complex problems, we enevitably revert back to school yard mentality."
"Celluloid_Junkie","Null","0","0","1 August 2002"," The Absurdity of War
","Looking back on all the films I've seen, I can't think of any movie that's as genuinely fun to watch as this Stanley Kubrick masterwork.  Through its goofy, over-the-top characters, the film examines the absurdity of war while letting its viewer laugh at its utter pointlessness.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" focuses on the possibility of nuclear Armageddon.   A psychotic air commander, General Ripper, sends all bombers of his wing to attack Russia.  He believes that the Soviets are attempting to fluoridate U.S. water in order to degrade bodily fluids, thereby, not allowing Americans to reproduce.  The film cuts between three different settings: (1) One of Ripper's B-52 bombers, (2) Ripper's locked office, in which his second-in-command officer Captain Mandrake desperately tries to figure out the recall code for the planes, and (3) the Pentagon's underground war room, in which the President and his staff try to keep the conflict from getting out of hand.<br/><br/>Kubrick directs flawlessly, as usual, but the greatest asset of the film is its cast.  George C. Scott is unforgettable in the role of Buck Turgidson, an excitable, anti-Communist, gung-ho general.  It probably helps that he is given so many of the movie's most memorable lines, but his dialogue delivery and facial expressions are simply hilarious.  Think of the scene in which the idea of the Doomsday Device is presented by the Russian ambassador. Turgidson declares it to be ""an obvious Commie trick"" while walking backwards.  Then he suddenly falls down, somersaults, and lands on his feet. Scott didn't fall intentionally, but he continued to recite his lines as he was rolling on the floor.  It's a hysterically funny moment, but it's even more amazing to think that it wasn't even planned.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers takes on three completely different roles with unique accents and mannerisms.  His performances as President Muffley and Captain Mandrake are brilliant in how restrained they are, and in how well he plays off of the nutcases (including himself as the title character) around him.  His scenes with Turgidson in the war room are ingenious, as are his telephone conversations with the Russian leader, but he does his most memorable work when the character Mandrake is being ordered around by the idiotic Colonel ""Bat Guano"".  Keenan Wynn, as Guano, displays perfect comic timing, and the combination of these two actors is impeccable.  Sterling Hayden, Peter Bull, and Slim Pickens are also mesmerizing in their roles.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" is an undeniably funny and entertaining film, but it also has moments of beauty.  For example, the opening credits with the planes drifting through the air with the tune of ""Try a Little Tenderness"".  Or the famous image of Major Kong riding a nuclear missile towards its target. The final montage of H-bomb mushroom clouds set to ""We'll Meet Again"" (an idea suggested by Peter Sellers) is among the most sublimely magnificent moments I've seen in a movie.<br/><br/>Kubrick does a good job of summing up the spirit of ""Dr. Strangelove"": ""After all, what could be more absurd than the very idea of two mega-powers willing to wipe out all human life because of an accident, spiced up by political differences that will seem as meaningless to people a hundred years from now as the theological conflicts of the Middle Ages appear to us today?"""

","Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>Well I've watched a few Kubrick Movies and I absoulutely love the artistry in the Cinematography. Its like watching (22x60xhowever many minutes the film runs for) postcards. Every single shot is perfect and nothing short of it. He doesn't play around and experiment with funny camera angles or if he ever did you never see it. It's all original and its all perfect. Thats why I was kind of disappointed this movie was in Black and White. I surpose this is good in a way though. I also wish the sound was better as well. Other then those minor gripes I loved this.<br/><br/>Kubrick's comedy is quite as you might expect it. Incredibly dark. You have guys shooting themselves and great action war scenes with member of the same army fighting each other. And then in the end the entire world being anihilated for...wait for it...Body Fluids. Then you also have very light comedy. ""Ok but if you don't have the president on the line in under a minute you're going to have some serious explaining to do to the Coca Cola Company"", And of course no fighting in the war room, ""So Dr. Strangelove about the 10 Woman to each man?"", and this crazy russian commander drunk as a skunk and having it explained to him in small words that America is about to attack him.<br/><br/>The whole nuclear threat thing I've seen in a few movies before this but I wish i'd seen this one first because it is the original although I enjoyed the others. ""the third world war/der weltkrieg"", a european movie using clips of the real leaders of the time of the 1980 cold war peak to suggest what a real world war might look like. Then ""Fail Safe"" as well which is a virtually carbon copy of this movie cept not funny.<br/><br/>I think I'll watch it again this week.

","Dr Strangelove requires three things from the viewer in order for the viewer to truly enjoy this epic. First, it acquires a common understanding of history and politics. Second it insists you to have a good humour for black comedy. Third, it asks for your attention and patience.<br/><br/>I first saw this film a very long time ago and there wasn't a moment where I thought that a scene didn't need adjustment. Kubrick didn't appreciate labelling his style as a perfectionist. He waited and let the public assess his skills. Every scene in this movie is wonderfully crafted, magically absorbed into the gloomy shade of black and white and astonishingly fallen into the pit of political unstabilization.<br/><br/>The movie's storyline is pretty simple. B-52 airplanes have reached the outskirts of the Russian border and are ready to bomb down the country with 40 megatonns of H-Bomb, commanded by the strict authority of General Ripper. Peter Sellers, the actor who brings the foundation of the entire film, plays three characters. One, a sissy British commander. Two, the american president. Three, Dr.Strangelove who is a peculiarly strange German with the obvious touch of neo-nazism running through the veins of his uncontrollable right hand that salutes the 'Mein Fuhrer' shake at almost every line. The character of General 'Buck' is the most eccentric - almost all American-hate-Rooskies-officers are like that.<br/><br/>Although this film contains its plot, the clear message it tries to bring over to the world is the risk and potential danger existing within the constant usage of nuclear implements of war. The film was released two years after the event of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Most critics did not find the film funny at all. They just had to wait ten years to understand its personal implication towards the savagness brought by the idiocy of the modern world. It does not support any political sides nor does it try to summon up any other message. It just aims to explain one thing: both sides are able to kill off each other and each side is as corrupted, barren and deadly as one another.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Anyone who thought that Stanley Kubrick was a cold and humorless director needs to watch this movie again.  All that's missing from the wild plot is a pie fight (which apparently was shot for the end of the film but cut from the final product---perhaps it exists somewhere).  Some of the situational humor seems dated (the Cold War paranoia) however the movie remains a comedy classic because of its characters.  Sterling Hayden's General Ripper is a screwball version of the Gunnery Sergeant in Full Metal Jacket.  Slim Pickens' ""riding the bomb"" is a sequence for the movie time capsule.  And of course Peter Sellers--all three of his characters are comic masterpieces, demonstrating his ability for playing deadpan comedy and broad slapstick.

For those of use who grew up in an age where the entire Soviet population were depicted in American media as more evil than Saddam Hussein or Bin-Laden have ever been, when the average elementary student could tell you that the acronym MAD stood for Mutually Assured Destruction, this movie really brings that time back.

","`We cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.' 			-- Albert Einstein								<br/><br/>`Peace is our profession.' 			-- sign on General Ripper's base<br/><br/>What statement was Stanley Kubrick attempting to make with this 1964 film? Is this a parody of the U.S. military and more generally the U.S. government  a mere spoof?  How realistic is this depiction?<br/><br/>	Though the scrolling text that introduces the film says that any similarities to real people is purely coincidental and that the U.S. Air Force safeguards against the types of occurrences contained in the film text, all subsequent devices used in the film point to a more realistic feel.  This sense of factuality overrides the understated initial comments almost to the point of negating them.  After our introduction to Group Captain Mandrake and General Ripper, we are whisked away into news-reel-like footage about the Airborne Alert Force.  The voice over that accompanies the footage also encourages the viewer to liken the sequence to a factual news segment.  Additionally, the statistical information about the 50 megatons of explosives being carried by each B-52 makes the footage seem realistic. Though there is definitely an element of fiction in the film, the realism is later continued by the hand-held camera footage of the invasion of Ripper's base by U.S. troops.<br/><br/>	One of the film's elements that seems as at first as if it can't possibly be realistic is the ability of Ripper to enact Code R, to call an attack without the knowledge of the President, the commander in chief of the armed forces.  President Muffley has his power `muffled' by a war provision that he has approved and signed into action but about which he has no recollection.  The President is shown to be completely impotent in at least one of the powers granted to him by Article II of the Constitution.  He is further depicted as a bit of an idiot he has childish arguments with the Russian Premier about who is more sorry and as he makes statements such as `Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.  This is a war room.'<br/><br/>	Ultimately, none of the people who sit in the ever-important war room of the Pentagon and gaze upon the secretive `big map' have any real effect on the bomb being dropped.  Finally, the decision, after Ripper has made the initial order, is left to be implemented by this group of young pilots, headed up by the countrified Major Kong.  Armed with their conspicuously labeled top secret manuals, the crew sets about to follow the ridiculous mission with which they've been entrusted to see through.  No wrench can possibly be thrown in the works to stop these boys from carrying out their mission.  Kong has been so trained (or so brainwashed  something with which the enemy Commis were charged  by his military training) to stop at nothing, not even following the example of the WWII Japanese Kamikaze pilots, to follow orders.  No amount of conferring at the big round table about the big map can keep plans from going awry.  In the end, those men at that table really have nothing to do with the war that goes on outside the walls of their precious inner-Pentagon sanctum.  <br/><br/>	We find that Ripper's aim of peace as a profession is erroneous just as Einstein surmised."

It has been called an anti-war film, which of course it is, but it doesn't bore you to death with the obviousness of its message.<br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director this material would have quickly degenerated into a polemic, but Kubrick's brilliant idea of filming the story as a black comedy lifts it to higher level of sophistication.  His mastery of the substance of the issue adds to the viewer's appreciation. For example, the Herman Kahn-like reasoning of Dr. Strangelove as he explains the theory of the doomsday device shows that Kubrick has studied the subject thoroughly.  As a result the intellectual force of the film's argument is enhanced.<br/><br/>It doesn't hurt either to have the brilliant performances of George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden.  Scott shows himself to be a masterful comedian while Sterling Hayden plays the role of Jack D. Ripper totally straight. Both performances work and the surprising mixture of gritty realism with lunatic farce blends seemlessly.<br/><br/>The final monologue of Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove, with the famous ""arm with a mind of its own"" scene is one of those exceedingly rare moments in film when the creative energy of the performance becomes palpable. When I first saw this scene I found it so totally electrifying that I actually felt a tingling sensation.  This energy contrasts sharply with the sound of Vera Lynn singing ""We'll Meet Again"" over the mushroom cloud images of the closing titles making the latter even more poignant and memorable.<br/><br/>A truly great movie."

There will be situations when someone besides the president will need the ability to launch a nuclear strike.  This structure allows the extension of launch capabilities to more and more people, who may or may not be sane.  Also, the culture of deterrence requires a distrust of the enemy, a distrust which must be fed by the state, news media, and the leaders of the nation.  This acts to build irrational thought in people, to produce people who are paranoid and perhaps insane.<br/><br/>Kubrick's movie follow the humorous but horrific chain of events that occur when a rogue general, driven insane by his paranoid delusions of Soviet attacks on the essence of the American people decides to take matters into his own hands."

It works out great in movies like The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, but in this movie it doesn't add anything to the humor in my opinion. It's hard to say if this movie should be considered as a comedy, a drama movie or a suspense thriller.

They are so bad now that they you cringe to watch them.<br/><br/>And it's a great shame, because the themes covered in the film are more important than ever. It's also impossible to imagine a film being made today that would treat the topic as seriously as this film does without ascending into war-and-technology-are-glorious or descending into empty anti-war or anti-nuclear propaganda. This movie does still succeed in giving some window into the fearful feelings of the nuclear standoff, and how close to 'midnight' the nuclear clock must have been (and could easily be again with a few unfortunate geopolitical developments).<br/><br/>But by indulging the unnecessary and the overdone, crassly and without the soft brilliance of Sellers in something like The Party, the film is not aging well.

For example, Maj. Kong is apelike and the name of Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadesky (Peter Bull) sounds like ""de Sade"". And of course, the title character loves something strange. And almost every scene is a double-entendre. Probably the best example is during Ripper's tirade: his face is completely illuminated, and his cigar is pointed straight up (wink wink!).

Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a movie that screams ""What if"" and puts us in a situation where nuclear war is starting to become an inevitable turnout. Dr. Strangelove shows all sides of the matter, and turns this cold war catastrophe into something of a sarcastic black comedy.<br/><br/>When a U.S. Air Force General becomes so delusional of a communist conspiracy theory that he impulsively orders an all out nuclear attack on Soviet Russia, things start to turn a little bit disturbing. With no prior knowledge from the president about the orders, the whole situation becomes one big fiasco between all the U.S. officials and a lone Russian Ambassador. The film continuously builds up to a dreadfully catastrophic circumstance, as they discover that the Russians have just finished constructing a defensive ""Doomsday Machine"" that will utterly wipe out all life on Earth at the sign of any hostility. But consistently retains a grim silliness, while all the different characters bicker at one another and impose extreme political views to assert effective action.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie takes after the whole ""paranoia style"", and pokes fun at the responsibilities of the figures of the government. It portrays a world of paranoia where at any moment now could blow itself to smithereens. And In this film, that finally has become the case. As we watch this preposterous dilemma unfold, the men in charge handle it like it's some sort of childish accident. It sends a message that we are fully capable of doing some dreadful things, and shows how absurd such actions can be. But when put under reasonable light, is only pure silliness."

Sterling Hayden is perhaps the one who cracks me up the most as Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper who denies women of his essence, and fears the Russians are attacking us via fluoride in the water systems of America (the line he spits about denying women his 'essence' is side- splitting funny, and kills me every single time I hear it); the exchanges between Ripper and Mandrake are pure gold. The always impressing George C. Scott plays General Buck Turgidson who is just perfectly fitting in the role, and there's nothing more I can say about that. And of course Slim Pickens is the hilarious Major T.J Kong aboard the plane carrying America's nuclear bomb, which is a role perfectly tailored for him as well; Pickens seems to BE Kong at times, as it almost feels like a documentary while watching him go through the procedure for dropping the bomb in a strict military format.<br/><br/>At a time when nuclear war was lingering in the minds of Americans, Stanley Kubrick made a pretty daring film, and satirized the nuclear scare in a hilariously scathing way. I can't recommend this enough. If you only like conventional slapstick comedy, you won't enjoy Dr. Strangelove, but if you like something with bite to it, not your regular funny movie, and something with a little political edge, then this movie will satisfy your thirst. 10 out of 10 stars all the way.

Political satire, nuclear comedy, stark warning, apocalyptic drama – it doesn't matter how you categorise the film; it works perfectly under any heading.<br/><br/>Mad American officer, Brigadier-General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), single-handedly instructs a squadron of B-52 bombers to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Ripper is obsessed with the notion that the Commies have been ""polluting the bodily fluids"" of Americans by fluoridation for decades, and decides the time is right to provoke total annihilation. In the War Room at the Pentagon, American President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), is horrified to discover that one man's irrational paranoid ideals have set into motion a countdown to Armageddon. He and his cabinet desperately try to find a solution to the crisis. Meanwhile, back at Ripper's HQ, an absurdly stiff-upper-lipped RAF officer, Captain Mandrake (Sellers, again), tries to persuade Ripper to reveal to him the recall codes which will bring the bombers back. Ripper shoots himself rather than reveal the codes, but Mandrake figures them out by ingeniously interpreting a number of doodles scrawled across the Brigadier-General's desk. Little of this matters in the slightest, as one of the B-52s piloted by proud Texan Major T.J. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens) has suffered radio damage and proceeds towards its primary target, blissfully unaware that all the other bombers have been recalled. Having thought they'd averted disaster by the skin of their teeth, the Americans look on in helpless terror as Kong's plane flies towards its appointment with doomsday<br/><br/>Based on a serious novel by Peter George, Dr Strangelove takes only the basic plot of the book and transforms it into something incredibly bleak and biting. The inability of politicians to grasp the futility of self-destruction is a key theme here, very pertinent considering that the film was made at the height of Cold War brinkmanship. Although time has inevitably diluted the relevance of the ""nuclear scare"" (nowadays the threat comes from terrorism rather than those pesky Russkies, the film is still enormously powerful and frightening in its absurdity. Sellers is terrific in his triple role (RAF hero, helpless US President and sinister German scientist), but the two stars who make the greatest impression are Hayden as the entirely insane provocateur and Pickens as the dedicated Major Kong. The scene of Kong straddling the bomb to oblivion – yee-hawing like some wild rodeo star as he rides the all-destructive megaton missile to the ground – is one of the most iconic cinematic images of all-time. The script is absolutely razor sharp throughout with some fantastically clever one-liners (""Gentlemen, you cannot fight in here. This is the War Room!"") delivered by brilliant caricatures of the men who hold the fate of the world in their hands. Many films have tried since to recapture the magnificently satirical edge of Dr Stangelove – a few have come close, many have fallen short, but none have equalled or surpassed Kubrick's horrifyingly hilarious masterpiece."

","Stanley Kurbrick's brilliant satire on the cold war is widely considered one of the funniest movies in cinematic history. A lone general gone mad gives the green light launching an A-Bomb attack on Russia, and the President now (Sellers) must pull out all the stops to prevent this. This dark comedy is shot entirely in black and white with terrific production design. Astutely, Kubrick focuses on the actual nuclear event in itself, thus removing the issues of foreign politics. The films message simply put its this; man is not at the mercy of machines,but it in fact it's just the opposite. Petter Sellers is sensational playing several roles and the film has stood the test of time remaining undated."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Difficult to decide if it's more shocking that this film is almost 50 years old, or that it ever got released in the first place. No other black comedy satire on such a sensitive political issue has ever had its theatrical release right smack dab in the middle of the ongoing issue. The cold war between Russia and the US was in high gear and the Cuban Missile crisis had just occurred. In fact, President Kennedy's assassination caused the film's opening to be delayed.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick only directed eleven feature length films, and ten of them can be considered classics (A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, to name a few). Dr. Strangelove is regarded as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, though it's difficult to imagine anyone under 30 really ""getting"" much of the humor - unless they happen to be a history buff. The movie could come across as one big ""inside joke"" to those unfamiliar with the times.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Peter George's ""Red Alert"" novel, Kubrick decided to take the source material and turn it into satire. He brought in Terry Southern (The Magic Christian) to help with the script, and then he turned the incomparable Peter Sellers loose in 3 roles (originally 4, but he broke his leg and gave up the Commander King Kong role). Stories abound with Sellers causing multiple takes and significant editing due to his ad-libbing cracking up other cast members (and even Kubrick).<br/><br/>The structure of the film involved three separate, yet intertwined sequences. We see Burpelson Air Force Base Commander General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) issuing the order to Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) to lock down the base. It turns out, Ripper has gone a bit loony and somehow issued the strike first command against Russia. Mandrake spends much of this segment trying to calmly obtain the Recall Codes from Ripper. We also meet the crew of one of the multiple B-52 bombers in route to Russia. Led by Commander ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickins), they are on the way to deliver two nuclear bombs. One of his crew is played by James Earl Jones in his screen debut. Lastly we go inside the War Room where President Merkin Muffley (Sellers) is meeting with his Joint Chiefs of Staff and advisors. A key player here is General Buck Turgidson (George C Scott) in full kill and be killed mode.<br/><br/>There are so many interesting bits to discuss, but let's limit to just a few. Watch the camera angles that Kubrick uses to film Hayden. He is made to look both powerful and nuts. Hayden (so great in Kubrick's The Killing) has the voice and tough guy stance to make us believe he could start a war due to a Russian plot to pollute the ""precious body fluids"" of Americans. Sellers plays two roles in the War Room, but his straight man performance as the President allows George C Scott to really shine in one of his few comedic turns as an actor. Scott's performance is somehow over the top AND right on the button (so to speak). When watching Slim Pickins in the iconic final image, keep in mind that he was a real life rodeo cowboy prior to breaking into acting.<br/><br/>Obviously the character names are outlandish (Keenan Wynn plays Col. Bat Guano), but it should be noted that the character of the President was based on real life politician and Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. The General Turgidson character is based on real life General Curtis LeMay who was infamous for his kill 'em first attitude. Also, General Ripper was based on General Thomas S Power, who was LeMay's protégé and ultimate replacement as Joint Chief of the Air Force. It should also be noted that Tracy Reed is the only female character who appears ... and yes, that is her in the Playboy magazine that Commander Kong is perusing.<br/><br/>There are so many classic lines and sight gags in the film that it's challenging to keep up on the first viewing. Also, it's been a few years since a pay phone and coke machine played such vital roles. When Kubrick killed the original pie fight ending, he added more frightening images and the poignant closing song - ""We'll Meet Again"" by Vera Lynn. The last note is that director Sidney Lumet did a film version of this same basic story told in a straight-forward and thrilling manner. His ""Fail-Safe"" was released less than a year after Dr. Strangelove."

"tavm","10","2","5","12 August 2012"," Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Stranglove...can still provide entertainment and intelligence in good measure
","This is my second time watching this classic dark comedy directed by Stanley Kubrick and I must say, it's even funnier than I remembered it. I mean, there's Peter Sellers as an RAF captain named Mandrake, as President Merkin Muffley, and in the title role. He's a little amusing as the first character, quite funny in a deadpan way as the second, and hilarious as the third whenever his hand goes up or he tries to stop from that happening. As General Buck Turgidson, George C. Scott steals his scenes every time he goes on a tangent or when he's talking on the phone with his secretary (Tracy Reed) whom he beds. There's also Sterling Hayden as General Jack Ripper who keeps talking about ""fluids"" as if they're the most valuable thing who's both funny and frightening in his attitude. And then there's Slim Pickens as Major Kong whose most defining moment was when he took a ride on that bomb as if he was on a bull in a rodeo! I also was highly amused by Keenan Wynn's role as Colonel Bat Guano especially his line about the Coca-Coca company to Mandrake. And while there was nothing funny about James Earl Jones-in his film debut role-as one of Kong's men on the plane, I did think how amusing it was that his voice would later become the one that became Darth Vader on the Star Wars series. Of course, the accidental possible start of a nuclear war was-and still is-nothing to laugh at. But the way many of these characters talk and react to the possibility of it happening is hilarious in the way some think it's no big deal while others do think so but in the way they think of as celebratory. Stanley Kubrick gave plenty worth to laugh about while also making you think just how dangerous some people in power can get. So on that note, Dr. Strangelove...still can make one think while also still be quite entertaining. P.S. One of the writers, Terry Southern, was later on the staff of ""Saturday Night Live"" during the 1981-82 season and wrote a sketch about Dr. Strangelove (Tim Kazurinsky there) conferring with President Reagan (Joe Piscopo's voice since the entire sketch was presented on his point of view shot) on the same thing Sellers' Strangelove did to Muffley here. I thought it was funny enough for me."
"rick-frame-227-30194","10","2","5","8 July 2012"," Absurdist Black Comedy
","I first saw this on TV at age 17, on the insistence of my father. I knew nothing about the film. Dad had a devilish glint in his eye for some unknown reason, and seemed to watch me more than the film. Given the subject matter of the film, something didn't seem right. Well, I'll never forget the moment the light bulb went off in my head (Muffley's reaction to the fight), when I asked Dad, ""Is this a comedy?"". He joyfully laughed and said no more. The point which the director was making hit me like a ton of bricks: I was a victim of calculated subversion, and not just by the director. F'ing brilliant! And so began my appreciation for the gifts of Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>I wish everyone could have this kind of initial experience, going in only with some basic knowledge of Cold War history. There is no question, the level of absurdity in Strangelove grows as the nightmare builds. Perhaps for the reason that everyone will ""get it"", perhaps so the viewer will ""let go"" of the plot and examine the themes, characters and symbolism. Or absorb the stunning, searing image of Major Kong's wild ride."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","8","2","5","15 February 2012"," Satire done right.
","The best satires are ones that aren't done with a tongue in cheek or a wink in an eye, but rather with full sincerity all the way. Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a prime example of how to make a satire the proper way. There aren't any quick nods to the audience to let them know that the film is in on the joke, or cheap low-brow comedic moments to let everyone feel safe in accepting that this is a straight comedy. No, instead the film takes itself just as seriously as Citizen Kane and it's that blunt honesty that makes it so hilarious.<br/><br/>It's a wickedly intelligent script, conceived from the genius mind of Stanley Kubrick who realized the comedic potential in the material (the source was a very dramatic affair before he turned it into satire) and all of his actors come along and play the game exactly as they should; as if they were acting in something out of a David Mamet play. There's never that nod to the audience, but instead the film trusts that the audience is smart enough to get it and thus everything becomes hilarious instead of tired and trying.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers is a work of art here, practically deserves a medal for his seamless ability to portray three different characters (in three different accents no less) with full believability. If you didn't know it was him in all three roles there really wouldn't be any way of telling. Each character is so distinct and created so fully by him and the writing, and he gets a real kick out of playing off the different supporting members of the cast. Sterling Hayden is a commanding force of hilarity, but for me the entire film was stolen by George C. Scott, in a comedic work of art rarely seen in cinema. Scott has the capacity to be a viciously intimidating presence and he utilizes that ability to poke fun at his ignorant and childish character, but only in the sense that the audience can see what a dud he truly is.<br/><br/>Scott is the ultimate representation of the film as a whole, an absolutely ridiculous situation played with the utmost sincerity. He dives into this character full on and removes any of that artificial vanity that comes with being an actor, and as a result he got major laughs from me all the way. The film is loaded with iconic lines that delivered all the way, but even the moments that I hadn't already heard about were leaving me in stitches. Tremendous work socially, politically and comically."
"PWNYCNY","10","2","5","28 January 2012"," Plausible story.
","This movie is both hilarious and chilling, hilarious because of the caricatures of real people it portrays, and the pomposity of power, and chilling because of the story's plausibility. A depraved psychopath launches a nuclear strike, putting the whole world at risk,, and the group charged with the task of heading off total destruction includes a Nazi, a warmonger, a president with no real power and drunk Soviet premier. One may dismiss such a scenario as mere literary hyperbole, but sadly, such characters do exist. When the president learns that his authority has been circumvented, he is powerless to do anything about it, revealing that the presidency itself is a sham and that there is no way to prevent a cataclysmic catastrophe. All the safeguards are revealed to be mere window dressing that are meant to lull the public into believing that a disaster could never happen. This movie includes many scenes that provoke laughter, but it is laughter that masks the truth which is that the whole world is at risk.<br/><br/>This is a classic movie because it deals with themes that transcend time and are applicable to the human condition. This movie is about the imperfections of people and how these imperfections can create huge problems. It is also about what can happen when people engage in brinkmanship, using weapons of mass destruction as leverage. Things can spiral out of control quickly and irreversibly. Some characterize this movie as a so-called black comedy. But there is nothing funny about the story, unless one feels that caricatures of people in varying degrees of regressive personal self-destruction is amusing. This movie shows what happens when people entrusted with safeguarding the nation really don't know what they are doing and the act in bad faith to try to cover their failures. This is most apparent in the role played by George C. Scott whose performance is brilliant. He captures the essence of a senior general who is is little more than a dilettante in a uniform and has nothing to offer to resolve the crisis, of which he is partly to blame, and knows it. This movie is effective precisely because its story is so plausible, and no amount of diligence can guarantee that something awful and catastrophic can be prevented. The human factor simply defies that kind of control."

That is what makes this one Kubrick's most accessible masterpiece. His observations still remain both insightful and relevant today and Sellers' multiple performances only grow in power with age.

","Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1964<br/><br/>Top 15 - 1960s<br/><br/>Released amidst the height of the space and technological race, between the USA and the USSR, perhaps the peak of the mutual nuclear terror that was the 'Cold War', and a 36 year old director named Stanley Kubrick manages to encompass the whole subject and satirise the hell out of it. 'Dr Strangelove' must not only be approached as an ingenious, innovative comedy, but also as a frighteningly alarming montage of the almost unlimited power possessed by our governments. Strangelove is no less relevant today than it was 40 years ago.<br/><br/>When an insane general starts a process of nuclear extermination against Russia, his manic executive officer Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to persuade him otherwise. The news spread quickly and the government's top officials meet in the War Room in the Pentagon, where the president Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is enraged at the possibility of a nuclear holocaust occurring within minutes and without his permission. A supporter of 'Plan R' is General Buck Turgidson, played by the superb George C. Scott, who exercises his facial muscles very much like Jim Carrey without seeming outrageous. The other character is of course Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) an ex Nazi government scientist who has an idea of building of post-apocalyptic society with '1 man to every 10 women'.<br/><br/>Kubrick's masterpiece is undoubtedly one of the most sarcastic, intelligently written films of all time. The script is sheer genius. Based on Peter George's Cold War thriller 'Red Alert', a serious and frightening novel, the adaptation became as Kubrick himself described 'a nightmare comedy'.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers is without a doubt astonishing and so is George C. Scott in a masterful comedic performance that is equally admirable as that of Sellers.<br/><br/>The film is filled with sexual innuendo, from its characters' names (Strangelove, Jack D. Ripper) to smart undertones present so frequently, you can probably spot more each time you watch the film.<br/><br/>Sexuality is a main theme in Strangelove (look at extract below) <br/><br/>From the opening scene of the B-52 ""mating"" in flight with the KC-135 Tanker (set to an instrumental version of ""Try a Little Tenderness"") to General Ripper's sexual frustration being at the root of the eventual apocalypse, sexual references are apparent throughout the film.<br/><br/>The character of Dr. Strangelove is laced with innuendo, even aside from his suggestive name. He is the character responsible for creating fantasies of a polygamous post-apocalyptic society with a ratio of ""ten females to each male"", suggesting Nazi efforts like the Lebensborn project. This raises the possibility that the subtitle of the film refers to Dr. Strangelove as the ""I"" who learned to ""love the bomb""  because the mutual destruction of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. would make way for the return of the Nazis.<br/><br/>General Jack D. Ripper is named after Jack the Ripper, the infamous serial killer who murdered prostitutes in London in the late 1880s. General Ripper's primary concern about Communism is his assertion that water fluoridation is ""a Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids,"" of which he was made aware when his ""loss of essence"" during sexual intercourse greatly fatigued him. He continues to explain that women ""seek the life essence"" and then states, ""I do not avoid women...but I do deny them my essence"". Here, ""essence"" is used as a synonym or euphemism for ""semen"".<br/><br/>Many characters' names involve sexual wordplay. Group Captain Lionel Mandrake's last name refers to the Mandrake plant, which has mythical fertility properties. The Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadesky is named for the Marquis de Sade, and Premier Dmitri Kisov's last name is pronounced ""Kissoff""; literally a pun on ""kiss off"". Major ""King"" Kong rides a phallic-looking H-bomb, which explodes as he approaches the ""target of opportunity"", Laputa (in Spanish: la puta means ""the whore""). President Merkin Muffley's first and last name each crudely imply that he is a pussy by nature, since a ""merkin"" is a female pubic wig used mainly by prostitutes in the 18th century, and 'muff' (pubic hair) refers to the area where the wig is applied. The name of General Buck Turgidson is derived from turgid, a biological term meaning full of fluid to the point of hardness, as in an erection, applied to ""buck"" as an explicit symbol of virility.<br/><br/>Colonel ""Bat"" Guano's name literally means ""bat-feces"", whereas scatological and sexual humour are often combined. The term 'bat-shit' is also a slang word for insanity. Although sent to arrest General Ripper, Colonel Guano turns out to be another Anticommunist who feels the Communist threat as sexual, namely ""preversion"".<br/><br/>There is only one woman in the entire film; General Turgidson's secretary. She appears not in an office, but in a small bedroom with twin beds and a sun lamp, wearing a bikini swimsuit. The General, when he appears from the bathroom, also wears bathing trunks. Although she tells a caller that she and the General are completing paperwork, the clear implication is that they have a sexual relationship. In fact, in a later phone call, Turgidson tells her that he does not love her only for her sexual favours, and that he intends to make her his wife.<br/><br/>This apocalyptic, darkly humorous cult film come highly recommended to anyone with a little wit and appreciation towards the medium of film <br/><br/>8/10"

He proceeded to create cinema's most stunning satyr to date.<br/><br/>The crazed (and perhaps sexually inadequate) General Jack T. Ripper (Hayden) orders his planes to go into radio silence and drop their nukes on Russia. this creates diplomatic turmoil as the inept US president (Sellers) and drunk Russian premier bicker over the phone to assign blame, knowing that unless the planes are stopped, automated retaliation systems will be activated and the world will pretty much suffer a nuclear holocaust.

Meanwhile, efforts are made to capture Ripper - from without and within, thanks to his hapless British adviser Mandrake (sellers again) - and reach the planes.<br/><br/>The most ironic part of the plot is that you could almost imagine it being a credible Tom Clancy novel. Yet most of its potential lies in the absurd, and it is perfectly captured by side-splitting dialogue, dead serious expressions, and stellar turns by Peter Sellers, probably the greatest chameleon of comedy ever to grace the screen.<br/><br/>But for all the excellent cast's madness, this remains Kubrick's show throughout. Witness the atmospheric sets, gorgeous photography, and immortal shots (something regarding a cowboy and a nuclear missile). Kubrick also very aptly uses the theme of sexual repression to underline all these violent boys' aggressiveness: the film begins with planes ""fornicating"" in mid-air, while something is blatantly wrong in Ripper's pants. and then there's that ending, something only Kubrick would have dared...<br/><br/>To anyone interested in war, politics, History or even the state of humanity in general and capable of self-deprecation, I can not recommend this film strongly enough.

It's not that nuclear war or communism could ever really be funny; by skewering McCarthyists and John Birchers, we can see here how the joke was very much on us -- on our cultural reaction to those phenomena. Today, we can laugh at this in comfort, because of the distance. <br/><br/>Consider how many ways this has influenced our culture, from ""A Boy and his Dog"" to ""Wargames""...and not just movies, but popular music as well; ""Grace Under Pressure"" immediately comes to mind. It is this self-rejuvenating quality of the priceless fragments that makes Strangelove so important. <br/><br/>The key was the implementation of Sellers as the narrator(s). He would famously say in interviews that he thought of himself as having no inherent identity, only the identity of the character he played at any given time. <br/><br/>Here he's in his element...imagine what an even greater coup he could have pulled off if he hadn't broken his leg during filming. He still gives us 'Mandrake' played as Clouseau, 'President Muffly' played as Adlai Stevenson, and the evil 'Doctor' played as a Fritz Lang/Albert Speer concoction; all three fight for control 'in' the movie and 'of' the movie. In the end, only the Doctor gets what he wants, prompting his symbolic erectile response...this is juxtaposed with the phallic bomb causing the fireball 'orgasm'.<br/><br/>This is an early fruition of the Kubrickian 'camera participation' approach to film-making. Irreducibly hilarious pieces here, maybe not so much the entirety."

","There were a few funny parts in this film, and I do mean a few,and all Peter Seller's parts were good, but why is this film so highly rated? I understand that it is a black comedy, but it's NOT THAT FUNNY! I grew up at the end of the cold war, but i still don't understand why this film is so highly regarded,I like the way it was directed by Kubrick, but I liked Full Metal Jacket and his other films better. Kudos too George C. Scott too, he was a good second banana is this film. I kept watching it asking myself when is it gonna get really funny, and it never did. The characters were good, the direction was good but compared to other black comedic films such as Mel Brook's. This one just falls short of my expectations."

","What can I say about this movie?  Hm..... I have a few words, like boring, pointless, unentertaining... just to name a few mind you.  Obviously, I didn't enjoy this movie, and that's an understatement.  Maybe I wouldn't go as far to say that this movie was pointless, because it did have a message, if you are intelligent enough to catch it, or that is was unentertaining, because to some people, other than myself, this was probably a great movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is my review, so here it goes.  Rather than tell you all the things I didn't enjoy about this movie, and trust me, there are quite a few, I'm going to focus on the only thing worth mentioning, Peter Sellers. Honestly, he's the only reason I kept watching, the versatility he has with acting blew me away.  Playing three completely different characters, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, U.S. President Merkin Muffley, and the hilarious former Nazi genius  Dr. Strangelove, Sellers captivates the audience with his range of talent.<br/><br/>Not only did Sellers do an outstanding job with his characters, but the characters he portrayed were the most vital out of the whole movie.  The Group Captain, President, and Doctor, where the only characters capable of preventing the bombing of the U.S.S.R after General Jack Ripper orders his bomber wing to do the deed.   Captain Mandrake was the only person in contact with Jack Ripper, President Muffley was trying to reason with the Soviet President, while Dr. Strangelove knows exactly what is going to happen if the bomb does in fact drop.  So, do these three characters stop the bomb in time?  You're going to have to watch the movie"

","Kind of dated. I get what it's trying to say and it's not that it's subtle it's just kind of lacklustre. I'm a bit so what about it all.<br/><br/>The multiple characters of Peter Sellers just feel self indulgent and it takes a long time for this movie to smugly come round to the revelation that not all politicians are the most admirable of people.<br/><br/>It's not a comedy and it's not a dark comedy. They tack on a comedic tone to the familiar red scare paranoia caricatures and you can almost here the canned laughter.<br/><br/>And of course you shouldn't fight in a war room. That's not ironic at all."

","I watched this yesterday - it's not every day you get to watch something that mythical. So what was all the hype about? Dr Strangelove has a reputation, but that's about it. The plot itself is the weak point of the film: it's irrelevant to us today.<br/><br/>Was it more relevant for people during the cold war? Probably. But for a film to be a classic, it cannot age if the politics have changed.<br/><br/>The treatment of the topic is funny, but only at times (about 3 times during the whole film). I found it long, tedious to watch, and it's not a long film. Peter Sellers is good, but it takes more than his individual talent to lift it up. It was like a story I can't relate to.<br/><br/>It's directed by Stanley Kubrick? So what? I don't rate a film according to who directed it, even if the director is considered a god by some. After all I disliked Eyes wide shut and found 2001 boring too.<br/><br/>So I guess it's probably because I'm not a Kurbick fan in the first place."

","'Doctor Strangelove' is considered one of Kubrick's best films, and it's been referenced in many other documentaries and films. The best thing about this film is its dark humor. The film centers around politicians in the eve of a nuclear holocaust. The comments by some of the characters about nuclear war is crazy -- it's so insane and stupid that you cannot help but to laugh at some of the comments (ie: 'precious bodily fluids'). Even watching the cowboy riding on top of the nuclear warhead as it plummets to the Earth is hilarious, in a dark and disturbing way.<br/><br/>Some people probably won't 'get' this humor or understand it. As a film, it really is not that great. It's a pretty good and different view of nuclear war, which was controversial (hence its popularity), but it isn't a great film. It's just different."

"raypdaley182","6","5","20","21 October 2007"," Woefully outdated & full of mistakes.
","When this was made, it was very much of it's time and quite accurate. With Reds under beds and paranoia at it's highest level until The Bay Of Pigs incident & The Cuban Missile Crisis, this movie fitted the time it was made. The height of The Cold War and neither side looked like backing down made this film what it was then.<br/><br/>Sadly now with the fall of the USSR, Glasnost and the ACE treaty this could never happen. B-52's no longer circle in constant readiness having been superseded by ICBM's and even those are constantly being disarmed.<br/><br/>The entire plot revolves around the idea that one rogue US General decides to start World War 3 all by himself by issuing irrevocable orders. This is of course ridiculous as the only thing required to stop the very slow Bombers is to scramble very fast Fighter jets after them and blow the Bombers out of the sky which would be done as soon as The Pengtagon found they were unable to communicate with the Bombers to recall them. They would willingly sacrifice their own Bombers rather than risk a full scale nuclear war.<br/><br/>The 1st mistake is a General wouldn't command a Wing, it would be a Colonel. The US equivalent rank of Mandrake would be a Colonel. The 2nd mistake is General Ripper telling Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellars) to implement Plan R for Robert (when he should say Romeo and an officer of his experience should have known that). Mandrake should have refused to follow the order for that reason alone (Incorrect procedure). Fortunately the actors in the plane do NOT make the same mistake.<br/><br/>Likewise General Turgison's phone conversation with Colonel Puntridge is a mistake as it would never take place over an insecure line with the topic they are discussing. Ripper's tannoy to the base is also incorrect (no matter what, he would never say ""Commie"" over a tannoy, he'd more likely say ""The Enemy"").<br/><br/>Mandrake soon finds out there is no state of war by listening to his own radio and goes to see what's happening. Kong's message over the flight intercom telling all the men about the radio frequency is wrong. Each man has those orders printed in front of him and would know that frequency from them, him telling them over the intercom risks that frequency being overheard. Likewise he would not give the target over the frequency or warhead yield for the same reason.<br/><br/>The Plan R they discuss in the war room is now an outdated concept since the introduction of ICBM's as they are programmed to fire without human operators to give MAD (mutally assured destruction). An Army Unit is ordered to take Ripper's base and put him in contact with the War Room, the base troops of course think anyone attacking are Russians in disguise because of what Ripper told them (another ridiculous idea).<br/><br/>The Russians reveal their Doomsday machine and it is explained to the US President (Peter Sellars) by Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellars). In the shots where Rippers office is being shot at there are several times where Ripper should be hit and killed. After his men surrender, Ripper shoots himself to make sure the recall codes can't be found and the Bombers can't be bought back. <br/><br/>Now, if the missile that was fired at Kong's B-52 was a nuke, it would have been unable to finish it's mission once it detonated (even though it didn't actually hit them). The EMP would have destroyed all the on-board electronics forcing the B-52 to land. This destroys the radio and the B-52 can now no longer communicate with the outside world (the pilot should have immediately stood down from his mission).<br/><br/>The B-52 Navigator is played by James Earl Jones in his 1st ever movie role. The recall code is given (having been worked out by Mandrake from a note on Ripper's desk) and acknowledged by 30 planes and with 4 shot down all planes are accounted for until The Russians admit 1 plane may have only been damaged (Kong's B-52). When they discover they don't have enough fuel to even hit their primary target, Kong's B-52 should turn back but Kong is determined to hit any target no matter what and diverts to an ICBM complex at Kodlos (now if The Russians were using ICBM's what was the point of the Americans using B-52's which were much slower?). A really huge mistake is Kong ordering an air-burst attack but then setting detonation altitude at zero feet (or ground level, so hardly an air-burst!).<br/><br/>On finding the bomb doors have failed Kong has yet ANOTHER reason to to stand down (especially after both manual opening fails and explosive opening fails) but doesn't. By refusing to stand down by this point Kong far exceeded any field authority he had as Captain. His co-pilot, navigator and bombardier should have all ordered him to stand down and in fact relieved him of his command for refusing to do so.<br/><br/>Now without this film Dark Star would not exist and Alien would have never been made.<br/><br/>The height the bomb was dropped from it would never have time to arm itself. The ending of discussing how to continue life in mine shafts (there must have been a huge section cut where they said the Doomsday Device went off) and the shots of all the nuclear bombs is a very weak ending indeed in a generally bad film which isn't funny and hasn't stood the passage of time well at all."

","Who really cares about one man's ""essence?"" This was a comedy that I really didn't find too funny. Some films are hard to imagine watching them without wide screen, and this movie is a perfect example of that. There was low key lighting throughout the film and it wasn't that great. I think Kubrick did a good job directing it, i just personally didn't enjoy watching this movie. The camera work on some parts of the film was shaky. It worked for certain parts (like in the beginning when the men first got the message of the attack on the plane, the camera was shaking and it gave the illusion you were on the plane with them -mis-en-scene-) but other times when the camera was shaky it just made the viewer dizzy. This was a very feminist movie, with many sexual references throughout it. I mean there were sexual references put into every thought of this movie, even down to the characters names! I mean really ""Merkin Muffley"" Merkin meaning a female pubic wig, and Muff is just another name for public hair. They were basically calling their president a vagina! I got a slight over all message through the movie of the corruption in our government at the time, and how Kubric wanted to make a mockery of it. Some parts of the film had great comic relief, but i didn't understand much of it. Over all- wasn't a huge fan. It was good, but not great."

In 1964 we lived under a constant largely imaginary threat of nuclear holocaust.It kept us in line in much the same way as the threat of Al Quaeda does today.And the threat of eternal damnation did two hundred years earlier. Instead of the big bad Reds it is ""The axis of evil"" and ""Rogue States"" that are our enemy now.The result for us is just the same,we meekly hand over our taxes to whoever at the moment is slopping around in the trough and they keep the shareholders at British Aerospace Arms Division and Boeing in the style to which they have become accustomed. ""Dr Strangelove"",like many a Kubrick movie,is merely an overstatement of the bloody obvious.It is clothed with the trappings of the satire boom which was reaching its peak at the time,Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce in the U.S.,""Private Eye"" and ""Beyond the Fringe"" here in the U.K. In the persona of Dr. Strangelove himself,Mr P.Sellers gives one of the worst performances ever seen in a so - called"" serious "" movie.This is closely followed by George C.Scott and Sterling Hayden in a tie for runner - up.

It looks very fresh , even though it is black and white and the dialogue is very funny but not is a rolling around on the floor kind of way. Although the lead actor is Peter Sellers ( he plays three parts) the man who steals the show is George C Scott who plays the war mongering commie hating general.

"johnmschofield","10","2","6","19 September 2009"," This is one film where I laugh virtually all the way through
","This is one of my favourite films. It is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made. All of the main characters are perfectly cast and Peter Sellers was at his breathtaking best. I very rarely single out anybody in any film but I make an exception in his case. He died almost thirty years ago at the age of 54 and apparently making this film with all the numerous professionals was extremely difficult for the director because there were times when the entire cast and crew were helpless with laughter because of him. When you watch this film you can understand why. Virtually all of the main characters are absurd mentally challenged individuals who really should not be let out in public on their own. Of course it is part of the films appeal that you keep being introduced to them and you laugh at their square peg in a round hole antics but at the same time you marvel at how complete basket cases can rise through the ranks and occupy positions of real responsibility. Forty five years after this film was made things have not changed much, this film is still as good today as it was then and in reality we are still as scared now as we were then. The lunatics are still running the asylums and the fact that so far we have not had a nuclear war is down to the probability that if there was, nobody would survive anyway and considering what the earth would be like after the bombs have dropped who would want to survive. This film is only just over an hour and a half long but it packs in so much in that time it seems to be a lot longer. I don't watch this film as often as I should but when I do I am reminded of the tale which as far as I am aware actually happened that in the late 1970's there was a serious alert in the USA which went to the last but one level before being stood down caused by one man who thought he saw something hostile approaching on his computer equipment and hurriedly pressed the button to start the USA's reaction. Real life is infinitely more unbelievable and frightening than any film which is why I would highly recommend anybody watch this film. I guarantee you will not be disappointed."

","What do you get when you mix the sheer genius of Stanley Kubrick, the appeal of the black comedy genre, the funny performance of Peter Sellers and a thrilling political plot? What you get is ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"", a film that's bound to be hailed forever as the best black comedy ever! When a crazy army general who keeps raving about how the Russians are ""polluting our bodily fluids"" orders a massive attack on Russia, his aid Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) tries to wiggle out of him the army code that will stop the invasion. Inside the Pentagon's secret War Room, the US president (Peter Sellers), with the aid of America's most powerful men, gets on the phone with the Russian president trying to calm down the heat while his own adviser, the ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers...again) convinces him that this attack will detonate a massive nuclear weapon that will annihilate all human life on Earth.<br/><br/>As you may be thinking, this is a far-fetched plot that screams of political intrigue and military action. A political thriller, if you will. Now mix in the fact that every character is seriously funny, that the dialogue is spiked with wit, irony and double-meaning, that every frame in the movie carries hilarious innuendo, that most of the twists and hilarious situations are a result of the fact that every military order and political negotiation is carried out through the phone...and you get an exciting, intelligent, immensely funny movie event that you'll remember forever.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers is hysterical in each of his three roles. As the witty, fast-talking but awkward British captain Mandrake, he is vaguely reminiscent of his role in the Pink Panther films. As the useless and so-serious-he's-funny US president, he adds a satirical tone to the film. And most importantly as the colourful and quirky Dr. Strangelove, he presents us with a character that's bound to be remembered in film history.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is at the top of his form for this film. He's managed to make the movie about everything at the same time. A political satire, a criticism on war, a criticism on nuclear weapons, a searing portrayal on sex and its blinding recurrence in mens' minds, and altogether a hilarious, intelligent and thoroughly enjoyable film.<br/><br/>I know I'm not being fair to the film. It's so much greater than what I'm actually portraying it to be, but I can't indulge in explaining how much a masterpiece, a paramount in film history it really is without divulging a great number of spoilers. I'll just say that you should pay careful attention to every situation, to every frame, to every line of dialogue. You'll be blown away by the kind of genius this film is.<br/><br/>And there's a plus! This is the kind of film that lingers with you, that makes you think. And it's about so many topics that you'll find yourself thinking about and relating it to so many situations nowadays, giving the film a current relevance that is simply surprising for a film made in 1964.<br/><br/>Whatever your favourite film genre is, you'll have a wonderful good time with this one. See it NOW. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"

Even though it's a satire it's full of very unlikable, totally crazy characters. It's shot in stark black & white and I still don't find the idea of nuclear war very funny. Also Kubrick has always been a very 'cold' director--he seems very cynical in all his movies and they have a cruel, detached view to them (especially ""2001""). This is no exception but I have to admit it is (in its way) a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It's never dull, has some incredibly funny moments (Sellers conversations with the Russian premier are hysterical) and moves like lightning. The cast is just great--George C. Scott enjoyably goes barreling out of control as the military leader; Sterling Hayden is just great as the guy who starts the war; even Slim Pickens was good! And this was James Earl Jones' first film.<br/><br/>But this film belongs to Peter Sellers--he plays three different roles and he's magnificent in all of them.

Starring Peter Sellers, in three roles, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden, Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove tapped into the overwhelming fear of nuclear war that was immensely prevalent in the 1960's. Analyzing the threat of overreach of power and the ego problems that arise in international politics, Dr. Strangelove is as relevant today as it was in the heart of the cold war. <br/><br/>Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has lost his mind. The poor General has gone completely mad, blaming fluoridated water for altering his body chemistry and contaminating his body fluids, Gen. Jack D. Ripper is sure that the U.S.S.R. is behind this conspiracy. Blaming the Russians for his ""ailment"", Gen. Ripper sends his command to destroy Russia and attack with nuclear weapons. Once he sets the attack in motion, a ""Doomsday Machine"", which nothing can stop is triggered. The ""Doomsday Machine"" was created with the purpose of destroying all plant and animal life on earth. Panic sets in when the U.S. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) and Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky (Peter Bull) realize there is only one way to stop the worldwide destruction already set in motion and that solution lies in placating an inebriated Soviet Premier and former Nazi commander Dr. Strangelove. The world is involved in a race against time in which one side losing means everyone loses. <br/><br/>I have such a strange relationship with the films of Stanley Kubrick. I more than recognize his supreme prowess as a film director. I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the first time this year and gave it a glowing 5- star rating, I find The Shining a shining 5-star film as well (see what I did there?). As much as I appreciate and respect his films, and see his superior directing in everything I've seen of his, I never reach for a Kubrick film to enjoy at random. There definitely ""mood"" films for me that I may only watch a couple times a year, although never tire of. I read that this was the final Kubrick film to be shot in glorious black & white, which is fantastic, as such a political satire begs to be shot in black & white. The tone is much more heightened and shadows can be more manipulated in B&W than in movies shot in color, and Dr. Strangelove necessitated a look that takes itself maybe too seriously, as a B&W film can. Peter Sellers is well known for the difficult task of playing three roles in this film, which he did wonderfully, especially the scene in which he was on an extended phone call resulting in several laugh-out- loud moments. George C. Scott more than stole the show, for me, however. Every time he was on-screen, Scott stole the scene. He overplayed his part to perfection, creating one of the best characterizations I have seen on-screen in recent memory. Of course, several Kubrick staples made it into the film including his penchant for long takes. Kubrick's long takes are always a joy for cinema lovers and were an absolute necessity for the dialogue-driven Dr. Strangelove. With a beautifully brilliant script, Stanley Kubrick struck gold again, creating a perfect political satire as relevant today as it ever was."

","Is someone rational in this movie? Everyone plans to outwit and outsmart the other one! But how could that be possible when all of them are completely 'bonkers'!? What a stunning facial expressions all the characters have! Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson is just fantastic - it could not have been better in his role. Thanks to the stupidity of Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper, the rest of the actors start shuddering in their acting. Where the heck Dr. Strangelove appeared from!? This unbelievable 'nazi-fascist' is the last straw that broke the camel's back in terms of laughing! I thought we had enough ridiculousness with Capt. Lionel Mandrake and President Merkin Muffley but I was wrong! Here all is possible - even inviting the Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky in the American politician round table. Such a brilliant idea by Stanley Kubrick in showing us what the world could have been if the path to nuclear holocaust came into reality with a little bit of giggling. Well-deserved #52 position for this movie that stops worrying about the Russia-America-War, and begins to love that bomb that they all tried to prevent from exploding."

","There is a simple message to be had from this film of course: in the words of Eric Idle ""There's fools and idiots sitting on the trigger."" and he ain't foolin'! When a US base commander goes ""a little funny in the head"" and orders a nuclear attack on Russia farce follows farce in ensuring the end of the world is actually delivered. And all to the sound of Vera Lynn...<br/><br/>The acting in this film is totally admirable. Peter Sellers has won the lion's share of the acclaim for his superb three role performance, but what about George C. Scott's opportunistic hawk general? Scott is absolutely brilliant, and Stirling Hayden isn't far behind him as General Jack D. Ripper, convinced the Commies are subverting our bodily fluids by fluorinating the water! Sellars shines supreme as the title character, whose rogue arm aches to snap the Nazi salute. And of course Slim Pickens' B52 commander, determined beyond the call of duty to deliver his 40 megaton payload.<br/><br/>Kubrikian touches abound, from the cinema verite combat scenes to the absurdity of having to raid a Coca Cola drinks machine for loose change to save the world this is so artfully stamped with his signature.<br/><br/>This is a brilliantly satirical film that is beginning to seem more not less relevant as time goes on. You only have to look at the future USA, UK, North Korea and Russia to agree with Mr. Idle."

The plot, the characters, the screenplay, the director work, the camera operator work, the playing of actors. It was truly awesome. Political satire and irony are made nice. It is really hilarious and you are laughing on that some absurd situations. The movie is got this spirit of the cold war and original Kubrick's style is likable. I think you will never forget this film if you saw it once. ""Dr Strangelove"" is a legendary movie that will never lose that charm. My only tip for you - just watch it. 10/10"

","Stanley Kubrick war comedy just shines in all colors that you can imagine, as it provides audience with twisty situations, funny conversations and some scenes where you feel all tensions and worrying. As movie keeps going it amplifies its impact and keep bringing more and more tense with questioning of what is going to happen and is there really treat such as Doomsday weapon. Creating some of very uncomfortable scenes that tend to bring just pure laugh with their seriousness. Towards the end Dr. Strangelove keeps to be in the center of attention as he delivers his ideas about what could happen and what to do with his serious determination but at the same time so comedic and physical movement and trouble with his arm. Also constant shifts towards Fuhrer are so funny so you can't help but laugh when such thing happens. Yet another brilliant movie by Stanley Kubrick that brings us happiness. 4/4"
"cro75","10","1","2","11 May 2015"," Brilliance in Peter Sellers/Kubrick Collaboration
","DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB is a monumental achievement in both filmmaking and performance art. Stanley Kubrick, director of a canon of classic films, takes audiences to a dark place, both emotionally and physically, in the form of a dimly lit ""war room."" This was released at the height of the Cold War, as détente was becoming more of a fantasy than reality. It is this, and the timing of the film's release, coupled with the black comedy Kubrick employs so seamlessly into near-tragic circumstances, that make this a watershed moment in film. The comedy here, as mentioned previously, is as dark a shade of black as you can find, but brilliantly executed due, in large part, to the performance(s) of Peter Sellers and George C. Scott. Peter Sellers was known as a British comedian, famous for his work in smaller British films, BBC Radio as a member of THE GOON SHOW, as well as LOLITA (1960), with Stanley Kubrick. This film not only introduced him to an international, Hollywood audience, but garnered him an Academy Award nomination for his work in playing three integral, central characters. (He is the only actor to ever accomplish this feat.) Amongst these characters include a by-the-book, but soon befuddled Royal Air Force officer, an Adlai Stevenson clone as President, and an ""uber maniacal"" former Nazi scientist after whom the film is named. His performances, measured alongside an uncharacteristically, but welcomely, zany George C. Scott, who plays the Curtis LeMay send-up as a Hawk-like, pugnacious Army officer very much in favor of bombing the Soviets, make the comedy land with force. This was also the film that introduced James Earl Jones to film audiences, as he helps to pilot a bomber, captained by General Kong (played hilariously by Slim Pickens, though only after Peter Sellers had to drop out of this fourth role due to an injury suffered while filming) that holds the very future of the world in its bomb compartment.<br/><br/>In all, this film - a darkly comedic look into the frigidity of the Cold War, at the possibility of what could happen should a nuclear attack become a reality, and how some of our most trusted politicians and their advisers might handle such a situation - is a landmark. If you are in the mood for a deeply disturbing, yet hilariously insightful, 95 minutes of Cold War comedy, I cannot recommend this enough. Although, really, no matter who you are, or what it is you like in film, I still could not recommend this movie enough. It has become one of my own personal favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"g-bodyl","10","1","2","28 February 2015"," Cold War Paranoia!
","Dr. Strangelove proves why Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors to have ever exist. He masters every genre, and political black comedies are no exception. This movie was made during the height of the Cold War, just after the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cuban Revolution, so this film was very timely. For those paying attention to current news, this film may also seem relevant today. The movie expands upon paranoia that was suffered during these years, and that created maybe the best film of this particular genre: political comedies. <br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's film is about a crazed general named Jack Ripper who orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. Now the President and his aides must rush against time in order to stop the attack. <br/><br/>Peter Sellers is a great actor and he shows his versatility by playing three key roles: Ripper's second-in-command, the President, and the strange Dr. Strangelove, apparently a former Nazi. My favorite role of Sellers was the crazy doctor and his German accent. George C. Scott was also very good, as the general always questioning the orders of the President. <br/><br/>Overall, Dr. Strangelove is one of cinema's best comedies you'll ever see. I'm sure this film influenced modern political comedies such as 2006's Thank You for Smoking and 2008's Burn after Reading. But this is a film also known for its relevance as many people in the United States were afraid the Soviets were going to attack them and start a nuclear holocaust. But relevance aside, this is one of the very best of the genre and of Kubrick's career. Those plane exterior shots make be plainly fake, but that is only a very minor complaint. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"crculver","9","1","2","16 February 2015"," Kubrick's 1964 slapstick on the extinction of mankind is a perennial classic
","Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film DR. STRANGELOVE is a hilarious film about the nuclear annihilation of the human race. Its plot combines three strands that lead inevitably to this doomsday. In the first, an Air Force base commander (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches the go-code for his B52s to drop the bomb on their targets in Russia, while a British captain on an officer exchange program (Peter Sellers) tries to reason with him. In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb. Finally, there are the scenes from the Pentagon war room, where the American president (again Peter Sellers) harangues a general (George C. Scott) about how this could have happened, until the mysterious German scientist Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again) offers a solution.<br/><br/>Originally meant to be a straightforward adaptation of a political thriller novel, DR. STRANGELOVE became a madcap comedy. The characters' sexual quirks, anti-Communist hysteria and nonchalance about the coming apocalypse are exaggerated to the point of farce. No other Peter Sellers film shows off his range of talents so well: he segues effortlessly between Captain Mandrake, a nervous fellow with a British accident already antiquated at the time the film was made, the staid American politician President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove, one of the Nazi scientists that the USA brought over after World War II.<br/><br/>Filmgoers must have perceived this film somewhat differently, when the threat of nuclear annihilation felt very real. Contemporary audiences won't fully get how black this black comedy is. Nonetheless, this film remains perennially funny, and even after numerous viewings over the last 15 years or so I still laugh every time."
"panchodh_12","9","1","2","20 January 2015"," A Cold War gem
","This movie hilariously depicts how absurd the Cold War was. Especially in the early 60s, when this movie was made and the world was so close to Nuclear War, it was almost as if people actually wanted it. Some just for the sake of the show, or curiosity of how it would actually look like, and some because they had actually suffered all the brainwashing that came with the Cold War. I think that what's best achieved in this movie is how hilarious yet realistic the whole situation is. I mean, had someone actually sent those poor boys in nuclear planes to drop a nuclear bomb in real life, I bet their reaction wouldn't have looked much different. And it's funny because we've all consumed the imagery of war full of heroes ready to die for their Motherland or an Idea, while in reality it's just made of flesh and bones people, more similar to the ones in this movie. That's what makes this movie so great: it deconstructs all the social meaning charged into the ideas of Superpowers, Nation, War. In the end, it's just people. Mention apart deserves the great acting in that good ol' American accent of the 50s and 60s, which makes the script even funnier. Sellers, Scott and Hayden pull of amazing performances the three of them, specially Dr. Strangelove's amazing role. I only realized that Mandrake, the President and Strangelove where the same actor when reading the cast, and it makes Peter Seller's performance even more praiseworthy."
"RolyRoly","10","1","2","7 September 2014"," A landmark and a masterpiece
","Among the manifold injustices in the history of the Academy Awards are the facts that Dr. Strangelove did not win for Best Picture and that Peter Sellers did not win for Best Actor for any one of his three (and it could have been four) roles. Much as I enjoyed Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady, and even recognizing the narrow-minded conservatism of Hollywood in 1964, it is a gross indictment of the Academy. In fact, Sellers should have won for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, such is the magnitude of his accomplishment here.<br/><br/>I first saw this film in 1968, when I'd just turned 14. I can't count the number of times I've seen it since and, now that my own kids have come to recognize that Dr. Stangelove is the greatest comedy ever filmed (City Lights not too far behind), my work here is done."

"rtp4242","10","1","2","14 September 2013"," Classic Movie Review: Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb (1964) A Blast
","General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) is a general with a hair trigger. He's responded to a U.S. training exercise, by locking down Burpleson Air Force Base, and ordering attack R, a scenario where a U.S. fighter wing goes deep into Soviet territory, and drops its payload of nuclear weapons on Soviet cities. Ripper's British liaison, Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is convinced there is no attack coming, because he can hear civilian music on the radio. Mandrake begs Ripper for the recall codes for the fighter wing, but Ripper lets the attack go forward unabated.<br/><br/>In the Pentagon War Room, President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to get the Soviet Ambassador, (Peter Bull) to contact the Soviet premier Kisov on the phone to tell him that the US has launched a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by mistake. Muffley is also trying to get someone into Burpleson Air Force Base to get those recall codes from Ripper, so he orders an attack on Burpleson with different US forces. Ripper takes this to be the Russian attack and fights back, with Mandrake in tow, still pleading for the recall codes. At the war room, a bad situation gets worse, when the Soviet Ambassador reveals that his country has developed a doomsday device, and it will be triggered automatically in the event of a U.S. attack.<br/><br/>Muffley calls in Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) a holdover from WWII, to confirm the existence of the doomsday device. Can Merkin Muffley recall the fighter wing before they enter Soviet territory? Can the Soviets stop their doomsday device? Will a nuclear catastrophe be averted? <br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is an exceptionally good satire of the whole political and military mood of the U.S. and Soviet Union in the 1960's. There's the American military's paranoia about the Soviets keeping secrets, the Soviets desire to reach nuclear parity with America, the US generals advising that America can survive a nuclear attack, and both sides almost blundering into nuclear war, reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact George C. Scott's character was based on a real General in the Kennedy administration. JFK talked about a missile gap, George C Scott's character talks about a mineshaft gap. There are also theories floated about surviving a nuclear attack and repopulating the earth, that were popular in the 60's. A right wing conspiracy about fluoridation of water is also lampooned. This is political satire at its finest.<br/><br/>Sellers gives a tour de-force performance, playing three characters British officer Mandrake, a typical British stiff upper lip character, who is at his wit's end with the loony Ripper. Merkin Muffley, who might be an amalgamation of Hubert Humphrey and Adlai Stephenson, is a clueless president stuck in an impossible no-win situation. Muffley says the classic line, ""You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!"" But by far, my favorite character was Dr. Strangelove, an amalgamation of Werner Von Braun, and other WWI era Germans, whose arm has a mind of his own, and who shows a little too much gusto for his previous regime. Peter Sellers is much more well known for his Inspector Clousaeu , but these roles are much more complex and much more satisfying to me.<br/><br/>There are many more good performances in this movie. Sterling Hayden pays Jack D. Ripper as a man whose mind dances on the edge of sanity. George C. Scott gives a hilarious performance as a general devoted to the military strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, and adamantly against letting the Soviet Ambassador into the War Room. Who knew George C. Scott had impeccable comedic timing? Slim Pickens is also excellent as the proverbial cowboy pilot of one of the planes of the fighter wing.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick deserves a lot of credit for this movie, he co-wrote and directed it. There are some amazing shots in this movie, the wide shot of the War Room, the low angles and close-ups of Sterling Hayden, showing his flop sweat, the interplay of innocuous music with military scenes, like ""Try A Little Tenderness"" while the planes are refueling and a montage of bombs dropping while ""We'll Meet Again"" is playing in the background, all add to the satirical edge in this movie. And of course the iconic scene of Slim Pickens riding that bomb, this is a scene that is etched in every true movie fan's mind. And the whole movie is filmed in glorious black and white. This movie is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>For more explosive reviews, read my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

"patryk-czekaj","9","1","2","12 June 2012"," Kubrick's grand satire on the nuclear war
","Dr. Strangelove is a simply marvelous, absolutely ironical, and very clever satirical take on the possibilities of a nuclear war that might have arisen during the Cold War period. The constant, ridiculous disputes and fights between Americans and 'Ruskis' (as they are called in the movie) contributed to the fact that this movie actually took shape of a most pleasurable caricature of a war film ever.<br/><br/>I can only imagine how Stanley Kubrick suddenly realized that the script that he's been working on didn't really present this tremendously serious topic in a totally respectable manner, but absolutely on the contrary – as a genuine parody.<br/><br/>It's scary to laugh at such a tragic moment in the history of our world, but the way that Kubrick depicted all the imaginary (thankfully) events that lead on to a prospect of nuclear holocaust is so humorous that no one will be able to suppress laughter. I don't think that any other director will ever be able to do it in such a way that he has. It's hard to imagine the disturbing power of the message that the movie gave to the viewers in the times of its premiere. However, in fact, it may be right to say that people, scared of the concept of another war hanging over their heads, were walking out of the cinemas feeling much more relaxed, after seeing a film so brilliant and bizarre at the same time.<br/><br/>There are so many fantastic moments in the film that it would be hard to point out all of them, so I'll just mention some of my favorite: Gen. Turgidson starts a fight with the Russian ambassador and president Muffley says: 'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the war room!'; Capt. Mandrake trying to call Mr. President, when he doesn't have enough change to put in the phone machine, and asks for a collect call; the shooting of a Coke machine to get some pennies; the ridiculous phone call that Turgidson receives from his mistress during the serious talks in the War Room; Muffley's conversation on the phone with the Russian President; the scene of a soldier bull-riding a nuclear missile shouting 'woo-hoo'; every scene that includes Dr. Strangelove and his disobedient Nazi hand.<br/><br/>It's so full of totally humorous and absurd situations, ideas, sequences, notions, connotations, characters that it's simply overwhelming, in the most positive meaning of the word.<br/><br/>It's also packed with many splendid performances by a bunch of brilliant actors. Sterling Hayden as the paranoid Gen. Jack Ripper gives an exquisite show, being the one who actually started the whole nuclear mess. Later he tries to persuade his comrades that there is a possibility of a Russian fluoridation scheme to poison the US citizens. George C. Scott as Turgidson, laid back ladies' man and general full of hatred towards 'Ruskis'. But the biggest credit goes to the magnificent Peter Sellers, for his versatile and confident acting as three distinct characters. He is so convincing that it looks as though different actors played all of those parts. It's a shame that the Academy jury didn't award him with an Oscar, because the way that he portrays those three major persons is a standout achievement of his long career.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, if all the ideas that's been put out in Dr. Strangelove the world as we now know it probably would not exist. I mean, with all the talks about fluoridation, poisoning, and weapons of mass destruction that would destroy all life on Earth if somebody attacked the Soviet Union, it's hard to stay indifferent to the topic of nuclear disasters. However, as I mentioned it previously, the way that Kubrick was able to present all of the gimmicks is so laughable that it makes all of those notions unbelievable and nonsensical. <br/><br/>All of those factors combined make Dr. Strangelove a stop on the filmography road that no one should omit."

I mean you learn to identify the stereotypes and the problems that they will bring to the movie universe, but this don't spoil the fun in any way. I mean, you still want to watch what is going to come ahead and happens to be HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>OK, I wasn't LMAO and ROFL throughout the movie, but mentally I was just delighted which such finesse. I'm not going to spoil your fun, I don't even mean to get you disappointed with the movie just to drop you the ""You just don't get it"" line. But try to watch the movie and to put yourself in that time, it's like playing Russian roulete with a nuclear bomb revolver. The destiny of the entire world changes between hands constantly, by the way, in the hands of the most funny human people we can find and it relies on the most ""out of this world"" conversations you could imagine. You'll go crazy when the doomsday is about to happen because a military cannot find change to make a telephone call. This movie portrays the military powers in its comic facet. It's is just insanity to put such powers in the hands of anyone in the world, still we have many nations who could just destroy the planet if they want to. It means that the doomsday has the same probability to happen as a car crash.<br/><br/>When Petter Sellers is explaining his plans to keep the human species alive in case of a doomsday, you just can't help yourself but to put a smile in your face. The way he says ""MY FUHRER!"" with his uncontrollable nazi hand is just PURE GOLD and he keeps going with it.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 10/10 cause I was reluctant to watch it due to its age, still when I saw the credits I just realised what piece of jewellery I had right before my eyes.<br/><br/>SPOILER QUOTE: ""Gentlemen.

Surprisingly the politicians, the President in particular, comes off pretty well in the end. One slight niggle (for me) was that the film was shot in a 4:3 ratio and I'm afraid that did make it look a little dated.

Let's jump right in and go for condition red, that's a jolly good idea for a start, don't you think? Make yourself at home in the war room, where a poster makes it perfectly clear that ""peace is our profession""! Here, take some gum! You might have guessed it already: If you want your humor black and apocalyptic, you've found the right movie. The doomsday machine is waiting for its cue, as some madmen got something up their sleeve. Well, admittedly, there's a wee bit of inconvenience with that whole affair, because somehow the legendary red button actually already got pushed, and it's only a matter of time until... But don't you worry - the two presidents are talking it out! However, should the world - against all odds - still stand after everything is said and done someone might get in trouble with the Coca-Cola company. Alternatively, look in your survival kit to find three lipsticks and some pairs of nylon stockings. That should help! Apparently there's no genre Kubrick couldn't do. Be it sci-fi, horror, war movie, epic, historical drama or political satire with this one - Kubrick's perfectionism leaves no doubt that he's master of his domain. And in the case of ""Dr. Strangelove"" he was also on the pulse of his time, or quite ahead of it if you will. As even decades later it's still OK to get goosebumps when Vera Miles' gets to finally sing ""We'll meet again""..."

I think there has never been a more mordant political satire ever filmed, nor hardly ever a better movie, as far as that goes.<br/><br/>This movie came out when the cold war between the Soviet Union and the United states was in full swing. I don't recall it ever having been stated as an official policy, but the idea of mutual assured destruction (MAD) was in play--if one country tried to annihilate the other with a nuclear attack, there was enough time for the other to deploy an equally devastating retaliatory attack. This movie captures the absurdity of this situation wherein a single United States general goes nuts and orders a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. If you were not around to experience the fear and anxiety of the time, then this movie should convey a bit of the mood of the era that produced such a film. The concept of a Doomsday device that would be automatically triggered in the event of a nuclear bomb detonation was invented by Herman Kahn in his book, ""On Thermonuclear War,"" a book that Kubrick had studied for the film.<br/><br/>We have gone beyond the dread of apocalypse accompanying any world conflict and the times when a variety of fallout shelters were sold on lots like car lots, but even now the message here is not totally irrelevant-- someone misinterprets a blip on a radar scene, a missile is launched, retaliation ensues, and we are in dire circumstances. <br/><br/>However you are affected by the story you should be able to appreciate the genius of the execution. The black and white photography is used to great effect. The war room, with the ""big board"" and the eerily lighted monster conference table, has to be one of the grandest sets ever designed and constructed. Kubrick had a talent for realism as well. The battle scenes where the army tries to take the General's headquarters seemed like documentary footage. And it is hard to believe that the inside of the B-52 was not done inside of a real B-52 (apparently revealing the interior of a B-52 was classified at the time, but those in the know said that Kubrick's presentation was pretty much dead on.) Watching the crew of the B-52 calmly watch their radar screens while a missile tracked them was chilling, and the scene inside the plane when the missile exploded a couple miles away was masterfully done. <br/><br/>Every actor turns in a stellar performance, with Peter Sellers a standout in playing three different parts. If you did not know about this triple play, you would have not guessed it. When Sellers first realizes that General Ripper has gone round the bend with his concern about his precious bodily fluids, the expression on Seller's face is priceless.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant, presenting characters and situations that are exaggerated, but not totally beyond belief. As one example, consider the discussion about having select people live in mine shafts for a hundred years while waiting out the radioactive fallout. Given the distrust between the two nations you could imagine a General Turgidson worrying that the Soviets may take a bomb down with them into the mines so that when people emerge in a hundred years they would have the advantage.<br/><br/>The only minor flaw for me was the scene that has Colonel Bat Guano (if that really was his name) firing into a Coke machine and being sprayed by soda--such slapstick is not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the production.<br/><br/>The images on the Blu-ray DVD are crisp as might be expected. The DVD also contains a load of extras, the most interesting being pop-up picture-in-picture interviews and historical information relevant to what is on screen."

","Released in 1964, Dr Strangelove capitalises on the tension of global post-war paranoia and the tragic, blood-stained past to crack the most inappropriate jokes to devastating effect. Kubrick's black humour in Dr Strangelove was the joke needed to break the ice of the cold war – and despite its specific subject matter in this respect, his tendency to subvert conflict with comedy is universally appreciable. Dr Strangelove has the effect of La Grande Illusion, The War Game and Nuit et Brouillard rolled into one and injected with an infectious and hilarious absurdity. It is completely unique and the quintessential cold-war-era-HUAC satire. Probably my favourite film of all time.<br/><br/>Read my full review on my blog: http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/"

","I can't believe there is a minority that doesn't like this movie. I'll be the honest the first time I saw this movie I thought to myself ""what the hell was that??"". But after seeing it again I finally got it and the brilliance. I think some people expected laugh out loud non-stop comedy maybe. I don't know - just know I love this movie. Sellers was fantastic in it and the Hayden was very memorable. Despite it's age the movie is STILL relevant to the year 2011. I always knew there was more evil to fluoridation than I thought. But seriously I am actually not a Kubrick fan either - although I did find The Killing to be relatively enjoyable. If you didn't like it the first time I suggest watching Strangelove a year later and re-visit it. You might be surprised."
"bmvrock","9","1","2","3 April 2011"," Great Movie
","Dr. Strangelove is perhaps Kubrick's greatest film. It is also deeply flawed. The movie overflows with moments of comic genius, all motivated by Kubrick's devastating critiques of war and warmongers. Peter Sellers does a brilliant job in his three roles (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Mirkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove himself). And the fourth role intended for Sellers (Major ""King"" Kong) is filled admirably by Slim Pickens after Sellers broke his leg late in filming. The script is a showpiece of sight gags, caricatures, and dialogue. Especially notable are the monologues by the President while talking to a drunk Soviet Premier on the phone (we can't hear the answers). ""He went and did a silly thing."" Or: ""I'm just as capable of being sorry as you are."" Quoted out of context like this, they seem innocuous, almost boring. But Sellers has impeccable comic timing, and the whole speech has a cumulative effect. We feel like we're not supposed to be laughing at imminent nuclear war this film is the reason why Kubrick is THE MAN!"

Nazi scientists miraculously recovering from leg paralysis, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb saved the world, if not from nuclear genocide, at least from a fatal dose of pessimism.<br/><br/>If you understand the mechanics of the Cold War and are looking for a way to laugh at an imagined apocalypse then Dr. Strangelove is for you."

","This is one of those films everyone knows and yet surprisingly few have actually seen, which is a huge shame, as its Kubrick's best and probably the best Cold War film ever made too.<br/><br/>I suppose any review of this must start with Peter Sellers. He plays God-only-knows how many roles, fantastically funny and often unrecognisable in all of them. This film truly is a masterclass from possibly the greatest comic actor of them all. However, his support is also excellent, with not a single weak link.<br/><br/>The plot is pure Cold War paranoid fantasy, and I'm sure anyone who has any vague knowledge of that era of the War will be in stitches at the stupidity of it all.<br/><br/>But I don't suppose any of this would matter if the film wasn't so brilliantly funny. The 'Purity of essences' and, of course, the infamous last line are among the best evidence of the cinema as a worthy and intellectual art form.<br/><br/>That last point is definitely worth noting, a I can't pretend the humour is accessible for all. It's not full of fart gags or sex jokes, as we've come to expect, and I assume some may be put off by the black-and-white camera-work and the hand drawn titles, although for me they added to the charm of the film.<br/><br/>So, all in all this is possibly the greatest comedy, or at least satire, ever made - but not for everyone."
"namashi_1","10","1","2","16 January 2011"," A Great Film!
","Stanley Kubrick is one of those filmmakers, that can explain versatility in it's true sense. Kubrick has never been a person the Academy-Awards acknowledged, but a person that loved movies way too much.<br/><br/>'Dr. Strangelove' is amongst the greatest comic satires I've seen. It's a great film, that is in intact with humor, performances that are done with gusto, A Screenplay that is like Sunrise and direction that is neat in every aspect.<br/><br/>'Dr. Strangelove' is about an unhinged United States Air Force general who orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, and follows the President of the United States, his advisor's, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a Royal Air Force (RAF) officer as they try to recall the bombers to prevent a nuclear apocalypse.<br/><br/>Like it's idea, this 95-minute long feature is a pleasure to watch. Kubrick delivers each and every aspect so neatly, that I was once again in awe of him. Peter Sellers in 3 roles, is very good. George C. Scott is simply Godly as an over-the-top patriotic General. Others also deliver wonderfully.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick is still alive, so are Peter Sellers & George C. Scott. Their work in here, is enough to make them immortal. I can see myself as a grandfather years n years from now on, and I can see my grandchildren watching this 1964 cult-film. Bravo!"
"Supachewy","9","1","2","11 December 2010"," Absolutely Hilarious
","The war comedy Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden. The film takes place in planes over Russia, the war room, and in an American base.<br/><br/>Brigadier General Jack Ripper (Hayden) made the insane notion of dropping a nuclear weapon onto Russia during the Cold War. President Muffley (Sellers) must try and calm down the Russian President and make him understand that this attack was not planned by America just one crazy general. General Turgidson (Scott) tries to convince the President that maybe the attack isn't a terrible idea while spewing anti communist insults to the Russian Ambassador that is present in the war room. But the Russian Ambassador reveals that if Russia is attacked by a nuclear weapon a doomsday device will automatically go off destroying the entire world...<br/><br/>The screenplay by Peter George, Terry Southern, and Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest comedic screenplays of all time. Probably my favorite scene of the film is when the President is on the phone with the Russian President for the first time. The back and forth between the two is comedic genius and is humor that everyone can enjoy. Another comedic part I thought was quite hilarious was the classic line when the President told General Turgidson when he was attacking the Russian Ambassador that there is no fighting in the war room. My only problem with the screenplay was that it took a while to get into the film, by that I mean the introduction to the film was not as strong as the middle and end of it. But besides that this film is absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick directed this classic comedy and he did so brilliantly. His last film was the controversial Lolita and he goes to what could have been an extremely controversial film about the cold war if it wasn't comedic gold. There are many iconic shots in this film, the first that comes to mind is the shot of the entire board room. It is a simple shot but it is beautifully composed. I have to say it is hard to find a shot in this film, or any Kubrick film really, that is not masterfully done. Besides the great shots he got great performances from his entire cast.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers played three roles in this film, the president, Dr. Strangelove, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. In all three of those roles he used his comedic talents to make this film as great as it is. Sellers worked with Kubrick previously in Lolita and in both films he was absolutely wonderful. Above I mentioned the president and the Russian president's phone conversation, well that could not have been so hilarious without Sellers's great voice and facial expressions. Then when he is Dr. Strangelove he again uses his voice talents to win over many laughs. Sellers proves with this film that he is one of the greatest comedic forces of all time.<br/><br/>George C. Scott was also fantastic as General Turgidson, delivering plenty of laughs as well. My favorite scene with Scott was when he was explaining what was happening to the president. How he tried to make himself look like he could save the situation was just uproariously funny. He is an extraordinary actor overall, one of my favorite films features him in the Best Picture winner Patton where he also wins an Oscar for Best Actor. I would say that in this film Scott does an equally well done job as Sellers, which is saying a lot for the both of them.<br/><br/>Sterling Hayden has worked with Kubrick before in The Killing and in this film he delivers a fine performance as the insane General Jack Ripper. He delivers many great lines about fluids that guarantees a couple of chuckles from the audience. Hayden works quite well off of Sellers as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. I loved it when Hayden takes the machine gun and shoots it out the window out his fellow Americans.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 9/10, due to its great script, direction, and performances. I recommend this film to absolutely everyone, even those people that don't have an interest in film and just want to have a good time. This film features a great ending that is extremely hilarious as well. If you haven't seen this classic, go get it. Right now."

","This movie is outrageously funny for a war/apocalyptic plot. I never laughed out so much. The director, Stanley Kubrick's olympian reaches of perfection and creativity never ceases to amaze me! <br/><br/>The movie is about a private nuclear war waged by an insane general taking advantage of a tweak in the war codes, with the argument of the loss of ""precious body fluids"" thru water fluoridation by a Communist conspiracy; and the tussle extracting the secret codes from that general,to stop them from bombing Russia and survival plan when the situation gets out of hand.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers did a great job in three roles. The conversation between the US President (Peter Sellers) and the Soviet Premier was unbelievably funny.<br/><br/>George.C.Scott's role as General Tugidson was over-the-top hilarious. Every moment of his scenes made me twitch with laughter; his facial expressions where he learns about the ""Doomsday Machine' is a miracle. The role works in being is so inappropriate and antithetical to the situation.<br/><br/>The best scene of the movie for me was the Coca Cola scene where Peter Sellers asks the colonel to break the Coca Cola machine for some change to call President to give the recall code, to stop the guys from dropping the nuclear bombs on Russia. The scene was supposed to be so tense. The colonel answers ""That's private property. If you don't get the President of the United States on that phone, you know what's gonna happen to you? You're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola company."" I mean how did they come up such ideas? <br/><br/>""Mr. President, we must not allow a mineshaft gap!"""

","Stanley Kubrick's end-of-the-world comedy was merely topical back in 1963; today the film is essential viewing. No other Cold War feature (and certainly no straight-faced drama) so accurately depicted the lethal absurdity of the arm's race, and the chilling consequences of one rational madman pushing the wrong buttons. The stark overhead lighting and low-level camera angles aptly illustrated the combined myopia of the military, scientific, and political communities, with all three represented by the versatile Peter Sellers in a characteristic triple performance. The supporting roles are no less memorable: George C. Scott as Air Force hawk Buck Turgidson; Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper (who initiates the apocalypse to ""protect and preserve our precious bodily fluids""); Slim Pickens as B-52 pilot Major Kong (riding the Bomb like a bucking bronco to oblivion). The giveaway names only underline the broad simplicity of the satire, but oddly enough the sometimes childish (black) humor makes an already frightening scenario all the more plausible."
"wwe7961","10","1","2","17 October 2010"," Absolute perfection! Brilliant from beginning to end.
","When I decided to watch this movie for the first time today I thought that it was going to much like a ""Monty Python"" film. I love ""Monty Python"", but the movie I am reviewing today is different. ""Monty Python"" is funny humor that is filled with a lot of silly satire. With ""Dr. Strangelove"" it never seems to take itself really unseriously. Does it at times get unrealistic? Yes, but compared to most comedies this gets very subtle. The dialogue is simply amazing. In fact I think that if I called it that this movie has the best dialogue ever in a film I wouldn't get a lot if any backlash. The characters after seeing them one time I already feel like I have seen them a million times how memorable the characters are. The people who play the characters are just wonderful, and would like to thank them all. It just unbelievable what I got out of this movie. In my opinion it works well as both a comedy and a drama.

Historically important in its timing, its nightmares being those of the early 1960s, it once more has genuine and chilling resonance in the early 21st century.

","Kubrick seems to turn everything he touches into gold and the same goes for ""Dr. Strangelove"" This film is plagued with fantastic acting, flawless direction, well built/chosen sets, and a timely theme. Kubrick masterfully turns a movie about the Cold War into what he has termed a 'nightmare comedy'. This comedy carries with it a heavy message about how foolish war is and how flawed and foolish the people who start the wars are.<br/><br/>The history behind this film is also very interesting. Many lines were dubbed over and scenes cut out of sensitivity to the sudden Kennedy assassination during filming. Mentions of ""Dallas"" were dubbed over to ""Vegas"". The original ending—the pie fight—was taken out all together.<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" is a must see. It is rightfully cemented as a modern classic due to Kubrick's genius."

","This is truly an excellent view into both Kubrick's humour and view of the world. The movie is basically about the paranoia and stupidity of both the US and the Soviet. Both try to prevent getting killed by the other, and end up blowing each other up. I think this is the only funny nuclear holocaust film I've ever seen. It's just one problem after another, more prejudice, more stupidity and more paranoia after the other. <br/><br/>And Peter Sellers plays excellent as three distinct characters. he's the president of the United States, an British RAF officer, and the rather strange ex-Nazi German scientist; Dr. Strangelove. The special effects can be a little quirky, but you hardly notice. This is the ultimate black comedy, and I give it a 10/10."

Kubrick's stark, documentary style contrasts perfectly with the comic proceedings, creating a sense of uneasiness. Sellers is excellent playing three characters, including the title role of a mad scientist. Scott is hilarious as a war hawk general.

","I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Strangelove, and if political/cold war doomsday satire is your cup of tea I'm sure you will as well. The characters of the movie were certainly the most satirical aspect. Peter Sellers does a great job portraying different political archetypes, such as a helpless leader, as well as a technology crazed ""mad scientist"". The General was a strong analogy for the eager-to-fight leader who wants nothing more than to see the fun toys the military has at its disposal to be put to use. The film came from a time in which society was caused a great deal of distress due to the significant potential for have government officials acting as recklessly as they do in Dr. Strangelove. The film was a satirical wake up call to the world that the current course of travel leads to one logical conclusion: the end of the world."

","Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (1964) is all about the Cold War on the outside.

These men working for the government who were supposed to be protecting our country and making important decisions were portrayed as idiots! I really enjoyed the space and symmetry of the war room. The huge round table where the men sat had a matching row of lights that hung above. High shots were often used, showing the action through the circle of lights. Low close-up camera shots were used when tensions rose. This was useful because it make the scene feel more dramatic.<br/><br/>The technical aspect of the film was also enjoyable.

Don't get me wrong, this movie is dark and depressing, but the use of comedy to lighten the mood was a very clever tactic. I couldn't stop laughing for most of the film. I noticed with respect to the sound that the ""marching on"" song was played every time there was a scene with the plane that was to release the nuclear bomb. I thought that it was a good way of familiarizing the audience with the mood of the people in the plane. I found it highly ironic that all of these safety mechanisms were put into place in case the other country dropped a nuclear bomb, and yet they could not be deactivated under any circumstance. I guess the whole concept of a nuclear war is ironic in itself though. I thought that the acting was superb in the movie and I wouldn't have guessed that the same person played all three of those characters. What a feat. I couldn't get enough of Dr. Strangelove. I really liked the sequences of nuclear bomb explosions at the end of the film. I thought that was a nice piece of cinematography to add to the film. The film also made good use of parallel editing.

It should be quite clear to anyone watching the movie that his is a comic performance, and consciously and intentionally so. Equally odd, is the claim that Sellers' President is some sort of straight man or voice of reason. He is rather a wonderful satire of the sensitive sort of lefty politician who is as worried about establishing his high level of sensitivity as in the main action of the film. If there is a normal major character anywhere in this wonderful movie, it is probably Sellers' RAF captain.

Kubrick, as usual takes many pot shots at the military (United States,as well as the British),as well as the ruling class that preside over the military (and even gets a few jabs at Russia,for good measure). A psychotic general,named General Jack D. Ripper,finally goes over the edge & calls for bombers flying over the Arctic Circle to drop a payload of atomic bombs on Russia. This triggers a catastrophic series of events. Kubrick has assembled a top notch cast to play out the various characters that pop up for the mayhem. The late, great Peter Sellers plays no less than three roles. Add the likes of George C. Scott,Sterling Hayden,Slim Pickens and even (a then unknown) James Earl Jones,as well as others,and you have yourself the basis for a sparkling cocktail of a political satire that will make you laugh,shudder,and finally think of our future. Originally released unrated in 1964,this film was eventually handed a GP rating in 1970, which was eventually changed to a PG rating for a rude word or two, some violent (but not graphic)content,some sexual humour & the potential disturbing consequences of nuclear war & it's aftermath."

","General Jack D. Ripper, who is more than a little insane, uses an obscure emergency procedure to order a fleet of bombers armed with nuclear warheads to attack Russia. Only he knows the recall code, and when he commits suicide can the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff find any way of preventing World War Three  ?<br/><br/>Written by Kubrick, Terry Southern and Peter George, based on George's novel Red Alert, this brilliant black comedy of nuclear annihilation remains perhaps the funniest and most savage military / political satire ever made. The story and its details are completely credible, the characters - despite being twisted buffoons - are instantly recognisable and human, and the movie is both hilarious and terrifying at the same time. The entire cast find exactly the right tone for the film. Sellers repeats his Lolita trick of playing three different parts, Scott is possibly funniest of all, Hayden is perhaps the definitive first in a long line of Kubrick's crazed, staring, psychos, Pickens and Wynn both give career best performances, and watch out for a young Jones as the bombardier. A lot of critics seem to find this film (and Kubrick's work in general) very cold and misanthropic, but this really misses the point. First of all, as satire, it merely serves to remind us not to place too much faith in government / technology / procedures / what have you. But more importantly, it's really a celebration of human ingenuity. The reason the bomber gets through is precisely because they don't follow procedure, they adapt to a new situation, use intuition, solve difficult problems and work out a new plan for themselves. The end result may be catastrophic, but it's also a celebration of individuality and mutability. Kubrick may have been a bit controlling but he really understood people, and that's what makes his work so good. Featuring great sets by James Bond designer Ken Adam, and brilliant photography by Gilbert Taylor - don't miss the shots of an angelic Strangelove surrounded by a halo of light. This movie is packed full of incredibly funny dialogue; if I had to pick a favourite line, it's General Turgidson's masterpiece of understatement, ""Although I hate to judge before all the facts are in, it's beginning to look like General Ripper exceeded his authority."". Kubrick died ten years ago, but his influence as a giant of both film-making innovation and insight into human nature still permeates all cinema. He was thirty-five when he made this movie and lost the Best Director Academy Award to sixty-five-year-old George Cukor, who won for My Fair Lady; does anybody want to argue with me about which of these was a more talented director ? Do not miss this brilliant film."

","For Stanley Kubrick, perhaps it was better to laugh at the problems of the world than to dread them. That certainly was the case here as Kubrick adapted Peter George's nuclear war novel Red Alert. However, Kubrick was wise enough to take this rather serious subject and force it under some very funny situations that for a minute take you away from the actual danger of the realities of nuclear war.<br/><br/>From a cinematic point of view, this is just about perfect. The acting is spot-on, from George C. Scott's right-wing, hawk Gen. Turgidson, to Sterling Hayden's mad-cap General Ripper, to Peter Sellers' triple performance as Captain Mandrake, President Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove. Sellers, in particular gives one of the greatest performances in film as he flawlessly transits from character to character and is so believable as an uptight, downright British officer, a neurotic and plain American president, and a creepy yet brilliant former Nazi scientist. Nearly every line is memorable and perfectly captures an era where paranoid reigned supreme and you were instructed to trust no one.<br/><br/>As for Stanley Kubrick, he is obviously poking fun at the sheer lunacy of this situation, yet he shows some deft seriousness as well. Sure, there is a better way to handle this, but there is no wrong in trying to save your own skin. Take it as you will, but there is no doubt that Kubrick has created one of the most inventive, memorable, and timeless films in American cinema. No matter what the state of world affairs is, Dr. Strangelove will always be significant."

","You don't mess with the Coca Cola cooperation. One of the many things I learned from this movie. Dr. Strangelove is my personal favorite out of all Kubrick films, and despite being a comedy, it still matches the seriousness and intelligence of his other films. The movie is so well written that everything could be interpreted as a joke or fact.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes this movie somewhat confusing to some is the lack of straight-out humor that some may expect but there is no need for slapstick when there is perfect use of metaphors. I really enjoyed Peter Sellers' triple performance, especially as the demented and conflicted Dr. Strangelove. The whole crew made this an excellent movie, bursting with black humor and the absurdity of bureaucracy.<br/><br/>There are many lessons to be learned from this movie such as the importance of proper communication and trust. Looking back, the movie was as relevant to the Cold War, as it is to Modern Day."

","Don't get me wrong their were some amusing parts in the film (sellers line of 'no fighting in the war room' springs to mind)but on a whole similar to the novel Animal Farm by George Orwel, Dr Strangelove is not such a comedy but as good as satire will ever get.<br/><br/>Many people identify Strangelove as being a black comedy however I believe one can't identify it as a solid genre for it could equally fall under the brackets of being a thriller or more importantly a horror. The way in which the politicians bicker over petty differences while on the brink of nuclear destruction may seem funny, but leaves one to question is this really as far off from the real world as it seems? <br/><br/>Think about it the cold war was mainly based on the very one dimensional appearance of both Communism and capitalism (my ideal is better than yours etc)yet the looming threat of destruction was evident because of it. It is scary to think that people that behave like children have the fate of the world in their hands and this is the idea that Strangelove feeds off and through this brings a sense of dread and fear to the audience making the inevitable nuclear holocaust presented in the film not as much a dramatic climax than a dramatic realisation.<br/><br/>To tie up this effective portrayal would not be achieved without great direction and acting; both delivered immaculately in this masterpiece.

First Sputnik then Gagarin showed they had the ""right stuff"" while our rockets just exploded. But the fears ran deeper. In college I took a course called ""Sociology of the Horror Film"" and during this period we had films like ""The Thing""(invasion), ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Invaders from Mars""(hey, they look just like us but they're NOT!!), and all those ""big bug"" movies caused by atomic testing.<br/><br/>Amid all the paranoia comes ""Dr. Strangelove"" with all the people we saw on the nightly news showing their true colors and stripped naked to what they really COULD do if given half a chance. Gen. Turgidson? Just a better looking Gen. Curtis LeMay. Gen. Jack D. Ripper? An amalgam of the dreams of anyone in the John Birch Society and lots of people in the position to BE him, and this includes Col. ""Bat"" Guano (any non male-female, non missionary position sex made you a ""deviated pervert"", excuse me ""prevert""). Ambassador DeSadeski was a stereotype of how we saw the ""typical"" occupant of the Kremlin and Kruschev's performance at the UN just reinforced it.<br/><br/>Sellers' three roles sum up LOTS. Mandrake was the prissy, mannered Brit who turned up on Monty Python as Graham Chapman. Pres. Muffley was the whimpy guy generals said had no backbone. Strangelove himself was a cross between Verner Von Braun and an unknown professor named Henry Kissenger.<br/><br/>While Slim Pickens riding the bomb down is the most famous scene, I can't help feel, with mixed emotions, the final scene. Over a sweet lullaby views of dozens of open-air thermonuclear blasts are seen that the fear and terror of them melts away and I was filled with a sense of beauty and awe....even in black and white!

As very few US presidents over the last 4 decades have been anything other than idiots or schmoozers, the possibility of a ""Dr Strangelove"" nuclear scenario remains a distinct possibility.<br/><br/>It's interesting to read (in the IMDb ""Trivia"") that Slim Pickens played his role of Major Kong straight because he wasn't made aware of the satirical content of the rest of the movie. In the light of this fact, I suppose that if you strung all of the B52 bombing mission scenes together, you'd have a pretty good recruitment film for Strategic Air Command.<br/><br/>""Dr Strangelove"" is a perfect example of the absurdity within rigid political and military methodology.

","First off, this movie is neither overly dramatic or serious, nor is it a laugh-out-loud gagfest like ""Airplane."" I didn't really find this movie to be really all that funny, but I did appreciate the cynical humor that Kubrick had injected into this masterpiece. Kubrick's approach of treating nuclear holocaust as absurd and insane through absurd and insane characters and dialogue makes for far more entertaining cinema than a Cold War thriller that takes itself far too seriously.<br/><br/>The main characters are exaggerated versions of the participants in the military-scientific complex (I made that phrase up, but it seems to encompass the world that Kubrick thinks is real) in the United States and the Soviet Union, and the craziness of their thoughts and actions conveys Kubricks dim view of brinksmanship and the nuclear arms race. This film was truly a labor of love, with the set designers and the actors putting in lots of time and effort . All of the actors do a splendid job here. The clear standout---and the person Kubrick wanted as this film's star---is obviously Peter Sellers, who is a master of versatility. As others have mentioned before, George C. Scott's portrayal of the pugnacious general foreshadows his most famous role, that of General George Patton. This is an intelligent movie, but it is far from being a boring or pretentious movie. You may not laugh, but you may smile at Kubrick's implicit misanthropy. The chills of nuclear war are lightened with Scott's bombastic exclamations and Dr. Strangelove's shouts of ""Mein Fuhrer!"" DO watch this genuine masterpiece."

","It is 1964, the time at which the Cold War has escalated to its peak. Fear of an attack by nuclear weapons against the United States was at an all-time high. This is where the movie Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb begins. A paranoid general, Jack D. Ripper, has launched an all-out nuclear attack with each of the 34 planes from his Burpleson Air Force Base carrying on average a 40-megaton bomb. His reasoning behind this attack? ""The preservation of our precious bodily fluids."" Word of this attack gets to the President of the United States and his top military advisors, who immediately begins trying to convince the drunk Russian Premier over the phone that the attack would be stopped as soon as possible. However, the attack would be nearly impossible to stop because General Ripper is the only person who could and he wouldn't do it. Another problem was that if the U.S. bombed Russia, the Russians would set off the ""Doomsday Device,"" a weapon that if set off would destroy all of humanity.<br/><br/>The movie portrays what could have happened in a warped parallel universe if there were an actual nuclear attack on the world. However, the film approaches this topic in a very satirical manner, addressing the idea of a nuclear attack as completely ridiculous. However, it was very important at the time because it allowed Americans to laugh at the Cold War even though it was staring them right in the face.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is considered one of the best movies of all time by critics and common people alike because there has been no other film like it. Stanley Kubrick is one of the most well-known directors ever and this could be his most well-known and highly praised film. The performances in the movie are all very memorable, including Peter Sellers in three different roles. What is best about this movie, though, is that it is simply hilarious. Throughout the movie there are many laugh-out-loud moments, even at very somber things like the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, as described by the title character played by Sellers. Dr. Strangelove is a classic dark comedy that comically portrays the Cold War and at the same time gives us an in-depth look at the paranoia and fear associated with the time period."

","When you think of the name Stanley Kubrick it conjures up a larger than life figure that few directors who have directed so few films have. A career of only 13 feature films, four in the 50's four in the 60's, two in the 70's, two in the 80's and only one in the 1990's before his death. It was the 1960's where in a span of four very different films, Sparticus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove and 2001 he forever established his legendary status. Four films that earned 15 Academy Award nominations including five wins, 10 Golden Globe nominations including two wins, and 13 BAFTA nominations including six wins. In Dr. Strangelove, he sets out to do an adaptation of the 1958 Peter George novel Red Alert but when he teamed with novelist and screenwriter Terry Southern it evolved into a satire. An irreverent, sarcastic, sardonic cold war satire filled with sexual innuendo and symbolism. A great cast with Peter Seller in three roles, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones in his film debut. Filmed in black and white by cinematographer Gilbert Taylor who had photographed A Hard Days Night and would go on to do such films as The Omen and Star Wars this film keeps your attention from beginning to end. Anthony Harvey is the film editor here who had worked on Kubrick's film Lolita and went on to be a director himself of such noteworthy films as The Lion in winter and They Might Be Giants. Ken Adam who did seven films in the James Bond series from Dr. No to Moonraker is the production designer. I've seen this film many times and have always been entertained. Interestingly this film and Fail-Safe both were put out in the same year by the same studio. The novel Fail-Safe by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler so closely resembled in premise Peter George's novel Red Alert that George sued Burdick and Wheeler and won an out of court plagiarism settlement. A flaw in this film is George's Red Alert was published in 1958 when the delivery of atomic bombs by B52s was fundamental to conducting nuclear warfare but by the time when Dr. Strangelove was made ICBMs launched from land and submarine was the primary way to conduct mutually assured warfare and B52s would be a 2nd strike facilitator. Look for great stage sets in this film. It's a great film with great pacing and direction and I would give it a 9.0 out of 10."

"DICK STEEL","10","1","2","29 November 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Dr Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)
","The first thing that strikes you from this 1964 classic, is the extremely long title! Directed by Stanley Kubrick (2001 Space Odessey, Eyes Wide Shut) and starring the talented Peter Sellers (the Pink Panther franchise), this film touches upon the use of nuclear weapons, or the lack of controls thereof.<br/><br/>In this nuclear age (and during its infancy at the time of the film's release), this question is always in the backburner: Who is given the authority to launch these weapons of mass destruction, and what controls are there to prevent the authority from being abused? The film begins with one crazed US general being able to order the B52s in the air (Cold War time, these bombers are always in the air to strike targets within 2 hours) to attack the Soviet Union with its nuclear bombs. The US President (Sellers) questions how this is so, and the very plausible reason being, if a sneak attack happens on US Soil and on the US Government, then there must exist a system for the lower echelons to launch retaliatory strikes. Which was what happened, except that the US was not under attack.<br/><br/>Sellers is excellent in his multiple roles as a British officer attached to the crazed US general, the US President himself, and Dr Strangelove, a Nazi scientist turned US Presidential adviser. Now that the US is seen as the aggressor, Sellers turns in a fine serious performance as the President, who has a lot of answering to do to his Soviet counterpart. However, tables are turned when the Soviets confirm the existence of their doomsday device, which on one hand sounds absurd, and on the other, raises the stakes for the world's survival.<br/><br/>What appeals in this movie is that, given its various serious theme, Kubrick manages to inject wicked humour into it effortlessly, like the sexual innuendos galore (the riding of the phallic shaped nuclear bomb, the talk of bodily fluids), yet keeping the audience fully aware of the gravity of the situation.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time. And Seller's performance, need I rave more? The Code 1 DVD contains loads of features, but of most excellent value are the documentaries, one on Kubrick's claim to fame and his movies, and the other, close to an hour's worth of Dr Stangelove's making of details."

","I am a huge fan of Peter Sellers and LOVE Dr. Strangelove.  In fact, it is one of my favourite movies.  The dark comedy and wonderfully symbolic images make it more than just a good book adaption of Peter George's Red Alert. They, along with the stunning acting, make it one of the greatest films ever made.  The most amazing aspect of the acting was Sellers's perfect American accent as President Muffley.  I had to check the back of the movie to make sure it really WAS Sellers.  I am a Russian and learned an American accent myself, but his was really amazing.  I have lived here for four or so years and my accent is not half that nice.  Go Sellers!  Too bad he had to die. Too bad Stanley Kubrick had to die..."
"vman13","10","1","2","18 March 2004"," Comedy,Stanley Kubrick Style
","Only in a Kubrick film could the Cold War be so hilarious. Dark humor has always been prevalent in many of his films, but it's this satire about cold war paranoia where Kubrick really gets creative. I have a feeling that everyone involved in making this film had the time of their lives.<br/><br/>
What I love about this film is that it can be both incredibly intelligent and incredibly ridiculous all at the same time. This film  disguises its humor so well. Some call it subtle humor. It seems at times that this cast doesn't know they're making a comedy. The audience laughs not because the actors are really funny but because we're convinced(thanks to the great performances)that these characters are real human beings that do really funny things. Roger Ebert gave the analogy that a man wearing a funny hat trying to be funny isn't funny, but a man that doesn't know he is wearing a funny is truly funny. Out of all the great comedies, I guess you could say that Dr.Strangelove or:How I learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb is that man who doesn't know he is wearing a funny hat. Kubrick truly is a genius."
"ericglunneborg","9","1","2","17 March 2004"," You can't fight in the War Room!!!
","At first glance, Dr. Strangelove appears to be a typical movie about the cold war, that is presented in black and white.  Well it is more that that. It pokes fun at the cold war, and totally makes fun of nuclear war in general.  Everything gets turned around in this zany black comedy, and the whole world comes to an end.  Though it is all a joke, you should take some time to see it.<br/><br/>The story begins in 1963 when the cold war is heating up between the Americans and the Soviets.  In this movie, the Soviets were working on trying to create the ultimate nuclear weapon, a Doomsday Device.  The Americans decide not to worry about this, except for General Jack D.Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who has ordered his men to bomb the Soviet Union using nuclear bombs.  President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is holding a meeting in the War Room (which is supposedly in the Pentagon) trying to figure out what to do about the planes that were called out to attack Russia.  Just then, the Russian Ambassador shows up in the movie to talk with the President about nuclear war.  The Ambassador gets the President on the phone to Russia to speak with their leader about what has gone wrong. The Russian Ambassador tells everyone  in the War Room about the Doomsday Machine and how it could destroy the world.  The President panics about the situation and asks Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) for help.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Soviets have found and taken care of 3 US bombers, but the fourth one is still out there and no one can find it.  As the fourth bomber is flying, they almost get hit by a Russian missile.  They did not know the Soviets were defending themselves. They dropped a bomb out where the Doomsday Machine was.  Back at the Pentagon, Dr. Strangelove is explaining the half life of the radiation in that bomb.  While he is explaining, the Ambassador found out that a U.S. bomber had dropped a bomb over where the Doomsday Device was and he set his stop watch.  A few minutes later, the whole world is being blown up with nuclear bombs all over the place.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers' portrayal of the President and Strangelove are flawless, funny, and all improvised.  Sellers also plays Captain Lionel Mandrake, a British Program officer with an authentic English accent. He manages to transition into these three different characters so well that movie watchers could almost believe that it is actually three different actors playing these parts. <br/><br/>Sterling Hayden's portrayal of General Jack D. Ripper is really great.  He really shows off to the viewers how much he wants to bomb the Russians, and how obsessed he is with bodily fluids.<br/><br/>The reviewer rates this movie 5 out of 5 gold stars.  It is filmed in a simulated area that looks like a real room in the Pentagon and all the people look like they actually work for the government.  My favorite part of the movie takes place when the President turns around to find the Russian Ambassador fighting with one of the generals.  The president Says, `Gentlemen, don't fight in here. This is the War Room.'"
"Jennydavis131","9","1","2","15 March 2004"," the strangest movie i have ever seen
","Dr. Strangelove is probably the strangest film the reviewer has ever seen but yet probably the most creative. This film can be viewed as a satire about war movies or war itself, and it is a black comedy. The movie is directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Peter Sellers and George C. Scott.<br/><br/>
 This film is about a general, ironically named Jack Ripper played by Sterling Hayden, who orders nuclear bombs to drop on Russia. When the President finds what has happened he finds out that there is no way to get a hold of Ripper and stop all the madness. Once Russia finds out what's going on, the U.S. is informed of a `doomsday machine' that would destroy the whole world. <br/><br/>There is so much hilarity in this film it's amazing. There is one particular scene that stands out from all the rest and that is when a pilot of one of the planes, goes through a check of his crews survival kits. The pilot goes over the intercom and reads off the items. They include 9 packs of chewing gum, a miniature bible, and various medications such as vitamins, sleeping pills, pep pills, and tranquilizers. It also includes prophylactics, and womens nylons. At the end of the checklist the pilot says to himself `Shoot! A fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all this stuff.<br/><br/>
The acting was just great, all the characters where unbelievably well thought out. The reviewer's favorite character was General Buck Turgidson played by George C. Scott. His character is outrageous and in your face. He also has an obsession with chewing gum. There could not be a better cast for this film. <br/><br/>The set, costume and props were all great. They looked so realistic and not so 1964. There are many scenes in the film where a plane is flying around scenery, it does not look as fake as it could have been, it was impressive for a 1960's film. <br/><br/>The music adds a lot of comedy to the movie as well. During a scene that is supposed to be serious they always seem to have music for enlightenment.<br/><br/>This movie is the funniest war movie ever. The reviewer highly recommends it to people that love and hate war movies and love comedy as well. The reviewer would rate this film 9/10."

","Dr. Strangelove<br/><br/>
	Dr. Strangelove my seem like one of those old' movies. It may be, but it is an excellent old' movie. It is what's called a dark comedy'. Dark comedies take real life, serious situations and make them comical. It's actually a lot funnier than it sounds.<br/><br/>	The movie Dr. Strangelove takes place at the height of the nuclear arms race between the United States of America and the united soviet soughvern republic (or U.S.S.R.). And is about how an Air Force general who goes paranoid delusional and sends B-2 nuclear bombers to attack the Russians without authorization from the president of the united states. Dr. Strangelove is this crippled German nuclear scientist that cannot control his right arm (this becomes more obvious towards the end of the movie) that is an advisor to the president of the United States.<br/><br/>	There is a lot of Freudian psychology in this movie. For example, when the air force general talks about precious bodily fluids', and with cigars and cigarettes. All the generals smoke big cigars. And Dr. Strangelove always smokes little cigarettes, and talks about big bombs. <br/><br/>	The story behind the name is that we as Americans have a strange love' for nuclear bombs, especially big' bombs. And having lots of them.<br/><br/>
	So now that this review is read, go and watch the movie and see that it is worth a rating of ten out of ten."
"slugbelle","10","1","2","14 March 2004"," Even with very little explanation, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a great movie.
","Love songs between planes and a translation of ""Merkwurdichiebe"" seem a little strange for a movie's theme.  By the title, one should expect such a thing.  ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb"" is not only a mouthful, it's an excellent movie.  Although in some cases, it should be overviewed and discussed before seen.  Released in 1964, the film reflects the worries and mood of the time surrounding it, but twisting those thoughts with humorous ventures and fictional characters.<br/><br/>Based on Peter George's novel, it scratches at a loss of hope, but somehow is cheerful.  Since it was based around such heavy subjects, it would make more sense if the movie itself was somber and full of events.  In truth the movie is surrounded by only a few sets and can literally make the viewer laugh out loud.  It is the smaller things, such as: a ""keep off the grass"" sign at a military base while shooting is going on, or the ongoing talk about bodily fluids leading to the decision to abstain from sex, that make the movie so hilarious.<br/><br/>It takes talent to take a subject like nuclear warfare and put a spin on it, using names like King Kong and Jack D. Ripper contributed to the affect. The contrast between the music and pictures, using one main instrumental song throughout the entire film gave a sense of a continuous suspense that was crucial to the feel of the movie.  This is a film that needs to be seen by anyone who would have an open mind to its sense of humor, and with that open mind it's one of the best movies ever made."
"Blondeatheart56","9","1","2","12 March 2004"," A strange but good movie
","Dr. Strangelove is a rather strange movie.  It is also a very good movie. It provides its audience with comedy, a history lesson (in a way), and drama.  The plot centers on the love of nuclear weapons that helped lead to the Cold War.  Although the film does not portray this entirely accurate the audience can get the picture.  It takes this incident that really happened in history and makes it seem comical.  At first the film may seem to be somewhat boring, but once you get into watching it it's great. <br/><br/>
The music in Dr.Strangelove basically revolves around three main songs, two being love songs and one being the tune to `the ants go marching.'  The two love songs are played at the beginning of the film during the opening credits and at the end of the film while the world is being blown to bits by nuclear weapons.  Although at first hearing a love song during a scene in which the world is being destroyed may seem odd, it really isn't.  The U.S. used to have this strange infatuation, this strange love for nuclear weapons, so playing a love song while they are being put to use is actually quite fitting.  It gets across the fact that we once did love nuclear weapons.  Now, the tune to `the ants go marching' is played during every scene with the pilots in their planes.  The tune when heard without the words actually sounds very patriotic.  The pilots in the planes are getting ready to carry out their orders and they very well know they could die.  It is a patriotic thing that they are doing, thus the patriotic music.  Having only three different songs in the film helps the audience to remember them better and is something that this reviewer has never seen in any other film. It is a great idea.<br/><br/>The film has more than one main character. It has quite a few actually. All the acting in the film was pretty good.  It wasn't as good as others, but it wasn't so horrible that the viewer would become disgusted and turn off the film because of it.  Now and then there were some times when the viewer could tell that the actor was just acting, but for the most part it was pretty good and always entertaining.  This reviewer kept finding herself just wanting to laugh at some parts that weren't even meant to be funny just because of the way the actor was coming across.  Any movie that causes laughter is definitely a good one.<br/><br/>When most people watch Dr. Strangelove they probably do just that.  They watch it.  They don't think that it has any hidden meanings.  They watch it as if they would watch any other film.  But this film has something that not all other films have.  The film is full of references to sex and penis envy. It isn't obvious though, not at all.  The viewer probably won't even catch it, but it is.  On the surface it seems as though it is just taking a historic situation and turning it into comedy, but below the surface it's all about sex.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove isn't the type of movie that a typical teenager would pick out to rent at the movie store, but it is one that they should.  This reviewer admits that she would never have rented or even thought about watching this movie on her own, but Dr. Strangelove is a really good movie and it is really funny.  All teenagers should get the opportunity to see this wonderful film."
"JPTaylor","9","1","2","12 March 2004"," A multi-layered black comedy
","Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen.  Not only is it absolutely brilliant in terms of comedy alone, but it communicates something through its precise satire that most comedies wouldn't dare to contemplate. I am sure that many who saw the film in its first release completely missed its rather negative undertones regarding U.S. policy - and, in fact, it has enough pure entertainment value to be worth seeing anyway.  Yet Kubrick's work is filled with innuendo and subtle insults that may bypass the viewer initally, but once they are noticed are undoubtable.<br/><br/>The movie's theme is the nuclear arms race of the Cold War.  General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has ordered a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, without authorization.  After hearing of the news, a prominent general has the unenviable task of explaining to the president in an emergency meeting why World War III is about to begin, and why there is little hope of stopping it.  Eventually a Soviet Union representative informs the U.S. that the Soviet Union has created a Doomsday weapon, programmed to immediately launch a nuclear holocaust that would destroy the world if even one nuclear warhead touches Soviet soil.  The idea is that the Doomsday weapon is completely irrational and irreversibly devoted to its task, thus eliminating any threat by the U.S., as any rational being would not engage in an attack that would destroy the world.  Unfortunately, the attack was launched mere days before the USSR was planning to announce the Doomsday weapon.<br/><br/>The actors in this film do not so much play characters as they play characterizations - each character has little depth, as far as personality goes, but represents a satirical element.  Here we see George C. Scott, extremely entertaining in his portrayal of General Turgidson, particularly with his lengthy conversation with the president.  He maintains a distinct even-tempered boyishness throughout the film - ever-passionate about politics, but rather easygoing about everything else, leading to some brilliant comedic dialogue, which will not be revealed here.  Peter Sellers is also amazingly funny, particularly in his role as President - his one-sided telephone conversation with the Soviet Premier is very clever, with perfect comedic timing.  His performance as Dr. Strangelove, a German nuclear physicist, is amusing, although I found the character less interesting than the others, probably because of the more exaggerated personality.<br/><br/>The entire film is told in a rather laid-back manner, at least as far as the characters' reactions to the imminent apocalypse at hand.  The characters are perhaps slightly indignant but not outwardly terrified, which contrasts excellently against the earth-shattering power of atomic weapons.  However, they remain doggedly determined to outwit the communists, or at least have slightly more survivors.  This anti-red fervor perpetuates itself throughout the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately Kubrick's film is striking and multi-layered - probably remembered as a simple comedy by some, and remembered as a sharp satire of U.S. foreign policy to others.  Regardless, Dr. Strangelove is undoubtedly an excellent film."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","1","2","8 March 2004"," worthy of the wait I've had to endure to see it
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Ok, let's say straight away that I love the idea of this movie. Based around the Cold War, the worries and fears and signs of incompetence it shows from back then are still present in 2004. Kubrick, Sellers & everyone else involved have produced a Gem.<br/><br/>In ""Dr Strangelove"", Sellers acts not only as the title role, but also as the hard hitting President Muffley and also as Captain Mandrake of her Majesty's Royal Air Force. When Mandrake's superior General Jack D. Ripper launches a nuclear attack on Russia, there is panic at the Pentagon and the remainder of the film is spent attempting to solve this problem.<br/><br/>Three key things struck me during this film to be honest. Firstly at times it did feel very dated. Unlike in the original version of ""The Little Shop Of Horrors"", the film had been kept in a decent quality and it transfered very well to dvd. Having said this, at times it felt simply a bit too out of time. This first problem was however cancelled out by the second two things I noticed about this film.<br/><br/>The second key thing about this film which really stands out is, as you'd expect, Peter Seller's amazing performance, once again, as three of the main characters. It is depressing to think sometimes how so many great comedians of the past lived tragic lives, Sellers & Hancock to name two, but when watching a film like this, we are reminded that these men will leave indelible marks on our lives forever. Sellers is outstanding, and is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast.<br/><br/>Finally, and most importantly of all, the key point which springs to mind when viewing ""Dr Strangelove"" is just how funny certain parts of it are. Lines like ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room"" are just parts of moments which add to the comic element of this film.<br/><br/>Truthfully what makes this movie I think is that even now it is being viewed in a world where stupidity dominates the political landscape and where you get the feeling that at any moment beurocracy could screw up and we'd have a nuclear war on our hands. I feel that if we were living in a world where the Hippy Peace Movements had got their way and there were no weapons and no fighting and everyone lived in peace, then this film would be nowhere near as funny. As it happens, we don't, and this film is down as one of the best comedy masterpieces of all time."

","A 20 year old won't relate to Missile Gaps and Commies but would surely appreciate the acting in this excellent film. When portraying the President, Peter Sellers' American accent is dead-on. George C. Scott is just hilarious as the paranoid General--his gestures and facial expressions bring my me knees with laughter every time I watch him. Even the dead-pan Army Colonel is funny. The director makes excellent use of B/W lighting and camera angles when on the actors.<br/><br/>A good contrast to Dr. Strangelove is the film Fail Safe from the same era. Both have the same plot but tackle it entirely differently; no laughing in Fail Safe."
"deldotvee","10","1","2","6 February 2004"," 40 Years Later, not a day wiser
","Dr. Strangelove is a great film because it has unforgettable characters enmeshed in something that was chillingly possible at the time the film was made. It is side-splittingly funny and terrifying at the same time, drawing out the repressed sexuality of its main characters like pus from a boil. A lot of other films beat its production values but realism and black comedy trump everything else in making this particular point.<br/><br/>Now in 2004, it's time again for Strangelove to take on the Enemy, with a hearty ""Let's **** them before they **** us.""  Here's hoping they stick to conventional weapons."

","minor spoilers.<br/><br/>Its amazing to think a movie can deal with the total destruction of the planet due to nuclear war and make you laugh at the same time, but Dr. Strangelove pulls it off with flying colors.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in two locations.  At a U.S. air force base, the base commander has taken it upon himself to launch a nuclear attack against the Soviet Union.  He is obviously mad, and hopes his attack will leave the President no other options than to commit to a total nuclear assault.  Peter Sellers plays a R.A.F. officer on an exchange program stationed at the base who tries to get the recall codes for the bombers from the crazed general. This is the only way the attack can be averted.<br/><br/>The rest of the action takes place in the ""war room"" presumably somewhere deep within the pentagon.  Here the president (also played by Sellers) confers with his top advisors as they try to deal with the crisis.<br/><br/>George C. Scott delivers a surprisingly great comedic role as General Buck Turgenson, a hawk who tries to advocate the full-scale assault.  Sellers plays a third role, the title character, who is a wheel chair ridden ex-Nazi scientist, and now one of the president's top science advisors.<br/><br/>As always, Sellers is flawless (ok, I'm a big fan and maybe not that objective).  He pulls off a flat Midwestern accent as the president without breaking a sweat, and his rendition of Dr. Strangelove will leave you rolling.<br/><br/>Oh yes, I just remembered a third action venue in the film.  We are brought aboard one of the bombers launched on the assault and watch as they follow the prescribed procedures during their mission.  The jet is commanded by Slim Pickens who brings an over the top red neck cracker performance to the screen.  There is also a very young James Earl Jones as part of the flight crew.  Whenever we watched the scenes which take place aboard the bomber, we are treated to the strains of ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" playing in the background.<br/><br/>What is so great about the movie is the the subject is treated with absolute seriousness.  There is nothing overtly funny about the movie.  Its the little things that are thrown in that make it such a riot.  The actors never lose sight of this, and stay in character brilliantly. <br/><br/>
Dr. Strangelove is a different kind of film.  It makes you laugh, but it also makes you worry and makes you think.  In the end its highly entertaining.  I give it a 9 out of 10."
"MichaelCorleone2002","10","1","2","19 October 2003"," A Masterpiece That Gets Better With Time.
","When looking at many films dealing with the Cold War fears, they come off as extremely dated, cheesy, thinly veiled propaganda.  Not so with Dr. Strangelove, in fact it seems to get better with repeated viewings. Released during the peak years of the Cold War, Strangelove tackled a doomsday scenario and made us laugh at it.  Peter Sellers, comic genius, plays three different parts, all perfectly.  Co-stars Slim Pickens, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are all superb as well.  At 93 minutes, the film moves quickly and leaves practically no filler.  Even though we aren't battling the Russians anymore, the scenario could be applied to our world's current condition.  During my first viewing I was uncomfortable, but after that I started to laugh at the jokes and the performances and it became one of my favorite films."
"dav4is","10","1","2","4 October 2003"," Flawless, indeed!
","The TCM commentator made an excellent point when introducing this movie tonight. MTV and that ilk have produced a generation of short attention span viewers. Tight shots, quick takes, ""interesting"" angles. These poor blighted folks have no patience for, e.g., a wide shot of Peter Sellers walking across the computer room and turning out the overhead lights one by one before leaving. They are unwilling, and probably unable, to invest the time to study this scene. <br/><br/>  True, this is not a key scene, but it does say something about the methodical, careful nature of this Sellers character. And it also helps to establish a pre-crisis tone of calm normalcy, ready to be shattered by the actions of a loony air base commander.<br/><br/>-R."

","I have heard people call this the greatest comedy ever made. I feel that is an injustice to the film. This is the greatest movie ever made, which happens to be a comedy. I don't consider this statement to be that bold. Let's face it, Stanley Kubrick was the greatest director of all-time. Why wouldn't his defining masterpiece be considered the greatest film ever? Moreover, Peter Sellers, one of the greatest actors of all-time, gives his greatest performance/performances. Three characters, each unique and each unbelievably funny. George C. Scott, the great dramatic actor, makes you laugh as hard as you can. Add to this, the great Sterling Hayden, preaching about the evils of communism and the greatness of a nuclear holocaust. However, when describing the greatness of this film, you have to take into account it's historical importance. This was a film about a nuclear war between two superpowers, which seemed on the verge of real nuclear war. Moreover, it was released right after the assassination of JFK. With so much negativity and impending doom everywhere, Kubrick goes and makes a film that makes people laugh at it all. Imagine that, seeing a film in the most tense moment of the cold war, that deals with the entire world blowing up, and you leave the theater laughing? That my friend, is Kubrick and that is why he was the greatest."

What is perhaps forgotten is how well placed Kubrick's eye is, which makes Dr Strangelove another rarity- a technically outstanding comedy.

I have never seen such a intelligent use of irony and sarcasm. The acting is amazing, specially for Peter Sellers and the great George Scott. If you havenÂ´t seen it yet. Do it now!! It will be for sure in the top ten of your list."
"Blade_Le_Flambeur","10","1","2","11 March 2003"," The best comedy ever, perhaps one of the best movies ever
","This is the second Stanley Kubrick film I watched, the first being Full Metal Jacket. And I loved it. It combines an excellent script with excellent direction and on top of that you get brilliant performances. This movie is funny, but its much funnier if you know cold war terms and have extreme knowledge of the cold war. I think that this and Death To Smoochy are the two best comedies ever made and both are dark comedies too, although I'm sure this is going to spark quite a bit of controversy. This movie was nominated for four academy awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. It didn't win any, the first three went to My Fair Lady and I'm not sure about screenplay. But it deserved each one. Peter Sellers is excellent here, he plays the three characters very well. George S. Scott and Sterling Hayden also turn in noteworthy performances as two generals. The entire situation has a lot to do with todays impending war on Iraq so some people may find this not funny at all. The subject is rather scary but the presentation is excellent and funny. Everyone should see this movie. There are no flaws. A VERY well earned 10/10."
"Moshe Kam","Null","1","2","30 November 2002"," The King Has No Clothes
","I fail to see the greatness of ""Dr. Strangelove"".  The movie was certainly timely.  It addressed, through somewhat off-center humor, a very serious and pervasive fear that the West has harbored in the 1950s and 1960s.  However, the execution here is crude beyond belief.  The tastelessness starts with the ""symbolic"" names, from the mad general ""Jack D. Ripper"", to the Soviet Prime Minister ""Kiss-off"".  It continues with a large number of rather gross jokes, some plain silly (the nuclear war starts, and the B52 pilot suggests that his crew is to enjoy some ""very serious promotions"" once this war of annihilation is over), most laced with infantile sexual innuendo.<br/><br/>Especially grotesque are the scenes with the German Nazi advisor, Dr. Strangelove (""He changed his name; it was originally Merkwurdigliebe""). Yes, I know all about Wernher von Braun, but this series of Aryan slogans and Nazi salutes, again steeped in infantile sexual ""humor"", was just plain silly.<br/><br/>So there are a few good lines executed quite well by George C. Scott, and the scene that has our pilot hero, Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, ride on the nuclear bomb on its way to the target is amusing.  Overall, not too much."
"cant_touchthis","Null","1","2","27 November 2002"," what are some of you saying!!
","I wasn't going to write a comment on this film until i read some of the comments written about it.<br/><br/>The film has been around for a long time now and so is obvious that it has alot of comments. I quite easily agree with most of you as it is a very good, well made and acted film but for some of you to say it isn't that good is something i find quite insulting. The film, about a worst case scenario of starting a nuclear war, is one of, and if not, the best comedy i have ever seen. Now that cant be bad for a film that has been around for almost 40 years!!And its black and white! I never had much respect for old films until I saw this and even had to buy it on DVD. It goes down as 1 of my most favourite films and 1 of my best buys ever. For those who say it isn't that good or it is over-rated then I say that either watch the film again or that you are all uncultured. Kubrick and his team did a fine job, as one would expect from a talented director and I have been enraged by this. I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion but my only explanation as to why they believe that it is over-rated is because they don't understand it and I also believe it takes a certain inteligence to understand this film.<br/><br/>I finish with my appologies to anyone who is offended and that Stan, if it is at all possible in any way for you to read this in your spiritual form, then well done.<br/><br/>Stan, is the Man!

"villard","Null","1","2","5 October 2002"," One of a Kind
","Ingenious script, brilliant acting, exquisite editing, dramatic sets, unforgettable scenes, all rolled into a bulls-eye satire courageously made deep in the black heart of the Cold War. Why can't they make movies nearly as good as this today? (and on a $2 million budget!)"
"Philby-3","Null","1","2","20 December 1999"," Still a blast after all those years
","Those of us who grew up during the cold war have reason to thank Stanley Kubrick, who had the brilliant insight that the only way to stay sane in the face of nuclear annihilation was to laugh at the absurdity of it all. He started out with Peter George's serious ""what would happen if."" novel ""Red Alert"" and produced with the aid of some very fine actors a black comedy you'd have to be psychotic not to understand.<br/><br/>Seeing it again after many years, I was conscious of how my focus had changed. As a schoolkid who had recently experienced the Cuban missile crisis, I concentrated firmly on the laughs: ""You can't fight here, this is the War Room,"" ""Precious bodily fluids"", ""You're going to have to answer to the Coca Cola company"" and the slapstick: ""Mein Fuerher, I can valk!"" Now I can see how deadly accurate the comedy was, and how well the film was made, with only four or five sets and minimalist back projection for the aerial shots. The War Room itself, huge, bare, efficient and  enclosed, is a great metaphor for the military mind. Kubrick, by highlighting the heroism of the bomber crew, sends up wonderfully the laudatory war movie which was very much in evidence at the time (""The Dambusters,"" ""Reach for the Sky"" etc). The Strangelove character is a bit of an ""add on"" but I don't agree that the final War Room scene, in which Strangelove outlines his plan for a post nuclear underground brothel/breeding farm for the Chosen Ones, is redundant. As long as the bastards running the world think they might personally escape a nuclear holocaust the rest of us are at greater risk. There was something to be said for ""Mutually Assured Destruction"" or MAD.<br/><br/>The acting performances are all definitive and we are lucky Peter Sellers did not do Major Kong, thus depriving us of Slim Picken's heroic cowboy pilot who, against all the odds, reaches a target and rides the bomb right to the ground. George C Scott, only 40 at the time, as General Buck Turgidson is a sort of proto-Patton on speed, alternately petulant, sly, mystical, gung-ho and evasive. Peter Sellers rises to the challenge of making a couple of ""normal' characters, the President and Group Captain Mandrake, interesting (Strangelove is pure vaudeville) and Sterling Hayden, helped by camera angles, made it clear that no-one was going to convince General Jack D Ripper he was wrong about fluoridation. (The problem about Col. ""Bat"" Guano (Keenan Wynn), he with the hatred for ""preverts"" and the solicitude for the fixtures of the Coca Cola Company is that there are too many people like that in the real world  for such a character to be very funny.)<br/><br/>The Kubrick touch is evident in the detail as usual. In Washington the phone in Gneral Turgidson's bedroom is answered by his secretary and mistress, Miss Scott (Tracey Reed). In the pilot's seat on board the B-52 overflying Russia, Major Kong is discovered ogling the centerfold of ""Playboy"" and this month's Pet is, naturally, Miss Scott.<br/><br/>It's all a bit over the top, but for once that helps. There's a lot of talk and techno-babble and the pace is not particularly fast. The world goes down the gurgler at a stately pace and there's not a damned thing anyone can do about it. All the procedures designed to stop such a disaster happening are gone through, but found to be ineffective. One of them turns out to have provided General Ripper with his opportunity to get the Russians first before they pollute his precious bodily fluids.<br/><br/>It's interesting to compare ""Dr Strangelove"" with ""Failsafe,"" another movie on the same theme (but from a different book) which played it as straight drama. ""Failsafe"" with Henry Fonda as the hero president from central casting, was a well made movie, nothing more. ""Dr Strangelove"" is art in the cause of humanity."
"andrew7","10","1","2","17 November 1999"," 10/10 -- Perfect comic genius!
","You have to learn how to watch this movie..., or, at least, I did.  About twenty to thirty minutes in I realized the layers of humor present in the script and the performances.  The more you pay attention, the more you catch.  Whether it's an unobtrusive sight-gag which could easily slip by unnoticed, or a beautiful piece of ironic dialogue, theirs is a gold mine of material here that a casual viewer will just miss.  At the same time, there is present a level of comedy that cannot be escaped.  Viewing it carelessly will produce the idea that the film is a dark and serious film peppered with moments of bizarre physical comedy and the odd pratfall.  Watching more closely reveals that the film is much tighter and more consistent than it might first appear to be.<br/><br/>The performances, also, are superb.  Peter Sellers is simply wonderful in all three of his roles (and while I have a hard time imagining it, I bet he would have been great in Pickens's role as well).  George C. Scott takes a script which makes the military look ridiculous (and more than a little disturbing) and milks it to the bone, pulling every ounce of power out of a finely crafted piece of writing.  Especially wonderful is how every character plays everything completely straight.  From experience, I know that this is a difficult kind of comedy to play, i.e., when everything is funny to the audience but nothing is funny to the characters.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film is very tight.  Some might complain that it's slow in places, and I suppose that's fair.  But I wouldn't cut or trim a thing.  The long scenes of procedure aboard the plane are absolutely crucial, since the film is about the inanities of military procedure.  The long scenes of dialogue in the war room are absolutely crucial because the film is about the inanities of government decision making.  That, and the fact that the film is just a joy to watch from start to finish, more than make up for any criticism that one may care to make."
"tbickle-2","10","1","2","24 September 1998"," The best comedy ever
","Dr Strangelove is the best comedy I have ever seen. (perhaps not the funniest, but the best)  Kubrick, my favorite film-maker, shows the insane hypocracy of our military establishment, and the lunacy of the principle of mutually assured destruction.  The classic characters this film created are wonderful, and the uniquely dark satirical humor is excellent.  It is one of my favorite films of all time."
"Bob-45","Null","1","2","28 July 1999"," THE APOCALYPSE ACCORDING TO DILBERT
","When I saw DR. STRANGELOVE as a high school student, I thought it was silly, childish, and unbelievable.  Now, after 30 plus years of working in the military-industrial complex, I think it's a documentary (or, at least, a docu-drama).<br/><br/>Though I believe Kubrick is generally overrated, he was in top form with this movie.  By telling a serious story, but populating it with childish elements (gibberish names, bad puns, a Bob Newhart-like ""red phone"" call to the Soviet Premier), Kubrick assembled a film which delivers a far greater message than the sum of its parts.  Certainly, the cinematography and editing (particularly on board the B-52) is par excellance, right up there with CITIZEN KANE (or any Sergio Leone movie, for that matter).  In the B-52 scenes, Kubrick even had the camera set to realistically shake, simulating aircraft movement. (By the way, did anyone else spot James Earl Jones as one of the crewmembers?)<br/><br/>The White House's refusal to accept a collect phone call from a SAC base under siege, the former NAZI national security (and science advisor), the Air Force General whom views the start of World War III as a blaze of ""glory"" all are well grounded in similar, if not actual, events.  One of of former NASA Apollo program scientists was deported for being a former NAZI (after he was no longer useful, I presume). During Granada, a Marine had to use his own telephone credit card and a pay phone to call in an air strike, because the different services were using different radio frequencies!  The first Commander of SAC, as a Vice Presidential Candidate suggested we bomb North Vietnam ""into the Stone Age."" Finally, can't anyone imagine a President Steve Forbes using almost the same words and manners if HE had to call the Kremlin in a similar situation? Remember George Bush and ""Deep doo-doo?<br/><br/>What is true about DILBERT is equally true about DR. STRANGELOVE:  the truly scary part is that every joke, no matter how absurd, seems plausible."
"pieter-3","9","1","2","29 March 1999"," ""Look, mein fuehrer, I can walk""
","This must be the best black comedy ever made. The absurdity of the war room, the fighting, the telephone call with Dimitri and the Werner von Braun phantom, make me laugh every time I see it. But it's more & more the hysterical laughter of a condemned. Maybe in retrospect the fear of a nuclear war has lost some of its menace, but that only has brought the fear for the combination of bureaucracy and human insanity (those who are sane please rise) in more frightening prominence."
"begbie-7","10","1","2","28 March 1999"," How Kubrick make us laugh before the end of the world
","It's terrifying. But very comic. If wasn't for Peter Sellers roles, it wouldn't have the same impact. But, together with Kubrick's brilliant direction work, ""Dr. Strangelove"" doesn't supports only with the jokes. The cynical song by the end of the movie, some unforgettable scenes and the mix of fear and laughs makes of ""Strangelove"" a wonderful piece of art. You can also feel some kind of connection between the end of this movie and the beginning of Kubrick's next film, ""2001"". Is the world being reconstructed by Stanley?"
"KRAGE","10","1","2","26 March 1999"," Great movie
","A fantastic film.  After watching this film and Patton, I can say without reservation that George C. Scott is my favorite actor.  His portrayal of Turgidson is hilarious.  The scene in the War Room where he is backing away and trips into a roll onto the floor is hilarious, and caps off Scott's portrayal of a character who is a hyperactive child in control of the big guns.  This is by far my favorite movie about the nuclear age."
"SKG-2","10","1","2","15 March 1999"," Still relevant
","Unlike other Stanley Kubrick films, which often need repeat viewings before I completely get them, this one I got right on the first try.  And okay, so the Cold War is over (though I'm sure there are people in America who still wish they had communism as a straw man).  With nuclear weapons still out there, and the chances of terrorist groups of all kinds being able to get their hands on them, and the gun mentality which pervades the militaries of the world, this is still timely and hilariously funny, as it shows the people in charge for the idiots that they are.  Sure, it's cynical, but wouldn't you be?<br/><br/>Sellers, of course, deserves to be commended, and Slim Pickens assured his place in history with his riding the bomb down like a horse.  George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Keenan Wynn, however, usually get overlooked, and they're equally funny without ever trying to be.  A masterpiece."
"ToldYaSo","10","1","2","10 March 1999"," Perhaps the greatest black comedy ever made
","Learning of Stanley Kubrick's death on Sunday, March 7, 1999, came late for me. I had missed the news and only found out on Monday. I decided the best way to honour the man, was to watch my favourite film of his, ""Dr. Strangelove"".<br/><br/>Some time ago, when I told a friend that I was working on my own black comedy, he said he didn't think there were any black comedies that were successful as they fell flat and did poorly overall. I thought about it for a moment, but couldn't think of anything at the time. I later recalled ""Dr. Strangelove"" in the same way you think of the perfect comeback to an insult the day after.<br/><br/>When I first saw the film, I was struck by the brilliance of Peter Sellers, playing three roles. I learned later that he was slated for four roles, the fourth being that of Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, but due to an injury he wasn't able to do it. But then Slim Pickens might never have hit the world stage in the way that he did.<br/><br/>I recently bought the DVD, somewhat reluctantly, as it does not have any special features whatsoever. I have read there's a fantastic alternate ending where a pie fight in the war room ensues, but unfortunately, everyone was cracking up and having a good laugh over it, and ruined the feel that Kubrick was looking for. Wouldn't that be great to see, though? There's a still picture of this scene in a biography of Kubrick by John Baxter.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the wake of Stanley's death, we may see some special editions of the film reissued on DVD, which would be a welcome treasure in my opinion. I only wish that all film companies would give the same attention to film's behind the scenes and outtakes that Criterion does. Universal and New Line have gone to great efforts to provide high quality DVDs with plenty of bonus materials.<br/><br/>I'll leave you with a quote from Stanley which can best summarize the mood of the film: ""Confront a man in his office with a nuclear alarm, and you have a documentary. If the news reaches him in his living room, you have a drama. If it catches him in the lavatory, the result is comedy."""
"Agent10","10","1","2","28 April 2002"," Always the classic war film
","When a movie tends to be parodied by The Simpsons as often as this one has, it must have been good.<br/><br/>It's a grand pleasure to watch a film with so many underlying meanings and messages. This film could be considered the first indication of Kubrick's genius. Up until 1964, Kubrick was still a bit mainstream, engaging in projects which most grand directors undertook when they reached a certain level of fame. Kubrick took the opposite direction, distancing himself from such rituals by encompassing a persona which was technically un-Hollywood. This movie stands up very well, especially in these times of nuclear threats and possible war."

And it must have been quite something to see this film back in 1964, at the peak of the Cold War. The black and white also adds to the thrill.<br/><br/>A lot of irony in this one.

","Dr. Strangelove shows an interesting strategy to make a prophetic hypothesis' of the rate that intra-countries competitions could become. Its original purpose was hard to grasp, yet this same confusion backs up the purpose trying to be shown. That the subconscious or even conscious reason for the existence of the competition of creating bombs more powerful than someone else's, is lost in the midst of so much politics. A comical example of this is the delivered line which prohibits the fighting in the war room. The way in which politics and international relations were represented was comically put. During a conversation between the Russian and American president, had the audience been ignorant of the speakers identities, an assumption could have been made that it was a conversation between husband and wife feuding. Dr. Strangelove is known for its immense amount of froid content, all throughout the film many references to this subject are portrayed by the dialogue of the actors and even minor things like the smoking of varied sized cigars. The purpose and manner in which this film portrayed its message was both subtle and bold. Even though at times lengthy and seemingly pointless dialogues were present, along with an excessive amount of sexual references, it was understood that this excess was what was desired and necessary to bring across its comical message of `international bomb envy.'"

","I can only shake my head at some of the fawning film-school comments here. Yes, Sellers' performances are brilliant, you'll laugh out loud at his Dr. Strangelove, and the rest of the cast is excellent. Yes, it was an especially daring satire for its time, making light of a subject that was deadly serious in 1964.  And yes, you'll enjoy the Kubrickian touches and details - the contemplative camera, the ""cold"" lighting, the political sarcasm, the signature ""head bent, eyes up"" expression from George C. Scott which we later saw in Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket et al; and the final scene set to intentionally light and inappropriate music, a precursor to the evocative use of ""Blue Danube Waltz"" in ""2001"".  For all these reasons, see Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>But the whole is less than the sum of its excellent parts. It's simply not a great movie. The set pieces in the war room and Keenan Wynne's office drone on and on towards modest punchlines, the B-52 scenes are interesting mostly to electricians, the attack on the military base resolves awkwardly, and the movie's climax is clumsy at best (and yes, I ""get"" the intent of the final cut away from the warroom). The movie as a whole hangs together poorly.<br/><br/>
Although not a great film, its an important film, especially for its time. See it, but temper your expectations."
"denscul","6","2","9","5 April 2007"," reevaluation after 40 years
","This movie is still funny, and represents a better quality film than was produced during this era. I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out, and had views similar to the majority of comments at the time.<br/><br/>Two years later, I was a pilot in SAC, and was very familiar with the real system, including the two man policy, and the procedures involved in starting nuclear war. <br/><br/>But one doesn't have to know anything that comes close to personal experience with the complex systems in place. My complaints, too numerous to mention make me rely on one very funny scene where Peter Sellers is trying to call the President on the pay phone. Nobody has to be familiar with a complicated system, to know that the scene is a cartoon of real life, and not a satire worthy of various awards this film earned. Keenen Wynn's character, an Army Colonel has been sent under force of arms to get the commander in contact with the President. Why then, did Wynn's character act as if the Deputy would not suffice, knowing that Hayden's character had committed suicide? And did Kubric do such little research as to be under the impression that a British Officer could act as a Deputy, when NO foreign officers were allowed access to nuclear control It was funny seeing Sellers trying to place a call to the President from one of those antiquated pay phones. It was also funny seeing Wynn blowing up the Coke machine to get change. But how many films have we seen where Colonels go around without several subordinates carrying various means of communications,especially if the boss back at the Capital wants to learn what's going on- IMDIATELY if not SOONER. Whether it was fast runners,carrier pigeons, or radio; we do not see anything of the kind. This one scene makes part of the film a cartoon, not worthy of any award, because it not well crafted. The scene violates what everyone who has ever seen a war film knows. Its not any different than a cartoon character being blown up in one shot, and coming together in the next shot. It's ludricrous, and admittedly funny, but that's OK for cartoons, not for award winning films. Satire should be a bit more subtle. ""No Fighting in the War Room"" is an example of Kubric's genius, and would deserve a 10 had the film refrained from caricatures and preaching.<br/><br/>War is not funny, and at times, it is ludicrous. It is a worthy subject of satire and ridicule. And in the proper context, it can be funny. But when a film strays into being a platform for preaching propaganda, its no longer entertainment or serious.<br/><br/>Plan ""R"" was a complete fiction. B-52's had numerous radios, and were in constant contact with various command posts throughout the world. Since refueling was necessary in order for the B-52's to reach their targets, the B-52's could not have reached their targets. Aircraft carrying nukes on actual missions had been discontinued when this movie was made. The accident in Spain, where 4 weapons were lost during a air-refueling accident caused political reality to end the practice.(Nobody was killed, except the SAC crew members, and no bombs went nuclear). Nobody was killed by any nuclear accident by either side in the 50 years of the cold war. Read history to learn the truth.<br/><br/>Why hasn't someone made a a ""funny"" movie about fanatics seeking control of nukes?"

"ofpsmith","10","1","3","11 November 2014"," The darkest dark comedy of them all.
","What is a dark comedy? I would describe it as a movie that deals with a dark subject and looks at it in such a humorous way. The Coen Brothers are known for this for their works like Raising Arizona, and Fargo. But my favorite dark comedy is this one. Stanley Kubrick takes the darkest idea imaginable and turns it into something hilarious. A paranoid USAF officer named General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) launches a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union just for fun. Meanwhile in the war room President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) frantically tries to stop Ripper's attack. Also in the war room are the inane USAF chief of staff General Buck Turgidson and the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (also played by Sellers). Merkin is just trying to keep this whole thing under control but the first telephone conversations with the Russian Premier show that he really has no urgency yet. Turgidson is incredibly hyper and energy filled. Instead of viewing Ripper's attack as a horrible mistake and trying to fix it, he actually offers Merkin strategy on how to strike again. He was actually based on real life Air Force General Curtis Lemay and if you read as much Air Force history as I do, you'll know that Lemay was known for doing things like this. Dr. Strangelove actually get's very little screen time but when he's on screen he absolutely steals the show. This is one of the very few times where Kubrick left one of his actors to improvise because he pretty much knew what Sellers could do. All the actors do a fantastic job so if you like dark comedies (and by that I mean really dark) you have got to see this movie. It is amazing."

I recently watched the documentary on the making of the movie and I wasn't surprised to see the efforts that Stanley Kubrick would show to perfect it. The writing, the camera-work, and the well- placed comedy are excellent, but the best really is the cast, led by Peter Sellers, Sterling Hayden, and George C. Scott. I can't imagine anyone else playing their roles any better. Anyway, I honestly can't imagine anyone really disliking this movie,... And if they do, man are we different from each other.

","Brilliant cold-war comedy-drama by Stanley Kubrick. Captures very accurately the angst and paranoia of the Cold War, especially from the view of the US military. And then proceeds to parody it...<br/><br/>Hilariously funny, but peel away the humour and I imagine this movie would have hit a nerve in the 1960s. The threat of nuclear war and the entire planet being destroyed was very real then. Kubrick exposes just how easy the path to our own destruction could have been. <br/><br/>Peter Sellers outdoes even himself by starring in three roles, each of whom is quite different. All use his comedic skills to the maximum but there is a large element of drama in the roles, esp Group Captain Mandrake. Sellers shows he is not just a great comedic actor, but a good dramatic actor too. (See Being There if you need any more proof).<br/><br/>Good support from George C Scott, Sterling Hayden and Slim Pickens.<br/><br/>The Cold War may be over, but this movie has lost none of its effectiveness.

"amiableshark","9","1","3","27 December 2011"," A Wonderful satire from Kubrick!
","First and foremost, let me mate note that Peter Sellers really shone in his role as the group captain, Lionell mandrake. This is a film that heavily mocks the cold war and the absurdity of the situation. For some viewers, the comedic side might not be clear until the end, as some of the humour derives from actors playing silly things straight. Peter Sellers was really good as President Merkin Muffley, and his phone call to the Russian leader is one of the funniest in history.<br/><br/>The routes of concerns in Dr Strangelove take place in logical facilities that soon escalate into absurdity. There was some subtle jokes, and some not so-subtle ones such as Petter Sellers character, Dr Strangelove, with an uncontrollable Nazi hand, and some other slapstick moments. It's got an iconic ending which in the end is lead to by the human assertion of power and gaps in logic. THis is a film well worthing multiple times - for I only fully understood some jokes, such as the true hilarity of a certain Russian's camera- the second time.<br/><br/>""You can't fight in here, this is the war room"". A masterpiece, with the strenght of a serious drama with great irony, one of my favourite comedies."
"coreymoquin","7","1","3","20 October 2011"," A one of a kind
","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb came out in 1964 during the height of the cold war. Kubrick's film has many recurring political themes such as improper leadership and nuclear war. It also has a deep theme of how pointless the tensions between the two factions were. Despite the film's subject matter the film is a comedy. Although, one could call it a dark comedy because it's almost impossible to take such serious themes and make them comedic. Kubrick was able to balance the line of seriousness and comedy to create a very intuitive film. 1964 and the sixties in general were a very tense time for the eastern and western world. Both sides were contending with a nuclear arms race, which terrified the public of both nations. This was most notably apparent in the Cuban missile crisis, which had just occurred a couple years before the film's release. This tension led to racism between the two worlds. In democratic countries this racism was connected to the ""red scare"". Both sides were very subjective of each other just because the country's governments were having issues with each other. The public was very frightened during this time. Kubrick took this opportunity to create a very controversial sort of film. He took a large risk when he decided to portray such a serious situation in a humorous light. The unique thing about this film is that mostly every thing is realistic and believable. The plot itself seems like something that could of actually happened during these times. A general who is so brainwashed into hating the communists so much that he becomes paranoid and finds a loophole to start a nuclear war. These circumstances seem true to life. Even the protocol the characters assume seems realistic. From meting at the war room, to contacting the leaders of Russia and hiring experts (Turgidson and Dr. Strangelove). However, despite having such a realistic and believable setting and plot the characters in the film create a large juxtaposition. This is where the film turns into a comedy. The characters are very tongue and cheek. General Turgidson, played by the late George C. Scott, is a perfect example of an unrealistic and ""goofy"" character. Turgidson constantly finds humor in dark situations, his girlfriend calls him during important meetings, and he is extremely racist. Then there is Dr. Strangelove who is supposed to be a genius scientist. He is an oddball character whose ideas and theories are only weirder than his need to call the president ""mien fuehrer"". All of these comedic characters add levity to the realistic situation that the film's plot has formed. One can say that Kubrick's characters are his ""weapons"". He uses his characters to poke fun at the cold war conflict. It's possible that the point of the film was to show how pointless the whole conflict was. The scene where General Turgidson is urging the president to create a mine so they don't have a ""mine gap"" is obviously alluding to the nuclear arms race and is showing the futility of such a thing. Perhaps Kubricks intentions were to ease the public's fear by showing the situation in a comedic light. It all depends on what the viewer takes away from the film. Dr. Strangelove was most certainly an intuitive film for weaving together serious issues and politics, and making it comedic, while still having a deep message to communicate."

","When images are coined of the Atomic Era, there will always be references to 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,' Stanley Kubrick's 1964 comedy whose figures and situations remain clear in the mind. Widely considered as the greatest political satire in film history, 'Dr. Strangelove' still carries vitality today, despite being over four decades removed from the height of Cold War tensions. The question that Kubrick poses, after all, is still with us: what would happen if nuclear capabilities fell into the hands of a total madman? <br/><br/>Such trouble is brewing in Kubrick's version of the Pentagon. General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), the paranoid commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, is convinced that American water supplies have become 'polluted' with fluoride in a vast Communist conspiracy. Ripper decides to unleash war on the Soviet Union by using a technicality in Wing Attack Plan R that allows him to send a fleet of patrolling B52s into nuclear counterattack on Russian targets. In the now-famous War Room, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) must break the news to President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers), a weak but levelheaded figure modeled after Adlai Stevenson.<br/><br/>While Muffley tries to negotiate with the drunken Soviet Premier via telephone, General Ripper is being sweet-talked by Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Sellers), his Royal Air Force attaché, into revealing a three-letter code needed to access the B52s' radio systems and countermand the attacks. It is soon revealed by the Premier that his countrymen have built a 'doomsday machine' that will automatically explode if any nuclear attack occurs, much to the delight of Dr. Strangelove (yes, Sellers), a wheelchair-ridden Nazi physicist hired by the American government. A total retreat of the B52s becomes imperative as a plane headed by Major T. J. Kong (Slim Pickens), whose radio has been destroyed by enemy fire, stays determined to reach its target. The survival of mankind will hinge on this lone bomber, which is unfortunately run by competent pilots.<br/><br/>Needless to say, 'Dr. Strangelove' hinges on the comic mastery of Peter Sellers, who had already filled the role of Clare Quilty in Kubrick's 'Lolita.' Sellers's portrayal of three men (including an interweave of Muffley and Strangelove) is a major comedic achievement that deserves his Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Sellers's primary talent is his total embodiment of character; he lives roles instead of merely 'playing' them. His working of all three personalities is complete and flawless. George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Slim Pickens are excellent in their supporting roles, conveying the film's berserk atmosphere. James Earl Jones also makes his cinema debut as a pilot on Major Kong's bomber; Tracy Reed appears in the only female part as Turgidson's secretary.<br/><br/>'Dr. Strangelove,' at least in my opinion, plays out as a tongue-in-cheek satire rather than a laugh-out-loud farce. Much removed from 1964, the political implications of 'Strangelove' have a subtlety that has grown with time. Kubrick's decision to make the film comical rather than melodramatic (such as 'Fail Safe') was a brilliant one that shows the true absurdity of our Nuclear Arms Race: gangs of oversexed half-wits playing out the fate of mankind like a poker hand. Nuclear armament reached our world from Pandora's Box in 1945, becoming a threat that can only be avoided with delicate juggling acts. A tough question is whether or not we're choosing the right jugglers and what the repercussions could be if there's a foul-up. As 'Dr. Strangelove' shows, it's not even animosity between nations that can result in nuclear war, but the tiniest flaw in a military's checks and balances.<br/><br/>If there are any flaws to 'Dr. Strangelove,' it is moments of humor that are overripe; while Sellers portrays Strangelove brilliantly, the relative calm of Muffley and Mandrake cause him to look ham-fisted. The fact that General Ripper sets the three-letter code without anyone else's knowledge (including the Secretary of Defense) is also a huge plot gap that fortunately doesn't become noticeable. Satires will always have moments that do not entirely work, but 'Dr. Strangelove' has far more good moments than bad ones. Terry Southern's screenplay (adapted from the Peter George novel 'Red Alert') contains dazzling dialogue and uses stereotypes that only add to the film's comic value. And as long as there is international conflict, 'Dr. Strangelove' is guaranteed its social importance.<br/><br/>'Dr. Strangelove' has enjoyed two incarnations on DVD, the first of which happened in 2001 as a Columbia Pictures 'special edition.' The 2001 disc presents 'Strangelove' in Kubrick's original filming ratio of 1.33:1, thus appearing on TV screens in full frame. Picture quality is fair, with noticeable grain that does not spoil the overall black-and-white effect. Audio is available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese with subtitles in seven languages. Dolby-mastered sound brings across dialogue, sound effects, and Laurie Johnson's music clearly.<br/><br/>Extras are aplenty, with everything you need to know about Strangelove's production. Supplemental material includes 'The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove' and 'Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove,' two recently-made documentaries; footage of mock interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott; a gallery of advertising spreads; bios of the film's lead actors; the theatrical trailer; and a four-page booklet with production notes. Columbia also retailed a 40th anniversary edition of 'Strangelove' on two discs in 2004, with enhanced audio options and further supplements. Viewers appear to have been satisfied with both releases, but 'Dr. Strangelove' is a classic piece of film-making either way. It's required viewing for fans of vintage cinema.<br/><br/>*** out of 4<br/><br/>Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr"

","The obvious movie to compare this to is ""Fail Safe"" - made at about the same time and dealing with essentially the same scenario  an accidental nuclear bombing mission by American jets over the Soviet Union - that no one seems able to stop. The difference between the two, of course, is that while ""Fail Safe"" was deadly serious, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a black comedy  and a wonderful one, beautifully developed all the way through by director Stanley Kubrick. In fact, the thing that made this so funny was how realistic everything seemed. As you watch the events transpire, you find yourself asking the question ""why couldn't this happen"" - and it's not easy to come up with an answer.<br/><br/>Sterling Hayden plays General Jack Ripper, commanding officer of a U.S. Air Force Base who goes insane, becomes convinced of a Communist conspiracy (after all, fluoride was introduced into drinking water in 1946  it must be a Communist conspiracy) and takes it upon himself to issue orders to his pilots to nuke Russia. Meanwhile, his second-in-command Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, a British officer on an exchange (played by Peter Sellers, who also plays the title character, as well as the U.S. President) realizes that Ripper is insane and tries to find a way out of the mess. Back in Washington, Gen. Turgidson (George C. Scott), who commands the Air Force, sort of sums up the whole mood of the movie when he reflects on why current policy won't allow any way to recall the bombers: ""don't let one little slip up"" - even when that ""one little slip up"" is the nuclear bombing of the Soviet Union! - ""ruin the whole program!"" There's a lot of good comedy here. I loved some of the conversations between the U.S. President and the Soviet leader (""Dimitri, turn the music down, I can't hear you""), thought the emergency rations given to the place crews (including prophylactics and nylons) were a scream and it was hilarious to watch as Mandrake is trying to get in touch with the President to explain what's been happening but can't get through because the only phone he can find is a pay phone and he doesn't have the right change. Interestingly, in addition to the comedy, there's a good build-up of suspense as well.<br/><br/>The title of the movie is interesting, because Strangelove (a German apparently brought into the service of the U.S. After World War II) actually only appears in 2 or 3 scenes, but Sellers manages an over the top performance with him when given the opportunity, replete with Nazi salutes and references to the President as ""Mein Fuhrer!"" I would rate this as one of Sellers' best performances. In fact there isn't much of anything to dislike here (although to be honest I found Slim Pickens a bit irritating as Major Kong, the pilot of the plane trying to bomb Russia.) Otherwise, this was great. 8/10"

His performance certainly rivals Alec Guinness' sublime performance in Kind Hearts, if not comprehensively relegating it to an ""also ran"". Kubrick's direction (as always) is firing on all cylinders: a damning indictment of the futility of ""the bomb"" and a cutting commentary on the politics of the Cold War era.

Except Kubrick manages to do it all with such class and hilarity and Sellers delivers arguably some of his best performances (especially of the German Scientist Dr. Strangelove). George C. Scott is a good addition as the fiery soldier who just wants to end the ""commies before its too late"", he bounces off of the other communist characters in the film quite well.

I particularly liked the role of two characters, Peter Sellers who plays many roles in the film of which one is Dr. Stranglove. This Dr. seems to be of German descent, is in a wheelchair and finds himself unable to keep from hailing the president, who is also cleverly also played by Peter Sellers. At more than one time the President is having a phone conversation with the Russian Czar and by what you hear on our side of the conversation the writers are drastically poking fun at the Russians. I really enjoyed the performance of George C. Scott as Gen. Turgidson, he plays the Commie hating Gen. that never trust the Russians at face value. I found Gen. Turgidson to be incredibly funny.<br/><br/>Movie starts at an army base were Gen. Ripper sends out a ""Plan R"" command to the in-flight B-52s that carry nuclear weapons. We are not told what plan R is right away. After giving this order Gen. Ripper barricades his army base and gives orders to shoot anyone attempting to get in, even American ""looking"" soldiers. Before long we are engulfed in two drastically different views. One one hand we sympathize with the commanders in the ""war room"" who are trying to stop a nuclear Holocaust. But on the other hand we find ourselves not wanting the crew of our B-52 to fail their mission. As luck would have it our B-52 looses radio contact and so they proceed with ""plan R"" which we have found out, means plan retaliation. We as we were attacked from the commies and we will retaliate with our nukes. On the home front the ""war room"" is having quiet the bustle of action the Russian Ambassador is aloud into the ""war room"" and Gen. Turgidson has a fit. We get our first glimpse of Dr. Stranglove here. The war room decides to take the base to acquire the codes to cancel plan R. Gen. Ripper fights till the end and eventually shoots himself so the codes are lost. Luckily he wrote them on a piece of paper on his desk before he died. Now the codes are given to contact the other B-52s whole cancel their plans. Our B-52 however is still flying low, Our leader of the plane is Maj Kong, who is a cowboy till the end when he ruff rides a nuke.

The attitudes in the film represented a number of those what were closely held at the time.<br/><br/>Finally, it was considered an adult film, and one that did not contain nudity or explicit sexual content, or for that matter ""the type of violence with red blood"" that causes banning of movies in the US or overseas. Well, there is a bomb dropped, and some long shots of combat, but it was profoundly disturbing because in was very, very real at the time."

He gets the best from all of the actors. it's interesting to see component's from his other films playing a part. i saw some things from ""a clockwork orange"" ( which i found tough to watch all the way thru because of the violence the first couple of times that i saw it).

","If I had a pie chart representing my total nightmares throughout my life; the largest pieces would belong to those with zombies and those with a mushroom cloud of some sort. Now, I was not born in the heat of the Cold War nor did I really ever have that incredible fear of the Russians and nuclear bombs that I am sure that my parents did. However, the hydrogen bomb haunts me at twice a year.<br/><br/>After watching Strangelove, my nightmares become laughable, and more haunting. I am of the generation that was not directly touched by this film, but rather hears echoes of it through parodies, homages, and so forth. Though this film is lauded as a terrific black comedy (which it is), it is also a horror film and very serious with its treatment of the issue. In Strangelove, human beings have this ability to make everything vanish in moments. It is an ability that neither side wants to push itself into a position of having to do, yet things continue to escalate to a point where no one can make a mistake. Yet, if we as humans understand and know so well is that humans will continue to make mistakes. This is the stuff that fuels my nightmare."
"Captain_Couth","10","1","3","30 July 2005"," The World of Stanley Kubrick: Doctor Strangelove...
","Doctor Strangelove (1964) was another dark black and white comedy that Kubrick directed. Filmed and produced right after Lolita, Kubrick decided to work with the enigmatic actor Peter Sellers. This time he plays three different characters (an R.A.F. officer, President Muffley and Doctor Stranglove). George C. Scott co-stars as a manic gum chewing general, Slim Pickens as the S.A.C. bomber pilot (playing the role as straight as an arrow) Sterling Hayden playing the crazed airbase commander Jack D. Ripper, and a early appearance from James Earl Jones as a bomber air man.<br/><br/>The story is about an airbase commander who snaps and thinks the communists have infiltrated the U.S. by poisoning the drinking water and seals of the base and sends it's S.A.C. bombers on a mission to destroy the U.S.S.R. This emergency leads to an international incident when the president of the United States is notified by the premier of the Soviet Union and their ambassador about a self defense mechanism that they have developed. Once a nuclear weapon has detonated in their airspace it will go off setting a chain reaction of thermonuclear destruction. Can the U.S. government stop this rogue general? Can they knock the bomber out of commission? How does Peter Sellers handle all three roles? You'll have to find out for yourself by watching Doctor Strangelove.<br/><br/>I have to give this movie one of my highest recommendation possible award. one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. Knowledge about the Cold War will make it even funnier! ""We'll meet again....."""

","Stanley Kubrick brings a humorous light to the Cold War Era. The threat of nuclear war had everyone on the edge of their seats until Dr. Strangelove comes along. With a brilliant script and amazing performances by Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens among many others...Stanley made the greatest comedy, and in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>In one of the films that put him near the top of the list of great directors, Kubrick took a hot topic and made a hilarious satire out of it, making a laughingstock of a very real threat of the time. Some of the greatest quotes in history, and the most colorful characters ever imagined, this is truly a must-see movie! It never gets old no matter how many times I've watched it, and even 40 years later - with the threat of terrorism present in today's society, the film is a timeless classic and deserves to be seen by all.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend that you do. Hilarious screenplay, hilarious characters powered by brilliant performances, and one of - if not the greatest director of all time in Stanley Kubrick. 10/10 - simply amazing."
"bulleetz37235","9","1","3","11 July 2005"," The funniest film ever?
","Dr Strangelove: or how I learnt to stop worrying and love the bomb is comedy genius.<br/><br/>The film starts with a deranged colonel (Sterling Hayden) ordering a huge fleet of American bombers to attack Russia. His plan: Preserve American purity, by ensuring that the communists don't infect the precious bodily fluids of American people. After ordering the attack, he locks the planes out of reach, using a code. And then barricades himself in his office, with a nervous colleague - played by Peter Sellers, in one of three roles.<br/><br/>As the pentagon gets wind of this, they try and devise a plan to stop the onslaught. Peter Sellers is president Muffey. And with the help of Buck Turgidsen (The brilliant Geroge C. Scott) he tries to negotiate with the Russian ambassador, to stop it. But, things are worse than they first thought. The ambassador informs the president of the doomsday device. A device, that will automatically let rip nuclear warheads, and destroy the world, if any attack on Russia is made. As the bombers close in the tension mounts. An armed unit is sent to the colonel's base to try get the code off him, with little use - this being due to the colonel committing suicide at the last minute. Meanwhile, as this is happening, we follow the path of one of the bombers, which is attacked, and sustains damage. Cutting off radio communication. This is bad news. As the colonel's colleague finally cracks the code, the bombers are aborted. Except one, the damaged one. And so --- the pentagon begins to worry, aware that there is nothing they can do to stop it, they can only hope that the bomber crashes... <br/><br/>In comes Dr Strangelove (Sellers again, his best character) a maniacal split-personality scientist, whose identity changes from Nazi-German at one instance, to Russian citizen the next. They talk about the strategy they must undertake to ensure that if the bombs do go off, that they can still live.<br/><br/>But... Ah, I can't spoil the ending. But rest assured, as tense, and serious as the film seems, it really is quite funny---<br/><br/>Quoting:<br/><br/>""You can't fight in here this is the war room.""<br/><br/>""Look at the big board. They're getting ready to clobber us.""<br/><br/>---From the hilarious Dr Strangelove, the eccentric Buck Turgidsen, and the nutty-as-a-loon colonel, this film is amazingly funny, and poses a sly question, in it's anti-war themes. Isn't war. And nuclear war just so laughable?<br/><br/>Well, I don't think it's up to me to field that question. But all I can do is highly recommend this film."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","3","8 July 2005"," War and sex (spoilers throughout)
","What I love most about Dr Strangelove is the fact that General Ripper destroys the world because he can't get an erection. It's just the most absurd reason to start nuclear war. Yet it also weirdly has a ring of truth. There you are, you're a General in the American Air Force, responsible for thousands of men and the safety of the country, and your sexual prowess slowly begins to ebb away. What do you do? Do you accept it like a normal human being and seek help? Do you just ignore it? Or do you let it drive you mad and then concoct elaborate conspiracy theories to explain your inability to get it up? Ripper certainly goes for the final option. Only this is a man who can drop nuclear bombs and who has an Air Force that can avenge his sexual impotence. The end of the world and the final big bang are his last orgasm.<br/><br/>And when you watch the film it's amusing to notice Ripper's two big penis substitutes  his large cigar and his huge gun. He's obviously compensating for his sexual shortcomings. And the excuses he makes are hilarious. I can't help but crack up when he talks about ""loss of essence"", ""bodily fluids"" and ""fatigue"". What is the virile American male who's insecure about his sexual potency meant do? Nuke everyone of course! <br/><br/>And the phallic symbols aren't only restricted to General Ripper. If the copulating aeroplanes aren't bad enough then there's Major Kong with a huge bomb between his legs. He whoops in orgasmic delight as he fulfils Ripper's revenge by dropping the General's substitute penis on the Russians. That'll teach anyone who laughs at his flaccidity! <br/><br/>But staying on the subject of sex in Dr Strangelove, another thing that tickles me is the way that the Nazi, the Commie and the Yank agree that using a mineshaft (snigger, snigger) to have sex with lots of women is a terrific idea. Nothing builds bridges like promises of post-nuclear war orgies. Oh, and I also love the moment when Sellers as Strangelove gazes down at his groin with wide-eyed alarm as his rouge Nazi hand does something off-screen <br/><br/>However, it's not all about sex (although Kubrick rightly shows that most things are about sex). Dr Strangelove is also about the stupidity of authority and the blind way we accept it. I mean, surely if someone is a General or a leader of a nation, they must know what they're doing. They must be right in the head. They must have our best intentions at heart. Right? Of course it's a lot of rubbish. People in power are just as crazy, if not more so, than everyone else. Yet like sheep we all go along with it. Just take how gleefully Kong ensures humanity's demise. He doesn't ask questions, he just goes along for the ride, whooping all the way. And then there are the soldiers forced to fight one another. It's always the ordinary people who end up paying. And how insane is the idea of a nuclear deterrent anyway. Whatever happens no one can win. Whoever fires first, the result is always mutual annihilation. But perhaps Ripper does everyone a favour by ending the insanity with his own brand of madness.<br/><br/>As you can probably gather, Ripper is my favourite character. Buck Turgidson, though, would have to be my second. I love his cold rationalism  ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks""  and his blind, patriotic pride  ""Does he have a chance? Hell yeah!"" He's the red blooded American male who's happy to cheat, lie and shout in order to get his way. And he's strangely endearing. Sure he's a loudmouth and he's really not that smart, but like Homer Simpson you just can't help but warm to him. And I also crack up at his prayer. It's very American to talk coldly about carnage and then give thanks to god. And speaking of the fictitious one, I also love the way that Ripper sends his bombers off to nuke Russia and those pesky Commie atheists and then says that ""God willing we will prevail and in peace and freedom of fear."" As always, the religious have a terrific way with hypocrisy.<br/><br/>But it would be remiss of me to talk about Dr Strangelove and not mention Peter Sellers. He's magnificent. Each three of his creations is superb. But although Strangelove gets most of the attention, it's probably Mandrake that I like the most. He's just so terribly British. I mean, just take the calm, rather frightened way that he talks to Ripper. And the blasé way that his mentions his torture. And I still crack up when he mentions his ""gammy"" leg. He's a sane voice in the mouth of madness.<br/><br/>But there's so much that I love about Dr Strangelove and so many moments I could mention. However, it all really comes down to one thing. People are bloody insane and each day we spend without destroying ourselves is down to blind luck."
"metalrox_2000","10","1","3","1 July 2005"," One of the greatest movies ever filmed
","Originally begun as a drama, Stanley Kubriak smartly followed his instincts after a screening, and turned the movie into a comedy. Without a doubt one of the most important, and funniest films ever made. George C. Scott is over the top as the crazed Turgenson, who's character was Dan Ackroyd's inspiration for the admiral in the movie Spies Like Us. Petter Sellers almost walks away with the movie, playing more roles in one movie then some actors do in their entire career. SOme of the signs posted at the various army camps are ungodly funny, as there is always something you'll catch for the first time, no matter how many times you've seen the movie (and i've managed to wear out both a VHS and DVD copy of the movie) Only a genius could have a army general named Jack D. Ripper. One of my personal favorite scenes comes when Sellers as Mutley is trying to call Sellers as the president when a stone faced soldier appears. Mutley finally gets the soldier to agree to let him make the phone call. To get change, they are force to break into the nearby coke machine, and in a drawl, rather semi-serious tone the soldier replies ""If you don't get the president on the phone, you're going to have to answer to the coca-cola company."" Perhaps one of the most memorable scenes comes at the end, with Slim Pickins riding the bomb towards the ground. As he screams yee-haw, the bomb hits, and we are treated to the song happy trail as explosions happen all over the screen. This infamous scene has been replayed many times, most notably during an episode of the Simpsons. Another bit a trivia, Pinkins would ape one of his own scenes in this movie in the movie 1941, when he is captured, and taken aboard a Japanese Sub. 40 years old, and still as funny today as it must have been then. it will still be funny when the movie is 140 years old"
"billywilder67","10","1","3","20 June 2005"," Dr. Strangelove
","I clearly remember the first time I saw Dr. Strangelove. I fell in love with it immediately, a combination of Sellers in three flawless roles, Kubric behind the camera, the exuberant war room settings, and Scott's expressions. It is one of the most beautiful works of the art of film: it is far and way the greatest black comedy and satire of all time, showing what can happen when the fate of many lies in the hands of an incompetent few. Some say that the Cold War issues the film addresses have somewhat less meaning now, because that is all behind us. I completely disagree. Consider Kubric's 2001 and A Clockwork Orange: we are closer now to those times that Kubric prophesied in the late sixties/early seventies now than we were then. The same goes for Dr. Strangelove. Although it covers the issues of the Cold War, the issues of the Doomsday Machine, the crazy General Ripper, all of the silly authorities Kubric so vibrantly depicts seem more like things we are headed in the direction of now, than it did forty years ago. This is a film that I would not argue with one if they called it perfect. From Kubric's brilliant directing, to its tight editing, the dark, riveting, cinematography, the fantastic acting lead by Sellers as three different characters, and some of the most memorable settings in the history of the movies make this one of the top tenperhaps the top fivefilms of all time. Never has a comedy had more of a point, and a biting satire."

Kubrick's theme may have lost a bit of its power as the Cold War (according to some) has ended...but those familiar with the circumstances of world politics during that time will find the narrative hilarious. The key to this film's success begins with Peter Sellers. His triple role in the film is one of the best performances ever. Check it out! Kubrick's choice of black and white adds a stark reality to the work...watch Dr. Strangelove even in the depths of summer and it will send chills up your spine.

"MichaelMargetis","9","1","3","3 June 2005"," ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room."" - President Merking Muffley
","#1 Film of 1963<br/><br/>It's been over forty years, since Stanley Kubrick released his highly controversial yet intricate and beautifully made spoof comedy circling around the conflict the U.S. had with the Russians during the Cold War. 'Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' held up wonderfully with age, and is still considered by many even today not only one of the funniest films of all time, but one of the very best films of all time. It's amazing to me after so much time has passed (the movie was in black and white for god's sake), audiences all over the country still get the dry and deadpan humor that 'Dr. Strangelove' so exquisitely expresses, and still are left to ponder the subtle but definitely present political statements at the heart of movie. Since I wasn't alive in 1963 I don't know for sure, but I heard from reliable people around during that time, a lot of Americans (especially in politics) hated this film because it shows them as something less then the geniuses they usually think themselves to be, it kind of just shows them as idiots, or buffoons.<br/><br/>The film chronicles what seems like the cold war, a war that could turn out to be World War III. The movie stars the immensely talented Peter Sellers in three roles, that are all different and carefully crafted by Sellers. The first is Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, a captain in the United States Army under the command of Brig. General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden - The Godfather), who fears the Russians because they intend to fluoridate water -- oh no!!!!!! General Ripper and Group Captain Mandrake are stranded in an office building under attack from the Russians, and Gen. Ripper goes completely insane in one of the plot lines 'Dr. Strangelove' possesses. The second character Sellers portrays is the president of the United States, Merkin Muffley, whose in the war room during the entire course of the film, trying to decide what to do when the Russians try to bomb the U.S. Merkin Muffney is a short bald fellow, who never seems to quite understand what's going on around him. Helping him make decisions, are the war hungry General Buck Turgison (George C. Scott - Patton), and the ex-Nazi mad genius scientist, Dr. Strangelove (who is also played by, you guessed it - Peter Sellers - in his funniest role of the entire film), who tries to refrain himself from involuntarily giving Hitler salutes throughout his hilarious scenes. 'Dr. Strangelove' is based on a book that isn't presented in a comedic fashion like the film adaptation. Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones co-star in this off-the-wall dark comedy.<br/><br/>There are so many wonderful things to be said about 'Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. Kubrick provides eye-popping direction way ahead of it's time, and also provides a rich, engaging and timeless screenplay based on the popular novel. Peter Sellers gives his very best screen performance in 'Dr. Strangelove' (in my opinion) tearing up the screen with his three fabulous and ingenious characters. George C. Scott is surprisingly witty and likable as the war room General, Sterling Hayden provides us with solid work as the crazy General Ripper who fears that evil fluoride in water plot the Russians are planning, and Slim Pickens is funny as the Major T.T. 'King' Kong, who actually rides a missile being fired into Russian soil from his fighter plane. The movie was nominated for four Academy Awards -- Best Actor in a Leading Role - Peter Sellers, Best Director - Stanley Kubrick, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year, and sadly didn't receive awards for any of them. If it was up to me, I'd give it awards for all four categories, because looking back, 'Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is by far the best film of 1963.<br/><br/>In conclusion of this film review, I have to say 'Dr. Strangelove' is a terrific accomplishment in regards to film-making. Kubrick really hits it out of the park with this, making it his second best film of all time (the first being 1971's A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess' vision of a horrific future). The movie has minor shortcomings, like moving a little slow towards the first half hour or so, but besides that I have to say it's all near perfect. I think I admired 'Dr. Strangelove' not only because it's very funny and delivers interesting political messages, but because it stars one of my favorite actors of all time (Peter Sellers) and is directed by one of my favorite filmmakers of all time (Stanley Kubrick). If you have a taste for an abnormal dark comedy, and haven't seen this already, go out and rent it. Chances are you might just like it. Grade: A-<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #44"

But there is so much to say that I can't really help it.<br/><br/>This movie is a dark irony. I cannot in good conscience call it a comedy, for the laughter that it causes is not a funny one, but one of sadness. You see this beautiful movie, so recent feeling half a century after it was shot, with extraordinary casting, acting, directing and attention to detail, and you recognize in it all the ugliness that resides in all humans and humanity as a whole. This movie is to be watched, seen, partially understood, then watched again and again.<br/><br/>OK, Petter Sellers is ""the man"" in this movie. Not just a man, but at least three, as I am not sure of the soldiers that were shot from behind (by the cameras :) ). George C. Scott is great as a silly general, the rest of the cast performs great, too, although for a movie that shows so much attention to minutiae, I guess they couldn't have acted bad if they wanted to. Kubrick would not have let them.<br/><br/>The humor is terrifying and present in almost every scene. You just have to watch this one. Just have to. One of the few movies I gave a 10 to."

","""We accept the world in which we are placed"".<br/><br/>This film has a very ironic sense of humor but beside that there is a hidden message I believe.<br/><br/>This quote sums up the film because Dr. Strangelove is set in 1950's in a time of secrecy and fear of a communist invasion. In Dr. Strangelove there is a constant threat of being overrun but the communist nation. A constant fear of what the Russian's will do next. This point can be seen in the way that George C. Scott who plays General Turgidson. When Scott finds out that the president of the United States is going to let a Russian into the War Room, he immediately packs up his papers in a panicked fashion and he is concerned about letting the Russian see the ""Big Board"". Also when Peter Sellers is playing Dr. Strangelove and says that it is inevitable that the world will end. He reveals the idea of sending the important people in to a mineshaft to survive and nothing will infringe on breaching the mineshaft gap. Where there are ten women to every one man, ultimately creating a perfect race.

","One thing that always struck me great about Dr. Stranglove or: How i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. was its genuine humor about the U.S. air force and government! It blends ingenious comedic references with action and war. It also has hilarious war references to certain characters such as ""crout"" as a slang term for Nazi, or German. It's probably one of the best Kubrick films i've seen. I think he's one of the best directors in all time mainly because he can direct a good variety of movies (i.e. A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey.) Dr. Stranglove or: How i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is definitely in my opinion his greatest film. The acting is flawless and the characters are played really good (mad props to Peter Sellers, he rules at acting.)I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes GOOD movies. At first i was a little too eager to watch this movie (mostly because all my friends keep telling me it's so great) so i couldn't really concentrate but i eventually got sucked in, hehe. It's also one of those movies that you can watch over and over again without getting bored of it.

","I hesitate to call Dr. Strangelove a comedy, lest doing so encourages you to watch it and expect a laugh a minute. Not that it isn't funny, but it is a dark comedy; as dark as they come, probably, about a total nuclear doomsday. You also have to watch it with some sort of historical consciousness, I suppose, to truly understand the satire in ""the mine shaft gap"" and the ""Doomsday gap."" This movie is probably the best example of political satire I've ever seen; as a work of ""irony, sarcasm, or caustic wit used to attack or expose folly, vice, or stupidity,"" its particular target is the Cold War, yet the ultra-patriotic Texan fighter pilot who, complete with accent and cowboy hat, ends up dropping the weapon of mass destruction on the Soviet Union and triggering a chain of events leading to complete nuclear holocaust reminds us that politics and attitudes have not changed much since 1964, when the film was made. Its performances are probably its strongest points, with Peter Sellers as 1) RAF Group Captain Mandrake, 2) President Muffley, and 3) the title role of Dr. Strangelove, Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, George C. Scott as Gen. Buck Turgidson, James Earl Jones in his first movie role as Lieutenant Lothar Zogg, and Slim Pickens as Major ""King"" Kong, the aforementioned Texan pilot. I've actually heard that Sellers was supposed to also play Major Kong,but due to the fact that he either broke his leg or had doubts about a Texan accent (stories vary), Slim Pickens, a character actor from westerns, was brought in; I've also heard that Stanley Kubrick, the director, did not tell him that the film was a comedy, and the earnestness of his patriotic pep-talk to his crew, promising metals and promotions after they drop the bomb, is certainly a convincing portrayal of the jingoistic yet not all together un-admirable loyalty practiced by true believers in the American Duty, and does not in itself ring with irony as much as the rest of the film does. Of course, the pompous music and the actual context of the episode do frame it ironically, the context being the sudden decision by General Jack D. Ripper (Jack the Ripper. Get it? One in many wonderful instances of nomenclature, my personal favorite being Colonel Bat Guano) to initiate a pre-emptive strike against the Soviet Union, thereby destroying the ""Cold"" part of the Cold War. Ripper, believing that the Soviets are poisoning ''the purity and essence of our natural fluids'' by adding fluoride to the water supply, which was apparently a common belief in the 1950s, issues a Code Red, seals of his air force base, and orders a nuclear attack. Major Kong's flight crew is one of many to respond to this order, and will prove the only one to actually complete it. But before that can occur, we are introduced to a whole range of characters. RAF Group Captain Mandrake serves as the voice of reason countering General Ripper's manic ""purity and essence of our natural fluids,"" mantra; he knows that Ripper is a few bombs short of a nuclear arsenal, yet tries to wheedle the code for recalling the doom bearing planes out of him through gentle persuasion, until it is too late. Being the clever person he is, he manages to figure out the code anyway, yet runs into another obstacle when he tries to call the president of the United States: he's out of change and the White House will not take a collect call. Meanwhile, President Muffley, the President of the United States and rather milquetoasty, has convened assorted advisors in an effort to prevent the unthinkable; among them, General Buck Turgidson, who's over the top paranoia and pride in the American nuclear program do not deter him from assuring his girlfriend that ""it's not just physical,"" over the phone in the middle of a national crisis, and the sinister Dr. Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist who is now head of the United States' weapons development program, and who's black-gloved right hand springs into Nazi salutes and tries to throttle him to death. Also invited to the War Room, much to the angst of Turgidson (""He'll see the big board!""), is Soviet Ambassador de Sadesky, played by Peter Bull, who informs Muffley of the Soviet Union's planned retaliation for just such an eventuality: a spontaneous Doomsday device which can not be shut off or deactivated. When Turgidson and Sadesky almost come to blows, they are sternly told by President Muffley, ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the War Room!"" That sort of irony runs through out the film, both verbally and, something I've rarely seen, visually: at one point, a full fledged battle on an army base is conducted with a ""PEACE IS OUR PROFESSION SIGN"" looming in the background. Returning to Major ""King"" Kong and his brave crew, they are hit by a Soviet missile as authorized by President Muffley to prevent the Russian ""Doomsday"" device from detonating automatically, and lose communications capabilities; when an emergency recall of the B-52s is finally sent out, they are therefore unable to receive the message and set out to complete their mission. The film-ends in a montage of many mushroom clouds, with Vera Lynn singing ""We'll Meet Again,"" and you just know that they will. That even if the survivors are trapped underground for 90 years, awaiting a thaw in the nuclear winter, when the time comes the same characters, the same attitudes, and the same reasoning for warfare will re-emerge. After all, 40 years later, they have."

"Merkin4pres64","10","1","3","14 February 2005"," Finest Comedy Ever Made
","Stanley Kubrick's classic black comedy, Dr. Stranglove, is revered one of the greatest films ever made as it placed number three on the AFI's funniest comedies list. What makes this movie a great movie is that Kubrick brilliantly slipped in comedic excellence in a film dealing with controversial material at the time and did so in a way that makes the viewer of the film think.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick had set up a pie fight scene for the end of the movie, but in a wise move, decided not to include it in the film, realizing Dr. Strangelove was a satirical comedy and not slapstick.<br/><br/>I consider Stanley Kubrick to have only two classic movies, Dr. Strangelove, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. With these two films, Stanley Kubrick had set himself up for more critical successes in the future including ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""The Shining,"" and ""Full Metal Jacket."" Of the above three, I have only seen ""The Shining,"" and realized, that, it shows a different side of Kubrick thus showing the visionary director can handle many different genres.<br/><br/>Now back to ""Dr. Stangelove."" Peter Sellers brilliantly takes three roles in this film, Lionel Mandrake, Dr. Strangelove, and my personal favorite, President Merkin Muffly. George C. Scott I think gives the best performance of his career (Give me a break, I haven't seen ""Patton"")as the lovable General Buck Turgidson who tries to convince the War Room representatives of commie conspiracy behind the use nuclear weapons on their own country.<br/><br/>The scenes with crazed General Jack D. Ripper make me laugh because he orders a nuclear attack because the damn commies are going to unpurify the water. Mandrake however realizes the general's insanity and acts to stop the bombing. However with this who situation, I love way how Muffly describes it as a ""silly thing,"" makes me laugh every time.<br/><br/>What is great about this movie is the way it ends with Vera Lynn singing ""We'll Meet Again"" while mushroom clouds appear in the background."
"ryan_kuhn","10","1","3","13 February 2005"," The darkest comedy ever
","One of the worst things to ever happen to Hollywood was the end of the Cold War, and looking back at a movie like Dr. Strangelove reminds us of the fearful, sober, overall silliness that was the tensions between the Soviets and the Americans. During the 40 years or so that the two super powers threatened each other's destruction, movies had always exploited the fears of the movie-goer to create suspense that often was ""too real."" Dr. Strangelove is the darkest of the black comedies about the Cold War, and the source of the humor comes from how real it is. Examine one of the classic scenes from the movie. What would be the first words between the American President and the Soviet Premier when nuclear war is about to start? Thanks to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, we have an answer that looks ridiculous, but may be as real as anything else in movies. Or look at the George C. Scott character. As the head of the Air Force, he gleefully announces that an all out attack on the Soviets would only result in the ""death of 10-20 million civilians, depending on the breaks"", of course. There are a few weaknesses to the movie in the way of time issues (is it 3 am or 3 pm?), but those are only minor quibbles. This may be my favorite movie, a comedy about the end of the world. We are able to laugh at the circumstances that lead to the end of civilization, which also scares the hell out of us. What if these are the people running our country, with their finger on the button? Even now, with the Cold War over, this movie resonates with the viewer, showing us how silly the competition was in the Cole War (By the end of the movie, there's concern over a ""Mine Shaft Gap"") and how the leaders who controlled the fate of a planet may not have been the right men for the job."
"ACitizenCalledKane","9","1","3","2 February 2005"," A biting political satire, and a nightmarishly dark comedy!
","Some times, the only way that we can cope with the horrors of the world we live in is to laugh in defiance of them. Stanley Kubrick looks directly into the eye of the Cold War; the paranoia, the fear, the tension, the politics of major world powers gone mad, with the fate of the entire world hanging in the balance, and he snickers! Kubrick accomplished the impossible in 1963...He made the world laugh at the nuclear bomb. He didn't do it by sugar-coating anything, in fact, he did the exact opposite, painting a pointedly dark and satirical portrait of the powers that be. This portrait, too accurate not to fear, yet too accurate not to laugh at hysterically, resembles a group of little boys comparing the quality of their toys. The insanity of The Cold War is exposed, almost to the point of violation. There are clowns deciding the fate of the world, and human lives are nothing more than statistics, yet through Kubrick's lens, we find humor in the tragedy! We see how ridiculous it all is. An army general manipulates a complex Cold War strategy in order to start a nuclear war with the Russians because he blames fluoridation for his impotence. It sounds preposterous, and it is, but anyone who follows politics knows that the crazier things appear, the more realistic they usually are. The manic performances of Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and even Sterling Haden's twisted Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper provide the life to this story, which speaks so often of an ultimate doom. Peter Sellers plays three parts - Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and the mad genius, Dr. Strangelove. The President is Sellers playing it straight, while Mandrake shows a little more of Sellers' eccentricity, but it is in Strangelove that he goes completely over the top. Speaking of over the top, George C. Scott gives an incredible energy to his roll as General ""Buck"" Turgidson. Scott later admitted that this was his own personal favorite performance. Slim Pickens basically plays himself as the gung-ho Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, who caps off the film in one of the most famous scenes in modern movie history. The satire is powerful, the humor dark, and the end result - remarkable. The detail that went into the War Room and the interior of the aircraft is amazing. The fact that Kubrick could produce a comedy as hysterical as Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is testimony to his far-reaching genius, and another example of the classics that have come together to form his legacy! A must-see!"

Nothing against it, its one of the best movies I have ever seen, just its not funny. Its so depressing as it can be. If you realise that the same weapons(vast number of them) are still somewhere and they are waiting when something went terribly wrong to be used... no thats not really fun, even if we admit, that the doomsday machine is a fiction, still it is a nightmare. So the conclusion is that there are some funny moments but they are so surrounded by so many depressing situations, that the viewer has no time to start laughing.

Meanwhile when it's all said and done, the now famous ""riding the bomb"" scene spawns from this great, yet almost ironic moment.

We know it's a spoof of us and of the dark days of the Cold War. We don't take it personally. In fact, we've all known people similar, if not exactly like, the characters in this film, which makes the movie all that more fun.

And by and large, the US does far more good in the world than it does bad. We bailed Europe out of two world wars and we still try to ease the suffering of millions. The guy who listed all the supposed NBC crimes we've committed since the dawn of the 20th Century has obviously got an ax to grind no matter what reality tells him.

","Like most of Stanley Kubrick's films, ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is an excellent movie. A combination of a great (and funny) story and wonderful acting makes this one of the best movies ever, and certainly the best Kubrick movie.<br/><br/>The movie begins when cleverly named Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders his B-52 bombers to attack with nuclear weapons inside the Soviet Union. However, unknown to General Ripper and the rest of the world, the Soviets have built a doomsday weapon, which will detonate and cover the earth in nuclear radiation for the next 98 years if the Soviet Union is attacked.<br/><br/>Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) is from the British Royal Airforce. When he learns of the order to attack, he tries to persuade General Ripper to issue the recall code, only known by the General. Meanwhile, in the Pentagon War Room, General ""Buck"" Turgidson informs the President (also played by Sellers) of the attack, and the President is, to say the least, rather annoyed. He orders the army to capture the air force base and get General Ripper to issue the recall code.<br/><br/>When the army finally captures the base, Colonel ""Bat"" Guano (Keenan Wynn), who is charged with getting General Ripper on the phone with the President, finds that the General has shoot himself, leaving behind only a piece of paper, on which several seeming meaningless phrases are written. However, Group Captain Mandrake realizes that it's really the recall code, and gets on the line to the President, after some arguing.<br/><br/>The recall code is issued, and all planes turn around. That is, all but one, piloted by Major T.J. ""King"" Kong (Keenan Wynn). His plane has been hit with a missile, and the radio is dead, so he is unable to get the recall code. When this becomes obvious, everyone is at chock. Enter Dr. Strangelove (once again, played by Sellers), an ex-Nazi scientist. His rather crazy solution is to settle in a mine shaft and live there until there is no more nuclear radiation.<br/><br/>The movie is a very funny one. It has some very memorable quotes such as ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!"" and General Rippers rather funny speech about bodily fluids.<br/><br/>But in order to really appreciate this movie, you have to see it for yourself, and I strongly recommend that you do! This movie gets a very deserving 10/10."

","What a film. Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers have made a film that can only be described as one of the greatest ever made. It is a superb satire, brilliantly funny and filled with some spectacular performances. Peter Sellers' three performances are a masterclass in acting. From the wonderfully English Group Captain Mandrake to President Merkin Muffley and, not to mention, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers produces characters who will remain timeless. George C. Scott's performance, which he viewed not to be his own, is outstanding. It is tribute to Kubrick's spectacular direction that he was able to get such a performance out of one of his actors. And what of Kubrick's direction. Incredible. It is flawless. He manages to maintain a good comic script, which deals with a sensitive subject, without causing offense. Other than this, a superb supporting cast, a brilliant screenplay and the war room lead this film into the halls of the great.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Wacky_Deli","10","1","3","26 November 2004"," -FANTASTIC-
","Stanley Kubrick has certainly showed the world how much humor can be found within one of the most serious subjects imaginable, nuclear war. 'Dr. Strangelove' details a particularly bad blunder by the United States military during the climax of the cold war. The film covers the time span of about two-hours beginning when the maniacal and mentally unstable General Jack D. Ripper, (Sterling Hayden), orders a surprise nuclear air-strike on dozens of installations inside Russia, cuts off all communication entering or leaving the base, and fortifies himself within the confines of his office. Frantically in an attempt to abort Ripper's order, President Merkin Muffley, (Peter Sellers), assembles the military's leading generals in Washington's top-secret WAR ROOM. Efforts are made by the assembly to storm Ripper's base and drive him into custody, however, because Gen Ripper ordered his troops to defend the base at all costs, the U.S. military are forced to open fireÂ….on their own men! Unable to get to Ripper, the WAR ROOM assembly contacts the Russian Premier and informs him of the impending attack. Russia then delivers some very disturbing news; the Top-Secret 'DOOMSDAY' device that has been developed for a situation like this will be set off during the attack. The grim information prompts the assembly to turn for help from one particularly eccentric scientist, the ex-Nazi Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers, again).<br/><br/>The film, in all respects, is a masterpiece for its wildly funny satire of inept individuals within the government who hold the apocalypse at the tips of their fingers. Filmed in stark black and white, the movie just 'screams' the Kubrick-style by including enormous portions of scenes filmed entirely in one shot. Kubrick also puts to use the technique of the 'long, tracking-shot' he has made himself famous for in previous efforts such as 'The Killing'(1956). The acting in this film is nothing below spectacular as Sterling Hayden is portrayed as the sadistic yet focused General Ripper. George C. Scott plays the gruff Gen. Buck Turgidson, who is basically a good natured individual but totally and utterly inept at his job. James Earl Jones also makes his film debut as Lt. Lothar Zogg, the bombardier aboard the aircraft ordered to nuke Russia. However, the one man who dwarfs all the other actors in his performance is Peter Sellers. Sellers plays three different characters in the film, Dr. Strangelove, Capt. Lionel Mandrake, and President of the United States Merkin Muffley. As the President, Sellers convincingly speaks perfect 'American' English without the slightest hint of his own accent. And as for special effects in this film, a single shot at the film's climax is regarded as one of the most memorable scenes in Hollywood history. <br/><br/>If quick pacing, witty dialogue, subtle jokes, sheer horror, and stark settings are what you dig, 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' will be guaranteed not to disappoint."

","Dr. Strangelove is by far my favorite movie of all time. It contains nearly all the elements that can be found in great movies: comedy, suspense, action, intelligence, satire, irony, and even romance (if you count the wife at the beginning or Dr. Strangloves plan for repopulating the world). Taking into account that it was released during the cold war, it was very gutsy. It also does well representing many groups of Americans and their points of view (the warhawks, the moderates on either side of the political spectrum, and the anti-war people). The comedy in the movie is both blunt and very clever. All of these aspects and the infamous ""no fighting in the war room"" line make this movie the greatest comedy of all time. 10-10"

","For me, there is no much to say on Kubrick, he is a genius. Besides being a great director, he is a talent to reveal the best performances from his actors. In Dr. Strangelove I have seen one of the most outstanding performances from Peter Sellers, for it he should have been rewarded, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden. Telling a story about cold war, which is an outmoded  subject for now of course, in a satiric way along the detailed art direction and set decoration still attracts the attention and makes people laugh about it. His devotion to perfection and details, his exceptional directing and his sense of humor makes the film unforgettable. Watch the film and look at that War Room which was considered a real room for one of the ex presidents of the United States. It is a classic, a must see and of course a glance at the history."

","If you wonder why I titled this commentary the way I did.. it's because I attempted here to convey the subtle satire the only way I knew how.. not by explaining what it is, not by defining comedic concepts, but with a friendly satirical greeting.<br/><br/>I think one thing worth nothing is, if one person does not like this film, it does not necessarily mean they did not get the humor, or they are stupid or whatever you want to judge them as being.. perhaps they just didn't like the film... to say any movie is bad, or wrong, invites narrow minded criticism. One must state what it is about a film they liked or disliked, therefore those with opposing views can understand what is causing the difference of opinion. <br/><br/>I'm watching the movie Dr Strangelove, and I will not say anything yet... My personal head space is subjective and filters the movie thru my own set of discriminating beliefs to result in my opinion and personal view of the film. <br/><br/>I would not say the film is great, I would not say the film is horrible, I would not define the film as not great or not horrible.<br/><br/>How I react or respond changes in time. Today I might not like this film, tomorrow I may get something from it I did not yesterday. As I change so do my beliefs. <br/><br/>I respect the cast of this film, and historically am aware this is Kubrick's first and only satire, which to me says something right there. Kubrick being one of the greatest film directors of all time - in my opinion. In fact he is so well respected I feel I don't even have to say it is my opinion, it is nearly a fact. But, I say it is my opinion anyways, to keep unbiased.<br/><br/>
So with no further ado I will give my personal opinion of Dr Strangelove, taking into account everything I just noted above at length:<br/><br/>
This movie is awesome :) I laughed my ass off. <br/><br/>nadir writes ""There are probably over a 1000 comedy movies better than this e.g. ""The Party"", ""Very Bad Things"", ""50 first Dates"", ""National Security"", ""American Pie trilogy"", ""Starsky & Hutch"", ""Punch Drunk Love"", ""Money Talks"", ""Go"", ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Gods Must Be Crazy 1 & 2"" & ""Spaceballs"" to name a few. From the 44 minutes of what i had seen of the movie i would have to give this movie a 2/10.""<br/><br/>and I wonder if their post is complete satire.. as they mention films that are not even comedies.  50 first dates wasn't a comedy.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest could never be classified as a comedy.  American Pie, Starsky and hutch even considered as the best comedies of all time? Well, you can see where this is going.  I am discrediting this person's commentary, and as you can see, it doesn't take any effort to accomplish.<br/><br/>Having seen all the movies Nadir mentions, as well as most likely quite a few they haven't,  from Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, to James Stewart onwards to the contemporary... I can say with a certain amount  of experience, that George C Scott, Peter Sellers, were genius in this film. Remember, in comedy there are things we need to  become attuned to.. how attuned we are to true comedy, begins with the superficial, and deepens to the subtle, to the improvised, to the satirical...  George Scott gets the best lines, but Peter Seller's carries the film. Remember, when standing on the shoulder's of giants, it's best to not  hit your head on a satellite."

","Stanley Kubrick is to me the greatest director this world has ever had and this film proves my point. <br/><br/>When I first saw this film I thought it was boring and dull, but over a couple of viewings I realize just how important and ground-breaking, Dr Strangelove is. What you must remember is this was made during the cold war, plus it was at it's most disturbing peak. And this film did show just how pointless war is, and with 'recent events' it makes it more ironic to watch also. Dr Strangelove is suppose to be a very black comedy and on some levels it is, but I will admit that there some scenes which I say ""This is suppose to be very funny but it not making me laugh."" To me the humor is NOT suppose to be belly-laugh material, but humor that makes you smile for about one second. <br/><br/>I can't praise the acting on this film enough it's on some level perhaps the best seen in any film ever made. Peter Sellers is just amazing, I mean to play three people all different in some way is quite incredible to watch and to me he SHOULD of got the Oscar for it. The main reason he so good in it that he plays these people very straight faced and very seriously, which makes it more convincing and shocking as well, and every time he's doing something you know it's going to be a classic movie moment. Don't forget that the supporting cast is just as good as Peter is George C. Scott is wonderful as this very in your face looney and keep an eye open for James Earl Jones, because he makes his screen debut also.<br/><br/>All I can say is this is a TRUE classic and will still be for about 50 more years to come. It also has more famous movie moments than any other you can think of. And lastly is has the best written comedy screenplay in movie history."

Chock full of excellent actors and with the direction from one of the most talented of all time, Dr. Strangelove is a brutal powerhouse of a film that few can compete with. Made and released during the Cold War, it definitely had much more of an impact back then than it does now because the film is about just that...the Cold War and it's ludicrous implications. <br/><br/>All hell breaks loose when a general gone mad, General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), decides to take things into his own hands and start a nuclear war in retaliation to the Soviet's ""attack"" of implementing fluoride into our water supply, thereby poisoning the entire American population's bodily fluids. As the imminent threat comes closer and the planes carrying the warheads travel closer to their targets destined for complete annihilation, it quickly becomes apparent that stopping the attack might not be as easy as the powers that be originally thought. As dark as it sounds, this film is hilarious! <br/><br/>Peter Sellers is this film. Without him, it wouldn't be nearly as funny. He plays three different characters including the President of the United States, Jack D. Ripper's first officer, and of course Dr. Strangelove. He is a pure joy to watch on the screen and even with the knowledge of his multiple characters beforehand, he is almost entirely unrecognizable from role to role. One of my all time favorite movie characters is his Dr. Strangelove. He was also supposed to play Slim, the pilot, but supposedly the cast and crew could not stop laughing during his performance to the point of hindering filming. As a result, he was replaced. I'd love to see those out takes. George C. Scott as Gen. Buck Turgidson, the completely brash and ignorant commander, is also quite hilarious.<br/><br/>Very few films can make such a strong statement, one that stands the test of time. It's even more difficult to do that with satire/comedy. Kubrick does this with Dr. Strangelove flawlessly and created one of the most important films of all time, if not the most important film ever made."
"potoko0204","10","1","3","12 June 2004"," EXCELLENT MOVIE
","This movie is an excellent one. It is funny, scary, and at the same time, sad. At the heights of the arms race and the fear for MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction), brilliant director Stanley Kubrick portrays those years in what seems to be one of the best movies of all time. As many of you have said, Stanley Kubrick is the main actor in his films. He gives them life and longevity. This film, along with the other Kubrick's films, will remain in history as one of the best films ever made. What further ameliorates the quality of this movie is the performance by Peter Sellers, a very gifted actor who seems to fulfill Stanley Kubrick's expectations as well as ours. A much better performance by him than in Lolita (since he got more than one role in the movie Dr. Strangelove) he makes the movie more memorable. One of my favorite movies of all time."

","Well, after seeing this movie quite a few times (thank God for DVD), I must say that its humor and appeal hasn't become old.  In fact, I just finished writing a 11-page paper on the psychology behind the humor in the movie for a class I took this semester entitled ""What's So Funny About The End Of The World"".<br/><br/>That said, the satire here is brilliant.  My initial reaction after watching the movie the first time was, ""And we ever thought this was a good idea because..."" refering to the arms race.  Granted, I'm too young to have any memories of the arms race during the Cold War, but I am a bit of a history buff, especially where it concerns post-Depression 20th Century history, so I generally understood the references, even if I didn't have memories to go along with them.<br/><br/>The guys around the table acting like five year old kids with nuclear capability was so wrong...yet so dead on.  And while many of my friends were offended by the last scene with the mushroom cloud footage with ""We'll Meet Again"" playing in the background, I still find that part to be the most poignant part of the film, as it shows how lightly the political structures of the time took the possibility of the end of the world."

","This is not only one of the greatest comedies ever made, it is probably one of the greatest films ever made, period.  To take a serious subject like nuclear holocaust and turn it into something laughable was unimaginable at the time, but somehow this film made it work.  The performances by Sellers, Scott and Hayden as well as the intelligent script and wonderful direction by the late, great, Stanley Kubrick helped make this film into a classic. However, one of the best performances had to have been from Keenan Wynne as Colonel Bat Guano.  His performance in this film was sheer genius as he was looking for ""deviated preverts"".  This film will always be among my personal favorites."

","Being a fan of Kubrick's for some time before seeing this film I had mixed expectations; Kubrick is known for his savagery and brutality behind the camera. But, could he do a comedy? <br/><br/>I bought this film sometime last year (it came in the Stanley Kubrick collection) and sat down with huge expectations. Although, the first time through I didn't really appreciate it; I thought I'd give it another go to give it a fair chance. <br/><br/>The script is what holds this film up over time, I think. Peter Sellers is an extremely good performer and George C. Scott was great, and often subtle while being surrounded by over the top performers. <br/><br/>The sets and models of the film are, of course, dated. But, at the same time it's nostalgic to me and I enjoyed it. The direction is always top-notch in a Kubrick film, so don't expect too many innovations that you've yet to see from Stanley, because all of those came with two of his other, and I dare say far superior, films; 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>Of course it's funny, but it's subtle humor. If you're a fan of someone getting kicked in the face thinking it's funny -- don't stop here looking for a laugh. If you think Kevin Smith is the funniest director working today -- pass by this one. But if you're a fan of Charles Chaplin and enjoy older, more subtle, humor; give this a look.<br/><br/>Also, riding the bomb out of the plane is one of the most memorable moments in cinematic history -- and I'd long since knew of it before I knew this film existed. <br/><br/>Rating: A-"

But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops...depending on the breaks.""<br/><br/>This is certainly an interesting and very different movie, as are all of Kubrick's movies.

","Dr. Strangelove is a satirical make-over of the book 'Fail Safe' by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler. The book is fantastic and definitely NOT a comedy. 'Strangelove' follows the lines of the book fairly closely but with a comic twist which, at the time it came out, was sorely needed. I was 12 years old at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis and we all thought we were going to be incinerated at any moment in a nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>'Dr Strangelove' can best be described as a ""black comedy"" in which a deranged wing commander of B 52's sends his entire force to bomb what was then, the Soviet Union. Desperate attempts to recall the wing are aided by British liaison Captain Mandrake, played by Peter Sellers who also plays President of the United States Murkley Muffly, and Chief Of Weapons Development Dr. Strangelove. Unknown to the Americans the Russians had been working on a doomsday device which ensured destruction of all life on earth if even one bomb were detonated in Russia.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick at his best.

But the wife and I bought this one tonight and I really think this a pretty boring movie.  It has it's points, it has irony, it could probably even happen.  I think however, the acting sucked, the jokes were out of place and ill timed (and yes maybe a bit too subtle) and it has lost most of it's relevance today.  I put it in the category with 'A Clockwork Orange' and the apallingly boring 'Eyes Wide Shut"

Unfortunately what became of that was boredom, and confusion. I really did understand the satire that was taking place, but being ""in"" on the jokes didn't seem to help make me laugh. The character of Dr. Strangelove really confused me, since reviewers are saying the performance was amazing and hilarious... I'm not sure what I missed there. Maybe if I knew to look out for how amazing it was supposed to be, I would've received it better, but on its own merits, I found the character to be bizarre, not in a good way, and overplayed when on the screen for more than a minute.

","Despite being one of the finest examples of genre-filmmaking that's neatly crafted, superbly scripted & wonderfully performed, Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is a film that I admire more than I love. I've no hesitation in calling it the ultimate black comedy or the perfect satire but I also won't deny that my experience with it was pretty ordinary, regardless of the few laughs in between.<br/><br/>Set during the Cold War era, the story of Dr. Stangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying & Love the Bomb concerns a paranoid Air Force general who green lights a nuclear attack on Soviet Union without the knowledge of his superiors, thus causing mass panic in the Pentagon War Room where the President, his advisers, key officers & others desperately try to recall the bombers before they reach their destination.<br/><br/>Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film is another masterwork of precision craftsmanship from the legendary director for I've nothing but admiration for its incredibly detailed & well-lit sets, the ironic elements in the script & its depiction of the complete absurdity of war. Camera-work is marvellously carried out especially during the base attack scene, Editing nicely balances its different subplots & its background score is another plus.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the film features an impressive cast in Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden & Slim Pickens. Sellers here plays not one, not two but three different characters & is excellent in each one of his roles. Scott only gets better as the film progresses, Hayden is pretty grounded despite his unhinged character while Pickens doesn't leave much to complain about & plays his role straight.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Dr. Strangelove might very well be the best political satire of all time for it criticizes the nuclear conflict between US & USSR in the most biting manner possible, but the farther we're moving from the Cold War era, the weaker its impact seems to be getting. It's full of crazy characters, is filled with memorable quotes & crafted with panache but despite its strong legacy, I felt no love for it. Maybe one day I will, but today is not that day."

","Dr. Strangelove Or:How I Stopped Worrying And Love The Bomb is one of the greatest films and Comedies ever made,an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable masterpiece that combines amazing direction,terrific acting from the cast,great laughs and dark Humor,a wonderful script and a memorable score. All of those elements make Dr. Strangelove not only my favorite Stanley Kubrick film but also my favorite Comedy that is cinema at it's best.<br/><br/>Based on the novel Red Alert by Peter George,Dr. Strangelove tells the story of an Army General Jack D. Ripper(Sterling Hayden)who is worried and paranoid about Americas ""precious bodily fluids"" and Communist subversion sends Army Aircraft planes to attack Russia with one of the planes commanded by Major T.J 'King' Kong(Silm Pickens). With the aircraft's on the way to Russia it's up to Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,President Merkin Muffley,Dr. Strangelove(all played by Peter Sellers)and General Buck Turgidson(George C. Scott)to stop it and prevent Nuclear War.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or:How I Stopped Worrying and Love The Bomb is a brilliant and outstanding film that is film making at it's very best and is an instant masterpiece and classic the first time you watch it and one of the funniest movies of all-time that is hilarious and offbeat,dangerous and crazy as it is Satirical and frightening and is the true definition of Black Comedy. Whenever at watch this movie I often think how on earth was Kubrick able to get a major studio to make Dr. Strangelove because this was a brave and bold movie to make especially in 1964 during the time of the Cold War and Americans were afraid of Bombs dropping on the United States and a Nuclear war and with Dr. Strangelove Kubrick makes Nuclear War funny. I guess that's why Kubrick use to call this movie a ""Nightmare Comedy"" taking something serious and terrifying as Nuclear War and making it funny in a way that is ingenious and daring and years after it's 1964 release the film has not lost it's impact. There is a weirdness and energy in Dr Strangelove that never stops and when you watch the movie you are in for a ride for 94 insane minutes. The Comedy and laughs in Dr. Strangelove is hilarious,demented and is done with such a darkly Humorous glee that is perfectly balanced between the Comedy and laughs going completely over the top and playing it straight with intelligence and great timing because of the main characters and the wild things that happen throughout the film. The Comedy also works because each of the events that take place in Dr. Strangelove in different settings(Military Base,The War Room and Aircraft)making the situations more funny,wild and at times eerie and claustrophobic. Most of Kubrick's films have moments of Comedy and Dark Humor but this was Kubrick first and only Comedy where there is laughs all over the movie. I also loved the Satire in this film and how the movie makes fun of politicians and The screenplay by Stanley Kubrick,Peter George and Terry Southern is terrific,amazing and one of the funniest screenplays in a Comedy film because the dialog has a strange and ironic style that is very memorable,quirky and will make you burst with laughter. The main characters in Dr. Strangelove are funny and entertaining and we are with each of them as we witness the chaos that is happening all around them. Another thing I love about Dr. Strangelove is that while the movie is a Comedy the look and style of the movie will make you think you are watching a serious dramatic film with an undertone of paranoia and tension(there's a little paranoia in the movie but it's done for laughs). The ending of Dr Strangelove is amazing and one of the best and funniest endings in the history of film and while it is abrupt,it's an ending that goes well with the apocalyptic tone of the film and is one of the reasons Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece. An outstanding conclusion.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding. Peter Sellers earned an Academy Award nomination for his excellent,hilarious and unforgettable performances in three roles as Lionel Mandrake,Merkinn Muffy and Dr. Strangelove with Sellers masterfully being funny and serious. Amazing performances. George C. Scott is brilliant and delightfully over the top as General 'Buck' Turgidson with Scott stealing every scene he's in. Sterling Hayden is sensational as General Jack D. Ripper,a paranoid General. Silm Pickens is outstanding and funny as Major 'King' Kong,the man in charge of the Aircraft. Keenen Wynn is wonderful as Colonial 'Bat' Guano,a straight laced Soldier. Peter Bull is fantastic as Russian Ambassador Alexi De Sadesky,doing a great Russian accent. James Earl Jones(Lt. Lothar Zogg)and Tracy Redd(Miss Scott)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Stanley Kubrick is masterful with Kubrick giving the film an amazing visual style and sometimes moving the camera with creative angles and atmosphere. Fantastic direction,Kubrick.<br/><br/>The score by Laurie Johnson is great,memorable and matches the film's tone. Good score,Johnson. There is also the terrific song We'll Meet Again by Vera Lynn that is put used wonderfully. You'll never listen to the song the same way again.<br/><br/>In final word if you love Stanley Kubrick,,Comedies,Black Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Dr. Strangelove,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable Masterpiece that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","Without a doubt my favorite film, that in my opinion, is so good that its current rating of 8.5 vastly underrated the film. The characterss are memorable, the pacing is fast, the humor is fantastic, and the satire is sharp and clever. When most people think ""classic Kubrick"" people think about a haunted hotel (The shining). Others picture a malevolent AI trying to jeapordize a flight into space (2001: a space Odyssey). But when I think ""classic Kubrick"", I think of an insane General triggering nuclear war. I think of a fumbling president. An over patriotic bomber pilot riding an atomic bomb to oblivion. But that's not all. There are so many fantastic characters, more than I can recount here. That's the thing that made Dr. Strangelove a classic. Not only is it so memorable, but it is always concise and on point. Without a doubt, this film deserves a grade befitting such a fine film.

"Rickting","10","1","4","27 October 2014"," Pure genius
","Stanley Kubrick this time turns his attention to the cold war. Adapting a cold war thriller to the big screen, he increasingly started to see the funny side in it and the result is Dr Strangelove, the tense, dark- and utterly hysterical- story of a war room full of generals and politicians trying to stop a general from triggering nuclear war. As this is Kubrick, everything is meticulously crafted and nothing happens by accident. Despite his other dark and disturbing movies, Kubrick's comedy is one of the funniest films ever made. The laughs flow more slowly at first, before the floodgates open and once the film gets going it never slows down. Although it's a satire, part of the films ingenuity is that there's a unmistakable ring of truth and the laughter is often bitter. The screenplay is incredible; oozing with laughs and full of clever symbolism. It also has the best use of a cola cola machine in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The acting is great, with winsome performances from George C Scott and Peter Sellers. What's even more mesmerizing is the direction. With every shot perfectly crafted and every frame full of power and art, the film never ceases to be compelling. In general, who knew the end of the world could be so funny? While it's certainly funnier than anything Adam Sandler's recently done, the film finds plenty of laughter in its coal black subject matter and is the ultimate black comedy. With plenty of iconic moments and a sharp wit, as well plenty of ingenuity, Dr Strangelove is definitely one of the best comedies ever made and another brilliant effort from Stanley Kubrick. Dr Strangelove is something all aspiring comedy writers should watch and all sorts of people should be able to relate to it. Although it's now 50 years old, it isn't particularly dated and its themes still resonate today. It has a bit of a slow start, but other than that it hits like the bomb.<br/><br/>10/10"

Scotts performance is in my opinion the funniest his facial expressions and the way he says things can make me burst out with laughter which is very rare in fact it happens quite a lot in this movie where as in most movies now they need a sex joke every minute.

","Every time you see a great film, you find new things in it. Viewing ""Dr. Strangelove"" for another viewing, I discovered what makes this film so funny.<br/><br/>To spoil Dr. Strangelove would be to deny a film lover a fresh experience that is unlike any than they could ever dream. The results are that wonderful. This is a dish best served cold. The less you know about the film, the better.<br/><br/>For those that insist on an explanation of plot, it is fairly simple. A United States General, Gen. Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches and all out nuclear attack on Russia. The movie is about how global leaders, a British officer, and a fighter jet respond to the situation. That's all I am going to tell you. I won't even use the film's greatest image-- one of the most glorious and wonderful images in all of motion picture history-- in the pictures accompanying this review. Those that have seen the picture know the classic image I am talking about-- and if you watch the movie for the first time that magical moment will be blatantly obvious.<br/><br/>This is a perfect movie. It is perfect in its direction, casting, dialogue, set design and cinematography. The music-- particularly the classical use of the American classic, When Johnny Comes Marching Home, is pitch perfect. Notice the way the tempo of the score increases and becomes more dramatic as the tension in the film progresses. That is true genius-- the choices that were made are so completely intelligent that they are seamlessly integrated into the experience.<br/><br/>The movie is funny because it does not know it is funny. Classic lines like ""You can't fight in here, this is the war room"" are written practically into the situations that are taking place. Even the most absurd parts of the picture are historically accurate. For example, Gen. Ripper's conspiracy theory of fluoridation was actually something that hundreds of people believed in the 1950's. Survival kits did come with condoms back then. Even the moments that seem like slapstick come from practicality-- such as when Lt. Bat Guano (Kennan Wynn) shoots the Coca- Cola machine. It seems at first like a cheap gag when the soda shoots into Guano's face-- but think about it: he shot a Coke machine. What else would happen?<br/><br/>Kubrick knew when to embrace the inevitable-- some day, some ridiculous, stubborn, and completely misguided but passionate idiot will bring about the end of the world. We could disarm-- but that would require trust. It is sad when the reality of the world is so bleak it is funny- but this is how it goes."

"robert-temple-1","10","1","4","22 March 2014"," The most acerbic and hilarious satirical film of its time
","If only Stanley Kubrick were alive today, he would be making a satirical film like this about the surveillance society and the paranoia about 'terror'. In the sixties, however, the prevailing paranoia was about 'the bomb'. This earlier culture of fear was certainly heightened by the 1961 showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis. (Those of us who were alive then vividly remember how everyone was certain 'we are all about to die'.) In this brilliant film, Kubrick relentlessly and savagely exposes the madness of the system, the leaders, and the philosophy behind the doctrine appropriately known as MAD (abbreviation of 'Mutually Assured Destruction'), whereby if anyone is destroyed, all must be destroyed, the hope being that no one would be crazy enough to start it. But in this film, the world had not reckoned on General Jack Ripper, played by Sterling Hayden, drinker of grain alcohol and rain-water cocktails, obsessed by his 'precious bodily fluids' (how all we young people laughed at that when this film came out!) who did 'not avoid women' but 'I deny them my essence' (i.e. that particular bodily fluid most sought after by prospective mothers). Hayden who commits suicide during the action, has decided to wage nuclear war unilaterally on the Soviet Union with his wing of 34 B-52 bombers at Bortosdale (i.e. really Barksdale AFB in Louisiana, where the B-52s were really based) Air Force Base. (I once spent two fascinating weeks there watching those elegant birds take off: their wings dip when resting, then rise to horizontal on the runway, and curl upwards as they soar like birds. They rest overnight with their bomb-bay doors open for purposes of ventilation, but when I once thought I might try a naughty peek, I was warned that if I stuck my head up there it would be chopped off, as they are set to sever any intruder.) The film opens with an aerial scene of a B-52 being refuelled in mid-air by a K.C.135 tanker plane. (I was once inside one of those; you lie flat on your stomach on a kind of bed, looking out through a window, to feed the tube into the bomber below and behind you.) Kubrick, who was sex-mad, lovingly dwelled on the copulatory symbolism of this aerial mating dance. Inside the plane piloted by actor Slim Pickens which is sent to bomb Russia, Pickens is sitting in the cockpit reading PLAYBOY and looking at the centre-fold. Stanley was so obsessed by pornography that he had to have batches of fresh hard-core porn photos daily, so this scene came to his mind naturally enough. I knew Stanley fairly well for a couple of years, and whereas he was certainly a genius, he was a deeply psychologically disturbed one. I was especially nervous of his passion for collecting Nazi insignia and daggers, strange, considering that he was a Jew. However, I only met him after he had already made this film. Wally Veevers did such a good job on the special effects for STRANGELOVE that he was put in charge of those for 2001, where he excelled himself even further. (Wally and his team were a wonderful group of guys.) Of course, this film is also famous for featuring no less than three brilliant performances by Peter Sellers. He plays Group-Captain Mandrake of the RAF, the President of the United States, and Dr. Strangelove, who is one of the fanatical Nazi scientists imported to the USA under Project Paperclip and other such projects at the end of the War. (Considering that some of those very scientists worked for Stanley on 2001, his earlier ridicule of them was rather ironical.) If there is anyone by now who does not know about Operation Paperclip, I would be surprised, and I would merely point out to them that Werner von Braun was an Obersturmbahnfuehrer (Major) in the SS who tormented Jewish slave labourers at Peenemunde, and so go work that out along with its implications! Stanley was clever to choose some of his favourite B-film stars for this film, such as noir actor Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Keenan Wynn, all of whom are positively brilliant. The script, dialogue, and scenes are so hysterically funny and hilarious that if this were not also a serious film about the destruction of the world by nuclear warfare, it would rank as one of the greatest screen comedies of all time, which perhaps it does anyway. (After all, if 'we are all gonna die', then you sure gotta die laughing.) The film is based upon the novel 'Red Alert' (aka 'Two Hours to Doom') by Peter George (writing as Peter Bryant), who collaborated on the screenplay with Kubrick and Terry Southern. Peter George (1926-1966, dying aged 42) also contributed to Sidney Lumet's film FAIL-SAFE (1964) about a similar theme. I know nothing about Peter George or why he died so young, but maybe the 'Russkies' got him, or even SAC (the Strategic Air Command under General Le May) was taking revenge. Just joking. Or possibly the American Nazis brought over by Allen Dulles did not like being made fun of. (Hitler may have loved his dog, but who ever heard him laugh?) This film is certainly unlike any other, as was its director. I have seen this classic several times, but each time it becomes both funnier and more horrifying simultaneously. Perhaps it is even more relevant now than it was then, not because 'the bomb' is still our major preoccupation, but because of the mentalities portrayed, which are even more dangerous now than they were back then, when the worst that could happen to us was that 'we will all die', whereas now, it is what happens before then that is even more terrifying."
"SimonJack","10","1","4","17 March 2014"," A great satire and a truly great film
","""Dr. Strangelove"" is among the best satires ever put on film. I only wonder that it didn't receive at least two or three acting nominations for Academy Awards. But, 1965 was a year of heavy competition, with many great films. Still, how could Peter Sellers not get a nomination for his masterful job in handling three completely different roles? The Oscar for best actor that year went to Lee Marvin for ""Cat Balou."" Marvin was good, but I don't think he was as good as any of the other four nominees. Perhaps it was easier to pick him from the pack with Peter Sellers' name not in the running. I think Hollywood made a sentimental choice that year, but clearly goofed in passing over the superb cast and acting jobs in ""Dr. Strangelove.""<br/><br/>The best supporting actor Oscar for 1965 went to Martin Balsam for ""A Thousand Clowns."" He was a worthy choice among great competition. But none of those on the list gave markedly better performances than two actors in ""Dr. Strangelove."" George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden both had outstanding performances and should have been nominated. Some viewers may be interested to know that Sterling Hayden was in espionage for the Allies during World War II. He worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the American wartime intelligence service. He went by the name, John Hamilton. He ferried supplies from Italy to partisans in Yugoslavia and did undercover work in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. Hayden was awarded a silver star for his service. <br/><br/>A few roles and scenes in this film are side-splitting funny. The script is a masterpiece of wit throughout, with puns and metaphors galore. The Air Force Base is Burpelson. Would anyone guess that the film was made in England? The base commander was General Jack D. Ripper (played by Hayden). The base deputy commander is an RAF officer, Group Captain Mandrake – one of Sellers' roles. The U.S. President is Merkin Muffley (another Sellers role), and the Soviet Union Premier – who's never seen or heard, is Premier Dmitri Kissoff. The Soviet ambassador is Alexi de Sadesky (reference to the Marquis de Sade), played by Peter Bull. George C. Scott plays the top U.S. Army general, 'Buck"" Turgidson (turgid means swollen, congested). Keenan Wynn plays Col. 'Bat' Guano. For those who may not have caught that one, guano is the Spanish word for excrement of cave-dwelling bats. Other names have innuendos as well. <br/><br/>The cap of Sellers' roles was as Dr. Strangelove. In the movie, Turgidson asks Mr. Staines, ""Strangelove? What kind of a name is that? That ain't no Kraut name, is it?"" Staines replies, ""He changed it when he became a citizen. It used to be Merkwurdichliebe."" Turgidson responds, ""Well, a Kraut by any other name, huh, Stainesy?"" Merkwurdichliebe is a compound that isn't readily translatable. ""I love remembering wurd."" The last scene with Sellers as Strangelove is riotously funny. It may be the funniest scene ever put on film. <br/><br/>A mark of the genius of this film is its script that intersperses serious, sensible and concerned lines with some outlandishly funny ones. These stand out even without video. But the visual scenes, with the facial expressions and contortions, compound the humor. Sellers' last scene without the video would lose much. Even after nearly 50 years, this film is as funny as when it came out. Here are some of my favorite hilarious lines from the movie. <br/><br/>Gen. Ripper: ""I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration  and the ultimate Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids."" Pres. Muffley: ""Gentlemen! You can't fight in here. This is a war room."" Muffley, on the phone to Soviet Premier Kissoff: ""One of our base commanders went a little funny in the head."" And, later, to Kissoff: ""I am very sorry. All right, you're sorrier than I am. But I am sorry as well. I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri. Don't say that you're more sorry than I am  because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are. So, we're both sorry, alright?""<br/><br/>On learning of the Soviet doomsday machine, Pres. Muffley says to Soviet ambassador de Sadesky, ""This is absolute madness. Why should you build such a thing?"" The ambassador replies, ""There are those of us who fought against it, but in the end we could not keep up with the expense involved in the arms race, the space race, and the peace race. At the same time, our people grumbled for more nylons and washing machines. Our doomsday scheme cost us just a small fraction of what we have been spending on defense in a single year.""<br/><br/>Strangelove says,"" Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy the fear of attack."" Then, to the Soviet ambassador, he says, ""The whole point of the doomsday machine is lost if you keep it a secret. Why didn't you tell the world?"" Sadesky says, ""It was to be announced at the Party Congress on Monday. As you know, the premier loves surprises.""<br/><br/>The last scene has Strangelove describing how a remnant of the human race could survive thousands of feet underground, and Turgidson suspecting a Soviet move to take over the U.S. deep mines. Strangelove, caught up in the exciting possibilities, rises from his wheel chair and starts walking toward the president. He looks down at his legs and shouts, ""Mein Fuhrer, I can walk."" The film closes with a musical score set to scenes of distant horizons with bright flashes and mushroom clouds rising. This is a classic satire that should live on for generations to see, heed and enjoy."
"Sewaat","9","1","4","24 February 2014"," An explosive cartoon for adults
","What can I say about this film, other than it was just extraordinarily great? It is totally unique in it's place on the cinematic scale, unparalleled by any comedy or cold war drama that came before or after. <br/><br/>The movie's best strength by far is it's cast. All of the best players are here and they hold nothing back: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, Sterling Hayden...they all play such diverse characters. Each of them are all so utterly insane in their own ways and yet so believable. How each actor managed to do this with such expertise is beyond me. <br/><br/>Funny enough, the story is still just as relevant now as it was back in it's hay day. One would think that because the cold war is long over, the film would start to show it's age. But the reality couldn't be farther from. Audiences both young and old continue to find enjoyment in this film. The endearing and politically charged script rolls off the tongue so fluidly and makes for a sharp, viewing experience no matter what your age or historical expertise may be. It is this value which I believe has made Dr.Strangelove feel ageless. And like most timeless films, the themes of the film are universal. Every citizen of every nation in the world knows and understands the effects of war and how damaging they are to society. Which is why so many people resonate with the paranoia and anxieties that these characters bring to to the story. <br/><br/>Dr.Strangelove is no less than a brilliant masterwork of film making. It is a fuming concoction of raging testosterone, American patriotism and gruesome comedy. All of this contrasting with the very real threat of nuclear war makes for a very efficient and cathartic story. The film's only weakness would be that it is certainly not to everyone's tastes. But then again, no Kubrick film is."

","This is undoubtedly 1 of my favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is the greatest black comedy created by the legendary Stanley Kubrick (this is his best work other than Paths of Glory/Spartacus which cannot be forgotten).<br/><br/>This is the movie that has my personal favourite movie/Peter Sellers quote:<br/><br/>'Gentlemen, you can't fight in here, this is the War Room!'<br/><br/>I think it is incredibly funny and ironic.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is set during the middle of the Cold War when a psychotic airforce general orders a nuclear attack on Russia which a war room full of officials are trying to stop whilst defending themselves from the doomsday machine (which can destroy the world).<br/><br/>This also has the most ridiculous and unrealistic movie death it have ever seen, when major Kong is riding the bomb during the last 10 minutes and screams 'WAHOO!' To the world and blows up.<br/><br/>This is thrilling, spellbinding, tense, comical and a very ironic feeling to it.<br/><br/>This should be watched by everyone. Do not disappoint yourself by missing the Best Kubrick film of all time."
"joebobs","10","1","4","15 February 2014"," Cinematic Perfection
","For around 10 years this was my favourite film of all time, and has only settled into the number 2 spot after I saw Modern Times. Dr. Strangelove is magnificent on all fronts, the acting, writing, direction, sets, music, it's all flawless.<br/><br/>To begin, let's consider Sellers' three roles. Colonel Mandrake is superb, Sellers downplays the character perfectly in the style of the traditional British military officer. The marvellous thing is watching what he doesn't say: he is faced with insanity, but he cannot lose his decorum, so he often stumbles over the beginning of a sentence, as though he'd considered something more assertive but thought it impolite. The scenes between him and Colonel Ripper are my favourites, both are so under-acted, there is so much silence and darkness, it's as though time slows down; in this room are two individuals, one completely underwhelming and one truly insane, who will decide the fate of the world. For me the greatest point in the film is Hayden's delivery of the line 'I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, indoctrination, subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.' The pauses accumulate as the line goes on, until at the end when each word dangles one at a time before you, each second you realise how insane Ripper is, and of course it's met with Mandrake's response that so perfectly displays a look of equal parts confusion, condescension and terror. What's so great about Hayden's performance as Ripper, unlike so many performances of psychopaths, what makes him scary is that there is no self-recognition of the craziness, he truly believes every word (note the superb camera and lighting in this scene, the Dutch angle below Ripper's desk, the half-shadow on his face, the camera doesn't waver a millimetre during the speech, and the only distraction is the punctuation of the cigar smoke). But I think the real stellar moment of these scenes, in terms of acting, comes towards the end, when Ripper realises all is lost and he asks Mandrake if he's ever been tortured. Sellers delivers this scene perfectly. There is a mixture of true modesty, shame, fear, regret, but most of all a sense of something being too painful to remember, Mandrake isn't trying to be brave, he just pushes on, an embodiment of the 'stiff upper lip'.<br/><br/>The other great partnership in the film is Sellers as President Muffley and Scott as General Turgidson (though perhaps I should make note of the other great back-and-forth, Sellers vs Sellers on the phone to the Kremlin, probably the greatest piece of improvisation in film history). George C. Scott is truly outstanding in these scenes; he's a schoolboy who's been put in charge of the most powerful military in the world. But the character is more complex than this: he's intelligent, in that he's informed and forward-thinking, he walks the President into the strategies he has planned, revealing pieces of information bit by bit. In many ways it's the absurdity of the situation they all find themselves in that creates the absurdity in the man. Sellers plays the straight-man in these scenes and works so well with Scott (although, Sellers actually gets some of the great laugh out loud moments, the famous 'you can't fight in here, this is the war room', and the phone call to the Kremlin, such a genuine representation of speaking to a drunk person, 'I'm fine, you're fine yes as you say we're both fine'). Again, a note for the camera work, each shot is held for a long time while each man speaks, they tend not to track but to simply frame and allow the characters to move around in a set space. There is the surrounding darkness, with the slow movement of the dots on the big board, providing a constant reminder of the ticking bomb.<br/><br/>And then of course there's the titular character, the Nazi scientist (most probably an import from Operation Paperclip) who seizes the chance to allow his eugenic master plan to come to fruition. Yes, the battle with the arm is one of the great slapstick scenes in cinema (note the Russian ambassador can barely hold in his laughs), but listen to Sellers' delivery as well, the way he emphasises words has a great subtlety to it. There's something I find mystifying about this scene, there's a real sense of waiting for the end to hit. Throughout there has been a back and forth between Ripper's base, the War Room and the B-52 which has kept pace in the film, and when the Strangelove scene comes afterwards, it's exceptionally quiet, there's very little interruption, only a few lines from Sellers as President and Scott. It speaks to the insanity of the Cold War, that the world is ending and all these powerful men can do is sit and make silly plans that will never happen.<br/><br/>and I've not even mentioned the B-52 scenes, Major Kong as the cowboy who's no longer in command of a horse and revolver, but a B-52 and a hydrogen bomb. Kubrick is one of my favourite directors, and I think this is his finest moment. I mentioned in my review of Modern Times how powerful it can be to say something through comedy rather than drama, how it forces us to take its absurdities for granted rather than to focus on them, and I would say that it's one thing if you can tell someone that the world is insane and we're plummeting towards our own doom, and it's altogether more incredible if you can make them laugh about it. Dr. Strangelove sits alongside films such as Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Sunset Boulevard as one of those films where everything just comes together perfectly, all aspects complement the overall goal. Kubrick's vision is genius but it's also down to the brilliance of the cast and crew that make this film so good."
"llltdesq","10","1","4","21 January 2014"," Still a most remarkable film after fifty years or so
","I just watched this film again today and I'm still impressed. There will probably be mild spoilers ahead: <br/><br/>Frankly, with more than 700 reviews/comments on this film as I type this, there probably isn't a whole lot left unsaid about this film. But I watched it again today and just felt like making a comment here about this in any case.<br/><br/>Most likely every fan of this has their own favorite scene(s) and I'm no exception. But what most impresses me about the film is the performance of Peter Sellers. He gets to chew the scenery with the best of them in his portrayal of Dr. Strangelove and he plays the milquetoast president with sublime perfection, but I actually like his basically deadpan reading of of Group Captain Lionel Mandrake most of all. He more than held his own opposite the dry yet still overheated and hilarious performance of Sterling Hayden as Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper. Sellers strengthens Hayden's performance exceptionally well without losing any ground on his own. My favorite scene in the film (by a hair) is Mandrake's exchanges with Keenan Wynn. I know the dialog almost by heart.<br/><br/>A magnificent piece of work, with virtually nothing out of tune. Well worth watching and most highly recommended."

","What do you get when one of the most versatile directors of the 20th century, and one of its most gifted comedians, team up with a great support cast to make a black comedy?<br/><br/>You get what arguably is the best black comedy ever made - but certainly one of the best.<br/><br/>The plot is straightforward: a plane carrying atomic bombs is accidentally sent to drop 'em over Russia, and its Texan pilot refuses any attempts to be recalled. In the meantime, senior military personnel and the US president debate how to turn this problem to their advantage.<br/><br/>It pokes fun at US leadership and its military at the height of the Cold War, and by implication at all things American, while maintaining a certain respect and reverence for its subject. Only a pair of Brits could pull that off. Recently, on a much lesser scale, only Jean Luc Besson with ""The 5th Element"" has been able to pull off this kind of satire, from a French perspective.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers is near his pinnacle here, which he bested only in ""Being There,"" not long before his death. Given Sellers' penchant for improv, and Kubrick's ""by the book, let's do 100 takes of every scene until I'm satisfied"" approaches, it must have been interesting on the set. Sellers' inimitable physicality comes out in all three roles, although my favorite is his Wernher Von Braun in-a-wheelchair parody. People of a certain age group only need to see someone clasp one hand with the other while pretending to strangle themselves, and will immediately collapse in laughter at this meme. <br/><br/>Warning #1: if you don't like Seller's style of slapstick (i.e. you hate ""The Party"" or ""The Pink Panther""), then ""Dr. Strangelove"" may be a bit over the top for you. Warning #2: Actor Slim Pickens (his real name) plays Major 'King' Kong in this film. Then the character naming really gets weird!<br/><br/>The movie is deep, and too close to the truth, but its finest details have been analyzed plentifully and need not be rehashed here. Suffice it to say that I have seen it four times, yet still discover devilish new details in dialogue, set design and story arc whenever I see it again.<br/><br/>A masterpiece of the mid-twentieth century."

","""Yes, the whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost...if you keep it a secret! VY DIDN'T YOU TELL DER VORLD, EH?!""- Dr. Strangelove in DR. STRANGELOVE. <br/><br/>I'll tell ""der vorld"". After the dewy circumspection of LOLITA, Kubrick had a creative brainstorm. Gone are the eternally long takes of the previous film, with its prosaic settings and conventional structure. Beating back the censors, Kubrick was emboldened. He let loose with a barrage of wit and stylization. DR. STRANGELOVE is a template for radical filmmaking, dropped squarely into the film industry's bland mainstream. The director excoriates the denizens of the military-industrial complex, exposing them as a collection of disturbed lunatics whose pathological urges translate into nuclear destruction. <br/><br/>The production is geared to stun. The editing creates a rapid cascade of jolting imagery and dialog, much of it hysterically funny, but overlaid with an ominous solemnity. Ken Adam's sets are overpowering works of detailed artistry (cheers for the vaulting ceiling of the War Room). With Kubrick attached firmly to his back, the stark monochrome of Gilbert Taylor's photography exudes a vise-like grip over the audience. The script's satirical punch is so effective it gave birth to a slew of jocular, oft-quoted one liners: ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here; this is the War Room!"" And once more, Kubrick displayed his flair with actors. Nowhere in George C. Scott's film appearances will you see a more unfettered and successful effort. In what would prove to be the acme of his professional career, Peter Sellers comes across with three devastatingly funny portrayals, each one weighted with a touch of gravity to give them lasting impact. Kubrick was fearless. Fifty years after STRANGELOVE'S release the film is still alive with the power of his audacious wit and intellect. STRANGELOVE is arguably the director's finest hour and a half."
"raphaklopper","10","1","4","16 October 2013"," Is this a comedy or a political drama??? It can't be both can it? Oh wait, its Kubrick, yeah it can be!
","Does anyone ever stopped to think about the consequences if the nuclear war between the USA and the Soviet Union during the cold war had happened? How it would start and what would be the consequences? Many theories and ideas have been raised over the years, all almost similar always pointing to a possible nuclear apocalypse. Then the director Stanley Kubrick decided to take these theories and joined them with his own ideas and made the masterpiece ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"".<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is a satire that tells the consequences (in Kubrick's mind) of the nuclear war between the USA and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It all starts when the ultra-patriotic and ultra-paranoid General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) seems to have a crazy and patriotic attack, and gives the order to all B-52 bombers that surround Russia initiate the nuclear attack. Such an order reaches the ears of the also very patriotic General 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott) to rapidly informs the President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers). Now the general, the president and his aides, the Russian Ambassador Alexi of Sadesky and the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (also Peter Sellers) have to find a plan to prevent the attack from the bombers starting the nuclear war.<br/><br/>Can you imagine the controversy that this film caused at the time it came out? The world after the Vietnam War and America still redeeming itself. But not only the subject, but the way that Kubrick presents it. What could be a political drama with the theories and ideas of the consequences of war can be presented with great dialogs (which are actually 80% of the film), Kubrick made it a comedy. From start to finish Kubrick delivers a intelligent humor and silly at times without losing the mood, always presenting the ""possible"" consequences in a hilarious and satirical way, thanks to yet another flawless Kubrick script.<br/><br/>The use of the ultra-patriotism from the General Jack Ripper (if you pay attention his name is a tribute to Jack the Ripper) and the General 'Buck' Turgidson is exactly the statement of the ""ultra - desperation"" that the Americans had during the war. General Ripper has a huge patriotism and love for his country that led him to give the order to the nuclear attack, only for precaution. And General Buck is a clear representation of the lazy and ignorant patriotic American people.<br/><br/>And where Dr. Strangelove gets into all that? Not only as comic relief (in all his scenes), but also explain the title: ""How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"". In all his scenes, the former Nazi with one hand with own will, tends to try to convince everyone in the war room to accept the situation that they are, accept the nuclear apocalypse. It all comes in all its hilarious scenes where he presents arguments behind arguments silly and clever at the same time, showing the benefits of the nuclear war, all to do with a new era for human kind.<br/><br/>Not only the humor and genius of Kubrick that are superbly presented that give strength to the film, but also the fantastic performances of the cast. Both Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott shine with their ultra-patriotism; also Peter Bull as the weird Russian ambassador and Slim Pickens as Major King Kong (pilot from one of the B52s that will launch the bombs). But who steals the show with AMAZING performances is Peter Sellers in all his three roles. As much as the president of the united states, or the crazy and smart ex-Nazi and the friendly gentleman Captain Lionel Mandrake (that tries to convince the general Ripper to stop the attack), Sellers shines (I think he was the only actor who gave ideas and improvisations in the film and Kubrick liked them and changed things on the script because of it).<br/><br/>Many critics consider this the best film of Stanley Kubrick, and not for anything. Kubrick joined with his genius, years of ideas and theories of war in a hilarious and intelligent comedy, making not only a governmental critic but also entertains us from start to finish. Thanks to flawless script and direction together with splendid performances. Maybe not the best film of Kubrick (""2001"" already has this place), but surely one of them! <br/><br/>10/10"
"jprell-801-844757","10","1","4","26 September 2013"," A review of Dr.Strangelove
","Doctor Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb, directed by Stanley Kubrick is a political satire set in America during the cold war. The story unfolds in three settings; The first in a B-52 Bomber whose crew has been ordered to bomb the Russians, the second at the military base that ordered the attack, and the third in the war room with the President and his military advisers. The story unfolds as each group of characters in the three settings try to avert a string of ever worsening disasters. The movie was filmed in 1964 during the Cold War. For this reason, the movie is viewed as a black humor commentary on a worst case scenario. Major characters in the story include Brigadier General Jack K. Ripper (played by Sterling Hayden), an unbalanced man convinced that the communists are ""contaminating his precious bodily fluids"", Major T. J. Kong (played by Slim Pickens) a cowboy hat toting B-52 Bomber pilot, and General Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) an enthusiastic general with no love for the ""Ruskies"". Interestingly, Peter Sellers was given three major roles in the film; Lionel Mandrake – a British RAF exchange officer, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr.Strangelove – the ex-Nazi nuclear expert. Each of these characters complement each other to create a colorful and entertaining world while still addressing a serious topic. While the special effects and picture quality are far below my 2013/teenage standards, I found myself forgetting I was watching an almost fifty year old movie as the musical score, the cast of characters, and photographically composed shots drew me into the story. The combination was like a window into another era, since in the time the movie was filmed, nuclear war with Russia was an ever present threat. Taken through that lens, the movie manages to be hugely entertaining and thought provoking at the same time."

","I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other.<br/><br/>Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian.<br/><br/>The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me."

Is it excitingly funny not really, although it rated as one of funniest movies out there, I will say one thing, which is Kubrick, did a good job of making a mockery of the cold war crises that was looming at the time of this movie's release.<br/><br/>Dr Strangelove, is as captivating as the name, especially when you say it in full Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, my favourite scenes in this movie were when the commander of the bomber Major T.

","At the height of the Cold War the fear of nuclear obliteration was quite real. If the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a nuclear war there would be no winners. Stanley Kubrick made a film about this impending doomsday. This was obviously a very serious issue so the film would have to be dark, dignified and grave. Or maybe it wouldn't. Instead it would be one of the most hilarious black comedies the world had ever seen. What to do when faced with the end of the world? Laugh.<br/><br/>As the American president would later tell the Soviet premier an American base commander ""went and did a silly thing."" This quite insane commander ordered his planes to attack the Soviet Union. When these planes drop their nuclear bombs the Soviet doomsday device will be activated and that for all intents and purposes will be the end of the world. Well that doesn't sound very funny. Oh, but it is. Kubrick played this dire situation for laughs and, helped to no small end by his amazing cast, created a comedic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Everywhere you look in this film you see great actors turning in legendary performances. By virtue of the fact he played three different roles Peter Sellers gets most of the acclaim. And he is magnificent in all his various guises. He's the president, a British officer and Dr. Strangelove himself, a mad German scientist who has a hand with a mind of its own. Sellers was actually supposed to play a fourth role as well but that part, bomber commander Major Kong, eventually went to Slim Pickens. And while Sellers probably would have been fine in the part Pickens is simply perfect. A true-life American cowboy, patriot and total yahoo. Playing the truly insane base commander who starts the clock ticking to disaster is Sterling Hayden. It is a quite unique madness which afflicts this character and Hayden performs the role beautifully. Sellers, Pickens and Hayden are all fantastic. And there is a terrific supporting cast which notably features a young James Earl Jones. With all these great performances it would be near impossible for one man to steal the show. But George C. Scott comes really close to doing just that. He plays General Buck Turgidson who is ostensibly working to recall the American bombers but who quite clearly actually relishes the idea of mushroom clouds over Moscow. Scott's manic, over-the-top performance is comedic gold. His facial contortions alone are enough to induce side-splitting laughter. Scott may well be the best thing this film has to offer. And in a film this good that's really saying something. It's a film with a great story, great humor, great performances. Just for good measure Kubrick also tosses in one of the great movie sets of all time. How magnificent is that War Room? Do remember though that you can't fight in there."

","Dr. Strangelove bounces from one brilliant comic duo to the next. RAF Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) plays sidekick to General Jack T. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who starts it all off by launching a nuclear attack on the Russians, who he thinks are trying to sap and impurify all of his precious bodily fluids. The supremely British Captain Mandrake tries desperately to retrieve the recall code from the crazy cowboy General Ripper, and Ripper tries to get Mandrake to help him fight the troops sent to disarm him with insanely funny ruses like telling him that the ""Redcoats are coming."" When the crew of one of the bombers that Ripper has sent against Russia informs the pilot, Major Kong (Slim Pickens), of their attack orders, Kong tells them to stop ""horsing around on the airplane."" General Turgidson's recurring repartee with his ""secretary"" Miss Scott (Tracy Reed) comes to a humorous head when she calls him in the war room, and he advises her to say her prayers. President Muffley (Sellers again), who is dependent on Turgidson (George C. Scott) for information on the nuclear deterrence program that Muffley himself approved, grows more and more annoyed by Turgidson's less-than-humanitarian recommendations. When Muffley allows the Russian ambassador, Sadesky (Peter Bull), into the war room, Turgidson's distrust and disdain for his communist comrade breaks loose: ""He'll see everything! He'll see the big board!"" President Muffley's phone conversation with Premier Kissoff is all kid gloves, failed pleasantries, and ego stroking; despite all the Cold War strategizing, we realize that the fate of the world rests on the ability of two men from opposite sides of the globe to earn mutual trust through personal communication. Meanwhile, Colonel ""Bat"" Guano (Keenan Wynn) makes his way through Ripper's defenses to find Mandrake on the verge of cracking the recall code. When Mandrake tries to contact President Muffley on a pay phone, but doesn't have enough pocket change, he asks Guano to shoot open a vending machine, to which Guano warns: ""you're gonna have to answer to the Coca-Cola Company."" Finally, Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers, yet again), the imported scientist, has an outrageous slapstick routine with his alter ego, Dr. Strangelove, the Nazi, whose right arm takes on a life of its own. It becomes apparent, while watching the film, why the topic of all-out nuclear war offers itself, more than any other type of human conflict, to satire. It's the absurdity inherent in mankind's ability to destroy itself with the push of a button. And while the ""proper"" handling of such material includes fear and terror of the prospect, and/or cold rationalizing about attack plans and post-apocalyptic survival tactics, the only sane reaction may just be to laugh hysterically at the horrific possibility."
"nutolm","8","1","4","27 July 2012"," Laughing at war
","This movie is probably one of the most bizarre comedies of the time, but also one of the best in its genre. A kind of anti war movie; a satiric look at the cold war in the 50s and 60s between east and west. This movie is filled with tremendous actor performances, Peter Sellers stars in three of them - and does it best as the mysterious Dr. Strangelove. Sterling Hayden is excellent as the general who steps over the edge of insanity, and George C Scott is very funny in his role, even though he's not particularly known as a comedic actor. The great thing about this movie is the actors and their dialogues, and the plot is a stroke of genius from director Stanley Kubrick. And just look at the names of some characters - Bat Guano, TJ King Kong and Jack D Ripper, that alone gave me a big laugh. This is surely a great movie, although one thing was a disappointment, the special effects was very poor, even for its time - but overall, I enjoyed it."
"Sandcooler","6","1","4","13 July 2012"," Lost some relevance, but it holds up
","This movie used to be one of the most caustic satires ever captured on celluloid, which kinda shows how far the limits have moved since the 60s. Don't get me wrong, I do of course understand people took offense to this. Mocking nuclear warfare in the middle of the Cold War is daring no matter how you look at it, and furthermore it creates a thoroughly bitter-sweet atmosphere only paralleled in Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"". But when it comes to the actual execution of the idea, the whole thing is sorta goodie two shoes by today's standards. Only Peter Sellers really manages to get in your face from time to time, and that's mainly because most of his material is improvised. The actual script seems pretty well thought-out and balanced, but the dialogues often just lack zest. Occasionally there's a decent one-liner in there (""There will be no fighting in the war room!""), but often the scenes just serve purely as exposition and go on way longer than they need to. Still, the movie seems to pick up steam around halfway and leads you to an absolutely hysterical ending that makes it all worth it. Not Kubrick's best, but far from bad."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","4","17 February 2012"," ""Well, boys, I reckon this is it; nuclear combat toe to toe with the Russkies.""
","Stanley Kubrick's distinctively named ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" arrived in theatres at a time when nuclear annihilation was a very real threat to a lot of people. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was hardly a laughing matter but Kubrick somehow managed to find the humour in the ever-escalating arms race.<br/><br/>This is no frivolous comedy, though. The script by Kubrick and Terry Southern (based on Peter George's non-comedic novel ""Red Alert"") is full of pointed satire and black comedy. Accentuating the story's absurdities proves to have been an inspired choice. The possibility of a nuclear holocaust may be frightening but the ineptitude of those who hold it in check is undeniably laughable.<br/><br/>Bringing this story to life was entrusted to a cast headed by Peter Sellers in no less than three different roles. For his exemplary performance he was deservedly rewarded with an Oscar nomination. In support, Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott & Slim Pickens all contribute excellent performances while the rest of the cast is above average as well.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the strength of Kubrick's Oscar-nominated direction should surprise no-one familiar with his work. The cinematography's attractive as well, though many of the special effects are less than convincing. Meanwhile, Laurie Johnson's score is decent but not particularly memorable.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think that ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a classic that deserves to be seen by any self-respecting film buff. Though there are other Kubrick films that I'd rank above this one, it's only a slight step below Kubrick's best and, by extension, the best of cinema in general."

","Dr. Strangelove is definitely an 'oddball' film. When looking at the plot, it all seems pretty simple, but once it is over it can be digested more thoughtfully. That is not to say that it wasn't entertaining, because it certainly was. In fact, it stands out from the other Kubrick films because I find that one can easily come in at anytime and start watching it and still be amused, even if they don't understand everything that is happening. The screenplay is fantastic, and the ensemble cast as well.

His character Dr. Strangelove has little screen time but is pure comic genius. The other standout was the general played by George C. Scott.

","Of all the Kubrick films I have seen, this is by far the funniest, although it was never the initial intention of the director to make it so, the preposterous nature of events contained within the script led it to be altered to a dark comedy after work had begun.<br/><br/>In saying this, however, the film is not an out-and-out comedy. The subject matter would not allow it to be so. If anything, it is a very dark comedy.<br/><br/>The events may be serious, but the characters who create the tensions and events vary in hilarity. Peter Sellers plays three of the characters exceptionally well. His comic timing and ability to ad lib help create a bizarre atmosphere and ultimately a classic film, devoid of too much seriousness.<br/><br/>This is not in any way Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, but it is definitely a memorable piece, with memorable performances and a unique slant on the events leading to nuclear warfare."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","8","1","4","15 October 2008"," Managed to miss it for many years
","Growing up in the peace movement, I'd heard of this film more or less before I'd ever been to the cinema (and certainly before I went to the cinema and actually *enjoyed* it, an event which didn't take place until I was in my late teens!) I must have missed seeing it at least half a dozen times and probably more; it used to turn up regularly at CND events to be shown to audiences of the faithful, but at that age films just didn't interest me and the very ubiquity of this one was in itself off-putting.<br/><br/>When it turned up on the big screen at the National Film Theatre, I felt I really ought to take the opportunity to see it for once, but having heard it lauded more or less throughout my entire life my hopes were frankly pretty low; I was expecting another ""Citizen Kane"" disappointment. (It is very hard for a film to live up to its reputation when the reputation is sky-high and everybody knows 'the best bits' before they've even seen it...) <br/><br/>But on the contrary, I was very impressed. Dr Strangelove himself is a bit too broad for me, but the balance of paranoia and lunacy is otherwise perfect, and there is a lot of genuine tension as well. When the film starts off we have no means of knowing what is actually going on -- the significance of Plan R, the General's state of mind. It is only gradually that it even becomes apparent what is happening, which make the impact all the greater.<br/><br/>I suspect those who say that this is not a comedy but a satire are largely correct; there was laughter in the auditorium, but it was often laughter of shock/disbelief (""Did he *really* just say that?"") rather than a straight comic response. And the film ended in a stunned silence (with nervous giggles, again, at the bald caption ""THE END"") rather than in laughter or applause, although I think the audience had appreciated it. For a film that has been criticized as consisting almost entirely of dialogue -- not that there is anything wrong with that -- it contains a lot of subtle visual gags to pick up that are never mentioned by the characters, from the barely-visible nameplate captioning the General on his first appearance as ""Jack D. Ripper"" to the prominent signs on the airbase asserting in true sloganeering style that ""Peace is our Business"".<br/><br/>This picture has the oncoming horror/fascination of watching a comedian walk towards a bobby-trapped door or a suspended bucket of water, coupled with the wild insanity factor of the Goons. It has a serious political message -- not so much specifically anti-nuclear as against the madness of assuming infallibility. It has, of course, Peter Sellers playing multiple roles (although if I hadn't been warned in advance I certainly wouldn't have noticed this!) It has some inspired sets -- I gather that Pentagon visitors still ask to see the 'War Room' that only ever existed on an English sound-stage -- and sly camera angles. While, I'm not always a fan of either Kubrick or Sellers, both do brilliant work here. I find Strangelove himself just *too* strange (and peripheral) to be convincing (he is visibly over the top from the moment that we first see him, whereas the others are on the face of it normal) but the rest of the film is breathtakingly balanced between utterly bizarre and worryingly familiar behaviour; if it's a satire of anything, it's above all a satire on the incredible petty-mindedness of the human race."
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","9","1","4","20 June 2008"," One of the greatest ever!
","Arguably the greatest black comedy ever made, Stanley Kubrick's cold-war classic is the ultimate satire of the nuclear age. Dr. Strangelove is a perfect spoof of political and military insanity, beginning when General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a maniacal warrior obsessed with ""the purity of precious bodily fluids,"" mounts his singular campaign against Communism by ordering a squadron of B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviets counter the threat with a so- called ""Doomsday Device,"" and the world hangs in the balance while the U.S. president (Peter Sellers) engages in hilarious hot-line negotiations with his Soviet counterpart. Sellers also plays a British military attaché and the mad bomb-maker Dr. Strangelove; George C. Scott is outrageously frantic as General Buck Turgidson, whose presidential advice consists mainly of panic and statistics about ""acceptable losses."" With dialog (""You can't fight here! This is the war room!"") and images (Slim Pickens's character riding the bomb to oblivion) that have become a part of our cultural vocabulary, Kubrick's film regularly appears on critics' lists of the all-time best."
"Steffi_P","8","1","4","11 December 2006"," ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is a war room!""
","It's often said of Kubrick that he never repeated himself, as far as genres go at least. Of course, that's not strictly true if you count Dr Strangelove as one of three anti-war films. But it was his only true comedy, and even though it was originally conceived as a straight drama about the perils of the nuclear age it is only through the comical method of storytelling that it has real weight.<br/><br/>It was with this film that Kubrick really consolidated his style. It was here that he more or less abandoned regular camera movement, and began using his trademark zooms and long takes within one frame. It's as if he finds one perfect shot then sticks to it. If the camera moves at all it's generally a straight side-to-side track, from one carefully constructed shot to another. This use of camera became the template for all his subsequent films, although it appears to have happened more or less overnight. It's strange also to think that while only nine years into a forty-five year career as a director, in terms of numbers of pictures made this is in fact in the middle (he made six full-length features before it, and was to another make six afterwards).<br/><br/>There are of course many other Kubrick touches present here which had been in development since day one. There is his contrast of place, particularly through light and dark. There is a slightly crazed intensity to everything. And of course there is the usual supporting cast of deranged eccentrics  although the difference here is that the oddball characters are running the show.<br/><br/>One thing that really makes this film work is the way in which the comedy is gradually turned up and up, like a dimmer switch. There is barely a joke in the first twenty minutes, and the whole thing opens like some dry political drama. The real breakdown point is that freakish low angle shot of Sterling Hayden, at the moment where he first brings up his psychotic theory concerning bodily fluids. By the time the eponymous Doctor is introduced, the thing is well and truly off the rails and more or less anything goes  and all the while keeping to the dark storyline that the comedy was spawned from.<br/><br/>Probably the greatest strength of Dr Strangelove though is its cast. Sellers gives us three carefully constructed and totally individual characters (although I don't think he's quite as funny here as he is in Lolita). George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also both brilliant in rare comedy roles.<br/><br/>But after all this praise  I don't know. To me Dr Strangelove still falls a few inches short of being a classic. If you stripped away all the layers of comedy it would probably be mind-numbingly boring. Kubrick has tried to inject a note of suspense, but no matter how you shoot and edit it you can't wring much excitement out of world map boards and cockpit controls. This picture is great when considered as a kind of comic anti-war set piece, but it is too lacking in soul to be anything more. Then again that's not a bad thing in itself, as I can't think of a better way to make such a film."

","The first movie I saw by Kubrick was ""Full Metal Jacket"". I thought He was a brilliant director. To be honest the more I watched his movies the more I started to think that his movies have great humanitarian messages but they have per se sick themes. This is one of those movies which have hard-liners at both ends: Some liked it by describing dark comedy as brilliant some others hated it coz they did not see something very funny and probably they did not laugh more then three times during the whole movie. I always believed that a movie should be evaluated according to its time. I know that many people watched the movie because it is consistently in the top 20 on the Internet Movie Database's list of top 250 films and they were openly disappointed. Well I am one of those guys who did not laugh much during the whole movie but I am impressed by the message.Given that the fact a trailer for the movie was included as an extra in the DVD release of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" the movie got its message right though it was more than 40 years old now. If that were a better movie that could satirize the zeitgeist of cold war period than ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" would have been released with a different trailer I guess. The movie slips to a different character when you know that Peter Sellers improvised much of his dialog during filming. Sellers plays multiple parts each with an appropriate and successful accent. All in all I did not see a perfect movie in IMDb's top 250 list and I thought most of the movies were over-rated but this movie has a message but Petr Sellers is very good at his performance so I can't just say ""Hey it sucks just because I did not see something funny"" but I can't tell something like that either ""Hey the movie is brilliant 10 out of ten"". Even if you produce a dark comedy you have to offer a room to laugh for people.I believe Kubrick couldn't do that well enough. Not perfect but but not too bad either!"

Firstly, the characters are very stereotypical, embarrassingly so. Secondly, it tries to be a comedy, but it's not. The biggest criticism I have of this movie is that it could have been so much better if they dumped the stupid stereotypes that try and make a sitcom out of what is an extremely tense drama.<br/><br/>And that's what Dr Stangelove is, an extremely tense drama.

","What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humour, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy.

"colcam","Null","1","4","16 October 2003"," forty years?
","Amazing what a difference forty years makes in looking at a film.  While some work becomes more and more appreciated, some of it. . . well, some of it just doesn't hold up.  About forty years ago Dr. Strangelove seemed cutting edge, strongly satirical, and vibrant-- today, seen again by means of an original print on a full size screen (thanks, Madstone) it makes you flinch.  <br/><br/>I remembered a couple of minor technical bobbles from long ago.  Today, sitting in that big, dark room with sticky floors I lost track of the lighting problems, the bad plates, the voice and foley synch errors, and found myself wincing at poorly thought out writing and acting that should have been kept under control.  On a small screen at home it doesn't look nearly so bad, but in a theater?  Go to see it as a document of history, not as a work of art.  Now it is obvious that Kubrick had an anti American bias-- of which he was accused then, but without the hysteria of the cold war polarization to cover it, is now blatant.  While it was known, and even acknowledged in the preamble that there were safeguards that would prevent this from occurring, today we know that five years before Kubrick filmed Dr. Strangelove this problem was addressed by military and civilian leadership in both the USA and the USSR.  It was a serious concern, but Kubrick treats it shabbily.<br/><br/>It feels strange to watch a DVD of Dr. Strangelove and enjoy it as a light satirical comedy, then to go watch it on the big screen and wonder if it would be considered even fair work today from the technical standpoint. Maybe this was the best they could do ""way back then.""  Trouble is, other work from way back then does not have the bumbles, the flaws, the bias, and the heavy handed political message.<br/><br/>Take a look at Runaway Jury-- in the same way a heavy handed political message is used to justify the actions, there are technical errors throughout it, and the flaws overwhelm the whole; even so, it will be acclaimed by people who are unwilling to hold it to the standards all of the non political movies are held to.<br/><br/>It is a pity, and it hurts to see just how bad on the big screen a great memory and good DVD can really be. ."

","In 'Paths of Glory', Kubrick attacked the military hierarchy system and the concept of war and blind patriotism from a moralistic standpoint. In 'Dr. Strangelove' he does somewhat the same thing in the form of satire. He managed to generate humour out of a disturbing scenario of a mentally unstable army officer starting a nuclear war without the knowledge of his superiors. Although personally I love 'Paths of Glory' much more than 'Dr. Strangelove', however this is the film where the quintessential Kubrickian style of direction and storytelling was born. One can notice the black comedy, the formal visual style(like camera placement, lighting and editing) and a distinctively deliberate coldness in 'Dr. Strangelove' that would become a staple in pretty much all of Kubrick's subsequent films irrespective of the genre.<br/><br/>There are a lot of laugh out loud moments here. The satirical tone infused by Kubrick is overt and unavoidable. Pretty much every conversation scene is rich with sharp dialogue and scathing criticism. However I'd be lying if I say the film stayed with me and lingered in my thoughts for too long. I understand what the film is doing and I admire the technical precision involved, but 'Dr. Strangelove' didn't blow me away like most of Kubrick's later films do. The film tends to meander a bit with unnecessarily extended scenes where we spend time inside the fighter planes during which I genuinely found my interest waning due to the overabundance of technical verbal exchanges. I also think the film's ending should have been stronger.<br/><br/>Acting wise I have to mention Peter Sellers, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden. Sellers(in multiple roles) and Scott provide the eccentric and over-the-top comedy, while Hayden is the deeply intimidating psychopath.<br/><br/>I do like 'Dr. Strangelove', but not as much as some of Kubrick's other works"

","My immediate reaction to Dr. Strangelove once it finished was one of dislike. I thought it was talky, boring, plot less and overrated. However, since I've had time to let it sink in I've begun to like it a lot more on reflection. It's undeniably very well-made and beautifully shot, yet it still gives no inclination to Stanley Kubrick's colossal genius of scale and intelligence which he would later produce in 2001.<br/><br/>To be honest I never fancied Dr. Strangelove. Watching a political comedy is my idea of hell, however I thought I'd finally give it a try as I'm venturing through every Stanley Kubrick film. It's not a laugh out loud kind of comedy; it's more of a lightly amusing one, although I must admit that some parts had me chuckling. I especially enjoyed the part where the president talks to a drunken Dimitri. Other bits of comedy fell flat for me, however such as the Nazi stuff, although I do understand that comedy is very subjective so it's just a matter of what you find funny. My favourite comedy film is Mrs. Doubtfire, so judge me however you like.<br/><br/>I found the story surprisingly straightforward. It's basically set in three locations: The planes about to bomb Russia, the office of the mad general and the war room. The film is essentially just about trying to stop bombs landing on Russia in order to prevent a nuclear Holocaust. However, because it's such a bold idea it remains quite involving. The running time is also very tight so it prevents it from getting too boring.<br/><br/>Strangelove is a film which I strangely liked, more than loved. I think that repeat viewings will help to uncover its hidden intelligence. However, for me it's a step backward from Stanley's previous three films (Lolita, Paths of Glory and The Killing) which I enjoyed more. I must say that Peter Sellers was fantastic in this though and it is definitely well worth a watch. Who would've thought that just four years post-Strangelove, Stanley would release such a masterpiece?"

","The movie does depict a scary story of the old Cold War era fear of nuclear doomsday and the subsequent stalemate of the nuclear deterrence between the two superpowers. I really like how the movie shows the subtle but crazy scenes right after it builds up the suspense of imminent nuclear or retaliation threat. The phone dialog, or should I say monologue, between the two presidents are just a sheer twisted laughable scenes. Like most Kubrick movies, this movie also leaves the audience with quite an incomplete movie, having them wondering about the continuance of the story after the movie's abrupt ending. The acting is just nice because most of the actors can successfully depict the madness under stress of nuclear threat and also the crazy funny scenes."

","I have to say it: I was quite disappointed with this movie. I originally wanted to see it because of the fact that it is number one for comedy, voted by IMDb users. However, I found myself asking when will it be funny? Perhaps I am just not one for dark comedies, but I just didn't find it funny. That being said, I was especially impressed with the comedic talents of Peter Sellers (who plays four characters: Group Captain, Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove), the atmosphere that is created and the message behind the movie. But I didn't find it funny. Sorry. Maybe it will grow on me.<br/><br/>U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper goes absolutely mad, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R. He suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the ""precious bodily fluids"" of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a doomsday device which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers plays the three men who might prevent this colossal tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert a momentous disaster depend on a drunken Soviet Premier and Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove (who, in my opinion, was the funniest).<br/><br/>I think there is a truly good message behind this movie: if we don't do something, this is what will happen. I was very much impressed by that. Comedy wise, I laughed a couple of times, but that was it. That's the problem with critically acclaimed films  you have high hopes for it, and when it doesn't live up to your expectations, it is twenty times more disappointing. Nevertheless, I appreciate the brilliant performances, the message and Kubrick's clever directing. I enjoyed it, but in my opinion it does not live up to the hype."

","Actually this is one of those movies you have got to see more than once to fully enjoy them. However you may immediately notice (from the first viewing on) that the acting is astonishing: Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott and Peter Sellers, who once more steals the show (and that is very much to say with such an incredible cast). As a whole, the movie is rather macabre and therefore frequently bitter to watch (if you know what you see and clearly understand the message). In fact, it is exactly this aspect of the film that makes us think so much about it.<br/><br/>For Kubrick, the most challenging part of this movie was certainly to keep a certain balance between the farcical and the satirical elements of the plot. And it is here where the film reveals some problems. Unfortunately Kubrick could not always resist the temptation to insist on the comic aspects, and that is why 'Dr. Strangelove' becomes ridiculous, little credible, even laughable and above all hardly convincing in certain scenes. It is especially the title character who (despite Seller's great performance) seems too much caricatured. Nevertheless these moments are (fortunately) not too numerous, so that after all you have seen a greatly directed and acted film. A memorable scene is Kong's ride on the bomb, which is just perfect. Two words (or more) about the ending: It is certainly pessimistic, but it is also the only possible way for such a movie to end without spoiling its pacifistic message.<br/><br/>Rating: 83<br/><br/>MarSco"

","From director Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket) this is quite an interesting satirical look at Cold War, with a great actor playing three great roles. Basically U.S. Air Force Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes completely mad and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R., he suspects they are planning wide spread pollution. The befuddled U.S. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) meets with his advisers, where the Soviet Ambassador De Sadesky (Peter Bull) tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a ""Doomsday Machine"", destroying all plant and animal life on Earth. Also in the story is the story of the plane dropping a bomb, and bemused Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Sellers again) trying to help on the ground. But the title character of Sellers' three is the greatest, Dr. Strangelove is the crazed U.S. Nazi adviser with an arm out of control that can grip, raise and strangle at any time. Also starring George C. Scott as Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson, Keenan Wynn as Col. 'Bat' Guano, Slim Pickens as Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong, Tracy Reed as Miss Scott, young James Earl Jones as Lt.

It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it won the BAFTAs for Best British Art Direction, Best Film from any Source, the UN Award and Best British Film, and it was nominated for Best British Screenplay. Peter Sellers was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 22 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 24 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 64 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here!

","I recently saw ""Dr. Strangelove"" for the first time ever, despite its being such a well known film and despite my having seen a few other Kubrick flicks over the years.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar at all with the movie, this is Stanley Kubrick's comedic commentary on nuclear armament. Unlike some of his other films (""2001"", ""Clockwork Orange""), this film has somewhat of a more realistic feel to it, albeit one that deals in a bizarre ""what if"" type of fantasy. The basic premise of the film is that an American general with access to nuclear attack plans has gone crazy and initiates a nuclear war sequence. The rest of the movie is the nation's attempt to stop the war from happening before the first bomb drops.<br/><br/>The film is shot in black and white, and features robust cinematography--I was fortunate to have seen it in a theater release, and seeing it on the big screen really highlighted the wonderful camera work.<br/><br/>All in all this is a well made film with a couple of memorable lines--although there are elements of the movie that were just a bit too over the top for me (Dr. Strangelove himself, for instance). I think the most important reason to watch this movie is for the message it conveyed regarding nuclear arms. The film is a social commentary on the absurdity of nuclear weapons, and if you watch it without comprehending that then you've missed the point entirely. That said, this is one that requires a bit of thought rather than simply taking it at face value.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I'm going to go with 8/10 stars for this film. It's very well made, and certainly worth the time to see once in your life. I'm not sure whether I'd consider it in my ""favorites"" category on the other side of viewing it--but it's a tale that certainly makes you think, and perhaps I might even say that it's a film that's more important to see than it is enjoyable to see. You'll perhaps see the world a bit differently on the other side of this movie--and that's not a bad thing."

","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A General has a mental breakdown and orders an American plane to drop a nuclear bomb on Russian. When the Russian president hears the news he warns America that if the bomb drops they were retaliate by dropping a Doomsday bomb.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's DR. STRANGELOVE is considered one of the greatest comedies ever made. That has always somewhat baffled and amazed me because there really aren't too many actual laughs in the movie. What Kubrick originally set out to do was create a serious drama but as time went along he realized he should turn this into a comedy. What DR. STRANGELOVE does do is show that there's a very thin line between intense suspense and black comedy.<br/><br/>What really amazes me about this film, as I said, is the fact that there really aren't too many laughs but that doesn't hurt this comedy. Kubrick would become known for creating his own universe in movies and when people talk about this they usually mention 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I think this film also fits that description because there's just an alternate universe going on here. The film looks and sounds like a serious drama but at the same time there's that underlining comedy that comes out at times. The look compared with the tone of the film just sets off a rather weird universe that isn't quite ""our"" times.<br/><br/>It certainly doesn't hurt that Kubrick lined up a terrific cast of characters and of course there's Peter Sellers playing three different characters. Of the three my favorite is without question President Muffley because of the scene where he must tell the Russian president that a nuclear bomb is about to kill millions of his people. Then you've got Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens also turning in great performances. George C. Scott will always be known for his tense dramas but his comic timing here is pretty darn good and especially when he lets his character's madness out.<br/><br/>The film contains a wonderful score and there's no question that it's downright beautiful to look at. Kubrick is considered a genius for obvious reason but I honestly don't think there has been another director that would have managed to get out of this film what he did."

It was shot in 1964, when the world was at the verge of a third World War, less than 20 years after Nazi Germany's downfall. So, how did Kubrick manage to create a film where the possibility of nuclear Holocaust is faced with laughs instead of panic? Due to a brilliant use of irony.<br/><br/>From every character idiosyncrasy – an ex-Nazi scientist whose hand did not forget his past ideology; a patriotic American general who's so proud of his pilots he forgets their success means the end of the word; a soldier who prefers to risk the national security to vandalize a Coca-Cola vending machine; the presidents of the two enemy countries talking by phone like two 15 year-old madly in love, etc. – to every piece of dialogue like: ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here – this is the War Room"", the movie is a giant and sarcastic critique to the hypocrisy of war and of those who think of themselves as being on the right side.<br/><br/>On top of all that we have a historic triple performance by Peter Sellers (Dr. Strangelove, Group Captain Mandrake and the President of USA) and remarkable performances by George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick was a man that believed in the worse of every human being, his filmography tells us that. He knew that we tend to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. On the last scene we hear Vera Lynn singing ""We'll meet again"". Is there a more clear warning?"

","What I find awesome about this film is that it is first and foremost a pretty cool action and drama movie. I am going to look for more Kubrik's war movies because the scenes of the fighting between troops looked like camera footage from an actual war. The situation inside the warplanes is also shot seriously. Also, despite the occasional comedic situation, the characters are playing it relatively straight throughout most of the film and you can sense some real tension in what happens to them.<br/><br/>This relatively serious approach makes humor all the more striking, like when the tune of ""The ants go marching"" starts playing. Dr. Strangelove is not really a comedy in the standard understanding. There are no punchlines. The humor instead comes from the overall silliness of the situation and the ""jokes"" are subtle. It is still a really interesting thing to see.<br/><br/>The only thing is that the scenes showing the planes flying are surprisingly really bad. I know they can do better. I have seen Russians make war movies immediately after the war that had better looking flying planes. It's so bad in fact that I think it was done on purpose.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really recommend this one. It holds the test of time quite well and its underlying messages are still relevant as they are more about people in general than about the nuclear scare of the cold war. It has good high level cast (of its time) and well done, Kubrick, RIP."

","Unfortunately I know that many people will not really enjoy what I have to say about Dr. Strangelove. I found it particularly enjoyable the first time around, but unfortunately the only reason to come back to it is for the Bomb Squad scenes and George C. Scott. I can't imagine how controversial it must have been for the time, but like a political cartoon it has its time and relevance. A lot of my family do not like Peter Sellers, or this movie at all and when showing this to a couple friends not too long ago they were not really impressed either (I was born in 1992, the Cold War was way beyond my time). <br/><br/>Kubrick is my favourite director, but that doesn't mean I am also inclined to enjoy all his movies as well. Reasons I adore Kubrick are the many diverse genre movies he made, and his meticulous attention to detail. I think of all that wonderful hard work was not needed for a comedy of this calibre, but again the stories on set are quite charming. Kubrick wanted the War room table to be green like a poker table (Seeing as how these men were essentially gambling with the future in a black and white movie), Peter Sellers was originally set to play much more roles than the three he did, and he also had Kubrick rolling on the floor laughing in-between takes. Finally the original pie fight ending scene was scrapped for various reasons, ranging from being too farcical or unfortunately timed with President Kennedy's death by assassination.<br/><br/>And honestly, I think I am right. I love that Kubrick attempted a comedy, and I think the movie is a wonderful classic and successful most of the running time. However as time goes by, this is the one Kubrick picture to me that will age the most. Of course this film would have been very risqué and controversial at the time of release, as it was a black comic adaptation of a very serious 1958 novel ""Red Alert"" by Peter George. But aside from a few scenes, nothing really makes me laugh aloud and the acting really falls apart no matter how wonderful I think George C. Scott is.<br/><br/>Still I guess the positive things to say is I could watch it again for things like the ""War room"" set, which was great after so many iterations were developed off screen. Again, I did not hate this movie and the whole thing is a wonderful farce which I guess what was Kubrick's intention to show us in the first place (Believe me if the Cold War could be remembered as just a farce, Oh what a dream it would all be). Maybe as I get older some of it will grow on me, but I don't think I will change my opinion of it lightly. If the movie has anything going for it, I would say it possibly has the greatest end credit sequences of all time.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Obscurely enough, I found an old review I wrote at 18 writing how much I loved this movie. As I get older it just doesn't hit as high a note for me anymore. It's a political cartoon realised, and I would advise everyone to at least watch it once. 7/10."

","Three years before he turned the nation's stomachs with the ultra- violence of A Clockwork Orange, and sixteen years before he scared them senseless with The Shining, cinema's finest auteur Stanley Kubrick captured perfectly the absurdity of the Cold War nuclear deterrent. <br/><br/>When an army commander goes haywire and, without due authority, sets in motion an airborne nuclear attack on Russian bases, the US president (one of Sellers' three roles) and his trusted team of military 'experts' must save the day.<br/><br/>Prominent among these 'experts' is General Buck Turgidson (Scott), a gloriously American hothead who can wave off the idea of ten to twenty million civilian casualties with a flick of his wrist in a way that would make George W. Bush blush. He, along with the mysterious Dr Strangelove (also Sellers) and a circle of bumbling high brass, are the world's hope for avoiding nuclear war. It's a scary thought that must have been downright terrifying in the paranoia of the Cold War.<br/><br/>Despite being at heart a film with about as serious a message as it's possible to have, pitch black comedy still manages to permeate every scene. It's a guilty laugh, a laugh that becomes a grimace of fear when you realise that reality is not quite as far away from events unfolding on screen as we'd probably like it to be.<br/><br/>Dr Strangelove also marks Peter Sellers' finest hour, giving him and his incredible versatility free reign.

They are advised by nuclear scientist Dr. Strangeglove, played by comedian Peter Sellers.<br/><br/>Sellers, with his slapstick and witty brand of comedy, kept this movie going at a fast-pace, keeping the audience intrigued and entertained. While this movie is a comedy, it is meant to deliver a message of war and I believe all the plot devices of comedy, drama and sci-fi are blended in together very well.<br/><br/>I remembered that most, if not all, of the students in my class cracked up at the movie, and were thoroughly engaged.

","Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb<br/><br/>English, 1964, 1 hr 33 min Genre: War, Sci-Fi, Comedy Direction: Stanley Kubrick Cast: Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden IMDb: 8.6/10<br/><br/>Before going into the movie, a word about the director. Stanley Kubrick is regarded by many as one of the greatest film-makers of all time, in the league of Alfred Hitchkock. Kubrick's films covered a variety of genres, including war, crime, romantic and black comedies, horror, epic and science fiction. Kubrick was also noted for being a perfectionist, using painstaking care with scene staging and working closely with his actors. Normally, genres like war and comedy usually don't go hand in hand. But it seems this director was quite different. The story goes like this: a general of the US Army feels he should not wait and watch the growth of USSR. Hence he creates a hoax of Russian attack and as if to counter it, launches a nuclear attack on Russia without the President's knowledge. He informs everyone of the mission only after he launched it. The nuclear fighters could only be called back with a secret code known only to him. The US authorities' efforts to bring the deadly situation under control is shown in the movie. This is one of the movies that fall under dark humor. Many scenes, like a mistress calling a General while he is in a meeting with the President etc are standout examples. Almost all characters, save the president, are portrayed rather funny. Dr. Strangelove is a technically brilliant film considering the period it was made. I must say I did not understand certain actions of some characters. Overall it is a very good watch...The song in background at the end quite matches with the climax..."

","According to Morrissey's recent manifestation ""more gay people, more peaceful the world"", war is the malicious ramification of heterosexual men's urge to kill their peers (I'm paraphrasing here), which tallies germanely with this Kubrick's black war satire. Under the cold war backdrop, a rogue nuclear attack to Soviet Union commenced by a fervid anti- communist USA general, which would (irrevocably) launch a doomsday machine (a Soviet Union's ultimate self-destructive nuclear contraption), and would annihilate all the human beings on the earth. It may sounds ridiculous and far-fetched by the mass, Kubrick's masterful endeavor has overcome the detached accessibility of the warfare lingoes and the exclusivity of the decision-makers' political impasse to implement a stranger-than-fiction satire which grants a considerable closeness to its audience with ease. <br/><br/>Running within 100 minutes, the film slickly unreels its storyline with great force of dark humor which imbues parodic and even cartoonish idiosyncrasies to the permeating machismo in the air. Peter Sellers' three-faceted versatility, George C. Scott's Communism-slamming extravaganza and Sterling Hayden's trigger-happy paranoia plus Slim Pickens' cowboy hat, the ensemble cast owns their respective frantic glory within a compacted steak of time, umpteen gags and mockeries can be savored ad infinitum, Sellers'British accent (as Group Captain) when confronting Sterling's General Rippers is unimpeachably spontaneous, Keenan Wynn's coca-cola joke is pertinently deadpan serious and Sterling's conspiracy theory about water fluoridation and the fearful deprivation of life essence during a sexual intercourse (the man just cannot face his natural aging mechanism of the body) are plainly golden ideas, outlandish but vividly rib-tickling, and astringently self-reflective.<br/><br/>Kubrick's trademark set design which would prevail in his later color features has not fully exploited this black-and-white war farce, and the (not-too-obvious) misogyny and chauvinism overtone does impede the sensitive nerves a bit, nevertheless, it is not my favorite Kubrick's film, but it is an outstanding comedy which I presume can stay untainted by numerous re-watches, for me the first round is more than gratifying and since my generally inert resistance towards war-related films, a second round may take some time despite of its overall peerlessness."

","I watched this movie in my European History class as part of 'end-of-the-year movie palooza.' I'm personally not the biggest fan of black & white, old school movies, but this one was pretty captivating.<br/><br/>It was created during the Cold War and it was supposed to be ""dark comedy."" While the movie probably will not make you laugh out loud, it has its funny moments where you will at least grin. It is a dark comedy because it is a satire on the Cold War, which most people during the time probably did not find to be very entertaining.<br/><br/>The characters in this film are very memorable. I think that is partly because of the diverse personalities that exist; one is serious, one is paranoiac, one is crazy, and one is rather funny. I think Stanley Kubrick did a great job integrating them into the story. The characters individually are not particularly interesting, but the way that they combined to create a mockery of the war was truly a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The problem that I had with this film was the lack of fluidity in the plot. There were only about three places where action took place, and the entire movie was just switching back and forth between the two. While action was taking place, it did not feel that it was actually moving. Typically, the setting changes as the plot moves on, but this movie lacked that. I suppose that's not necessarily a flaw, it's just something that stood out to me.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is pretty relevant even though it is 48 years old. The lack of professionalism from the world leaders in this movie is still something that can be seen in today's politics.<br/><br/>""Gentlemen. You can't fight in here. This is the War Room!"""

","The eponymous Dr. Strangelove is in fact just a minor character in the film that bears his name; and moreover, one of three characters played by Peter Sellars in Stanley Kubrick's celebrated cold war satire. And justly celebrated, because this is a very funny movie, quite aside from being a disturbingly plausible story. What it isn't so good at is maintaining an air of tension: as the countdown to nuclear oblivion takes place, it's hard to really believe in the story unfolding as anything more than a set-up for the gags, and of course the special effects are predictably rubbish by modern standards. It's arguable this is a good thing, forcing the writers to rely on their script. One particular point struck me: just how much the paranoid general reminded me of the tea-partiers in modern day America. But perhaps it's just a mark of top-class satire that it retains a feeling of pertinence, even when the mood of the times has superficially changed."

","Entertainment Weekly called this one of the funniest 100 movies ever made. It also happens to be one of the most disturbing movies made. The humor is right there in your face, however, there is always an underlining political critique under every character, every line, and every government representation. Slim Pickins is the never quit Airman. He is a representative of our entire military system of the time. The president, played beautifully by Peter Sellers, is a demure, calm presence trying to deal with the Russian premiere. His perfect counterpart is a war hungry General, ready to accuse the Russians of any small infraction. This leads to one of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Sellers also plays a British airman who has to deal with the crazed general in the usual polite British manner. Seller's third role is that of the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a former nazi and weapons designer for the Americans. He represents the scientific community of that time period; those who worked tirelessly to build a better bomb. These characters, all of them strongly parodying a cross section of society make for an odd story. The final scene, while played for laughs, is actually a frightening image of a communist future. The final moments are frightening in their truth leading one to put themselves in a position of the characters. Dr. Strangelove is the funniest disturbing film I've ever seen."

","What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!"
"hessgail55","8","0","1","9 December 2011"," Dr. Strangelove is a satire
","Dr. Strangelove is a satire aimed at the scare surrounding nuclear bomb threats which were a concern at the time the movie was filmed in 1964. The movie involves several officers in the U.S. Air force with the action being divided between the war room of the Pentagon and a nuclear-armed B-52 war plane. <br/><br/>The story begins with General Jack Ripper(Sterling Hayden), who is clearly not in control of his mental faculties, giving the order to a squadron of B-52 fighter jets to mount an attack on Russian soil based on paranoid thoughts he has of the Russians putting fluoride in the liquids Americans consume. His assistant, Captain Lionel Mandrack (Peter Sellers), originally thinks the orders are a drill but upon finding out the attack is truly going to take place, attempts to stop it. <br/><br/>Meanwhile back at the war room,President Merkin Muffley (also Peter Sellers) warns the Russian president of the impending attack that he is helpless to stop (he doesn't have the code) and they argue over insignificant things instead of focusing on the huge problem of the bomb. General Buck Turgidson(George C. Scott), who is present at the meeting, relays information about the impending attack and tries to sway the president to take his advice, which is centered on his mistrust of the Russians. <br/><br/>As time goes on, the war leaders call upon Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers again)who is the science adviser to the president and a former Nazi for recommendations on the situation. His thoughts are to hide underground with ten women to one man in order to perpetuate the world again after it is destroyed. All the men find this most agreeable. <br/><br/>Eventually,Captain Mandrack is able to decipher the code from some papers he comes across on General Ripper's desk and calls in a stop order to the B-52 squadrons. One bomber plane, piloted by Major King Kong (Slim Pickens),does not receive the orders and while straddling a bomb as he tries to fix a jammed cargo door, suddenly finds himself riding the bomb as it hurdles toward earth. Of course the Russians are not happy with this new development and proceed to detonate a secret doomsday bomb they have created, which in turn annihilates the world.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove makes light of a concern that most Americans keenly felt during the years of the cold war with the Russians. It was a welcome comic relief which helped people to put into perspective the fears they felt during that time. If you could laugh at it, it didn't seem as bad. Peter Sellers was very convincing in his triple role especially since I didn't even realize that he was playing the role of President Muffley too until the end of the movie. Peter Sellers played warring personalities as President Muffley and Captain Mandrack with their intense seriousness as opposed to the unfocused, goofiness of Dr. Strangelove.This contributed to the theme which focused on making light of a serious situation. <br/><br/>A technique that stood out in the movie was the use of motifs. At different intervals throughout the movie, the word peace would appear on posters and papers. This irony contrasted sharply with the war scenes that were going on all around them and also related to the theme by helping the viewers to understand that peace is highly desired even in the midst of all our suspicions and insecurities. <br/><br/>Black and white, while not always the viewer's first choice, was very effective for this film. It immersed the audience in the dark world that was war and lent itself to the satirical nature of the theme.Another darkly humorous movie is Young Frankenstein which was also filmed in black and white. Its theme focuses on making light of the fears surrounding monsters instead of war; however both films help viewers to see their fears for what they are. As long as we have fears to deal with in our lives, films such as Dr. Strangelove will come as a welcome relief. After all, laughing at our fears is not so uncommon. Often all you need to turn a tragedy into a comedy is time and a little satire."

","The film was way ahead of its time when it came out. I've watched it maybe 100+ times and it never fails to impress. From the secretaries manners in the bedroom to the pilots reading out of 'box' contents to Dr. Strangelove himself. The 'funny' thing is that's it's not 'funny' but compelling viewing. The fact we could all die (and that remains today) a stark warning of differences in attitude and loyalties to each other. The fact that Peter Sellers (who personally except for this film) I always found someone who I'd not watch however in this the exact opposite. The three characters he played to perfection and actually gives the layman a view that the world is filled with such diverse people it reminds you that the world is so varied. I think the whole film shows two sides, that of 'procedure' and the other of undeniable 'greed' in realising you need to survive and what you can obtain from it. Kubrick did an amazing job and okay, we know there were no special effects available then however he depicted a film that is both memorable, diverse and makes the mind think. The truth is that in that year people 'did' think like they did an that notion can scare you a little. Michael"
"Kubris","8","0","1","27 August 2011"," A time capsule from an uneasy time
","Dr. Strangelove is an interesting film. So interesting in fact I had to see it twice before I could make my mind up about it. I was born well after this film came out, and even after the fall of the USSR. However, history quite interests me and I do research on the films I see. Dr. Strangelove still polarizes me.<br/><br/>From the mind of the legendary Stanley Kubrick, Strangelove is about war. Nuclear war. And somehow, this black comedy made it humorous. I don't want to say funny, because I didn't quite laugh out loud, but the characters are quirky, the plot over the top, and one famous scene demands a chuckle.<br/><br/>Strangelove didn't leave an immediate impression on me. I thought the jokes weren't funny enough and the first half hour was slow, which is a big chunk of this 100 minute movie. But in the days and weeks after, I found myself referring to things as the 'Big Board' and used a crazed German accent more. What Strangelove has is staying power.<br/><br/>This is due to the excellent performances. Sellers is a great anchor as the President, delivering some good lines. He does the job of Mandrake adequately, but his scenes weren't the best. General Ripper, while being quite nuts, would've lit up those scenes in the air force base with a little insanity. But the character of Strangelove is the best. His voice, hair, glasses and glove (evil!) are hilarious. His last scene, where his body starts to lose control, is great and his final line is priceless. Other winners are George Scott, and the anxious General Turgidson, Peter Bull's spot-on Russian stereotype, and Slim Picken's Major Kong.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Strangelove simply isn't as shocking or funny as another satire of conflict: The Great Dictator (If you read my review, it's golden). That film, 20 years older, stands above Strangelove in many ways, especially the humour. Strangelove is too slow-burning in comparison.<br/><br/>And then there's the ending. While I understand the plot's conclusion, I'm unclear of the message being told to a generation who lived in paranoia. If it's that nukes will kill us all, why was this a comedy with such a left-field ending? It's not a bad ending, just a fuzzy one.<br/><br/>I liked Strangelove more and more after I saw it. If you stick with it, it gets better later into the film. It may have had a large effect on people when it came out, but it hasn't aged too well. 8.4/10<br/><br/>*Edit* Now, 8 months after the second viewing I can say I've seen Strangelove 3 times, and now I have Kubrick's earlier repertoire under my belt as well. I can summarize my new thoughts of the film.<br/><br/>There's no denying that this is a great film. The script is legendary, the performances adequately silly, and there's just a very light atmosphere for a dark subject. But Strangelove is now... irrelevant. The future cannot be kind to it as it is very 'in the moment'. I envy anyone who saw this in theaters, but today it just doesn't have the same effect. It's not a universal theme that can be applied elsewhere, the film is very specific. And that is why, while great, Strangelove can't last. <br/><br/>Still an 8.4."

","This is definitely ""the satire"" of the Cold War. It is very well filmed – as you would expect from Kubrick - and the characters are very engaging – not something I would expect from Kubrick. The plot is also very well structured, as it alternates between the bomber crew, the War room and Jack Ripper's base. Jack Ripper's portrayal is the height of paranoia and along with the role of Buck Turgidson (played by George C. Scott) these are two outstanding personalities in film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I felt the role of Dr. Strangelove was too over the top and rather ruined the movie's effect, particularly towards the end. Nevertheless, this is still one of best satires ever and closing in at 50 years this film still holds its' own.

","Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Stanley Kubrick, 1963) is such a bold, arresting and confrontational comedic take on an unfathomably awful subject that you can forgive its imperfections. Sterling Hayden is the crazed brigadier general who blames the Russkies for his impotence, saying it's because they fluoridated his water. So he sends over some bombers to nuke them. If they succeed, the commies' Doomsday Machine will see the whole world go up in smoke. George C. Scott is Hayden's warmongering boss, while Peter Sellers excels in three roles: playing the President, madcap ex-Nazi scientist Dr Strangelove and, best of all, stiff-upper-lipped British captain Lionel Mandrake. The scene in which Mandrake tries to explain what on earth has been going on to endlessly suspicious colonel Bat Guano (Keenan Wynn) is a comic masterpiece. There are slow stretches, and Kubrick's notorious anal impulse means we get a lot of tedious detail about how exactly one would drop a bomb, but there's genius at work here, and it's a movie everyone should see."

","There's not a false note in Dr. Strangelove. This 1964 black and white comedy about the ultimate madness of nuclear conflict and the bloody folly of war is a stunning success, and one of the best Cold War movies ever to be made. From the evocative credit sequence of a B-52 bomber and a KC-135 tanker pairing for a romantic mid-air refueling to the totally ridiculous names for all the characters, Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is the funniest black and white film that I have watched yet. It is widely regarded as the screen's greatest satire, a film that terrifically encapsulates the fear and paranoia of the Cold War. There is not a sequence in the motion picture in which the dialogue is not quotable -- certainly, there are so many well-remembered moments that viewers and critics will disagree on the best, though surely the sight of Major Kong waving his cowboy hat as he rides the bomb into oblivion is among the most enduring images of its era."

Peter Sellers did an excellent job playing three characters, and he was able to switch back and forth between characters while making both characters very believable. While enjoying this movie, I felt that it sexualized females very much, with the only female character wearing a bikini, and then the same woman being the Playboy centerfold that ""King"" Kong is reading in the cockpit, and I thought that that was the only lame part of the movie. I thought that the cinematography was very well done, and seeing the plane fly through the air in a very campy (as it would be referred to now) 60s style definitely made for a good laugh, even though it wasn't supposed to be funny.

Like the Graduate and Full Metal Alchemist, it constantly switches between serious moments and funny moments and the two often overlap making this movie a farce. It is a farce on our government and our society and sometimes makes fun of men's use of women as objects rather than human beings. The acting is good, it is silly when necessary to be funny and is serious when necessary to be funny. Peter Sellers is very good in his three parts. He is able to act calmly or over the top depending on the character. Slim Pickins was pretty decent as the leader of the plane drew who had questionable intelligence, as did almost everyone else in the movie. The dark and bright lighting in certain scenes makes the movie feel like a political thriller that contradicts its comedy to make it even funnier like Shawn of the Dead and Darkwing Duck.

","Prior to seeing this film I heard a lot of hype from people of all ages and I must say I was a little disappointed. I don't know what it was about the film or what it was that I possibly didn't get but I just didn't think it was an amazing movie. However, there were some things that I did particularly enjoy. First of all, I loved the intro scene, the refueling of the plane sequence was awesome. Next, the acting in the film was very good; I mean sitting there watching that scene in the beginning when the guys are all on the plane and some are playing cards, some are looking at playboy, it just seemed so realistic and a great depiction of what soldiers really do. The camera work of the movie was also really good I loved how they used a variety of different shots instead of the same old boring one every time. I also really enjoyed the sound of the film but specifically in the shootout scene towards the end. The comedy wasn't too bad either. Perhaps if I was around in the time it was originally released it would of had a different affect on me."

","In times of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union have competed against each other in getting their first spaceships into space,building nuclear weapons that could destroy all human kind in one day, and the battle between communism and the free enterprise system. Although war is a bad thing that'll end with bad consequences, Kurbick direction into the film was good and to the point in showing what would happen if the United States had used nuclear weapons on Russia during the Cold War.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the film was good. The various shooting angles on the US Air Force planes flying towards Russia in close up views was good. The use of dramatic lighting shined on the generals, ambassadors, and the president was clear in focus, well lit on their faces, and very dramatic sense of light that establishes the characters as important, privileged leaders that are willing to fight and prevent the war against Russia. The lighting on the pilots and the soldiers fighting outside a building were dull in their mid-tone gray contrast emphasizing the gloomy mood and their need to be the people that'll be disposed in the fight against Russia, as a result of their deadly weapons. The use of back light on the general sitting in a chair was really nice. The special effects that were used for a full-view airplane flying towards Russia made the plane feel like it was flying in the older Superman series style. The duration of the plot throughout the film dragged causing the overall mise-en-scene of the film to drag and cause the viewer to lose interest in the film.<br/><br/>Although the screenplay dragged the plot and storyline throughout the film, the overall message was strong and to the point. If you're interested in seeing a Cold War film, come see this film."

"johnnyboyz","7","0","5","11 June 2007"," Kubrick's stab at comedy hits the mark most times with superior story telling for the time but the aging is the biggest problem here.
","Although it's Kubrick (and I like Kubrick a great deal), 'Dr. Strangelove' left me a little under-whelmed and a little disappointed. I would go so far as to say that the film's main problem is in it's aging as its content and the way in which the film is delivered are fine; in fact, they actually feel ahead of their time.<br/><br/>The film's core subject is the Cold War  this is obvious. The Cold War ran between the end of the second world war (1945) and ended in the early 1990s with the fall of the Soviet Union so between these dates I'm sure this film was at the top of every AFI and BFI list imaginable not to mention people's personal ones as well. I can imagine people watching this film during the Cold War and genuinely being entertained that something so serious can be looked at in such a carefree and laughable way and this is very clever  something only Kubrick and probably no one else could actually pull off. The way in which the Russians are allowed into America's secret den, the way suspicion and humour are connected during the 'he's secretly taking pictures!' gag and throughout as well as the way in which former Nazi accomplices are represented.<br/><br/>The film also uses the technique of revolving around three different stories which is very advanced and adds to the film. These is the base and its fate in which American planes are purposely ordered to attack the USSR; the 'allies' in an underground American bunker dealing with the situation (and getting into some hilarious phone calls with the Russians whilst they're at it); and the lone plane that breaks away from Allied control as it nears its Soviet target.<br/><br/>The first setting and its main characters: Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) and the aptly named bringer of death General Jack Ripper (Hayden) are absolutely hilarious to watch. Mandrake is English and remains calm in a crisis; only maybe raising his voice when he needs to give a monologue stating how he's taking control  this is counteracted by Ripper's disturbing persona and ideas about how he's going to make the world a better place by, technically, destroying it. He has his own brilliant monologue all about water and an interesting conspiracy surrounding it.<br/><br/>The second setting's humour comes across in the figure of phone calls to a Soviet leader whom we never hear speak yet totally understand through the American's conversation route. When he's told planes are heading to nuke a part of his country: ""Yes, I can understand you're upset(!)"" is the American's next line of dialogue. We also spend enough time with the bomber crew to have feelings towards them even if it is the worst 'story' of the three as all that happens in terms of dialogue are co-ordinates and the like which makes it feel like a shoddy documentary on an air force crew. There aren't many funny moments either although the ending does enforce some laughs and the bomber crew are involved.<br/><br/>Like I said, the film hasn't aged well in terms of its content about the Cold War; Russia used to be the enemy  now we have a new one. This may be my own unique interpretation but I feel events in Iraq have now come to dominate the 'war' content/topic/theme in most of our lives. As well as this, the jokes do not come as free flowing as I expected and the film does threaten to take itself a little too seriously at times  probably down to the seriousness behind the bomber crew's storyline.<br/><br/>Even though the brainwave of the Nazi in the chair and his ideas of creating a new, ideal group of people underground if nuclear war does happen; all the while resisting his Nazi roots and saluting with one arm is a stroke of genius, it's the ideas and script concepts that carry the film  not the humour within. This is probably Kubrick's least 'epic' film and as a result is probably (from what I've seen) my least favourite but that said, it's still an impressive attempt and shouldn't discourage you from seeing it."

A mad US General gives his airborne aircraft the go-ahead to deliver a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Slim Pickens is the aircraft commander who doesn't receive the recall command and continues onward towards his target.

","I have enjoyed and in fact loved many movies, but Dr. Strangelove is the only movie that I have seen over and over without eventually noticing flaws. George C. Scott delivers what I consider to be the finest comic performance in a movie (rivaled only by Lee Marvin, in Cat Ballou).<br/><br/>This movie is a satire, but even so the dialogue, ridiculous as it always is, is utterly, realistically human. When General Buck Turgidson (Scott) is explaining to the President what he considers to be the wisdom ofa first nuclear strike on the Soviets, for example, you can easily imagine a real general laying out the same arguments, using the same euphemisms. (""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. I am saying, no more than ten or twenty Americans killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks."") Or Major Kong (played by Slim Pickens) giving his bomber crew a brief pep talk. (""I reckon you wouldn't even by human bein's if you didn't have some pretty strong feelin's about nuclear combat."") <br/><br/>I have adopted some of Major Kong's expressions as my own. For example, ""I'm going' to get them doors open if it harelips everybody on Bear Creek."" Or, ""I've been to a picnic, one world's fair and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest thing I've every heard come over a set of earphones."" <br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove is the only movie I can name thatcontains no superfluous scenes. Every minute of this movie contributes to the story.

Although at first there were two good directors, time has judged what film will survive, and it is Strangelove. The difference is a point of view.

"dust-7","Null","0","5","15 December 2005"," Film that cannot easily be dismissed - that being said . .
","Kubrick is a tough one to appreciate. On the one hand you can't help but like his reliance upon the florescent light, lighting in general, and his slow set-work, set-piece films. And this is a film filled with fine leading and character actors, as well, quite obviously. And the latter alone often makes a film. So I want to dislike Kubrick. But I keep coming back to the DVDs, appreciating one or two things I had not previously. Kubrick, the late Kubrick, cannot be dismissed.<br/><br/>On the other hand, having said that, Kubrickism is also infantilism, adolescent fixations upon sex. It's crude jokes. Kubrick is the father, and it's not too much of a stretch to say, of Beavis and Butthead, and South Park (the Comedy Central mushmouth voice animation with cutouts). It's said that 'theater people' never really mature. They don't grow up.<br/><br/>Well, seen in that way, Strangelove is more a play-acted cartoon, like some FOX comedy of the 1990s. It's more farce than drama. 'Black comedy'? It doesn't come up to that. I don't think Kubrick intended such. And that was his mistake. It's because the farce is so cartoonish it overwhelms the drama. Drama there is. The set-piece interior of the B52 is striking, particularly for the era and the real cold war and desire to keep such military secrets. Pickens and the rest play it straight, mostly. So the Dallas/Vegas joke almost brings a laugh, in that context, but only because the tone is serious. Toe to toe with the Ruskies, like other absurd phrases, passed into the popular banter for decades afterward. There is suspense, action, and fear. These scenes make the film, and perhaps in spite of the farce and forced comedy ending.<br/><br/>Because back at the base rooms, even what subtlety is absent. It's nothing but madness at the AF base with the 'funny' name, and the spinning tape drives. Peter Sellers has a string in his leg. A what? You mean to threaten a brother officer, he asks, obviously upset but too weak to attack and shake the 'code prefix' out of the insane Ripper. The South Park folk would have a name for Mandrake. So it turns out that Ripper concocted some leftwing conspiracy theory about fluoridation based on his own failed fornications, his impotence. And so the solution, ultimately, is to abandon monogamy in the mine shafts, with Sellers' Strangelove compulsively saluting Adolph Hitler, and all of it's Kubrickian.<br/><br/>Stated another way, the clichés come fast and furious, just as in a recent film of that name. It's thoughtless. It's non sequitur. It's all too easy, and not generally funny. The work is put into the sets, not into the script. He's trying to make a point at odds with the very history of the time. The 'crisis' wasn't about reckless US action, but reckless Soviet action. And they literally had to loop or dub in Pickens as he originally jokes - Dallas - not Vegas. The President, in real life, had been assassinated. But even worse, the moral of the story is don't trust the Americans. They have no real control over their commanders or weapons. Not the 'Ruskies', as Pickens has it. Just as in the insane mocu-drama, Crimson Tide, America is reckless in its plans, in its commanders, and Russia, crazy as it may be (building a domesday device in this film), can always be trusted to keep the lid on. The good ole Ruskies. That's as much the vapid cliché as any. But Kubrick doesn't get it.<br/><br/>Again, the sets were great. But the Kubrick insisted that Scott, later to only slightly ham it up as Patton, should be shown falling over himself, and otherwise behaving as a spoiled child, or slapstick comic - everything, one might say, but that pie fight. And Scott may not have appreciated it then, or later. And I don't, now, in the 21st century, looking at this film, yet again.<br/><br/>For all that, one has to say that it is still a landmark film. It certainly doesn't merit a high rating on IMDb (and which is unusual given the age of the film). But it is good. It's good, again, not just for those sets, not just for the lead and supporting cast, but for the serious moments. It's good not for the concluding Nazi-farce scenes, which can lose the audience, but for the fight on the base. It's not good for the Hayden/Sellers play in the room, which is 'black comedy' much more with the low light on Hayden, than the close-ups of Sellers' Mandrake. It's good for the interplay of the crew on the B52.<br/><br/>Kubrick, in short, was wrong. This didn't play better as a farce. It could have worked better as a comedy. It didn't need Nazi-farce in a wheelchair. It didn't need the infantilism and 'bodily fluid' conspiracies. It didn't need Scott/Turgidson as buffoon. It's played at worst as a live-action cartoon. And so it continues to appeal to the adolescent, and few more than that, and always will. Where it's played for suspense and drama, I think it still appeals to all. But to those more experienced, and more intelligent, the film surely seems flawed, important for its historical importance and historical place, but not so much as a film for the ages. It surely made its points, however taken by whatever activists then and later. But it just doesn't play honestly. It doesn't make sense. And as for laughs, most any similarly adolescent 'britcom' is going to be funnier."

The Cuban Missile crisis had just ended. President Johnson would use the Gulf of Tonkin incident to escalate American involvement in Vietnam.<br/><br/>In such a climate, Kubrick had the audacity to produce an anti-war film. And, it was a brilliant film because it attacked American society's repression and anxiety, which was the basis of aggressive patriotism. And, it attacked the competence and integrity of civil and military leaders.<br/><br/>Kubrick did not make a breeding-heart anti-war film. He was not interested in giving love a chance. He was a realist, and he zeroed in on the crucial flaw in American society.<br/><br/>Even 40 years later, the film has a timeless prophetic quality. Is the American government not in the hands of reactionary nuts and incompetents? Kubrick deserves our respect. He was a consistently brilliant film-maker and insightful analyst. <br/><br/>It's a pity that the young people of today are fed a diet of Matrix films and MTV bites.

The RAND corporation created the thesis of Mutually Assured Destruction - where the threat of nuclear retaliation from both the US and USSR would prevent either side launching a nuclear first strike (sometimes known as the 'balance of terror').

If the Soviet Union becomes the losing opponent, then the ""doomsday machine"" will be activated and all life on Earth would be destroyed, while a B-52 is currently underway to drop the bomb that could spell certain doom to all living things.<br/><br/>This film is pure comedic fantasy, intermxing real life situations and fictional situations between two secretly warring factions.  Almost every character in the film added some sort of comedic genius equivalent to any Jim Carrey movie.  <br/><br/>This Reviewer gives this film a 7 out of 10 (10 being the highest) for it's origianality to a real life situation and it's ability to make even the most humor deprived person sneak out a chuckle or guffaw.  It's no wonder that this film is ranked so high on AFI's top list of best movies and should be influential to many future comedies in generations to come."

","Dr.Strangelove is a dark comedy that has a very specific message. This message is one that is completely against what was done in the cold war and the paranoia that in consumed the minds of those who have to make word altering decisions. The most obvious of these paranoia's was present in the character Jack D. Ripper who was afraid of fluoridation which was a fear during the cold war the U.S.S.R was planning to sabotage all of the U.S drinking water. To the viewer who knows what fluoridation is this seems to be the reason why he is so obsessed with his `precious bodily fluids'<br/><br/>	In this movie names were given with much thought though some of them may not be obvious. The obvious ones include Jack D. Ripper, `King' Kong, and `Bat' Guano. Some of the not so obvious may be Turgidson (turgid meaning swollen or highly embellished which suits the character perfectly) and Mandrake (mandrake being a European plant with narcotic properties and is also said to resemble a human this description may or may not be a reason the name was chosen). <br/><br/>	Music for this movie was chosen to show how idiotic it all was but also the song `Johnny comes marching home' was chosen and played every time the focus was on `King' Kong's plane. Anyone who has heard the original song called `Johnny I hardly knew ya' knows this may have been chosen to show the evils of such events and to those that do not know the lyric of `Johnny I hardly knew ya' it continues past when Johnny comes marching home again hurrah to say with drums and guns and guns and drums Harrah with drums and guns and guns and drums  the enemy nearly slue your darling john its been so long Johnny I hardly knew ya.where are eyes that were so mild  why did you run from me and the child.where are your legs that used to run  when first you went to carry a gun.you haven't an arm and you haven't a leg.

","Why have countries always competed to get the largest, most up-to-date, most destructive weapon? Is it our basic human instinct? But one would think that the human race is smarter than that. But obviously we aren't.  Freud would say it IS our instinct. He would say it is penis envy. The idea of penis envy is that males must and will always be jealous of the guy with the bigger thing and he will want to be the guy with the even bigger thing. That is why Freud would have absolutely loved Dr. Strangelove. The movie has many Freudian overtones. Dr. Strangelove is a movie that seems to have good intention of pointing out this ridiculous love people have for the bomb. It could have been done better though. The acting just wasn't all that impressive and neither was the character development, but for a movie like this with the issue it is dealing with, the characters/acting isn't exactly the most important thing. It is hard to understand the acting and what the characters are saying, but Stanley Kubrick somehow did a good job of getting the message across. Dr. Strangelove has the qualities of a film and a flick. It could be considered a film because of the real issue, and a flick because of the humorous aspect of it. But there are also parts of this film that the average Joe may not understand. One may not understand the Freudian overtones and the dark humor of it all. This movie is accurately put in the dark comedy category because of the satirical way that the very real issue of nuclear weapons is portrayed. It is portrayed so dismissive an un-serious. It is good that there are movies like this that poke fun at how nuts society is. There should be a more modern version of this film released. The original is good, but if it were remade and some parts maybe re-thought, it could have a big impact on the way people view war and the insane competition that countries are in to see who could blow up the Earth faster."

","It's the height of the cold war, and an accidental nuclear strike on Russia has been called by American forces. How is the U.S. going to stop the weapons from reaching their targets and avoid worldwide destruction? Why was the strike confirmed? And could Dr. Strangelove's plan work out just in case? These are only a few of the many questions posed by Stanley Kubrick in his 1964 film, Dr. Strangelove.<br/><br/>	The full title; Dr Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, aside from being quite unique, does a good job of setting up the audience for the premise of the film. It may not sound like a comedy from the title, but don't judge a film by its tagline. Here Kubrick has created a very funny black comedy that examines our fascination or `strange love' with power and military superiority. He smothers his film with symbolism and psychological metaphors, many that remind us of Freud's theories on the matter.<br/><br/>	Those not interested in a deep and analytical movie will still enjoy this picture nonetheless. It is a great comedy propelled by perfect comedic timing and some of the best actors of their time. Two of the best actors, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden, stray from their regular dramatic roles for a little comedy. Of course a little help is given by the hysterical Peter Sellers, who plays three roles, including the title character. 	 	Kubrick is a cinematic master and you can see why. The way he composes his shots and directs his actors tells you something about his genius. Very few people could take a topic such as apocalyptic world destruction and make it into a comedy, and do it so well. 	One word of advice though before you watch this movie; you will like it so much better if you really understand the feeling associated with that time in American History. You can feel the tension and the uneasiness that was extremely prevalent during the early 60's. Regardless of your historical knowledge, you'll still enjoy this hilarious piece on the insanity and weird obsession surrounding war and the struggle to become the best.<br/><br/>	 	At the very least, you'll learn the proper technique of riding atomic weapons out of planes.

"Chris_Cadatal","Null","0","1","12 March 2004"," Smokey the Bear says...""Only you can help preserve our precious bodily fluids.""
","Being a Stanley Kubrick creation, one can expect an artistic and multi-layered film with the usual abnormality in the screenplay.  Needless to say, this one takes the cake.  Packed with a plethora of Freudian innuendo, Dr. Strangelove is sure to keep you laughing and thinking throughout its duration.<br/><br/>The story takes place during the arms race of the Cold War and features Sterling Hayden who plays the role of Gen. Jack D. Ripper, an eccentric all-American cowboy on brink of madness. In a desperate attempt to oppose communist oppression and preserve the `precious bodily fluids' of the American people, he orders an unauthorized nuclear attack on the U.S.S.R. Getting word of this maniacal act, U.S. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) holds a meeting with his advisors.  There he finds out that the Soviets also have a trick up their sleeve, a `doomsday' device set to destroy all life on earth.  With only hours remaining, man's very existence rests solely in President Muffley's hands.  Can the bombers be stopped from setting off the end of mankind while still preserving our precious bodily fluids?  All this and more in this comedic mockery brought to you by the one and only Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>
This black and white farce exploits our `strange love' to nuclear arms in a relaxed but hilarious manner.  It's main strength came from its characters. Each one had individuality and life.  Peter Sellers was absolutely hilarious as the president, particularly in his lengthy and somewhat feminine phone conversation between him and his Soviet counterpart.  It was rich with originality, peculiarity, and comedic timing.  His other roles as British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove, a German physicist/genius, were just as comedic, but were more over the top and energetic, which not only added a strong contribution to the film's entertainment value, but also revealed Sellers' versatility in comedic acting.  Sterling Hayden was also very interesting to watch as he played the psychotic Gen. Jack D. Ripper.  He preserved a very dominant, loud and peculiar persona throughout the film that was far from dull.  His paranoia of the communists conspiring to pollute the `precious bodily fluids' of the American people opened doors for humorous dialogue and physical bits in the film that kept the laughs rolling.<br/><br/>Another strength this film had was the film's overall flow of dialogue and imagery.  Kubrick's masterful control on the film's story helped it evolve from a very delicate and tense situation involving nuclear arms, communist prejudice and a doomsday device to a side-splitting turn of events revolving around sexual innuendos anddare I saybody fluids?<br/><br/>Laughable as well as enjoyable, Dr. Strangelove is for anyone who likes comedy that's 3-dimensional and in depth.  This film has a lot of symbolism and sexual innuendo which surprisingly enough is easy to spot if you think like the average hormone-driven teen, but keep in mind that this film is not for the simple minded."
"Blondi85","Null","0","2","12 March 2004"," Strangelove shows the strangeness of the Cold War
","This dark comedy is about the bitter rivalry between the Soviets and Americans and the nuclear bomb. Colonel Jack Ripper goes crazy and wants to demolish the Soviet Union. Although this movie sounds almost like a drama it is a huge spoof of the Cold War.   Stanley Kubrick is a very creative director and screenplay writer. The comedy in this film had a lot of depth instead of the usual types of jokes that are in movies. He got his point across in an original way of his opinion of the Cold War and it shows in his film. He did a great job showing the stupidity of the competition of the U.S. and the Soviet Union wanting bigger and better bombs in a Freudian comedic way. Peter Sellers who played the three different characters of Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove did a great job acting.  Playing these three different characters in one film showed his diversity in acting. He was very funny in each of his roles which was impressive. The music that was chosen for the film was a great selection, especially in the beginning and ending. It illustrated the mood of the movie and gave it that extra flare for the humor of the story.   Dr. Strangelove is for a mature audience. It is a movie the viewer should pay attention to the whole time because of the depth.  This isn't a typical comedy so it is sometimes difficult to understand the humor in the jokes. Stanley Kubrick did a great job on this politically inspired film by getting his opinion across, not a in a blunt way but in a way that makes you think and laugh. It is definitely a movie to see."

The Director had a weird aspect to this movie it's kinda unique, you have to look at the movie from a totally different perspective from the beginning, but you'll have to find that kind of perspective on our own. The movie actually is mainly history in s certain way. The main theme is about nuclear bombs and refers to the bodily functions a lot. There is a specific scene where Major T.J. King Kong' is straddling the bomb screaming it has to do with both, if you know what I mean..... The Director used unique names like Jack D.

"FilmOtaku","8","0","3","6 March 2004"," A visionary and daring anti-war film
","There have only been a couple of Stanley Kubrick films that I have not seen, and Dr. Strangelove was one of them.  I'm not entirely sure why I never got around to seeing this one, especially since it is deemed such a classic, but nevertheless, until two weeks ago despite the fact that I have had this DVD in my collection for five years, it had not yet hit my viewing queue. Perhaps I had some preconceptions that it would be a war film I wouldn't be interested in. Of course, as what happens with most films I nonsensically and irrationally (and sometimes unintentionally) avoid, I ended up absolutely loving this film.<br/><br/>Peter Sellers is a triple threat in this satire about nuclear war in the face of the Cold War.  He plays a British military officer under a maniacal United States General who decides that he wants to wage nuclear war on the Russians without anyone's approval.  Sellers' role is to find out the code that will end the attack, but military bureaucracy makes his job that much more difficult.  Sellers also plays the President of the United States, a calm, but fairly uninformed fellow who relies on his strategists in the War Room to work out this crisis.  In the War Room is Sellers' third role and the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German scientist with an alien hand that has a mind of its own.  Joining him in the War Room is George C. Scott, who plays another top military official who is trying to talk some sense into the President while spouting his anti-Russian sentiments.  To throw yet another wrench into the mix, we have an airplane carrying a nuclear bomb that has no radio contact and is ready to drop the second they reach their target.<br/><br/>The film itself is excellent  the script is biting, very sarcastic and disdainful of politics.  It is no surprise that the names of characters are such like 'Jack D. Ripper'.  The shining trait of this film is definitely the acting  while we naturally come to expect that Peter Sellers is going to frighteningly good in just about anything he is in, I was most surprised and delighted to find myself in tars laughing over none other than George C. Scott's performance.  My friends and I watched this film as one of our `film club' selections, and I think we watched the scene when his mistress calls him in the War Room at least three times.  As someone who has only experienced Scott in such films as Patton and The Changeling, this was a hilarious change for me.<br/><br/>Dr. Strangelove immediately became one of my favorite Kubrick films with only one viewing, and I think that the visionary approach and the unabashed social commentary in the face of the Cold War is what put it there.  Make no mistake, this is not a war film- this is an anti-war film.  Dr. Strangelove is definitely a must-see for any Kubrick fan and film lover alike. <br/><br/>

"andyp1986","7","0","2","7 August 2003"," Funny, but a bit of a bore....
","A film that has made history. A relentless spoof of the cold war, and a unique story with memorable characters. The presence of Peter Sellers and Stanley Kubrick, and what each has done for this movie, and of course the satire and hilarious scenes combine to make this a comedy classic and an ""essential"" on any critic's list.<br/><br/>But seriously, in that respect the film's a bit of a letdown. It's not nearly as outrageous and entertaining as one might expect. It seems overly hyped. Sure it's satirical, sure its message comes across, and sure it does have its truly wonderful moments, but it just doesn't seem to be the ""comedy gold"" it's made out to be and very well could have been. Maybe the fact that I've only watched it twice has to do with this response, but the film seems to swallow itself up in its war theme. At times it concentrates more on the theme itself than the satirical treatment it's supposed to deliver.<br/><br/>As the film starts, we learn that General Ripper has ordered an air attack of Russia, exceding his authority and has sealed himself off at his base with his aide Captain Mandrake. The real aggravation though is that we are given the same facts several times in 3 or 4 different scenes. We learn the same stuff for a while just from different points of view making for a very dull, slow start, and there's little indication of humor.<br/><br/>
It does eventually pick up and move on to some excellent scenes that make the movie a classic, but they lose their strength as they are usually in between slow, overlong scenes with little humor. The scenes in the war room tend to drag, and the scenes with Slim Pickens and his crew (with the exception of the survival equipment scene) are painfully dull. General Ripper's theory behind flouridation and the contamination of our ""bodily fluids"" are fun at first, but they get old fast and are overused. So all these things simply flow through several intercut scenes as the U.S fights back, and tries to find the code to call back the planes and prevent the attack on the Russians, we learn about a Doomsday machines, and the silly ex-Nazi character Dr. Strangelove is introduced all leading up to a long-winded, bizarre, and sudden ending. It just doesn't seem to live up to its reputation as a hilarious comedy, sire it's funny, but it's not as funny as it could've been and is just too serious at times making it somewhat boring and hard to sit through. Perhaps it just takes a few more viewings?<br/><br/>
On the other hand, it certainly has its moments, and it does provide occasional laughs. The scene with the President on the phone with the presumably drunk Russian official is a highlight of the film, and Peter Sellers somehow manages to lighten up and hold together nearly every scene he's involved in. He delivers such classic lines as ""The string in my leg is gone"" and ""Gentlemen you can't fight in here...this is the war room"". And his performance as Strangelove practically sets standards for movies. Among other favorite scenes are the survival equipment scene (perhaps the only scene involving the air crew that's actually funny), the scene involving the Coca Cola machine (""You know what'll happen if you can't reach the president....you'll have to answer to the Coca Cola company""), and when Strangelove is explaining his plans while trying to control his gloved hand. These are scenes that got the movie where it is, and are well worthwhile.<br/><br/>But I honestly believe that Kubrick and Sellers have done better. This movie isn't nearly as satirical or consistently funny as a Mel Brooks comedy, but on the other hand, it is more intelligent, and it certainly is a classic. So overall, it's a worthwhile film, but don't expect your sides to be aching."

","Dr. Strangelove is a political satire of the cold war between Russia and the United States of America, which was made in 1964. The fact that it was made during the Cold War and not after it makes this film not only very special, but also daring in my opinion. The film itself is full of top secret information, suspicions people and anti communist attitudes which somehow remind me of James Bond themes from the Cold War era. But contrary to James Bond films these things are exaggerated and turned slightly comic, without making this film too strange and surreal. This is due to the fact that not only the communist Ruskies are depicted in a bad way, but so are the Americans, who (in some cases) seem to be war hungry, patriotic rednecks with dung for brains. In all of the confusion that springs from the failing of a  failsafe plan, there is also one ingredient which could not be missed in any film concerned with the Cold War. I'm talking about the German ingredient, in this case Dr. Stragelove, a German scientist, who turned American after World War II. This character is in my opinion the greatest character of the entire film and he is one of the reasons this film is still good almost 40 years after it was first released. Just watch the last 10 minutes of the film and you will know what I mean. The ending of the film, from the first dropping bomb to Dr. Strangelove, is truly funny and in my opinion a classic moment in movie making . In a way though, the entire film is a classic moment in movie making, because ultimately the film and the mishaps depicted, are of all times and Kubrick realized it just as you will (just listen to the words in the final song played).<br/><br/>

"Eagle2","Null","0","2","4 April 1999"," Good film, but cannot match the hype
","Dr. Strangelove has developed a strong cult following, which supposedly establishes it as a must-see cultural icon.  The problem is, the film isn't as great as its reputation might suggest.<br/><br/>The primary flaw is its attempt to play as both a comedy and a drama about a serious subject.  By attempting to do both, it does neither.  The comical bits simply aren't (""You can't fight in here -- this is the war room"" is just plain corny).<br/><br/>As someone who lived through the cold war, I can certainly appreciate the gravity of nuclear destruction.  However, Dr. Strangelove, unlike other anti-nuclear films (""The Day After"" and ""On the Beach"" come readily to mind) is not even remotely based in fact.  While there was and is always the danger of a madcap general launching a nuclear strike on his own authority, the inability to recall the planes is absurd.<br/><br/>Finally, it is worth noting that although Peter Sellers gets top billing, it is George C. Scott that steals the show hands down. Sellers plays his three characters well, as one would expect, but none of the three (including the limp-noodle president) play central roles in the overall story.  The Group Captain role is merely a foil to the crazed general, and Dr. Strangelove himself is a one-dimensional character without whom the film would be scarcely different.  As for the president, the least-inspiring yet most dominant of the three roles, he acts merely as a straight undeveloped figure who is a clearinghouse for the various proposals for action or inaction. While the acting is good, Sellers spreads himself too thin and might have been served better had he played only one part.<br/><br/>The movie is a part of the culture, and is worth seeing.  However, it is dated, inaccurate and over-hyped.  The production values are good, as are the dramatic / suspenseful elements, but, based largely on its overblown reputation, an overall disappointment."
"Eric-62","Null","0","1","14 March 1999"," Brilliant Satire But Dated Message
","First off, I'm not going to dispute the point that Peter Sellers establishes himself as the last great comic genius there ever was in this film.  He is brilliant.  The satirical thrust is brilliant.  From a technical standpoint, Strangelove is a great film.<br/><br/>Someday though, someone is going to ask that a reality check be taken for those who keep insisting that Strangelove is ""timeless"" or is still dead-on in it's message today.  Because in the long run of history, Strangelove's underlying philosophy is as laughably dated as the ""Duck And Cover"" civil defense films it effectively satirizes.  America kept building its nuclear arsenal, and guess what?  We didn't blow each other up over a foolish misunderstanding.  The Soviet Union in fact, folded up and collapsed when they realized they couldn't keep up with the demands of an arms race.  In short, the system that Strangelove lambastes, worked.<br/><br/>Strangelove is more fascinating as an eerie foreshadowing of the destruction in Cold War consensus that took place in American society in the late 1960s, for it is a film that is ultimately pushing the odious concept of ""moral equivalence"" that the collapse of Communism proved was a silly idea to begin with.  A brilliant film Strangelove is, but timeless it isn't.  The laughs it generates in me, when they aren't caused by Peter Sellers, are caused more by how unintentionally silly its philosophy is in the post-Cold War world."

Sellers is so good in this movie it's unbelievable, not only does he deliver one good performance but three (count 'um) three.

","Personally, when I think of Kubrick's masterful talents, I think ""A Clockwork Orange.""

But in a second viewing, I was able to better understand the humor and get some laughs.  I still admit, this isn't a comedy classic--and on IMDB a comment like that happens to be grounds for tons of hate mail--but it has some memorable moments.  Slim Pickens ejected from the plane attached to a missile is definitely a visual to be remembered.  However, I couldn't really indulge the humor of Dr. Strangelove himself.  I haven't checked out any of Peter Sellers' previous work, but watching this movie it's hard to laugh at all his jokes, because quite frankly he has this rambling voice attached to a moderately heavy English accent.  As Colonel Mandrake, I had a hard-enough time understanding him, and it was almost impossible as Strangelove--with his ultra-heavy, though noticeably fake, Russian accent.  The actor I actually commend the most is George C. Scott, who brings out enough humor with a simple facial expression.  I have never seen him do comedy before, and he's quite good. You can say that he overacted in some scenes, but for the right purposes. <br/><br/>
This movie was released in 1963, so I'm pretty sure people who were around back then were able to fully indulge the whole satire.  Yes, it's a bit of a dated comedy.  So excuse me if I didn't think this movie was entirely hilarious; I wasn't born until 1982.  I definitely can't say this is the most visually stunning Kubrick piece.  Most of the scenes are either indoors or cheesy-looking exterior shots of planes flying above mountains.  Of course, I can basically excuse the low quality--filmmakers didn't exactly have massive budgets back in those days--but living in modern times I'm acquainted with more realistic imagery.  But I do have to say the scenes are well-lit.  <br/><br/>Please keep in mind that I DID think this movie was funny!  My mailbox always gets full of protesters' comments whenever I give a ""comedy classic"" a less-than-brilliant review.  I'm sure a 60-year-old man won't grasp the humor of ""American Pie"" and you have to think of it in the same terms as an 18-year-old watching ""Dr. Strangelove.""  <br/><br/>I'm a huge Kubrick fan, but I appreciate his more recent work better.  I guess it's because I love his sense of color and using it as symbolism--and obviously you won't be spotting things of that nature in this movie...LOL.

","""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" might prove that Stanley Kubrick is in fact the greatest director of all time. That's not to say ""Dr. Strangelove"" alone is his best work -- only that it proves a range of direction that has never been matched.<br/><br/>So many other directors are acclaimed for their ability to define a genre -- John Frankenheimer paved the road of action films; Billy Wilder was the king of comedy; and Alfred Hitchcock is of course the master of suspense.<br/><br/>But Kubrick arguably made significant contributions into each of these genres -- all while tackling forbidden subjects. You want action? Try ""Full Metal Jacket."" You want horror? Try ""The Shining."" You want science fiction? Try ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" You want crime? Try ""The Killing.""<br/><br/>You want comedy?<br/><br/>""Dr. Strangelove"" is Kubrick's genius at work in a dark comedy. The movie laughingly shows the dangers of a nuclear holocaust when an insane general begins an unwarranted attack on communist Russia. Meanwhile, the U.S. president and other politicians try to figure out a way to avoid the earth's destruction.<br/><br/>Without taking anything away from Kubrick, it should be noted he has some help with ""Dr. Strangelove."" -- namely, Peter Sellers (""The Pink Panther""), who takes on three roles in the film, including the wacky title character, the U.S. president and a captain trying to bring the insane general to reason. Sellers is remarkably funny in each role, without overlapping any techniques. His characters truly have their own identity, and it's easy to overlook that the same man is playing all three roles.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most surprising performance, however, comes from George C. Scott (""Patton"") as an egotistical general who is advising the president on the situation. Scott is hilarious -- there's no other word for it. His character is perfectly played: Although not entirely bright, the general is quite sure he is the smartest person in whatever room he's in. His lines are filled with stutters and uh's, as if he simply enjoys hearing his own voice even if he isn't sure what he is going to say.<br/><br/>But all acclaim for this film should rest with Kubrick, who also co-wrote the screenplay. His timing -- including the carefully timed camera shots of his actors -- is unmatched. The way each character enters the film is also superb.<br/><br/>Of course there is also a message being sent in his film. ""Dr. Strangelove"" was released at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The anti-war sentiment Kubrick captured so well in ""Full Metal Jacket"" is attacked by yet another angle -- absurdity.<br/><br/>And, as always, he had to slight his message to get it through. This time he used satire."
