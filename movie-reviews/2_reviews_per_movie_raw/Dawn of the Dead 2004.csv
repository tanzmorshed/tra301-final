","Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.<br/><br/>This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"johnsigwald","10","333","441","20 March 2004"," Why I gave Dawn a 10 (well, maybe it should have been a9).
","I've been to thousands of movies in my lifetime and own hundreds of videos and DVDs, so I am a fan but not a bona fide film critic.  This is my first online review.<br/><br/>My wife and I saw the original Dawn of the Dead 25 years ago at a midnight show and left wired enough to talk each other down till the morning. Perhaps a quarter of a century has inured us to the violence a bit since we just watched it again (rental video) last week prior to yesterday's venture to the local multiplex to see the remake/""reimagining"" and were mostly unperturbed by the revisit.<br/><br/>For some reason, I was hooked on the new Dawn months ago from the teaser and, subsequently, the actual trailer.  The Sparklehorse song in the former fit perfectly and the suburban shot followed by killer Vivian and closing with the burned projector film of the latter was intriguing in its own way. So I was primed to see the movie, usually a recipe for disaster since preview expectations are rarely fulfilled by the finished product.  This time, however, they were.<br/><br/>The cast was uniformly believable and, more important, empathizable (at least with the good guys who got sorted out along the way).  Even the playboy jerk had several relevant lines.  Polley was a good, strong female lead (with another great rebuttal -- ""No, I'm a * nurse"" to a query about her medical skills) and Rhames a cheerable, if reluctant, hero.  The camaraderie, such as it was, worked, and visceral me-first survival gave way more often to self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>So, what's not to like?  The fundamental premise that a classic got remade? Doesn't wash.  These are two different movies with the same name and similar premises but very different attitudes.  (Better special effects didn't hurt, either, although this new version was oddly less disturbing sans zombies munching on dismembered body parts.)  Speedy zombies (except for the ""twitchers"")?  No problem; hey, they're hungry and, as always, persistent. My attention was held for the better part of two hours; the story was interesting; the outcome ambivalent; the characters arisen to the task at hand, becoming coldly rational to the divisions between life and death and zombiedom; the music weirdly appropriate; the black humor welcome respite. No, Dawn of the Dead isn't Citizen Kane nor is it a sacrilegious assault on the horror genre.  It's solid filmmaking that's entertaining and thought-provoking.  Otherwise, I suspect Romero would never have put his imprimatur on the remake."
"Senor-Spielbergo","10","330","446","29 March 2004"," At last, someone's got it right...
","If you haven't guessed already, I can't sing the praises of this movie enough - at last, a zombie flick that is two very important things.<br/><br/>1) Not a B-Movie; 2) An absolutely cracking A-Movie.<br/><br/>Having just got back from the cinema still amazed with the quality of this film I don't know where to begin. The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the ""Paul Verhovenesque"" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.<br/><br/>What is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, ""Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds"" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!<br/><br/>Her character is only clich√©d and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.<br/><br/>Since we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre, consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight, one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket, `I don't know why I'm bothering, I hate [rubbish] like this'. He was the one laughing the loudest and coming closest to vomiting throughout the film, and all of us came out saying, `how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..? Sarcastically - yes, but if it was nominated, it'd get my vote. The only thing that could have made it better was Steven Segal instead of Burt Reynolds but you can't have everything."
"elhombremagnifico","10","36","44","12 December 2008"," Best Zombie Flick Ever!
","I have to admit, the Zombie genre isn't my favourite, but Dawn of the Dead (2004) is a brilliant film for so many different reasons. In my view, it's the best zombie movie ever made.<br/><br/>The actors are likable, which makes you empathetic to their cause. You want them to succeed, you feel sorrow when things go bad. My main complaint with so many other zombie movies is I couldn't care less about the actors. Also, in Dawn of the Dead, the quality of acting is good, much better than most other films of it's type.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of action, but it doesn't detract from being a horror film. There's plenty of gore and quite frankly, the zombies scare the bejesus out of me (and I don't scare easily). I think one think I particularly like about this film is that the zombies are really nasty, fast, aggressive, in-your-face intimidating monsters who would really scare you in real life. I've just never been that keen with slow moving, sinister, but gormless, zombies. The zombies in Dawn of the Dead are truly terrifying.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is excellent too. It moves quickly from scene to scene but at a good pace and covers many different things which keeps the film as a whole interesting.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend this film enough. I really love it, and that's coming from a guy who's never been really in to zombie movies.<br/><br/>10/10."
"MattyGibbs","10","23","27","30 August 2014"," Brilliant Zombie horror
","Dawn of the Dead is one of the best Zombie films ever made. It combines a decent storyline, good acting, nice cinematography, good dialogue, good soundtrack and is genuinely scary. <br/><br/>From it's brilliant realised and scary opening, Dawn of the Dead holds you by the throat and doesn't let go. The action is pretty much non stop and at times it becomes unbearably tense. As well as a huge amount of gory scenes to keep bloodhounds satisfied it throws in a number of human interest sub plots as the survivors come to terms with their predicament. This stops this being just another one dimensional gore-fest. <br/><br/>What elevates it above most of is that it has characters are not only interesting but totally believable. All the cast do a good job in particular Michael Kelly as the power crazy CJ and Sarah Polley, Jake Webber and Ving Rhames as the main survivors. <br/><br/>This is an incredibly entertaining film packed full of memorable scenes. Most films are let down by their ending but this one is highly satisfactory if a little bleak. Anyone that likes Zombie movies is almost certain to like it. In my opinion it is pretty much the perfect Zombie movie. Highly recommended."
"BrandtSponseller","10","157","213","18 February 2005"," As good as the original, with exciting new directions and room for a sequel!
","Shortly after a number of strange cases begin to appear at the hospital where Ana (Sarah Polley) works, a bizarre zombie ""epidemic"" hits the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area full force. Sarah escapes her immediate threats and meets a number of other humans who decide to seek shelter inside a large shopping mall. As they learn that the zombie outbreak is much more widespread than anyone could have imagined, their chances of survival grow increasingly dim.<br/><br/>I know an awful lot of genre fans rail against remakes, but like the update of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), this version of Dawn of the Dead is so good that we should instead be clamoring for more.<br/><br/>Writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder knew that they had to come into the remake with both barrels blasting. Hardly five minutes into the film we're already into hardcore, high tension, gore-filled horror material. In lesser films, our introduction to full-fledged zombie activity would have been dream material as a kind of teaser. Gunn and Snyder dispense with such weak-willed tactics and immediately launch into Armageddon. We quickly move to a wide shot of explosions, brutal car crashes and other mayhem.<br/><br/>We do finally get a breather while we're learning our cast of characters at the mall in nicely written scenes that bring out personality and depth to the relatively large cast, but horror fanatics need not fret that the film will evolve into a drama--tension and gore are never far removed from the film.<br/><br/>Gunn and Snyder earn credit for both paying homage to their source material and taking off into other interesting directions. This remake is just as intense and titillating as Romeo's original, but with a different spin.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, the cinematography and editing exciting and innovative, and the makeup and ""creature"" effects are top notch.<br/><br/>Even though I've seen greater quantities, the DVD for Dawn of the Dead also has some of the best extras I've seen on a disc in terms of quality. You get two excellent short films that effectively extend the feature. In one, a new character from the remake, Andy (Bruce Bohne), who runs a gun shop across the street from the mall, gives us a 15-minute video diary of his last 15 days. It's similar in some ways to the feel of The Blair Witch Project (1999), but for my money, it's much better than that film. In the other, we get a 30-minute condensation of the news broadcasts following the outbreak of the zombie ""epidemic"". This also easily beats any mock horror documentary (such as The Last Broadcast (1998)) with its hands tied behind its back. Make sure you at least rent the DVD to check out these extras."
"bryandeth316","9","173","238","19 October 2004"," In a world of bad remakes, this wasn't bad.
","I went into this movie completely excited. And I wasn't even really disappointed either. The acting was very good, and I actually loved how they didn't follow the exact storyline. They took the basics of the original Dawn of the Dead and made it more contemporary. I knew they wouldn't be filming the movie at Monroeville Mall (the mall just 15 minutes outside of Pittsburgh where they filmed the original) but it was still awesome none the less. <br/><br/>The script worked rather well, and the movie flowed nicely also. Granted I wasn't a huge fan of the fast moving zombies, but I suppose I can let that go because truthfully, maybe before rigor mortis sets in, you'd be able to move quickly, who knows? But I do know that I was on the edge of my seat through many parts of the movie, and you start to really care about the characters in the movie. I am anxiously waiting for 1 week to pass so that I can get my copy of Dawn. I already have it pre purchased.<br/><br/>8/10 rating. <br/><br/>The movie missed a perfect 10 for the simple fact that zombies SHOULD NOT run that fast."
"jguz58","9","213","303","22 November 2004"," Get the unrated director's cut!!!
","I reviewed this film back in March 2004, and said, ""Wow! I just got home from seeing dotd-2004 and can't wait to add it to my collection."" Well, I just added it - the Unrated Director's Cut in widescreen edition. After watching it this weekend, I just had to add a footnote about this version of the film. <br/><br/>IT MAKES A GREAT FILM EVEN BETTER.<br/><br/>Comments from other reviewers have sometimes made reference to a lack of character development in the film. The UDC version restores this kind of content, and is one way that the UDC version improves on the theatrical release. I see better character development in this version of dotd-2004 then in the (1978) original version of Dawn.<br/><br/>The other improvement the UDC version makes is to restore some really excellent gore shots. If you're into that thing, of course. And if you're not - well of course you're into it - that's why you're checking out this film!"
"Cube_TX","7","130","183","20 March 2004"," Action rather than horror, but worthy remake
","As a HUGE fan of the original Dawn of the Dead I was very skeptical of this remake.  I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning blockbuster or anything, but I did want to see the remake do the original justice.  I was impressed with the filming more than anything.  This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy, hand-held camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTV-generation style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.  I could imagine the two movies co-existing, but in different parts of the world.<br/><br/>One of the key differences that I did like was the idea of the zombies running.  This made them come across as more menacing rather than being the slow clunkers that are seen in the original trilogy.  The idea of being able to walk right past them was abandoned.  I also feel that the movie did a good job of showing how quickly people would turn on one another and watch out for themselves only.<br/><br/>One of my favorite ""realisms"" of the movie is how the characters are too attached to their loved ones to shot them when they become zombies.  I'm certain that many of us would react in the same manner if something like this were to actually happen (yes, I know it's impossible).  Also, it was interesting to have so many people make it to the mall instead of only four as in the original.  Of course some of these characters fit the generic stereotype of a movie such as this, but I'm not surprised considering modern audiences would need such characters to maintain their interest.  This was a movie made for film viewers, not film makers.  We have the strong and silent male hero, the quick-thinking blond heroine, the official dumb jerk, the official slut, the young and naive girl who loses everything and needs the group's protection, the angry challenger for group leadership who has a change of heart and becomes heroic, the young trainee who disagrees with the angry challenger yet follows due to a sense of duty, and the stupid follower who gets his comeuppence.<br/><br/>One aspect that was missing from this remake was the original movie's social commentary on the commercialism of people.  Ken Foree's character of Peter mentioned this in the original whereas Ving Rhames' Kenneth was more of a silent action hero never having much to say.  This was another reason that I saw this as a simple action movie -- though I will say that Rhames has more acting ability than Governor Schwarzenegger, Sly, Seagal and Van Damme combined.  Rhames also LOOKS like an action hero rather than today's prettyboy ""action heroes"" such as Tom Cruise, Ben Affleck, Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves -- who all look like they couldn't fight their way out of a cooking class for senior citizens.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was not better than the original and won't be nominated for any Academy Awards, but if you're looking for entertainment and can stomach the blood it's worth checking out.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD someday."

","How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?<br/><br/>`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.<br/><br/>Seeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on clich√© themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.<br/><br/>As Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.<br/><br/>Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.<br/><br/>First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.<br/><br/>The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.<br/><br/>All to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'<br/><br/>However, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.<br/><br/>It's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.<br/><br/>`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.<br/><br/>Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires."
"gogoschka-1","8","10","11","11 May 2020"," A Non-Stop Thrill Ride With Pitch-Black Humor, A Great Cast And Excellent Makeup Effects
","I'm a Romero nut (for those among you who don't know the name George A. Romero: that was the genius writer/director who single-handedly created the modern zombie film and who also wrote and directed the original 'Dawn of the Dead' in '78), so you may believe me when I say I wasn't impressed when I heard there would be a remake of the zombie maestro's famed horror classic. Truth be told, I was absolutely determined to hate this new film when it came out - but boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise!<br/><br/>As it turned out, Zack Snyder's remake isn't just a re-hash of Romero's film but offers a very different take on the material and deserves to be recognized based on its own merits as one of the most entertaining entries in the particular horror sub-genre that is the zombie film. The James Gunn script is hilariously funny throughout - in a pitch black kind of way - and there is simply not a dull moment in it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the cast consists of great character actors who are totally game (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell among others); the gore effects are insane and the zombie makeup is the best pre-'Walking Dead' in any zombie movie by far. I'm inclined to believe that had this film been made by a less divisive director than Snyder, it would have since gone on to be regarded a B-movie horror classic for the ages.<br/><br/>It's true that the scathing social commentary which elevated the original ""Dead Trilogy"" above simple gore-fests is largely absent from the remake, but I don't see this as a flaw in the new film. The political subtext in Romero's films was effective in part because it was so subversive at the time; a remake repeating those same beats more than two decades later simply wouldn't have the same impact (which Romero himself actually went on to prove with his far from bad but oddly dated ""New Dead trilogy"" consisting of 'Land of the Dead' (2005), 'Diary of the Dead' (2007) and 'Survival of the Dead' (2009) ).<br/><br/>What 'Dawn of the Dead (2004) does brilliantly instead is focus on the characters. Every single player in the remake is fun to watch; even the supporting characters are colorful and more than ""one-note"" and have their own arcs. I would also like to point out that while Gunn's script is lighter on social commentary than Romero's, it's far from dumb, and the story beats are interesting and unpredictable enough to keep you invested throughout.<br/><br/>To sum it all up: While I love Romero's film for its clever subtext and critique of consumerism, its impact on the horror genre and its entertainment value, I love Snyder's version for the pitch black humor, the great cast as well as the pure spectacle and non-stop thrill-ride it provides. As far as action-horror films go, it actually doesn't get much better than this: Dawn Of The Dead '04 is simply an A+ genre flick that deserves to get more recognition.<br/><br/>About this review: tastes in film obviously vary greatly, so if you want to get a better reference if mine generally aligns somewhat with yours, I created a list of my 50 favorite films on my imdb page which should leave you in no doubt about what kind of stuff I'm into (just click on my name if you're interested)."

","Returning from a busy day in the hospital, Ana spends time with her husband when a neighbours daughter comes into the house and attacks her husband. He dies before returning to life and attacking Ana. She runs and escapes in her car, driving through a neighbourhood rife with violence and fires.  After crashing her car, she hooks up with a group of armed survivors who take refuge in a mall.  The group settle in and fortify their position as an army of the undead gather outside.<br/><br/>Before I start my review, let me just say that this will be biased as I am always easily won over by zombie movies.  The fact that they just keep coming (fast or slow), lack character and only want to kill really just freaks me out.  So I tend to get easily scared by the genre (even if `enjoy' is perhaps not the right word) and be easily more negligent towards their faults.  Despite telling myself that I wouldn't bother with this film as it would scare me, I went for it anyway in a fit of `confront your fears' type of stupidity!  The film starts with a creepy opening and pretty much manages to keep the pace up for the whole film.  It, like the zombies, moves fast and brutally throughout and is very, very tense.<br/><br/>Others have complained about the lack of gore - however I found the graphic exploding heads to do that more than enough for my tastes!  Better than gore is the atmosphere.  The use of news footage is not original but it succeeds (along with the aerial view of the town) in creating the impression of a world turning to sh*t.  I don't know about you but this scares me and the film did it well.  The speed of the zombie attacks makes for a thrilling ride and it did make me very tense - Snyder managed to make the whole film a threat (especially for a first time director) and I honestly have a very stiff neck a day after seeing this simply because my body was tensed up for the whole film!<br/><br/>The pace of the film also serves to cover the real problems in content and plot.  Unlike the original there is no satirical swipe on consumerism - the fact that the zombies are just wandering aimlessly around the mall like they used to in life is pretty much ignored here - but times are very different now I guess.  The plot itself also has quite a few stupid moments where the characters act in a way you know they wouldn't in real life.  For example people go on suicide missions for little real reasons and you can tell that the script is just doing it to create more action.  However, when you are into it, these things don't really seem to matter.  The film may be a little silly when you think about it but it does have a good ending - downbeat and realistic (or at least as realistic as it can be!) and left me with no hope of a happy ending - in this regard it is everything that `28 Days Later..' is not.<br/><br/>The cast is good even if the script places their characters secondary to the action.  Polley is used to slightly more substantial roles but still does well here.  Rhames is lumbered with a religious background that is never explained, but he is a great presence throughout.  Weber is the standout role however.  His character is a slightly less cartoon version of Evil Dead's Ash.  He is the unwilling hero but yet he seems to accept all the obstacles he comes across.  He also manages to be one of the group that the audience cares about - most of them are fodder and we know it!  Phifer is a good actor but seemed too `gangster' to really be driven to this degree by his family.  The rest of the support cast are mostly just there to get eaten but they do OK.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a great film - but it is an effective one.  As a film it lacks subtext, comment and plot logic. However as a thriller it is fast paced, gripping and tense with a satisfyingly bleak conclusion.  Snyder does a good job as a first timer and creates an atmosphere that is gripping even if it lacks originality.  Like I said, I don't deal with zombie movies very well and am easily scared but I reckon that this should satisfy many a Saturday night thrill-seeking crowd even if it does nothing for your brain apart from it's risk getting eaten."

","***********Spoilers Within********** When I first hear they were remaking Dawn Of The Dead, I imagined it would turn out much like any number of movies that should have never been remade. I swore up and down never to see it, and when it actually got better than average reviews, and was #1 at the box office for a few weeks, I simply thought ""well, there must not be anything else better playing"".<br/><br/>Usually when I watch a crappy movie, I turn to someone in the room and say ""wow, I could have made a better movie than that"" (yeah, I'm THAT guy). However, after a friend of mine brought Dawn Of The Dead over, I said ""If I was going to make this movie, that's exactly how I would have done it"".<br/><br/>The remake of DOTD is probably one of the best horror movies I have seen. It has enough blood and guts to satisfy the gore freaks, but not too much to offend the casual viewer. I also really liked the (intentional) humor throughout the film. What really surprised me is that unlike most horror movies, you really get to know and care about the characters (most of them at least). You cheer when some of them die and frown when others stay alive.<br/><br/>In most movies, the characters are quite two dimensional, and you can generally pick out from the first five minutes which ones will live and which ones will die. With this movie, villains become heroes and heroes become villains. I wanted so badly for the character of CJ to die, but by the end of the movie, I was sad to see him go.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a wonderful remake, and I hope remakes of other movies are just as good as this one."

","Dawn of the Dead starts just like any other ordinary day for nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) as she goes home after another long shift, she & her husband Luis (Justin Louis) go to bed & have a good nights sleep. The next morning Luis is woken by Vivian (Hannah Lochner), their next door neighbours young girl, who proceeds to bite Luis on the neck. Ana manages to push Vivian out of the room & locks the door, Luis dies in front of her but suddenly comes back to life & attacks Ana in the same frenzied way Vivian attacked him. Ana climbs out of the bathroom window & sees complete pandemonium outside as the dead are returning to life & attacking the living, Ana gets into her car & speeds off but ends up crashing. She is found by a cop named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who in turn find a guy named Michael (Jake Weber) along with Andre (Mekhi Phifer) & his pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina) who all decide to head to the local shopping mall to find safety. They break in & watch in horror as the streets outside become overrun by flesh eating zombies while the TV news broadcasts offer little hope, if any...<br/><br/>Directed by first timer Zack Snyder Dawn of the Dead was apparently described as a 'reimagining' of George A. Romero's utterly brilliant Dawn of the Dead (1978) which itself was a sequel to his groundbreaking Night of the Living Dead (1968) which already has already been remade so I guess Dawn of the Dead was next in line & I personally think the result is less than inspiring. There are two versions available, the theatrical cut & a longer director's cut, unfortunately I watched the shorter theatrical version because that's the one they showed on TV even though I have the director's cut on DVD but just hadn't got round to watching it before it aired on TV, I wish I had because I don't really feel like watching it again despite the promise of some extra gore but I suppose that's irrelevant... The script by James Gunn is actually quite different from the original except the title & the fact that some of it is set in a shopping mall, I think that almost everything that made the '78 original so brilliant is lost or diluted here. The start of the film is completely different & in my opinion the best part of this 'reimagining' as it's rather effective & well built up, once the film gets to the mall not that much actually happens to be honest as straight away it's empty with only two zombies inside, there's no running around shooting zombies, there's no hiding out, there's no locking or blocking the doors off, there's no raid by the bikers & it all seems rather stale, static & predictable. Then there's the character's, there's just too many of them & there's no real connection between them unlike the original which had a tight group of four close friends this time around they are a bunch of unlikeable underdeveloped clich√©s like the self serving yuppie, the 'strong' female, the big cop, the middle class hero & the antagonistic redneck. I was also disappointed with the lack of social satire, unlike Romero's original which had meaning this is a shallow film where the mall is used as a place to hide & nothing more. When Dawn of the Dead '04 does do something different like the zombie baby or the fact the zombies actually run it goes nowhere & they seem like afterthoughts just for the hell of it. Having said that Dawn of the Dead '04 is far from a bad film, it moves along at nice pace, it has some decent if unspectacular set-pieces & action scenes, I must admit I really liked the ending with the video taped footage during the closing credits, it's very sleek & it certainly passes 100 odd minutes entertainingly enough but it had an almost impossible task to better the original which it most definitely doesn't in any way.<br/><br/>Director Snyder does OK & there's plenty of homages to the original including cameo's from Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger & the ever watchable Tom Savini along with the BP trucks from the original turning up as does the WGON traffic helicopter also from the original. Gore wise I thought Dawn of the Dead '04 was very disappointing, there's no big gore scenes unlike the original, there's nothing in here to rival the screwdriver in the ear or the zombie having the top of his head sliced off by helicopter blades or zombies having machetes shoved into their faces or the gruesome cannibalistic scenes at the end. All this new version has to offer are better looking zombies, some gunshot wounds to the head, a spike through a zombies head, a poker through a zombies eye & after that I'm actually struggling, there's nothing here that memorable that will have people talking unlike Dawn of the Dead '78.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Dawn of the Dead '04 obviously is better made than the original with that big budget Hollywood polish about it, it's well made & has good special effects. Apparently the budget for Dawn of the Dead '04 was 'significantly slashed' by Universal after the critical & commercial failure of House of the Dead (2003). The acting is forgettable, I must admit I disliked most of the character's in this.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is a perfectly watchable & entertaining horror film that is certainly worth a watch but I think it pales into insignificance when compared to Dawn of the Dead '78, it seems to have a good reputation but it just didn't for much for me. However if you like shallow story lines, poor character's & no stand out set-pieces then you too might like it. Good but not brilliant & overall pretty disappointing."

","The Dawn of the Dead remake would have to be one of my favorite remakes because it is very chaotic, I love the carnage and the film's premises lie on disturbance.<br/><br/>At many moments I found the film very, very disturbing. Zack Synder had really put a lot of effort into the remake. his remake also starts off on some happy little slope and then when we see the girl who's a zombie, then we all know that it's gonna get better from there.<br/><br/>I like how Zack keeps the film's plot on the exact same story line where there are many survivors trapped in a Mall and that there are Zombies trying to get in. It was great to see that the elements of this great adaptation can be compared to George A. Romero's classic so well.<br/><br/>I also like how there were more survivors this time round and it was excellent to see that we could all see what each survivor was going through. Some where determined to get out of this mess, some where stubborn and one was just an idiot. But it was great to have a variety of smart and dumb-witted characters.<br/><br/>There were also many sad moments in this film that really left me disturbed and I'm not going to spoil it.<br/><br/>Overall it doesn't fall short off of Romero's Classic Dawn of the Dead, having a chaotic situation, fast zombies, different varieties of characteristics & tones of weapons. It is my second favorite Remake and anyone who hasn't seen it yet, see it... 8/10"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","10","13","20","29 April 2004"," Absolutely STUNNING remake!
","I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.<br/><br/>While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.<br/><br/>Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.<br/><br/>I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.<br/><br/>First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.<br/><br/>DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.<br/><br/>The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardises the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.<br/><br/>There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them 'in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.<br/><br/>Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the 'fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say 'crikey!' Yes, the 'turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.<br/><br/>I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.<br/><br/>This new Directors Cut DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.<br/><br/>Filmed in Super-35 the DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman, The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed, Special Bulletin: We Interrupt This Program!-complete news coverage of the attacks, deleted scenes, Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads."

"MovieAddict2016","Null","19","34","5 September 2004"," OK remake if you're in the mood for a brainless action picture -- but little else.
","The 2004 Dawn of the Dead is sort of a poor man's version of the 1978 original by George A. Romero, which isn't to say it doesn't deliver the goods in terms of gore, but it has little going on upstairs. It's the equivalent of choosing Paycheck over Total Recall ¬ñ both films are based on short stories by late sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, but only the latter of the two movies actually amounted to anything memorable and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Then again, I'm in a minority when it comes to the first Dawn ¬ñ although I liked it enough to purchase the DVD, I didn't love it, and felt a lot of it was silly and not very funny at all. Many critics call it an attack on consumer America (zombies flocking to the mall = us), and while I admire the message and the obvious passion behind Romero's project, I've always admired Night of the Living Dead (1968) ¬ñ the first installment in the original 'Dead Trilogy' ¬ñ the best, and think its allegories about racism are even more subtle than the consumer attack in Dead (which is about as blunt as being hit over the head with a hammer).<br/><br/>The remake of Dead boasts a better cast but a lot of the dialogue is just as stiff as its predecessor. Also, it often stoops down to the level of sheer stupidity ¬ñ for instance, when one of the film's characters, stuck in a mall surrounded by zombies, decides to make a mad dash across a street (flooded with the undead) in order to rescue a trapped¬Ödog? This makes those 'Don't go in the basement!' moments in other horror films look like brilliant ideas.<br/><br/>The zombies in this re-imagining of Romero's tale are faster than the slow-walking numbskulls in the original, which begs the question: If they can run as fast as a car, how come they can't manage to outrun humans carrying heavy weapons, and can't manage to figure out how to break into a mall, when all the humans did was throw a toilet seat through a window? And how come, if they're so strong, the scrawny female heroine can manage to fend one off and shoot it on the head? And yet Ving Rhames can't manage to win a fist-fight with one? Please.<br/><br/>IBrains are not required for this film. At all. For that reason it is a solid 'mindless action blockbuster' ¬ñ but don't expect anything substantial. You could have the IQ of a zombie and still enjoy this.<br/><br/>Yes, I was entertained by this movie, and that's why I recommend it as a well-made action flick, but I don't feel the need to see it again anytime soon, whereas the inferiority of this version has just made me appreciate the Romero version even more."
"poehlmann","1","33","68","10 April 2004"," Yawnfest cannot compare to original
","I saw this movie after - and only after - I had been assured that it compared favorably to the original.  I'll never be able to trust those people again.  This is another ""horror"" film that isn't scary, isn't original in any way, and doesn't have any particular redeeming value whatsoever.  It's shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot, and the story suffers in the same way - there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.  What we do have here is essentially the video game version of the original.  Retained are the shoot-em-up scenes of zombie butchery, but gone are the elements of humor and humanity that made the original so original in the first place.  The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable.  It's a one note movie and that note is one that really ought to leave it's audience feeling disgusted at the end - not because of the gore, but because of the utter waste of time we have been subjected to."

"Buddy-51","7","16","30","12 March 2005"," pretty good though not up to the original
","""Dawn of the Dead"" is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."" This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.<br/><br/>The original, in addition to being a horror film, was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society. This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straight-ahead horror approach. It may seem impossible for someone to actually ""dumb down"" a horror film, but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here. For this reason, the most famous and imaginative images from the first film - that of the undead wandering through the mall, vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein, just as they did in their previous lives - are nowhere to be found in this edition. The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing. Although, theoretically, this should increase their terror potential, it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn't rise to the level of the original. There's a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film, and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre. There's even a very subtle homage to the great ""Carnival of Souls,"" the far more gentle precursor to all these over-the-top zombie pictures, when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his ""calling"" as ""just a job."" Although the film isn't really all that scary, ""Dawn of the Dead"" provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado."
"jaynobody","9","10","17","19 March 2005"," Dawn of the Dead was great!

Most of the special effects are done the old fashioned way, and it shows.<br/><br/>This movie starts fast and doesn't let up. The cast is great, and it has characters you really care about. How often does that happen in horror movies today? Sarah Polly is great as the female lead, and Jake Weber is also great as the reluctant leader. Ving Rhames is tough as always, and every other cast member is very good.<br/><br/>This movie is a great end of the world film, capitalizing on post 9-11 fears and bring Romeros legendary epic into the 21st century. It also is one the most nihilistic movies to come out of Hollywood in some time. It was actually scary too. I look forward to seeing more work from director Zack Synder.<br/><br/>I own the directors unrated cut DVD which has some great extras, and some that are kind of cheesy too. The directors commentary is great, and I never like those things either.<br/><br/>My only regret is I did not know this movie was being filmed in Toronto, or I would have tried to get a job as an extra zombie."

","I've seen the original Dawn a billion times. I specifically remember renting it from MAJOR VIDEO in 1983. I was 8 years old. The shocking gore gave me nightmares. When I was 13, I bought my own VHS copy. AT 21 I got the laserdisc for Christmas-still have it. I eventually bought the many DVD incarnations...etc. My point is this: I KNOW((and really love)the zombie genre, and I was weary of this remake. Why remake perfection? Because the lame action movie ""28 days later""(whatever 14-year old girl was quoted as saying it was the scariest horror film since the EXORCIST was retarded) made money? I feared this remake would suck. Well, it does not suck. It is,in fact, one of the top zombie flix, ever. DOTD 04' is a frightening, post 9/11 re-think of the classic original. The zombies are scary, not to mention fast. The first 20 minutes pull you in, and the sharp direction, acting, script, and editing keep you on edge. This is potent fun, with moments of sharp humor; as well as a strong sense of apocalyptic paranoia. This well-worthy rethink of the original is a blast. George Romero should be proud."

These would be due to a few silly moments, typically stupid American stereotypes and lines, and couple of annoying characters - especially the young girl who comes in second half and messes everything up over a dog...<br/><br/>Ridiculous.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie could have went a totally different way had she just got thrown to the zombies!<br/><br/>Apart from that though, I do love this film.

Superb acting by everyone, incredible special effects, even better, sound, dynamic picture... I love it. Ving Rhames is the man as always.

I don't have to go over the plot, anyone who knows anything about movies knows the plot to dawn of the dead. 2 words... zombies. mall.

","I just got back from seeing this film, and I am so revolted by it. I've been a big fan of zombie flicks from the past, especially the romero and fulci flicks and this movie just saddens me. All I could think was rip off of 28 days later, and ruining of the original dawn of the dead. Heck, the movie starts in a hospital, leads into a dramatic loneliness seen, then the alarm clock imagery followed up by riot footage and a red on black title sequence so similar to 28 days later - oh and not to mention they sped up the film half way through, and of course magically all the zombies were fast paced atheletes - even a bloated obese woman, it made me feel bad knowing this movie was made in a america with a much more bloated budget than that of 28 days later, a movie that I feel made some steps forward in a genre that hasn't hardly been improved on since the early 80s. This movie also consists of a ton of plot holes and loose ends. Ridiculous. Absolutely. Now the group of friends I saw it with said it was OK as a gore film, but being a zombie fan and recognizing whats been done and why made this movie falter so badly. There's a million one-liners, some funny scares, a couple tributes to the classics (cameo by savini, head zombie, baby zombie, etc.), but it doesn't really do them any justice with the film as a whole. I say, if you're a zombie movie fan and you don't want to waste the eight bucks I just wasted, wait for it to come out on video, maybe there'll be a good movie in the special features on the dvd, who knows. But yeah, terribly unoriginal, and arrogant."

","George Romero's original ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a classic, hands down. It is a fine, thoughtful movie. The characters are carefully meshed out and developed over the course of the narrative, beyond that, Romero's dramatic decisions make sense, he only uses four main characters to propel his story. The remake, on the other hand (one can only hope that Romero made some money from this, which would be the only justification), is a stock 00s Hollywood product: utterly soulless and moronic from the first frame to the last. The characters are stereotypes and at times bizarre (armed security guards in a mall?), the action perfunctory and essentially pornographic in its lack of relation to the story itself. The screenwriter decides to toss in some smarmy, obnoxious characters straight out of a bad 1980s teen sex romp. Annoying, smart ass yuppie? Check. Hard ass rent a cop security guards/morons? Check. Useless characters who stand around for ten minutes acting surprised that the zombies that have been attacking them for the last few days are, in fact, attacking once again? Check. Characters are uniformly good shots (none of the tension in the first film from SWAT members vs. the macho but inexperienced helicopter pilot) able to adjust their aim and ""shoot 'em in the head"". In the first film the characters planned and executed schemes to the best of their abilities, in this one a bunch of idiots run around like headless chickens flailing about wildly from one ill conceived plan to another. Thank you again, Hollywood, for doing your part to spoil a movie for young movie goers who will now make no attempt to see the original, since this remake is so ""totally awesome 'cause like a zombie like gets totally stabbed in the head"". Its as if serious film goers have committed some grievous collective sin and are all being punished in some massive, communal private hell. At least Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini made a few bucks appearing in it."

"T850","1","31","68","20 February 2005"," was shaking my head through the entire film.
","I LOVE horror films. And zombie films have a place in my heart, especially George Romero's zombie films. And when I heard of a remake of Dawn of Dead with Romero having a hand in it, I was excited. Finally a decent budget and modern day effects along with Romero's touch. Unfortinately I felt betrayed and very unsatisfied after the first 10 minutes of the movie. And sadly the rest of the movie followed suit. The only good thing if any in this film was thankfully the gore wasn't restrained, But that's the only decent thing about this film.<br/><br/>What makes this film so bad? Well it follows the trend of movie 'remakes' which in reality are a totally different movie and using an existing title to get fans to watch. And unfortunately this was no different. The director simply had no respect for the original masterpiece of it's older namesake. It lacked everything that made the original so memorable and replaced them with cheap thrills, action sequences and annoying characters. I understand that it was Mr.Snyder's first time, But jeez he already had a base to go on and plenty of reference material. The Mall seemed to be there in name only, and the zombies where laughable rather scary.<br/><br/>There's not enough space and time for me to explain every reason why this film was beyond disappointing. So I'll just summarize instead.<br/><br/>First 'And foremost' the zombies. They ran, they climbed, they hissed and they made threatening faces at you. Wrong, very wrong and shouldn't even be called zombies. Romero understood what made the zombies so scary in the original 'Dead' movies. They were believable, and that's what made them scary. Because he realistically portrayed what a reanimated dead corpse would do. Their muscles where too rotted and stiff to move fast or do complicated movement, if at any. They were too stupid to speak or make facial threats at you. And they were relentless and numerous. They simply wouldn't stop and they were simply so many it was overwhelming. These aspects are what made Romero's zombies so scary, the 'remake' is completely devoid of all of that.<br/><br/>Secondly was the overwhelming stupidity of all the characters, It's expect that a few of the characters in films such as these are supposed to be stupid. But in this case they all are and none of them give you a sense of loss, (infact quite the opposite) when they are finally dispatched. The only character I felt sorry for was the lone gun-shop owner, But his demise was all but predictable and on the whole, irrelevant. The rest of cast, you feel rather gratified when they meet their doom. In this film, The characters and the zombies have something in common, their IQ.<br/><br/>Films like 28 days later and Return of the Living Dead I enjoyed, even though they feature what I described as (the first part at least) as Dawn 'remake''s failings. But neither of these films boasts or pretends to be on the same level of Romero's work. 28 Days Later is not a Zombie film per se, as the people weren't undead but diseased, so them running and screaming wasn't as far fetched. And 'Return' was more comedic and satirical in nature as well as it took a totally different path from Romero's 'Dead' movies, Dan O'Bannon made it abundantly clear that his movie had nothing to do with Romero's work or story lines. The 'Remake' however boasts about remaking a classic that carries the same name, this is where it becomes inexcusable.<br/><br/>If at all possible, watch Romero's 1979 version of Dawn of the Dead. It's a classic, And avoid the 'remake' travesty of a film."

","Dawn of the Dead (2004) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Remake of George A. Romero's 1978 masterpiece has a zombie outbreak happening and a group of survivors take shelter inside a mall. At first the diverse group of people are fighting but they finally come together to try and survive the ordeal.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the original DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the top three horror films ever made so going into this remake expecting it to live up to that would be rather stupid. The first time I watched this film I really didn't like it and to this day I must admit that I have a problem with these super fast, superhero like zombies. With that said, this second viewing of this 2004 version actually worked a lot better and I found myself enjoying the film even with its flaws.<br/><br/>I must also admit that I'm not the biggest fan of director Zach Snyder. For the most part I think he brings a lot of flash and style to his movies but very little substance and I thought that was the case here. I thought the film was way too flashy for its own good and I must say that I didn't even like the look of the movie. As I previously stated I'm not really a fan of the fast zombie but I really disliked the various CGI zombies here as well as the way some of them seemed to be better fitted for a MATRIX movie.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, I still find myself enjoying the characters and the performances from the actors. The film actually had a few nice ideas and I must admit that I liked the rather grim outcome and the fact that none of the characters were really safe. The film also benefits from some nice changes in the story including what impact the gun store has on the outcome. The mall setting was just a great idea by Romero and while it's not used as well here it's still a good option to have.<br/><br/>DAWN OF THE DEAD isn't a masterpiece like the original but even with all of the flaws it's still an entertaining movie."
"bradman1118","9","2","2","3 December 2014"," one of the few horror remakes that may actually exceed the original!
","Dawn of the Dead is directed by Zack Snyder, the director/writer of such films as 300, 300: Rise of an Empire, Man of Steel, etc. It is a remake of George Romero's second movie of the same name. There is A LOT to love about Dawn of the Dead. Firstly, it gets into the action right away. The original film spent a decent amount of time developing the characters and the idea of a zombie apocalypse, while this one wastes no time before the terror and suspense begins! It is the same premise as the original movie but rather than making a shot-for-shot remake, this movie actually goes in another direction and works on it's own terms. There are several differences, the main one being that the zombies run and do not follow Romero's rule. While it may not have as much of the human drama that made the original great, it is still a VERY fun time; it is scary, suspenseful, gory, has great action scenes, and a great survival/apocalypse element to it. Another thing I liked is the feeling of isolation. The original film had an element in which there were biker gangs hanging out outside the mall. This evoked a feeling that it is not truly the apocalypse and everybody is surviving in their own ways. That element is not present in this movie, and it has a feeling of isolation and dread that is present in many other great survival/horror movies like the Mist or the Descent. When watching Dawn of the Dead, it is important to view it for what it is worth, zombies, gore, suspense, action, and scares. There is no deeper meaning. There is no political metaphor like in 28 Days Later. If you view it as a straight-up zombie-thriller that you can have a good time with, I guarantee you will enjoy it."

","I have seen the remake a year before the original movie. And I am a fan of remakes, if they are good. This remake is way better than the original, to be honest: It's my favorite zombie-movie. The makeup is great, the effects are good, the actors are good, the camera-work is good and even the actors of the original movie have cameos (not as their old roles of course). I think, ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 2004 is simply the best zombie movie I have seen yet, better than the George A. Romero's, better than ""28 days (and weeks) later"" and better than ""zombieland"" (but not funnier). The only thing that is not that awesome is the violence: It is very bloody sometimes. But that doesn't make the movie much worse, the blood is used in a realistic way, not like ""If they shoot a zombie just let the head explode"" or something like that. All in one: This movie is just great."

"Wuchakk","8","2","2","12 March 2014"," Horrifying and INTENSE
","""Dawn of the Dead"" is the 2004 remake of the original 1978 classic horror film.<br/><br/>THE STORY: When dead people start coming back to life it seems like the end of the world. A group of people (led by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jack Weber and Michael Kelly) hold up in a shopping mall to survive while the dead increasingly congregate outside. What's going on? What can they do? How can they survive? And is there any hope? <br/><br/>Although the basic plot is the same as George Romero's original film the characters and storyline are completely different; hence, this is more of a re-envisioning rather than a true remake. Personally I prefer it this way. We already have the original so let's see a different take. No? <br/><br/>I just saw this film last night and it was so freakin' horrifying and INTENSE I couldn't sleep for two hours. This, for me, reveals the true effectiveness of a horror flick -- whether or not you can sleep afterwards. In this sense ""Dawn"" is a 5/5 Star film all the way.<br/><br/>What I liked about the story is that it takes the material seriously; there's no, goofy, campy, unrealistic vibe. What would it be like if dead people REALLY started coming back to life and seeking out living flesh to eat? This is the approach the filmmakers take here.<br/><br/>One reviewer complained that it was unrealistic that the characters on occasion would laugh, smile and joke around during such a dire, hopeless situation. But this isn't unbelievable at all. It's a natural defensive mechanism of the human psyche to try to have fun, joke and make the most out of a bad situation. I've seen it numerous times in my life and the lives of others over the years (car accident, hospitalization, destruction of property, serious illness, death, etc.). Besides, the film more than adequately portrays the downside of human reaction -- depression, violence, grief, madness, etc.<br/><br/>The only negative I can cite is the speeding-up effect used in the Third Act. It worked at times but too often it came across as awkward or amateurish and just served to confuse the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Some people didn't like the zombie birth scene but I found it well-done and effective.<br/><br/>The original was filmed at the Monroeville Mall near Pittsburgh, PA, while this remake was shot at the (now demolished) Thornhill Square Mall in Ontario, although the story takes place in Milwaukee.<br/><br/>The theatrical version runs 101 minutes (the version I saw) and the Director's Cut 110 minutes.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a truly intense, horrifying flick you can't go wrong with this 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead.""<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

","Ana (Sarah Polley) is a nurse in Milwaukee who just finished her shift. She's sleeping with her husband and is woken up by a rabid neighbor girl. She goes on the run for her life. After crashing her car, she's joined by cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), criminal Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant girlfriend, and TV salesman Michael (Jake Weber). They are cut off and decide to hold up in the mall. They find other survivors and are surrounded by zombies.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder takes the George A. Romero classic icon with James Gunn script, and he injects it with the fast running zombie like '28 Days Later'. It doesn't try to explain away the zombies. It just gets the action started after a short introduction. It's an exciting action start that showcases Snyder's skills. I especially like the zombies really running hard. The story isn't anything original, but it has the sense of suburban reality. The mall looks real although a few brand name stores would help. I like the character work and I like the simplicity of the story. It knows its simplicity and works within its limits."

","A random group of Navy SEALS sharpshooters, Israeli SWAT team members and Wild West gunslingers find themselves trapped in a Milwaukee shopping mall. . . . Okay, they're really supposed to be an ordinary group of strangers. I merely wish to point out that of the roughly 47 gazillion shots fired in the course of this film, not a one of them misses. To kill a zombie, of course, you have to shoot it in the head---not an easy shot even if both shooter and target are stationary. But we get a feeble old man shooting two handguns while being dragged backward; a guy who didn't know where his safety catch was, dispatching dozens of zombies - - - BANG!--Another zombie down. You get the idea.<br/><br/>This isn't criticism; I'm giving this film 8 out of 10. But you should know, if watching it for the first time, that you'll be asked not only to suspend disbelief, but to hang disbelief by the neck until dead. Plot holes are too numerous to mention; logic (even the film's internal logic) is gently slid off to the side and into oblivion; numerous major questions are never answered, notably how the sudden zombie virus originated, apparently overnight. Oh, lots of stuff.<br/><br/>How, then, an 8 out of 10? Because ""Dawn of the Dead,"" unlike any other zombie film I've seen (full disclosure here: I have NOT seen the 1978 original), clearly had someone with a brain behind it. Maybe even two such someones! There's good, chiseled dialogue; consistent understatement (an early, excellent example is the TV news flash while Ana and her hubby are otherwise engaged; we're not told what the news flash is about---just that there is one); and even some character development! (Well, not the zombies; they pretty much just keep on doing what zombies do.) Also, as other IMDb reviewers have pointed out, very effective flashes of humour, the best being the scene in which the lead characters, communicating by sign with a gun-shop owner stranded atop his store across the street, suggest targets---""Burt Reynolds""--- and the gun guy takes aim and blows away the shambling zombie who resembles Burt Reynolds.<br/><br/>My only serious complaint with this immensely entertaining film is the portrayal of the zombies. You'd think that someone would find some workable variant on the universal zombie standard: arms outstretched, bloody mouth, eyes circled in kohl for that sunken look. It's a tried and true formula, but watch enough zombie films and you just get tired."

The remaining hour and a half or so, I was just waiting for it to end.  <br/><br/>There is a period of about an hour in the film where absolutely nothing happens.  A group of survivors hole up in a shopping mall to keep safe, and uhhh well that's your movie folks.  Nothing happens from that point on, until the end.  This movie is nowhere near as consistent or as exciting as last years '28 Days Later.""  I also accept that these movies are not supposed to be realistic at all, I reinforce they are my FAVORITE films, but I somewhat expect them to be consistent.  You have some charaters who get bit, and turn into zombies within minutes, and others who take hours or days to turn.  Completely inconsistent, and it got a bit annoying.

"skazz","1","13","25","20 March 2004"," 29 Days Later?
","Someone pointed out to me that 28 Days Later was not persay a zombie film... and true as that may be, my contention is that Zack Snyder's (who) Dawn redux is no more a zombie film than 28 Days. It is poorly scripted (by Scooby Doo's James Gunn, so what did we expect?) and more closely resembles a sequel to 28 Days Later than a reworking of the classic film it is intended be based on. Sure this one also takes place in a mall, and has cameos from 3 actors from the original, but where the Texas Chainsaw redux created an intriguing, suspenseful and original take on the 1974 film, it also captured the essence of Tobe Hooper's classic. Dawn 2004 captures none of that. This film supposes that none of us have seen NOTLD or DOTD(1978) and tries to pull us in with a dizzying 10 minute prologue, which is taught and well constructed but ultimately leads us to... well NOTHING!!! A bunch of people you don't care about talking, talking and talking some more and for good measure they kill a couple of ""zombies"" so we don't forget what the movie is supposed to be about. Some stupid comic relief for those who can't handle the ""horror"" (if you can call it that) and then the breakneck final act which is edited in that MTV,  shaky cam (Blair Witch), cut every nanosecond pace in which the ""zombie"" attacks in 28 days were edited or for that matter any typical ""Fast and the Furious"" action film of the past decade which is geared to appease the no-attention-span video game playing fans who make this kind of crap so successful at the box office. There were NO scares in this movie, every moment was predictable and formulaic. The attempt at character development via the silly and overlong conversations that took place around the coffee shop only served to bog down the film and I for one nearly left the theater 45 minutes in. Not a memorable performance among the leads. The best moments came from Tom Savini and Ken Foree in brief cameos. Ving Rhames even disappoints and one can only hope that Jack Lemmon hung on to that Oscar that Ving gave him. The film had some (too few to mention) moments, but then so do reruns of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" With the recent releases of films like Wrong Turn, Cabin Fever and the TCM redux I was beginning to think there was hope for the horror genre, but after seeing DOTD 2004, I say let the dead STAY dead for now and cross my fingers that George A. can get his 4th dead film made. Any TRUE zombie fan who LIKED this movie needs a lobotomy. When there's no more room in hell... the dead will continue walking right past this waste of time!"

The movie begins with some ""unknown"" virus that reanimates the dead who are infected, fine that makes for an interesting Zombie movie.  This epidemic is apparently world wide, although the cause is never actually revealed. They continually make reference to the armed forces and how they are trying to contain these creatures.  The United States military was subdued and virtually annihilated in one days' time.  You learn in the movie that ""Fort Pastor"", the army base near this city, is destroyed and is a ""blood bath"". In other words the United States Military armed with armored tanks, Assault Rifles, and Air Support, is less suited to the task of fighting these creatures then 6 average joes wielding pistols and shotguns.  Oh yea...and let's leave the safety of the mall to drive to some Island out in the middle of no where.  This movie takes place in Milwaukee?  Apparently there are tropical Islands out on Lake Michigan now...and how exactly did those creatures get to that Island or infect it?  Weren't they supposed to be mechanically illiterate?

Acting is 1st class and editing is phenomenal. One thing that sticks in my mind RE the plot is how the dorky lead Mall Security cop starts out as a frightened tool, and in the end turns out to be the top hero of the day, making possible the ""escape into the sunset"" of the remainder of the surviving party.......I particularly like that sort of character development......It puts the ""value"" in ""redeeming social value"" that we do so crave in films of this genre!<br/><br/>In closing, this is not only a MUST SEE, it is a MUST HAVE IN YOUR DVD COLLECTION!"

","Let's get something out of the way first and that is as a director George A Romero is way down there with Ed Wood . The technical aspects like editing and sound are awful while his cast are so wooden you'll get splinters from picking up a DVD of one of his films .<br/><br/>But as both a producer and screenwriter he credits his audience with great respect and his films are unusually sophisticated and intelligent with DAWN OF THE DEAD being his masterwork . It's a film that pre-dates gore fests from the 1980s while at the same time mirroring the haunting novels of 1950s British apocalypse writers like John Wyndham and John Christopher and this level of sophistication I remember the original film for .<br/><br/>It's difficult to know who to blame for this farce entitled DAWN OF THE DEAD . Romero doesn't have a producer credit and it shows . Zack Snyder later went on to direct 300 , one of the most aesthetically pleasing and remarkable films of recent years . But there's little here that is pleasing . A lot people have suggested 28 DAYS LATER rips off Romero but I wonder what these critics will say when they realise the zombies in this film are able to run like an Olympic runner ? Something along the lines of "" Well it was filmed in Canada so as a tribute to the Canadians they're a homage to Ben Johnson hence their rapid running ability "" . Don't patronise me because the zombies here are a homage to Danny Boyle rather than Romero <br/><br/>Unfortunately Hollywood being Hollywood everything is about money so it's not difficult to see the motives behind remaking this horror classic .

The violence was out of control which is what you would expect from a zombie movie.<br/><br/>There are a few funny moments and a lot of zombie attacking, bullet through the head, blood going everywhere moments in in. The running zombies are much better then the slow groaning zombies because it makes the movie much better because it makes it harder for the survivors to get away which makes the movie more heart pounding.<br/><br/>This is a great guy movie. There may be a hand full of girls out there who will like this movie(like me)and be able to stand the gore and blood. <br/><br/>The story begins with Ana, a nurse who notices many weird things happening inside and outside of the hospital. When the zombies hit her house she flees and finds other survivors who take cover in the mall. I thought the dog was great(when you see the movie you will know what i am talking about)it was so cute and was a little bit of a hero.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to every soul on the planet.

","What a great word ""re-imagining"" is. Isn't that what they call Dawn of the Dead MMIV (2004)? A clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate, ""remake"" that is, and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination. Well, damn, was I misled. At least I was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of ""re-imagining,"" though it played a role.<br/><br/>Still, why make a remake? Directors do it for only a few reasons really: to update a movie for a modern audience, or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it. An homage, if you will. Nonetheless, it all generally (I do admit exceptions) boils down to one thing: stealing someone's idea and reshaping it (or ""re-imagining"" it) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it. It's like Coles'/Cliffs' notes; dump everything in a blender, purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors. In other words, a great marketing scheme.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with this one? Well, I'll start with what I liked. I liked the opening scenes. Thanks to CGI and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust Romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means. We see the city in ruins, thousands of zombies: chaos and death. Two words that look beautiful on screen. Then it all falls apart.<br/><br/>This set-up leads nowhere. The movie does what almost every remake does. It adds more of everything except character, atmosphere, and story. It's noisier, (in some sense) bloodier, and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots. The setting, the mall which played a crucial role in the original film's story and theme, is purely coincidental. The idea communicated in Romero's film, the pure ecstatic joy of having ""a mall all to yourself as a fortress,"" is gone here. Further, this ""re-imagining"" has no moxie, no spirit, no balls. It assumes (probably quite rightly) that the audience has no attention span and doesn't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story. The film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original. You actually grew to care about those people in Romero's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall. Here, you don't care when or who goes: what matters is how they go.<br/><br/>What else is their to say? The film is not scary. It has one or two ""jump"" scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects. As a story it's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it. The humor is also reduced to a few one-liners (and one really good character: Andy). After that, what remains? An ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued, inevitable ambiguity of the original film. But, despite it being a pretty bad film (though not quite as bad as some other remakes), it should be remembered for one thing: it kicked The Passion of Christ from it's number one spot in the box office. Well done zombies."
"The_Void","2","13","27","4 December 2004"," Terrible remake.
","The original Dawn of the Dead was a commentary on society; and this remake is too. Only this time it's a commentary on the fact that attention spans are getting shorter. The zombies move at lightening pace and the film is edited together like something that you would expect to find on Mtv (the scenes set to music only reinforce this view). This is all wrong; zombies don't move fast, they're slow; and Dawn of the Dead is supposed to be a horror movie, not a quick-edited action fest. What's going on?! The original Dawn of the Dead also selected it's characters wisely, and made them all unique and interesting, but the remake suffers from what I like to call 'Alien 3 syndrome', which is where a film introduces masses of characters and forgets to make a single one of them interesting, rendering them all just pawns for the central monster to eat. Now while this is fun because most of them do get eaten, it sucks because there is no tension since you don't care about them anyway. Which makes for a pretty boring and repetitive movie really.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames replaces Ken Foree (who himself has a cameo) as the main character in the mayhem, and does a pretty good job with it. Rhames is a big man and he has a very cool look about him, so it's fun to see him shooting zombies. That's one of the only good things I have to say about the film. Starring alongside Ving is Sarah Polley. Sarah looks nice, and obviously has fun with the role; but doesn't really make an impression. The rest of the cast aren't worth a mention, with one exception; Matt Frewer. This guy is one of my favourite smaller actors, but he's in the film for all of about five minutes. Damn. The main reason why the cast isn't able to impress is that they simply don't serve any relevance to the plot at all, rendering the human drama element null and void, and therefore making every moment without zombies incredibly boring. The film follows pretty much the same path that the original did with a bunch of people holding up in a shopping mall, only this time there's some attempt to escape. On the whole, for a film that supposedly depicts the falsity that remakes are a good idea, this film is a massive disappointment. There's so much that still could be done with the idea of zombies, in spite of the greatness of the original Dawn of the Dead, but this film hardly attempts to capitalise at all. There's some nice moments of carnage, but overall; this is an enormous disappointment."
"featherstondraws","4","5","8","25 August 2016"," An incredibly average zombie film with the same name as a classic
","It is impossible to evaluate the success of this movie without comparing it to the original. The fantasy element of living in the mall which drove the classic film, of having all the creature comforts of civilization amid the apocalypse, is missing entirely. The social commentary of the original, that consumerism has become so instinctive that even zombies would gravitate towards the mall, is missing entirely. This isn't ""Dawn of the Dead""; this is just a movie that has a mall in it. <br/><br/>Also absent are any compelling characters. While the original focused on no more than four survivors, the number is more than tripled in the remake to diminished effect. There are no nuanced portrayals here; the cast never transcends flat character descriptions like ""the tough nurse"", ""the pregnant woman"", or ""the jerk security guard"". As we see them dispatched with the indifference we might reserve for reality show contestants, none of these characters make much of an impression. Original film actor Ken Foret has a brief cameo as a fundamentalist preacher, and in his less than two minutes of screen time he provides a more powerful performance than any of the main cast.<br/><br/>The fast zombies are more comedic than scary. Whether they're sprinting after cars like cartoon dogs, bashing their heads through doors, or squealing like pigs as they are picked off by gunfire, the undead never seem to present a credible threat. <br/><br/>For all its enhanced budget and updated special effects, this ""Dawn of the Dead"" does not offer anything that cannot be found in the previous four decades of zombie horror. Once again we have to sit through the usual bickering between survivors over who will lead, the standard ""bit by a zombie and waiting to turn"" play for our sympathies, the predictable ill- advised trip to the basement. All this and more has been done before, and executed more effectively.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has always been an amazing visualist, and this is one way in which the film redeems itself. The full scope of a neighborhood descending into chaos is revealed through a camera mounted on an escaping vehicle. Two characters saying a tearful goodbye is broken into multiple cuts from several perspectives, distorting time and drawing us into the moment. The daylight scenes appear overexposed, amplifying the idea that this catastrophe is happening in our real world. Sadly, no amount of skillful cinematography can help this mashup of worn out horror movie banalities."

","I went to the video shop to see if I could buy any decent movies because I think recently some movies are not worth watching. I stumble into this corner and I saw the cover of the Dawn of the Dead. I said to myself that I should give this horror film a go because the last time I saw a horror film is a year ago and I had enough of comedies, chick flicks and action films. When I started watching the movie I thought this might be another 'DUMB' horror film where you normally see a girl running towards the back the door instead of the the front door. But then again after a few minutes of watching this movie, I realize that it might be a 'GENIUS' horror film after all. Although some of the actors in the movie are not famous or should we say veteran it's good that their acting abilities are excellent. At the end of the movie, the four or five people and the dog who fled the land and escaped using a boat from the zombies. The zombies are still alive that means there might be a sequel to this horror film and I can't wait to see the next one. Overall the entire film was a genius and shouldn't be missed by any movie lovers."

","Whenever I begin watching a modern movie with the slightest hint of zombies in it, my expectations are never high, and this was completely true for Dawn of the Dead. So, when I sat down to begin watching, I was expecting a movie more to the likes of the horrendous Night of the Living Dead 3D; definitely not up to the standard of a George Romero classic. However, Zack Snyder impressed and surprised me with this movie.<br/><br/>The plot was obviously moderately based on the Romero take of the movie, with an all new set of characters. Combined with the modern CGI and effects we have today, this 2004 was a close competitor to the highly set bar by the OG of zombie movies.<br/><br/>I loved the way the characters use ingenious methods of zombie aversion, and Snyder's modern take on the original shuffling zombie is a fresh take on this classical genre. Despite this, some of these zombie slaughtering ideas by the group seemed almost too comical for a movie without the comedy tag. <br/><br/>Overall, Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is a great movie, with a revitalized take on the Romero benchmark. While it may not be equal to it's predecessor, this movie is a great, edge of your seat watch that I would recommend for any zombie lover."

This is now one of my holy grail moves. If you're considering watching this, do it, you will not be disappointed. The only reason not to watch would be if you get queasy with gore, in which case you should probably avoid the whole zombie movie genre. The ending was great, a little predictable but when you watch through the credits you really get the full closure.

"lotus_chief","1","9","18","28 March 2004"," A new level of stupidity has been attained....
","***SPOILERS BELOW!***<br/><br/>I went into this flick knowing what to expect.  Horror movie.  Okay, silly people doing stupid things with some gore and mindless killing.  Fine, I'm a fan of horror flicks when they're done right; last year's Freddy vs. Jason was pretty good.  I don't think I've ever been more disgusted at a movie than I am with Dawn of the Dead.  Granted, I haven't seen the original so I can't compare it to this 'remake'.  But a new level of stupidity has been attained with DOD.  The movie started out pretty good - the way the 'calm ordinary day' to 'utter chaos and insanity' switch was shown was very well done.  I'll admit, it had me hooked.  However, the movie quickly went deeper and deeper into pure stupidity.  I can suspend my disbelief but so far, but this is too much!  They can't be serious:<br/><br/>The girl takes one of the few remaining trucks and risks her life and the life of all the other survivors to save 'Chips'...a stupid dog she's only known for a day or so?  And what was up with these idiots waiting until 'infected' people died and turned into zombies to kill them?  How stupid can you be????  How stupid was Mekhi Phifer?  He actually thought his baby was going to be normal?  He knew what he was doing was wrong, or else why did he have his wife tied to the bed?  He knew EXACTLY what was happening (his wife was bitten and was going to turn), yet he gets mad at the old lady and kills her because she had sense to kill his now-zombie wife - saying 'you're threatening my family?'  WHAT???  Your wife is a ZOMBIE you idiot!  LMAO! What the HELL were the writers thinking with this CRAP??  What was the point of them wheeling in the fat dying lady?  She was no use to anyone anyway and she was bitten...KILL HER!  And Ana, she's seen all that has gone on - when someone is bitten it's only a matter of time before they 'die' and become a zombie.  So why o why is she pleading with Michael to come along with them on the boat where they're SAFE, saying she could 'help him', knowing he's going to turn?  Just HOW IN THE HELL did she intend on 'helping him'?? The stupidity of this movie truly knew no bounds, and this is what ultimately kills it.<br/><br/>As I said earlier I'm a fan of horror movies; Halloween, Friday the 13th, Freddy flicks are among my favorites.  So I know what these movies are like and expect silliness (i.e. a chick laying down and blood drops on her from above and she asks 'where is this coming from'?? lol).  But DOD is on another level as far as stupidity goes.  I could not have watched the same film as everyone else, because my friends and I were all disgusted with this joke of a 'horror' flick..and yet it gets all these good reviews.  There's absolutely NO character depth (didn't expect much to begin with) and the plot is beyond brainless - we don't even find out how/why all of this is happening.  DOD is complete NONSENSE; a disgrace of a movie that tries to be a 'horror' flick (I don't even count as one since it isn't the least bit scary).  What a pathetic waste of time & money.  28 Days Later is FAR superior; anyone who says otherwise is deluding themselves.<br/><br/>¬Ω* out of **** stars.  What could have been...."
"rondigi2003","1","10","21","28 March 2004"," Stick to the original
","If you are a fan of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" that was released in 1978 by superior zombie director George A. Romero, you won't like Remake. I consider The Dawn of the Dead 2004 to be one of the worst remakes in the history of filmaking.  Dawn of the Dead 2004 is nothing like the original it was intended to be remade in, on the contrary, its its own movie.  It should not have been called dawn of the dead.  The original Dawn of the dead had excellent character build and delicious old school make up effects by Tom Savini.  The zombies were slow and stupid hence the name ""zombie"".  The Remake has far too many characters to like, accept maybe Ken ( Vingh Rahmes).  The Remake also had a diffrent breed of zombies than the original, the fast zombie which is a rip off of 28 days later.  The original Dawn of the dead is actually a HORROR movie.  The remake is more of and action suspense movie.  If you want to see a beautiful candy colored zombie movie watch the original ( 10/10) if you want to watch an action/thriller/suspense/monster movie then watch the new dawn of the dead(-10/10) starring vingh rahmes and sarah polly."

","Wow, if there is ever a case for a movie which is completely pointless, useless, and a waste of everyone's time, it's King Kong 2005. Oh wait, wrong review. it's also 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead."" The new ""Dawn"" sucked on so many levels. It's yet another reason why most remakes should not be made. Poor direction, horrible script, bad actors, lame music...and this was supposed to be a remake of one of the greatest horror films ever made? It's like a joke.<br/><br/>First of all, this wasn't scary at all. Horror means scary. You are supposed to be scared at a horror film. Nope. There was not a single instance in this film that was scary at all, none. Wasn't this the director's first film? Where'd they pick him up, eating lunch on 3rd street outside of NYU with all the other pretentious no-talents who attend there? Or did he save someone's life or something and being the director was his payback? Wow, the direction sucked.<br/><br/>Second, the actors all sucked. The main black guy cop was a laugh riot. Trying to look tough, spurting out those badass lines...he was hysterical! So were the others for the most part, but he was the champ here.<br/><br/>God, where to go from here...the music was a joke. The zombies all sucked. Running zombies suck. They looked OK here and there, but the running helps take away from the ""doomed"" atmosphere that was sorely lacking. I never felt there was the ""doom"" that the world was being taken over by the dead. Showing a million computer generated zombies doesn't do that, good film-making and direction does. So the zombies weren't scary, they were often pretty funny. The zombie baby was especially hilarious. So was the fat one chasing the blond in the mall.<br/><br/>OK, let me be positive for a sec. There were only two whole good shots in the film - the little girl in the shadows in the house near the start, and one shot of the Russian woman as she's dead. That's it.<br/><br/>Wow! It's a sex scene! Completely unneeded and out of place. Like most of the scenes probably.<br/><br/>Some may say you can't compare this to the original. Why? Of course you can, it's the remake! The original is a classic because it had it all - great direction, scary atmosphere, decent soundtrack that added to the film, decent acting - unlike the new film which was poor on every level.<br/><br/>What garbage. A complete waste of everyone's time. It really makes you wonder who is making these films these days and where they are learning their ""talent"" and craft. But hey. I'll end this on a positive note. I will say this about the film - as horrible as it was, it was better than ""28 Days.""

","Zombie review #1<br/><br/>
*Possible Spoilers (but if you're smart you WON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS RUBBISH*<br/><br/>So yeah, I was pretty disappointed by this film, and my expectations weren't really all that high to begin with.  At most I thought I'd get a cheesy but enjoyable action movie (I'd already resigned myself to the fact that this wasn't going to be a real zombie flick), but this film completely failed to live up even to that limited standard.<br/><br/>There's so much to drone on about what's wrong with this wretched botch job that I may as well start with what I DID like:  The first ten minutes - fantastic, as good a bit of cinematic chaos as anyone's ever pulled off. And there's some nifty business near the end with a chainsaw and a car park that's full of 100s of zombies.  This scene almost threatens to save the film but sadly the zombie apocalypse a few brief shots promise never comes. It's like seeing a porn film that offers the merest glimpse of the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, then cuts to a ten minute sequence of boring, annoying people doing nothing but bore and annoy you - and then it ends.<br/><br/>Zombie films are a lot like porn in some ways - the basic ingredients write themselves, and it's quite hard to completely screw it up, even on a limited budget.  Even the really bad old Zombie films have some entertainment value (ie: zombies eating people and shambling about to terrible synth music) but this film doesn't include ANY of the staples of the genre.  Not one scene of a character having their innards/brains exposed and eaten, not one scene of zombies losing limbs but THEY STILL KEEP COMING COS THEY'RE THE LIVING DEAD AND THEY DON'T NEED NO ANKLES!!!!   HAVE THESE PEOPLE NO RESPECT FOR THE CLASSICS?  They even have a dog in the film and never it have it a) have a fight with zombies or b) be a ZOMBIE DOG!!  Talk about your missed opportunities.<br/><br/>Pah, and I haven't even started on the poor dialogue and characterisation (it's true zombie films don't exactly have a good track record for this, but this is meant to be Dawn of the Dead right?), crummy ""action"" scenes that substitute the good ol' shaking camera for any real tension or thrills, the crass use of rock music, the fact that every single ""shock"" in the film is so damned cheap (she's not just a zombie, she's a fat ugly old zombie OOOOOOOOH) and then there's the complete lack of regard for the original film, the characters in this film, and hey, the intelligence of the audience!   It's the triple wammy!<br/><br/>Trust me here, I haven't even scratched the surface of what I hated about this film, but several of the other points have been made in some other reviews (although I will mention this one - what on earth is the point in the muslims glimpsed in the opening credits? To show it's a ""worldwide phenomenon""?? HOW?? All you see is people praying in a mosque, which, and I don't mean to scare any of you with this idea, could even be in the good old U.S of A, and there are no other nationalities shown in the sequence. Seems more like another cheap shot - show a clip of something some people are presently afraid of to try and get them jumpy cos there's nothing in the film that can do the job on it's own merits)<br/><br/>This is the without a doubt the most worthless cinema experience I've ever had and that includes Superman 4, Police Academy 5 and Alien Resurrection, and is the first time I've ever felt like walking out of a film because I was literally chewing my fist in frustration at the mind numbing dreck taking place in front of my poor, suffering eyes.<br/><br/>To sum up - this is a horror film that has a scene where a zombie woman gives birth to a zombie baby that is neither scary, disturbing, disgusting or even funny.

Also how did she manage to get downstairs and into the truck in a matter of 30 secs? By the way, werent they saying getting to the truck would be impossible yet a 14 year old did it. hmmm.

The remake hasn't the wit or inclination to do anything but reduce the original's idea to a show-off visual style and cheap set pieces.  The opening 10 minutes has been justifiably celebrated, but the cliches then start piling up nearly as high as the body count.  I detested the entire pregnancy angle because of its illogical loop to introduce characters only to dispose of them (including a zombie baby).  I'd expect that in some cheapjack slasher movie, but we're dealing with a classic, for crying out loud.  This new version, with its hyperactive attitude, may win over modern viewers, but will never stand the test of time."

","""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""The Ring"" proved that classic horror movies can be remade even better and ""Dawn Of The Dead"" gloriously follows that tradition.<br/><br/>MINOR SPOILERS: The movie grabs you right from the beginning. The first 15 minutes are absolutely admirable: first you see a close up of an x-ray of a skull and then the movie just bursts with action. The explosions and car chases are filmed so nicely it will take your breath away. And then in the middle of all that chaos the credits first appear to the sounds of Johnny Cash' ""The Man Comes Around"" while we see short clips of the Zombies taking over America. How great is that? A song hasn't been used so effectively since ""Layla"" in ""GoodFellas"". END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>Thankfully, the movie doesn't let you down or gets boring from there on. The characters are interesting and believable and there's just the right amount of humor (dark humor, that is). On the negative side, the movie did have some rather laughable scenes, too.<br/><br/>MORE SPOILERS: The zombie baby was unnecessary. They could at least have made more of it instead of just shooting it after that ridiculous monologue by the father. And why did the guy on the other roof hold up a card with blood on it after his transformation? Why would a Zombie do that? Also, the explosions in the end were too much over the top. The people in the trucks wouldn't have survived that kind of detonation themselves. END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>Anyway, personally, I'm not a fan of Zombie movies at all, but this one totally  convinced me. Bottom line: if you see only one Zombie flick in your life, this is the one. Bring on the remake of ""Day Of The Dead""!"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I really admired how this was constructed and consider it a better film than the original. The deal with that original was the Dead were slow and stupid but incessant and inevitable. Here, the form is reinvented in a new genre, that started by ""Alien"" and copied hundreds of times with various alien swarms.<br/><br/>The key here is the pacing, which I think is pretty well understood for that escape genre. The enclosures, the secrets, the small scenes of pathos, the innumerable ""them."" The kickoff. And that ending, the one that bleeds into the credits, is a special coda with post- climax superfrenzy.<br/><br/>I admit to not being steeped in the Zombie genre, though I recently saw ""Video Dead."" But I think this doesn't qualify. These are scurrying, smart, growling monsters. No, I actually sought this out because of Sarah Polley, who interests me. She is a serious actress who has done well enough in a few intelligent films and following such careers is one of my minor hobbies. She must have done this because it was local. There's nothing of her in this.<br/><br/>Also appearing is Lindsey Booth, someone else I am watching, but in this case only because she is a slim redhead. She is slim and redhead here, and little else but provides an excuse for the rescue that triggers the climax. She's the scoobydoo component, and that ain't all bad.<br/><br/>The original depicted the Dead as a disease, or diseased, apt to an age discovering AIDS. This one depicts the Zombies as mad, precisely the sort of evil madness we bestow on jihadists. Think I'm joking? Look at the very first shot in this film: hundreds of Muslims praying (in unison, naturally).<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 3-- worth watching"

"mag7_1","3","6","13","20 March 2004"," So dissapointing!!!!!
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** First off; let me begin by saying that I have NOT seen the original 1978 version of this movie. So therefore when myself and a friend decided on the spur of the moment to go see this flick...it was with only the basic knowledge that it was a ""zombie movie""....where folks are in a mall. After sitting through this movie....I felt as if it had been an almost entire waste of time!!!!! I will break down the reasons why I believed so.<br/><br/><br/><br/>1. I absolutely despise movies where s*** just starts happening and there is never any definitive answer as to why they have begun....at least on the original Night Of The Living Dead....they gave some vague reasoning as to what started the dead to rising!!! This movie is normal...and then suddenly total chaos!!!!<br/><br/>
2.Absolutely no background information on any of the characters to amount to much except for the Rhames character....com'on...how are we supposed to feel for these people that were just thrown at us????<br/><br/>
3.The pregnant chick thing....was just stupid!!!! 4 minutes into the movie...myself and everyone....in the theatre...knew she was gonna be birthing....the spawn of the dead...and then that baby looked like a combination of the babies from....""Its Alive"" and ""Basket Case""(Yes I know the latter wasn't actually a baby). It was so totally ridiculous!!!!!<br/><br/>
4.The dude that stayed on the dock at the end as the boat sailed away....was the most obnoxious....piece of crap I've ever seen....and his character.....was a waste!!!!<br/><br/>
5.There was just so much more they could have done with this movie....it was if the producers had borrowed the mall...and had to finish as quickly as possible with their shooting schedule..hehehe.<br/><br/>
6.The scenes where everyone suddenly got jolly...and started having a good time and kidding around for a few frames made no sense!!!!!<br/><br/>
7.Why were they in such a hurry to get out of the mall?....this was obviously one of the few places on earth that they could reamin relatively safe....hell;watch a video...or something....hehehe.<br/><br/>
8.And last...(but, definately not least)....I have absolutely had it with the the ""Blair Witch Style"" endings...give it a  break guys!!!! That s*** was 5 years ago(Blair Witch)....it worked then.....and it is very old now!!!! First the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre did it...and now this crap!!!! The final scene should have just ended with the boat sailing off to nowhere...and not with ""Island cannibals"" devouring....everyone...during the credits....This scene was seen by less than 50% of the people at the theatre I was at...because once they saw the credits rolling...the movie sucked so badly...they were up....and out of there...before they even realized there were ""more scenes""!!!!!!<br/><br/>
7. And another thing...that stupidchick that went and got the dog...would have just been one stupid dead girl!!!! I like animals as much as the next guy....but, to people that put them(animals) on the same level as human beings....then ...die with them...she knew the dog would be fine(The Zombies showed no interest...in the dog...when it ran across the mall parking lot).<br/><br/>
The movie had a few redeeming qualities...and they were.<br/><br/>
1.Ving Rhames turned in a powerful performance(as he does in everything he is in)...He is the most talented African-American actor currently on Hollywood payroll. His character...was very impressive...and they even gave us some hindsight as to who his character may have been.<br/><br/>
2.One very awesome soundtrack!!!! I have got to have that opening....song(Sung during the TV mayhem....right before and during the opening credits of the movie)....it sounded like Johnny Cash...if anyone knows what this song is...please let me know.<br/><br/>
3.The scene where they were having the dude across the way....shoot celebrity look-a-likes in the mall parking lot...was absolutely hilarious!!!! Loved it....<br/><br/>
4.The CJ character(head of security)...became very interesting once he began working in support of the group.<br/><br/>
Also; noticed the co-pilot from Jason X's spaceship...on the movie...he is cool.<br/><br/>
But, all in all these few things weren't enough to save this less than mediocre...movie....I give it a 3 out of a possible 10 points.<br/><br/>
I now plan to go out...and rent the original....and see the differences....my girlfriind says she saw the original when it came out in 1978 and that it was very good....we'll see."

"paul_haakonsen","7","3","5","20 January 2016"," A worthy re-make for once...
","Normally I am not particularly keen on re-makes of movies, especially when directors decide to tamper with movies that were already good in the original version. But this being a zombie movie, is almost sufficient in itself to make me look past my contempt for re-makes. But as a re-make of the 1978 original Romero movie ""Dawn of the Dead"", I must admit that director Zack Snyder really impressed.<br/><br/>While there are in overall similarities to the 1978 movie, then director Zack Snyder deviated enough from the original movie to make this 2004 version outstanding and memorable. And he managed to do so without actually embarrassing the George A. Romero legacy. And while there are similarities, then there is even more originality, which makes the 2004 version seem like a very different movie compared to the original.<br/><br/>The story, briefly summarized, is about a group of people cramped together inside a shopping mall with hordes of relentless zombies gathering outside. But with chances of survival dwindling, tempers flare, and things taking unseen twists, the survivors struggle not just against the zombies, but also against themselves.<br/><br/>The effects in Zack Snyder's version were impressive, with lots of great visuals in terms of zombie make-up, wounds and injuries and the special effects throughout the movie. And such effects are crucial when making a zombie movie, and I will say that the special effects and make-up departments really came through in this 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"".<br/><br/>But a lot of credit should also go to the acting talents, as they had some talented people on the cast list. Sarah Polley was really great in her role, and I haven't really taken much notice of her prior to this movie. Ty Burrell, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber were also quite good in their individual roles. Personally, I found it a delight to see Matt Frewer in the movie as well.<br/><br/>""Dawn of the Dead"" is a fast paced movie with lots of entertainment and thrills. Director Zack Snyder managed to present his vision in a way that was captivating and compelling for the audience, and it is difficult not to get swept up into the atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>This 2004 version is well-worthy of a place in the movie collection of any zombie aficionado, and it is likewise well-worthy of a place alongside with Romero's 1978 version."

I credit it and 28 Days Later for really bringing the zombie movie back in an awesome way.¬†<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead does almost everything right. There are some really horrifying events, plenty of scares, a good cast of characters played by capable actors, lots of action, a few moments of levity, and tons of zombie mayhem. It avoids the overwhelming deluge of heavy-handed social commentary that so many zombie movies drown in (Land of the Dead, anyone?), but it's also not just a completely shallow experience.¬†<br/><br/>You can't really go wrong with Dawn of the Dead if you're even slightly a fan of the genre. It starts with a bang from the very beginning, and rarely lets up the intensity. See it."

","Zack Snyder's remake was quite a fun watch. Horror fans will enjoy this one. It's been ages since I last saw the original remake and my memory is a little clouded but this one has some good special effects, decent acting, a nice soundtrack and effective cinematography. Due to high production values, it looks good. I remember that it is not as gruesome as the original wear you can actually see the zombies ripping off body parts of live people and devouring them. The 'good' main characters are quite likable as they are more humane than the stereotypical caricatures one has witnessed numerous times in such films. I was surprised to see Sarah Paulie who has a reputation of being selective with her films. This was quite an unusual choice for her and she did quite well as the heroine. Jake Weber and Ving Rhames are fine too. Overall, it is a good effort by Snyder and an entertaining flick for horror fans."

"gavin6942","7","3","5","17 October 2006"," Less Satire, More Action Than The Original
","A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman, and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Milwaukee shopping mall. <br/><br/>Production company Strike Entertainment (who had connections to distributor Universal) pulled out all the stops for this film. Being a fan of the original George A. Romero film, as we all are, I initially had my doubts about this one. As it turns out, however, by avoiding much of the original story, writer James Gunn helps the film avoid many of the comparisons it would have been subjected to. This is, for all practical purposes, a film of its own. And between my first viewing in 2004 and more recently in 2017, it has only grown in stature.<br/><br/>Gunn's style of work with Troma (""Tromeo and Juliet"") and his later work with ""Slither"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" does not seem to arise much in this film. The humor is more subdued, but I will give him full credit for the Jay Leno / Burt Reynolds target practice scene. Excellent work. To be fair, Gunn actually left the project early to concentrate on ""Scooby-Doo 2"", Michael Tolkin (""The Rapture"") and Scott Frank (""Minority Report"") were brought in for rewriting; Tolkin further developed the characters, while Frank provided some of the bigger and upbeat action sequences. Interestingly, Gunn's ""Slither"" was the next project from producers Strike Entertainment.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder makes his feature film directorial debut, though he had made music videos for Morrissey and Soul Asylum throughout the 1990s, so he was not a complete novice by any means. Interesting, Snyder was born in Green Bay, which may explain why the film is set in Milwaukee. Assisting him is cinematographer Matthew Leonetti, who started out on ""The Bat People"" (1974) but went on to great things with ""Poltergeist"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""Weird Science"" and many others.<br/><br/>All of the acting in this is great, especially Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, so there is no need to even get into that. Polley was Snyder's first choice, actually, which was wise on his part. Nobody stood out as the best, nobody fell short... by horror movies standards everything was kosher. The scenery was also great (it is a mall, it looked like a mall, job done). The zombies? Fantastic! So much better than the original in terms of getting the gore and missing limbs down to a science. Blood today is so much better than it used to be. What you may not know is that the special effects were done by Heather Langenkamp, better known to horror fans as Nancy from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise!<br/><br/>There was some dispute between the producers and Snyder about putting Johnny Cash or Richard Cheese on the soundtrack, with Snyder ultimately prevailing. And I say unto thee, you could not have picked two better artists for the soundtrack. The Cash song (""The Man Comes Around"") set the necessary mood while the opening credits create the back story, and the Cheese song (""The Sickness"") kept the mood lighter when it needed to be (horror films really should not take themselves too seriously). Adding the original ""Sickness"" (by Disturbed) was a nice touch. In fact, the soundtrack as a whole really catapulted this film from good to great -- so we have to thank Snyder for that. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the news footage placed in the movie at the beginning and at later times, especially with Tom Savini (""we have a twitcher"") and Ken Foree (the televangelist). It really gave the movie a more ""real-life"" feel and was a good throwback to ""Night of the Living Dead"" with the radio reports, not to mention giving these ""Living Dead"" icons cameos.<br/><br/>If you are holding back from watching this because you love the original, give it up. This film deserves a solid chance. If it helps, just ignore the fact the title is ""Dawn of the Dead"" -- this film rips off the original film much less than other films try to do. At least here, proper credit is given, but it really is a breed of its own.<br/><br/>The 2017 Scream! Factory Blu-ray is phenomenal and the only home video version worth owning. Take your old DVDs and sell them. Scream! provides a two-disc set f both the theatrical version and the unrated one, both with new 2K scans. The features are packed in -- featurettes, storyboards, audio commentary, deleted scenes. New to this release is behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with several people, including horror royalty Heather Langenkamp and living legend James Gunn."

It plays kind of like a Resident Evil video game, which may or may not be appealing to you. I thought it kicked ass. <br/><br/>This movie jumps right into the action, giving you only about 3 minutes of background and build-up. Anna (played by Canuck Sarah Polley) is a nurse, people start turning into Zombies, and she high-tails it out of her neighborhood. It sounds terse, but it all happens about that fast. She meets up with a few other survivors, and they hide out in the local mall, fighting for survival. Sure, they're stuck in a shopping mall, hiding from hordes of vicious zombies, but think of all the great stuff they can get at Sears! <br/><br/>The oddest thing about this movie is, after we left, I actually had a discussion with my girlfriend about whether or not I would ""kill"" her if she turned into a zombie. Yes, an actual conversation. I couldn't convince her that the only things on a zombie's mind are ""Eat brains"" and ""MEmnNASmAMmNa UHHhhhuhhh""; she was upset that I would do my duty to humanity and destroy the undead version of her. <br/><br/>I think a milestone in any relationship is when you can come to terms with the fact that your partner would eradicate your living corpse - I think I stole that from a Hallmark card."

It doesn't fit the movie at all well if its a horror movie of coarse because it was funny than scary to me.<br/><br/>8. One of the zombies in the mall was eating an other zombie laying on the floor.

"sandydoesntknow","3","4","8","12 September 2005"," Terrible remake of an incredible original
","I read the above review, and wanted to completely disagree with it. As an aficionado of the Zombie genre, I too was extremely excited to see this film released. But I don't think I have ever been quite so disappointed.<br/><br/>The original doesn't need me to describe how incredible it was. I regard it as one of my favourite films in any genre, and certainly the finest horror film ever made. In this big-budget remake they seem to have forgotten the entire premise of zombie films, and just gone all out for action.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue is terrible. The 'civilians' react to events rather more competently than the troops and police do in the first film, the zombies are badly made up, too fast, and overly intelligent, and there is little sense of atmosphere throughout the whole film. The post-credits handy-cam clip is perhaps the only redeeming moment of originality, but too little, too late.<br/><br/>They even tried to use a pregnant zombie/zombie baby for shock value (See Peter Jackson's BrainDead), and they only succeeded in ruined the film further, adding an unnecessary (and probably unintentional) comedy scene.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this: spend the saved money on some alcohol and watch the original again."
"MrGKB","6","4","8","21 August 2005"," Workmanlike re-imagining
","(Edited from a post to IMDb ""DotD04"" BB, with DVD-release emendations in *asterisks*) <br/><br/>In ""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"" Director Zack Snyder has crafted an interesting, though flawed, thrill ride of a film that cribs the scenario---a plague of the reborn dead intent upon devouring the living---and the shopping mall setting of George A. Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead (1978)"", and precious little else. Purist fans may be offended, but this reworking of Romero's consumerist satire is entertaining, if somewhat skimpy on substance; Snyder and screenwriter James Gunn have twisted elements of Romero's story to suit the needs of a revved-up, post-millennial audience. We get a child zombie, but this time right up front and gruesomely disfigured to boot. We get a ""Steve"" to love to hate, but he's not a lead. We get the mall, but it's not as much a haven to be secured as an insecure prison. There's no biker gang breaking in; our heroes are instead forced to break out. The zombies are as hyper as Mikey on four bowls of Life cereal, but just as appropriately gruesome and scary as their cousins doing the Romero shuffle. We get a dose of homage, including a Gaylen Ross storefront and a CGI-flyby of the WGON helicopter. We get Max Headroom as a guy who looks like the original Roger and dies like him, but without the ""I'm going to try...not to come back!"" along with the original Roger as a haggard general, Ken Foree reworking his classic tag line, ""When there's no more room in hell¬Ö"" and Tom Savini chewing scenery as a sheriff. We get a spectacular exploding head, but it pops near the end of the film, and it happens to someone we like. We get an unsettling ""happy"" ending, which is then tagged with a deliberately confusing ""unhappy"" postscript mixed into the credit reel.<br/><br/>What we don't get is much in the way of character development, and next to nothing of Romero's wry social commentary, unless one takes the underlying nihilism of the film to be thoughtful insight. Snyder's inspired opening and title sequences paint an uncompromising nightmare of civil disorder and a failure of authority to deal with crisis. Medical personnel are more dangerous than useful: a doctor shows more interest in golf than an unusual bite case, an ambulance runs down Ana's neighbor. Bus drivers are potential carjackers, the first cop Ana meets points a shotgun in her face, and later, security guards offer anything but. The military tucks its tail into a helicopter and runs, while the broadcast media seem to collapse overnight. Our band of survivors is left to its own devices, and the film's zeitgeist is very much every man for himself. Or as Kenneth says, ""F*** y'all."" <br/><br/>The film leaves more questions open than it grudgingly answers. Some are immaterial (how did the zombie plague originate?), some are niggling irritations (why wasn't Vivian as aggressive as the other zombies? Why do zombies possess the vocal cords of wild animals?), and some are whimsical (why kill a baby zombie; what's it going to do, gum you to death?), but some are crucial to the internal logic of the story. <br/><br/>How did Andy die and do the zombie two-step so fast? *This is explained in the DVD release in a short ""home-video"" as a combination of weakness from starvation and bad luck* Why did Luda take so long to die, compared to the fat lady in the wheelbarrow? Why did the bite victims in Ana's hospital take so long? Where were the zombie children and teenagers? Where were all the other dogs, and why wouldn't zombies eat them? How did Ana and her husband manage to remain unaware of the growing chaos outside their house? Big question: why, once they were secure within the cornucopia of the mall, didn't our protagonists exploit those resources? Why didn't they dress protectively? Why didn't they improvise more weapons, especially flammable ones? Why didn't they scrounge up a short wave radio, or try to access the Internet? *Andy apparently web surfs in his home video, but this avenue is quickly squelched* Why didn't Snyder and Gunn put a little more thought into their story?<br/><br/>Fast zombies are a chilling variation, but they defy the laws of physiology for the sake of frenetic film-making. Snyder and Gunn have catered to the eMpTyV, short-attention-span crowd and jazzed-up Romero's much more disturbing shamblers, if not for the sake of hectic-editing junkies, then as justification for the swift spread of zombie infestation. One can only guess how Andy barricaded his shop so quickly. *Even the home video ignores this* Fast zombies (or ""zoombies,"" as one inspired IMDb BB writer dubbed them) surely expend more energy than slow ones; flesh and bone breaks down without refueling, and corpses don't have much in the way of fresh oxygen and nutrients. Eyes cloud when fluids dry up. Joints stiffen; internal organs shrivel. Suspension of disbelief falls by the wayside.<br/><br/>Despite its plot flaws and questionable character development *some of which is mended in the DVD director's cut*, I enjoyed this reworking of Romero's seminal classic. Some of the visual effects were less than convincing, but the make-up was effective, the acting was commendable, the overall apocalyptic vision was well-realized, and the storytelling was well-paced, if problematic. I enjoyed revisiting the delicious horrors of zombie invasion, but---and it may simply be because I am now a quarter century older and that much more jaded---""Dawn'04"" didn't give me nightmares like the original did. If I had to pick one of the two for a desert island DVD collection, it would have to be Romero's inspired, shoestring-budget masterpiece over Snyder's pricier, workmanlike debut any day of the dead, pun fully intended. Still, I give ""Dawn'04"" a 6 out of 10; it's nearly as frenetic as the zombies with which it's populated, but just as empty-headed as well."

"TheTrick","6","4","8","24 March 2004"," Not bad, not great
","I went into Dawn of the Dead 2004 with fairly high expectations, being a moderate fan of Romero's original trilogy. What I got was a completely different film that is good for completely different reasons. It's impossible to avoid drawing comparisons between this film and the 1978 film that inspired it because, let's face it, they consciously decided to slap the same name on it. If they had just set the movie in a police station or something, they wouldn't have had to bother paying for the name. But I guess that's just the point; the title has built-in recognition going for it.<br/><br/>That said, this is not nearly the abomination that other recent remakes have been (Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind). It has lots of great action pieces, better actors than the original, and even some nice plot additions such as a character stuck on the roof of a gunshop across the street from the mall. You actually end up caring about the guy even though you only hear his voice in one brief scene.<br/><br/>The violence is certainly also potent, which I suppose some people will be looking for in a horror movie. I found myself terribly annoyed by the quick-cutting music-video style editing in the action scenes, but it's still a whole lot better than some other recent remakes (Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind). What I admired about Romero's films, however, is that the camera never doubts the potency of a scene, and simply shows the action in mostly still frames. Romero sets up a scene, let's it happen, and then moves on. The beauty is in its simplicity. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is like a hyper-active child, which some people will surely appreciate over its wiser, if somewhat sluggish, grandfather. It's all a matter of taste.<br/><br/>As many other have argued, however, I did miss the original's depth and satirical sense of humour. Some may argue that it was cheesy, but I still see that as being the point. Sure, it had suspense, blood, and violence, but it was never an out-right scarefest. And, you know... I don't think there was anything wrong with that. I could understand if director Zack Snyder wanted to up the adrenaline a little, but why did all the characters have to become shallow caricatures? If the original Dawn had one strength, I would say that it respects its main four characters as human beings rather than throwing them into the fray for little purpose except to become zombie-fodder. Romero allowed us time to get to know his characters, understand their motivations, their weaknesses, their relationships, etc. Having 16 (or whatever number) people tossed into the mall over a mere hour and a half restricts character development (CJ suddenly turning nice doesn't count since he was a cartoon to begin with) and severely lessens the impact when things start to go wrong.<br/><br/>And that's another thing... As much as I hate to cram the whole ""Romero's social commentary about consumerism"" thing down more peoples' throats, its absence leaves no good reason for these characters to hide out in a mall. People in the theatre actually broke out laughing around me when one of the characters says something along the lines of, ""Hey, let's go to the mall!"" The mall isn't even in sight and so it seems like a ludicrously random destination, and probably not the safest at that. Snyder's undead seem even faster and stronger than when they were alive, so I can't imagine that 2000 (there are a lot of zombies in this film) of them wouldn't have been able to break through the mall's glass doors. Finally, although Dawn 2004 had its share of jokes, it was not as tongue-in- cheek as the original, which I thought was sorely missed. People may say the pie fight was stupid... I say it was funny. People may say the guy checking his blood pressure (while being eaten) was stupid... I say it was funny. Even the individual zombies in this film weren't vaguely memorable. You never see any of them up close for more than 2 seconds because the editing is always so fast. You always just see them as a moving mass. Fans of the original will know right away what I mean when I talk about the ghetto-apartment-huband zombie, the helicopter-sliced zombie, the zombie with the gun, the kid zombies, the bride zombie, the hare krishna zombie, etc. The zombies of Dawn 2004 are a faceless, anonymous mass. Maybe that's scarier, I don't know, but it's definitely not more interesting for someone who just wants to see some zombies.<br/><br/>Enough harping though. In summary, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is definitely not the Dawn we've always known, but if you close your eyes during the credits (missing the title), you might enjoy it just fine as a fun, mindless action/horror flick."
"adsti3","10","4","8","16 March 2004"," Awesome! But not too faithful to the original.
","This tremendously entertaining picture strikes a great balance between scares, apocalyptic bleakness, and violent action.  The bravura opening sequence of utter chaos leads into a more subdued, but intermittently intensely violent and gruesome narrative.  The movie never sells itself out to sappiness while retaining some of the original's macabre sense of humor, especially in the ""Burt Reynolds"" scene.  The leads are strong, if not deeply developed; things are happening too quickly to delve deeper into these character's backgrounds, but we still care about them, because each of them, down to the gun-shop owner, possesses a humanity and individuality that sets them apart from the brain-thirsty hordes.<br/><br/>Elements of the original are retained, from the secure ennui of the mall to the final journey into the unknown, but this is really its own movie, with the intensity ratcheted up to satisfy audiences used to the rapid-fire thrills of a video game.  The editing and camerawork are reminiscent of _Seven_ and _28 Days Later_, but fit the subject matter perfectly.  An exceptional genre picture."

I am a huge fan of the original, I even wore my Dawn Of The Dead shirt made to honor the original to see the remake last night, but I believe that the remake has got it beat by its entertainment and production values. The original will always be a classic, and was the model for pretty much all zombie movies after it to follow, and, until I saw its remake last night, I felt it was the greatest zombie movie ever.

The only positive things in the movie are two scenes, first and foremost the credits are a joy to watch, and secondly the scene where the girl is thrown into the bath tub, VERY realistic I thought. It's very sad in today's world that the only way a movie can be interesting is if it contains high amounts of blood and violence, I would much prefer to watch a movie that messes with my head and has a seemingly plausible plot, this movie does not fit that criteria."

"a_chinn","8","2","3","14 July 2019"," Unneeded remake is surprisingly good and satisfying for fans of the original
","Surprisingly good remake of the George A. Romeo zombie apocalypse classic. It's tricky doing a remake of a beloved cult classic, so when I originally went to the theater to watch this film, I went in expecting to hate it, especially since the film was written by the same guy who wrote the terrible live-action Scooby Doo movie, along with some first-time director I'd never heard of and who'd only done music videos and commercials. However, right from the opening moments of the film, with a quiet suburban neighborhood quickly descending into a fight for survival from zombie hoards to when the opening credits roll to Johnny Cash singing ""When the Man Comes"" around, I was hooked! Little did I know that writer James Gunn would go on to write other terrifically smart and subversive mainstream genre films like ""Slither,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" as well as the little seen low budget films like ""Super"" and ""The Belko Experiment"" and that director Zach Snyder would go on to tackle (more successfully than you'd expect) other sacred cows such as ""The Watchmen"" and ""Man of Steel."" Compared to Romero's original, this remake is minus the political subtext Romero infused into all of his zombie films, but it does manage to capture the original film's balance of comedy and horror. Both films are for the most part straight faced horror films, punctuated with moments of levity and black humor. The remake delved less into the audience fantasy aspect of getting to have the run of a shopping mall (similar to ""Night of the Comet""), but the humor Gunn placed into his script was arguably much more witty when compared to Romero's more pie-in-the-face style of slapstick comedy. The remake also boasts a strong cast that includes Sarah Polley (a nurse), Ving Rhames (a cop), Mekhi Phifer (an expectant father), Jake Weber (a nice guy), Ty Burrell (a rich jerk), and Michael Kelly (a mall cop). Another charm of the film for fans of the original is that while it does deviate from the original in many ways (running zombie instead of slow zombies, changing most of the characters and scenarios, and keeping really only the basic concept of people holding up in a mall during a zombie apocalypse), the filmmakers included many Easter eggs and nods to the original films, including a truck crashing into a diner (a nod to a story shared by Ben in the original film) or the mall being named after the lead actress in the original film, or cameo appearances by the three stars of the original film (Scott H. Reiniger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree), and many others. Overall, the world did not need or ask for a ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, but Gunn and Synder managed defy my fanboy reservations and won me over to their new vision of Romero's horror classic. Well worth watching for fans of contemporary zombie films as well as for fans of the old school original film."

","""Dawn of the Dead"" is, in a precarious way, one of the films that most resemble the classic films of Romero, a simple, voracious movie with traits of humor and terror, with gore, bizarre, suspense and character, a classic apocalypse, with all the well-defined symptoms and ingrained by the beloved and hated Zack Snyder, who already in his first feature already began to demonstrate his traits and exaggerations of unique directions, even if still timid.
Snyder has very well defined his script, he chooses to tell the story of a group of people, so he does not give an explanation about the apocalypse and does not extend much about the destruction of our civilization, this is summarized in an excellent clip of 5 minutes to the sound of a country classic and Snyder already defines in the first minutes the initial nucleus of the group of survivors, that in the future changes, however, the character developments are still in that first group, which gives an idea that the focus of the script was to play with the end-of-the-world issue in people, an interesting and well-made decision.
Snyder uses the script for the film, which is about the zombie instinct, when the world ends, hundreds of them go to the mall, an interesting question, we are alienated alive and dead, but none of this is the focus of the movie. to test many cinematographic techniques - such as the final post-credit - that would eventually make their mark, such as slow cameras, medium framing, gray photography, good use of soundtrack, and redemption of characters.
Zack Snyder knew how to explore the bizarre and the comic in a film, which although little known, is extremely important because it has caused a huge influence and has become a source of inquiries the inspiration for the gaming industry. We have a very close and assertive zombie apocalypse movie that is worth watching, especially for fans of the genre."

Well, to cut a long story short ‚Äì in this installment of a classic zombie horror everything is changed, but it is still ""Dawn Of The Dead"" ‚Äì Turbo Edition now. Let us recall what original movie is. George A. Romero' s ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is an epic zombie horror with a strong elements of satire and social criticism. There's a lot of space to think and to interpret, but there's also a lot of character development and (of course, bloody) action. And ‚Äì this is the first thing you should keep in mind while watching this remake ‚Äì new ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the more bloody, more gory and more action-packed version of a Romero's tale.

But (and one must always remember this) this is not a shot-by-shot re- edition of a classic; it is a retelling of classic story for a new generation. It is, therefore, a completely different film, even if it uses legacy from the predecessor. George Romero made a story about mindless consumer society (with zombies). Zack Snyder made a story about zombie apocalypse (with some surviving people)."
"bowmanblue","10","2","3","15 February 2015"," A remake they actually got right
","It's become very fashionable to knock every single remake/reboot/re-envisioning that Hollywood comes up with. The idea it that they basically take a film that was popular a few years ago and film it again. Although what's churned out has very little to do with the source material apart from the name. It normally ends up being a soulless attempt at cashing in on the original's success via its name.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is one of the (few) exceptions to the rule.<br/><br/>The original George Romero version is largely considered as the best zombie film going. It is indeed epic in length and has a smattering of social commentary regarding people's obsession with consumerism and spending all their time in shopping malls. The 2004 remake still has the zombies and the mall and, although some Romero die-hards will lament the lack of social commentary, most will appreciate it as a truly modern re-telling of the story. At least quite a few of the old 1979 version's cast make cameo appearances in the new version (playing new parts) which give us 'old school fanatics' a few in jokes to pick up on.<br/><br/>Perhaps the 2004 version has its roots in the English film 28 Days Later which took the concept of zombies (or 'infected' as they were technically known) and made them run. Gone are the 1979 slow-moving 'shufflers' and here are some really nasty zombies who will even chase down a fast-moving car in order to rip apart their human prey.<br/><br/>The 2004 version also has more characters. Granted some are a bit under-developed, but the majority play their parts well. The director, Zack Snyder, also deserves some credit at putting his own stylish spin on the direction, giving it a distinctive 'look' about it which elevates it over its numerous competitors.<br/><br/>Granted Dawn of the Dead 2004 is not perfect. There are a few moments where daft things happen which are purely there to move along the plot and not really based on what would actually happen in such a situation. These faults I believe lie with the screenwriter. If you listen to the director's commentary, even he questions the characters' (and even zombies') motives for doing what they do. However, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a case of there is so much good and right about it, that I think most people should be able to see past the few flaws and just enjoy it for simply being a decent action/horror film.<br/><br/>If you only want to see one modern zombie film, I'd watch this one (or 28 Days Later, but, as any zombie enthusiast will tell you, there's NO zombies in 28 Days Later... technically)."

Some things that could have been altered include saving a main character that got bit and chose to be left behind, the rather awful ending mixed with credits, the majority of the people dying, a better definition for what caused the outbreak, the use of amputation to save a life, slower walking or at least worse postured and unbalanced (uncoordinated) zombies, the desire for the zombies to eat any creature not just human, less of an unrealistic explosion with propane, and more. <br/><br/>Overall this remake picks up and leaves alone some important aspects that the original covers, and the two movies make great buddies.

","The original DOTD is one of my Top 3 favorite horror films of alltime so I was bound to be disappointed in the remake but it was actually a little better than I expected. If you're looking for a slick, glossy and gory zombie film you'll be pleased. Actually, younger audiences and people who haven't seen the original DOTD might like the film more. The intro (first 10 minutes or so) and end credits sequences are both brilliant and make the film worth watching all by itself.<br/><br/>I guess my big criticism is that the DOTD remake should've been a stand-alone film because it has almost NOTHING to do with the original, other than zombies the mall setting. Except the zombies in the first film were slow, lumbering and relentless. The zombies in this film are fast, rabid, and quite derivative of 20 Days Later. The mall setting in the first film was used to satirize consumer culture. The mall in this version of DOTD is just a setting - the characters in this film could have holed up anywhere, because the remake complete eliminates all of the subtext of the first film.<br/><br/>Some good gore, a few scares and the most inspired intro and end credits I've seen in a horror film in a while, but whereas the original DOTD was funny and smart in addition to being horrifying, this version is slick, shallow and has nothing to say."

To me it was a new impulse, a new element to present zombies rather like rabid-raging fast animals, than slow-mo man-eaters who mainly get dangerous in numbers; now even a single one can kill. That's new and cool. <br/><br/>There's basically not much to say about zombie-flicks, everybody knows the deal. The only question is: ""Was it good or bad?"" or to express it properly: ""Have you been thrilled and entertained clever but without brains?"" The answer here is simple and not negotiable: ""Yes!"" <br/><br/>If after only 10 minutes the whole neighborhood is burning down, the world tumbles into devastation and they are playing Johnny Cash, then... yes well, then I'm supposed to love the movie.<br/><br/>When I dragged my buddies into the theater (I had already seen it 2 days before), some asked me: ""Man, are you certain? I don't know."" I paused, smiled and just replied: ""Trust me."" In recent years I've come away of saying that, because it can end in a nosedive for the expertise-rep among one's friends. Here I was absolutely sure. It was the attacking girl which suddenly emptied all their popcorn-buckets after 6 minutes; theater-staff must have hated this film. After the end-credits they were all strung-out but happy; me too even by the second time. <br/><br/>Another good point here were a bunch of fine and not too known actors and also a script which allows the characters to avoid the typical horror-movie-mistakes we gotten annoyed of through the years: ""Aw, Sally is gone. Let's all take flashlights, spread out in the woods and search her."" Yeah. Right. Die you idiots. And take the authors with you. Or when finally an armory is found, this idiotic pattern to take a shotgun, bash the ammo-box on the table so all shells spread away, grab three shells into the pocket (instead of directly loading) and go, as seen for an instance in ""Jurassic Park"".<br/><br/>These guys are smarter, their ideas are good (see escape-plan), once in a gun-shop they're truly gearing up, and parts of the group finally only fail by a tragic accident (anyway: secure your working-space! I told you once, I told you twice...). The end leaves the survivors fate open; good for a sequel but not necessarily.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to see that the DVD is available since 2006 uncut for 8,- Euros (approx. 5$). Nevertheless I'd even say that ""DOTD"" is one of the few zombie-flicks which is recommendable to be seen on the big screen. <br/><br/>Other Recommendations: ""28 weeks later"", ""Resident Evil I"" (screw the sequels), ""Rec"" (Spain 2007), ""Night Of The Living Dead"" (1990), ""Evil Dead II"", ""The Descent"" (UK 2005, Hello Bigwolf ;-)), ""Shaun Of The Dead (UK 2004)."

","A mysterious virus is bringing the dead back to life as vicious re-animated corpses that go fast and feed upon the living. One morning, a nurse (Sarah Polly) escapes from her house after her husband was turned into a zombie as she escapes on the road only to be later crashed without being killed. She teams up with a reluctant police officer (Ving Rhames) whom helps her up and joins with other human survivors (Mekhi Pfeifer, Ty Burrell, Lindy Booth, Jake Weber, Michael Kelly, and Kevin Zegers) as they seek shelter in a large shopping mall. Unfortunately there is a few monsters inside that can be eliminated by a bullet to the skull, as now the living must try to survive as they battle out with the killer dead and try to find a way to escape.<br/><br/>When i first heard back in late 2003 when George A. Romero's masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1979 was going to be remade, i was really upset. I mean why mess with something that wasn't even broke in the first place? sheesh, then when i saw the trailer to it, i thought it might not be so bad. Afterall the original 1979 version is one of my favorite movies of all time, i did went to see this version in the theater and was pleasantly surprised of how well this was well made. This is a spectacular update of George A. Romero's classic and worked just like the 1990 remake to ""Night of the Living Dead"" , this movie offers great performances by the cast and marks the debut of visionary Zack Sydner who gave us ""300"" and the upcoming ""Watchmen"". this movie is loaded with action and over the top gore like exploding heads, implements and of course the zombies here are fast like in the tradition of ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Nightmare City"", ""Lifeforce"" or ""The Stuff"". Although it misses out on the excellent social satire that made the original the classic it was, but this is a brilliant and fun re-imagining that is a solid winner."

"Danielramos16","10","2","3","20 June 2008"," A horror Masterpiece that equals the original
","This is the age of the Remake. I don't know exactly when it started but remaking a classic movie seems to be the hip trend in Hollywood these days. Tragically most of the remakes have sucked royally, some even stain the legacy of the originals. Dawn of the dead (2004) is a fine example of how to do a kick ass remake! Not only do we have a good remake of a classic horror film, but we have a horror classic in it's own right. <br/><br/>I saw an interview with the director Zach Snyder who said something I thought was brilliant about doing the Dawn of the dead remake; ""The Original is a classic, so I didn't want to do anything to step on the toes of that, so we took the basic premise of a bunch of people holed up in a mall during a zombie apocalypse and wrote a story around that"". I thought that was very smart & thoughtful cause what he ended up doing was taking the concepts from the original and making a movie that would stand on it's own feet, and not be seen as something that was trying to imitate the original.<br/><br/>I think this is arguably the best zombie movie ever made, because for once we finally see a zombie movie that shows the horror of a zombie apocalypse from the very beginning. The very first few minutes of the movie are great because it seems like just another day, but you can see the unsettling signs that something bad is about to happen. You really feel like this is the calm before the storm, then suddenly all F*****g hell breaks loose! The little girl walking into the bed room all messed up is so shocking. The action grabs you by the throat, the suspense doesn't let up, there is always a sense of terror around the corner. What also gets me is the humor, there are moments that are really funny. When the characters say something humorous you really do laugh cause it just comes across as so casual and like something that my friends would say. The characters came across as real people, They all gave pretty convincing & genuine performances.<br/><br/>What make this film so bad ass are the zombies. I know purists insist that slow moving zombies are better and more realistic, put that's so traditional & normal from every classic zombie film. This movie has Zombies that are fast! Snyder described it perfectly, when the zombies see food they go after it! their like wild carnivorous animals and that makes this film so scary. Face it, slow zombies are weak and you can get away from them, hell you could take on three of them with no problem. But you couldn't get away or take on the zombies in this film. They also looked very realistic, they looked dead, look at the Dawn of the dead special feature where they explain how they did the zombie make up. The make-up for the zombies was magnificent and intelligently thought out.<br/><br/>As amazing and as hard to believe as it sounds, Dawn of the Dead (2004) stands side by side with Dawn of the dead (1978) as classic horror films. As revolutionary & classic the original was to it's era, this remake does the same with our generation. I left the theater thinking ""Now that's how you make a Zombie movie"""

And in a next few minutes he'll die, and be reanimated as a zombie like your little neighbor! <br/><br/>Welcome to the Milwaukee county neighborhood.

And if you're a Romero fan or have read the book The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks, you'll know that sh*t happens when zombies attack! <br/><br/>Directed by Zack ""Spartan"" Snyder, this movie tells about Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Webber, Mekhi Phifer, Inna Korobkina, Lindy Booth and 3 more people entering a mall, having fun inside the mall, and getting out of the mall.<br/><br/>The zombies. what about them? Well, they bite people, and they'll bite anyone in sight who is people. And you know what? They're fast! As in an Olympic runner fast. All thanks to Danny Boyle for inventing such brilliant creatures, first seen in 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>The script? Well, it's the same thing from the original, except that there's no racism, and they added a cause for the zombie outbreak: virus. Which is good, since the almighty original points no reason for the outbreak, which has made everyone go cliffhanger in the end of the film.<br/><br/>THe verdict: Great film. Forget Resident Evil, or Land of the Dead. If you're looking for zombies, shopping, hot girls, and a cast member from Pulp Fiction, this one's for you.

"SiliconJon","10","2","3","11 November 2006"," The Best Zombie Movie I Have Ever Watched
","I am a fan of zombie movies to begin with, as I find myself engrossed in the very concept itself. While the original was great, this is the kind of remake that shines so brightly with skill and performance at all levels. Improved in this movie are the cinematography, editing, acting, and storyline.<br/><br/>Unlike too many (but not all) other zombie flicks, the zombies in this film are relatively agile, and thus pose a believable threat to those who remain un-undead. No brisk walking speed will keep you away from these infected creeps. This aspect alone is a great welcome to the zombie genre, though this film is not the first to implement this feature. This is the first zombie flick I have seen that incorporates a high quality storyline, and attention to detail. Not missed are the plot points that merely occur to fill film space, as events unfold with good cause, and not that ""it just happened"" rubbish that inflicts poorly created film art. Also of great skill are the technical aspects, giving great special effects, superb editing, and a director that kept his eye on the details.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of zombie movies for any reason other than an aversion to gore, then this is a great film for your zombie cherry to be broken. If you are a fan of zombie movies, I would fail to see any reason this film would do anything short of astonish and terrify you."

Even if you're not a fan of horror movies, this is definitely a must-see, because when you look past the ""blood and guts"", all you see is an amazing piece of work.<br/><br/>This film comes highly recommended... not only for excellent acting and casting, but also directing and presentation of an awesome story."

All the characters and plot are very much different. One think this should be viewed as it's own film and any die hard fan of Romero's classic should go in with an open mind.<br/><br/>This movie has one of the greatest opening's of any horror film ever made.

","As a film buff, I love movies. As a horror movie buff, I love horror movies. However, I have been saddened by the lack of decent horror flicks. Most of them have been mediocre at best. But now, here comes the dawn of a horror movie that is, dare i say it, AMAZING!!!!! The casting of mostly unknown stars was ideal for this movie and served the plot better than if Uma Thurman or Nicole Kidman played the leading lady. Instead, this is an ensemble driven movie, which it should feel like if survivors are uniting together against the undead. I actually felt compassion towards each and every character. The script was impeccable and the direction even better. The acting of all the unknown stars was fabulous and I LOVED the roles of Ana and that cynical guy with the boat ( I forgot his name). All of the situations felt so fresh and it never felt like I was watching a remake. The cinematography blew me away and some of the most intimate shots used with zombies actually added another dynamic to the static and boring character of a zombie. My only real gripe was that the whole Grandma showdown thing felt a little too ""wild west"" for me and that after the opening sequence and titles, the whole movie started off very slowly, which was strange considering there was a whole outbreak of zombies. other than that, i thought that this movie was awesome. My favorite horror movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. A DEFINITE MUST SEE AND A MUST BUY FOR HORROR FANS"
"nethlyn","9","2","3","9 September 2005"," Zombies are once again your metaphor for whatever, and in this case, it's more like Aliens than Romero's original - in a good way.
","*****SLIGHT SPOILERS***** Watched both the cinema cut and now have the Director's version on DVD, this film probably has 1000 comments after 18 months but having watched it three times since buying the DVD one thing struck me...for all its homages to the original Dawn of the Dead with the cameos etc, this movie actually owes much more to Aliens (1986) in its speed, execution, and the fact there's a bigger group of people, not to mention of course the running Zombies of 28 Days Later (2003), itself a heavy ""borrowing"" of Day of The Dead (1985), but whose $45million US gross allowed this remake to exist.<br/><br/>It's not a question of thinking the original or the remake is the superior version...Romero's Dawn of the Dead 1978 is the ""Alien"" of the two films, slower, more intelligent, more thought-provoking and with an attempt to actually show you a six-month stretch locked in a shopping mall with a 40-minute second act which modern filmmakers just don't do anymore. Snyder's Dawn of The Dead 2004 is Aliens, (or Platoon in a shopping mall) an action film with Zombies in it but the Zombies are a metaphor for whatever you want and not what Romero told you as with the 70s film.<br/><br/>The ""rules"" have been set up, but in comes a director who focuses on action and gives a bigger group of people better aim and the hope of a better chance (though that also means a larger group of people to bite the dust). In spite of the mall scenes dominating the second Act as with the original, you get a greater sense of scale with the new film although no mention of the internet except in one of the DVD Extras. One of the rules of the original is also dropped. I prefer the Dawn of the Dead novel to the older film, which only takes me 2 hours to read.<br/><br/>As for the director's cut...some scenes I plain couldn't remember but on having them pointed out, I was glad they were gone when I watched the film in the cinema - I don't care how they got into the mall, the film language did that for me with just two good shots cut together, rather than the ""where's the door"" nonsense. Likewise with the ""littlest Zombie"" scene (fans know which one I'm talking about) - again, in the cinema, we saw as much as we needed to know and the faster cutaway was a lot better to end it.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***I don't know if it's classed as a blooper when one character at a crucial moment, cannot open a door but then when it's time for him to check out, the zombies have absolutely no trouble - that's the one fault I could find with the film and I have had to watch it four times to find that, so I will put that down to nitpicking. Besides, Universal have my money now! <br/><br/>The ending? Speculative and the whole (surviving) cast were signed to the sequel, as their careers don't seem to have been damaged in the same way as the 1970s cast, there wouldn't be anything wrong with the sequel to this remake coming around again - even if ***SPOILER AGAIN*** the end had shades of Deep Rising to it, mixed with The Blair Witch Project in the use of DV. It's clever that you're seeing a different side of a character just through clips - or maybe just reconfirming his reputation. One of the DVD Extras continues the use of the DV Camera technique and it works extremely well.<br/><br/>As a means of passing time while waiting for Land of The Dead which doesn't hit UK screens until the 23rd September, the Dawn Of The Dead remake is a great action movie with zombies in it, and made by a fan for open-minded fans of Romero's films and a new generation which doesn't put Romero's trilogy on a pedestal and wants a faster film. You could watch either version according to your mood. It's certainly not the disaster some of the posters here have made out to be, the only problem is, can you rent the cinema cut where you are? I've only found the director's one in the shops. Wait for the second UK edition and you'll probably be able to buy both."

"janar_ks","9","2","3","18 August 2004"," Worthwhile to see
","It had a really good start. Very terrifying. The tense was nevertheless palpable all throughout the movie. Characters were also very fine, no overplaying. There wasn't much text, but I didn't miss it - all the explanations. The drama, that was between the characters, was enough and well-played, unlike most American movies in my opinion. There was also not much time to pause and think very long during the movie, about what is going to happen to all these people on the roof. Everything went on smoothly and quickly, although in between I somehow seemed to miss some of the development, for example when did they decide to escape through the underground garage in the mall.<br/><br/>The attempt failed, regarding some addition to the dead army. In conclusion I wish I hadn't seen the ending subtitles of the movie:) , then I wouldn't of known, what was going to happen to them on that island. I would have gone to bed, knowing the survivors lived through the tragedy, that fell upon human kind (""when hell is full, dead walk the ground""), although that would have made Dawn of the Dead just another usual ""happy-ending story"". Then again, I stress, this is definitely not some usual ""bad-ending story"" too! Every movie has to have an ending of some kind. I liked the music. It's hardly likely they survived on that island. But of course it's everyone's imagination.."
"ouunknowngirl","6","2","3","20 March 2004"," Some good twists, but overall a disappointment as a remake
","If you can forget this is a remake, it's not bad for an ""escape"" movie. It's got enough gore and action to keep you entertained, but for a moderate stretch in the middle where not much happens.  The opening sequence is absolutely terrifying, and pulled me right in with it's chaotic apocalyptic nightmare.  Once the characters get to the ""mall,"" however, things slow down to a pace that makes me a little bored.<br/><br/>The audience is never made to feel like the zombies outside are a real threat to the living in the mall.  The atmosphere is not bleak-- rather, you can almost forget about what's happening outside as the characters have fun inside the mall.  There's even comic relief (there were no comic moments in the original; it was completely dark).  I suppose this part of the movie was supposed to be about character development, but the movie even fails at that.  Most of the character development is shallow, stereotypical, and it is difficult to understand the motivations behind some of the characters' actions.<br/><br/>While it may seem like I hated the movie, the last thirty minutes or more are edge-of-your-seat thrilling, so the payoff is good.  As far as comparing this movie with the original, I would definitely call this movie a disappointment.  It's too flashy!  There is slick heavy metal music, blatant product placement, comedy, and cheap attempts to make you feel emotional without anything deep or philosophical under it.  The original made you feel as if something terrible had happened to humanity.  This film only makes you feel as if something terrible has happened to the characters in the film, most of which you could care less about."
"Gafke","10","2","3","20 March 2004"," VERY Well Done!
","I've seen the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" I loved the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" I loved this one too, probably because I didn't see it as a remake, I simply accepted it as an updated retelling. I can also accept the fact that both of these movies ARE JUST MOVIES! So, I'm going to skip the purist arguments and just review the damn film.<br/><br/>In the first five minutes of ""Dawn of the Dead"" we are introduced to the blase, perfectly normal ho-hum life of a nurse named Ana, who just wants to go home after a long shift and see her man. They have a nice, quiet evening together and fall asleep in each others arms without a care in the world. The next five minutes that follow Ana into the next morning are a violent, brutal shock. Instant carnage erupts as the little girl next door attacks Ana's man. Infected and mortally wounded, he turns on Ana. Within two minutes of awakening from a peaceful sleep, Ana is blood drenched and in shock, hurling herself out of the bathroom window only to see a world gone mad. Her peaceful neighborhood is in ruins, her neighbors are the undead insane, feasting on the few living left. As she escapes the burning ruin of her safe little world, the camera pulls back and gives us a glorious crane shot of apocalypse. The distant city is ablaze, the roads are overrun with ghouls. There is nowhere to go. It is indeed an awe inspiring, overwhelming sight. There is no safe place left. The feeling of isolation and growing fear is enormous. <br/><br/>From there, the movie centers on the refuge of a local shopping mall, which is littered with clever in-jokes that are never pointed out or lingered on too long. (The Gaylen Ross store? Nice...) The survivors gather together hesitantly, each eyeing the other with suspicion. There is no time to grieve for the dead with survivors straggling in, some injured, some not...and some on the way to ZombieLand. No one knows who to trust, and not everyone is what they seem. They still manage to forge hesitant friendships and there are some genuinely comic moments involving a long-distance chess game, the bored mallers taking target practice on some appropriately nicknamed zombies, and a great rendition of Disturbed's ""The Sickness"" performed Lounge Style. Finally, after a horrific quadruple death scene which wipes out an entire family, the survivors can take no more. They have a plan to escape and make for the ocean, and from there to a distant and unoccupied island far away from the overrun mainland. <br/><br/>This movie certainly owes much to the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" but there are also touches of ""Day of the Dead"" and Fulci's ""Zombi 2"" here as well. All in all, this film succeeds. It is strong enough to stand apart from the original. It may not bypass it, but it is a powerful entry in the zombie genre. The gore is understated, though brutally shocking when it does make its appearance. The real drive of the story here are the characters. These are not meat-for-the- grinder disposable heroes at all; they are very real, and very sympathetic. I found it very easy to imagine myself in their situation, and this is the films strength. The performances are wonderful, totally believable and the sorrow very genuine when one of the cast falls. There ARE truly fates worse than death, and this films shows you every last one. This is NOT a film about zombies. This is a film about staying sane in a world gone mad. <br/><br/>Despite a downbeat ending (for anyone who sat through the end credits, that is...) this is a film I would see again and again....just like the original."
"dbborroughs","8","2","3","20 March 2004"," Not Your Mother's Zombie Film
","To compare the two Dawn of the Dead films is unfair. Twenty five years have passed and there is no doubt that what passes for a R rated film today would have been X rated when the original came out (and vice versa). The two films also have very little in common other than the  basic premise.<br/><br/>Where the original film had more than being scary on its mind this new film is more concerned with building tension. The zombies, instead of being slow moving beasts of the original, move with the speed of a track star, so there really is a reason to fear them, you either kill them or they will kill you giving you no time to run. This will either thrill you or make you scream in pain. Personally I think it works since it explains why things fall apart so fast.<br/><br/>The new film, like the old film, is not with out its flaws, they just occur in different places.<br/><br/>If you want to see a really good horror/action film that takes its source material and does something other tan resting on its laurels with it, see this movie. However, be warned it is as bloody as the first in its own way.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 (which is what I'd give the original)"

It just feels wrong... No nihilistic feeling of dread and depression like the first Romero's trilogy. Oh, and the zombies aren't slow, they run. Then the second part of the movie starts, and things finally get together... What you get in second part is practically ""Left 4 Dead"" in a movie, which is no surprise, because the movie probably served as an inspiration for the game. And while it lasts, it's awesome... Aaaand, then they ruin it with the credits scene. I can understand why people like it, and on it's own, it's OK movie, but compared to the original, it's bad.

","This is a good remake is not better then the original film of course George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978) is a classic but this film is a good follower and Sarah Polley is fantastic in her role. This is the only good movie Zack Snyder has ever done and I have been watching a lot this movie. I have it on Blu-ray disc and this film was really the first zombie film I saw before I purchase an watch the original film.<br/><br/>The special effects were done by Heather Langenkamp from a Nightmare on Elm Street ,A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and New Nightmare. My favorite heroine Nancy Thompson did special effects for the zombies for this movie. This is my all time favorite zombie horror film that I have watch it more then once Ving Rhames is also good likable character much better then he was in Undisputed.<br/><br/>A mysterious virus is bringing the dead back to life as vicious re-animated corpses that go fast and feed upon the living. One morning, a nurse (Sarah Polly) escapes from her house after her husband was turned into a zombie as she escapes on the road only to be later crashed without being killed. She teams up with a reluctant police officer (Ving Rhames) whom helps her up and joins with other human survivors (Mekhi Pfeifer, Ty Burrell, Lindy Booth, Jake Weber, Michael Kelly, and Kevin Zegers) as they seek shelter in a large shopping mall. Unfortunately there is a few monsters inside that can be eliminated by a bullet to the skull, as now the living must try to survive as they battle out with the killer dead and try to find a way to escape.<br/><br/>When i first heard back in late 2003 when George A. Romero's masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1978 was going to be remade, i was really upset. I mean why mess with something that wasn't even broke in the first place? Then when i saw the trailer to it, i thought it might not be so bad. Afterall the original 1978 version is one of my favorite movies of all time, i did went to see this version in the theater and was pleasantly surprised of how well this was well made.<br/><br/>This is a spectacular update of George A. Romero's classic and worked just like the 1990 remake to ""Night of the Living Dead"" , this movie offers great performances by the cast and marks the debut of visionary Zack Sydner who gave us ""300"" and the upcoming ""Watchmen"". this movie is loaded with action and over the top gore like exploding heads, implements and of course the zombies here are fast like in the tradition of ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Nightmare City"", ""Lifeforce"" or ""The Stuff"". Although it misses out on the excellent social satire that made the original the classic it was, but this is a brilliant and fun re-imagining that is a solid winner.<br/><br/>Score A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but the original George A. Romero movie is way better but for 2004 this I a great horror film."
"davispittman","8","1","1","15 April 2017"," Pretty well made remake
","I won't be comparing this remake to the original dawn of the dead film because I haven't seen it. I'm just going to review it as a regular movie as if it wasn't even a remake. The movie begins with a nurse at her suburban home with her husband. They go to sleep and the next morning she finds a neighborhood girl that has been turned into a zombie and she of course runs to her car and escapes. She then discovers the zombie epidemic that has claimed the city in which she lives, and ultimately everywhere. She some other survivors drives to the mall and take refuge there. The acting is pretty good, all the actors give believable performances. The scare factor is definitely there, I thought the zombie attacks were creepy and had a very suspenseful feel to it. The only thing I didn't like as far as the killings go was the accidental ones, there's one character that accidentally gets killed by another survivor and I thought that was pretty stupid. That's really my only complaint as far as that goes, I wouldn't have minded if they were a little less gory but that didn't bother me all too much. The writing was fairly decent, better than your average horror film, which is refreshing to see. The movie has a high entertainment value, which is the only reason anyone would ever want to watch this movie. 8/10 for Dawn of the Dead."

You get the leader of the pack, who is just a simple mane with common sense, the people who were there first, thinking they are the kings of the castle. The obligatory yuppie, who whines throughout the movie, until he comes good. We get the tough cop with a heart of gold, and of course, because we have to be all PC, the main protagonist is a woman, who adapts to everything really, really quickly (see also The River Wild).<br/><br/>It never lets up, there are some truly disturbing scenes, but foe a remake of one of the most cherished zombie films of all times, it's a pretty solid film."
"swilliky","8","1","1","20 August 2015"," Fast Zombies!!!! Great Remake
","This movie and the 28 days and months, and maybe Zombieland, have the fast moving zombies, which are so much more scarier than the shambling ones. The beginning is so quick and concise right to the action and that overhead shot showing the spread is amazing. Good acting, not the best, probably the weakest part though I think there were certain performances that stood out like Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley. This seems to be where Zack Snyder showed his talent and has gone on to do great things. Also James Gunn's writing has that great sense of enjoyable horror and action that has shown through in several of his other works. I think this movies was what first engaged me in zombie films and how terrifying they really can be. It brought the next generation since this was a remake of an old classic and though the story is similar, it feels fresh. (Spoiler: the biggest flaw is the zombie baby) This is my first review so I hope to get better at this as I go along!"
"JPfanatic93","8","1","1","23 September 2013"," It took the rise of the dead for a remake to be better than its predecessor
","Few remakes ever surpass their predecessors, but this one gets remarkably close, if it's not a definite improvement over the already great original George A. Romero zombie classic from 1978. Zack Snyder, who would go on to direct 300, Watchmen and unfortunately Sucker Punch, first proved his talent for adapting ‚Äì in this case re-adapting ‚Äì other people's work with this gripping, gory and hugely entertaining horror flick. A zombie plague engulfs America after which a band of survivors barricades itself in a shopping mall for safety. Tensions run high in the group as its members continue to find themselves attacked by the living dead and eventually a choice must be made: do these people decide to stay in their safe haven where they got everything they need except their freedom, or do they take their chances storming out in an attempt to find out whether there's other people still alive out there in some remote and secure location, with the hopes of joining them.<br/><br/>The story remains largely the same (except for the absence of a violent, marauding biker gang invading the mall), but the hungry undead are more lethal than ever, this time also adding speed to help satiate their lust for devouring human flesh, making them much easier to take seriously than Romero's slow, lumbering walking dead, thus only enhancing the suspense (and the body count). Fantastic make-up effects galore in this picture, providing a wide array of eerie zombies and disturbing scenes of dismemberment and bloodshed. Still, Snyder doesn't let the gore rule the film, but prefers to locate the horror in the story itself. Of particularly great shock effect is the film's fabulous opening, which starts off very restrained and seemingly normal with a nurse just going home after a hard day's work, going to bed at night and waking up the next morning finding her neighbourhood burning in utter chaos and despair as it has suddenly fallen prey to a zombie apocalypse. Though the movie treats us to many a memorable moment of naked, merciless terror later on, this gruesome opening stands out as its most horrifying scene. The TV show The Walking Dead ‚Äì though itself based on a graphic novel ‚Äì would later feature a very similar world of undead post-apocalyptics, clearly inspired by this remake and building on its premise of a ragtag group of survivors trapped in a hellish world ruled by hungry corpses."

","Dawn Of The Dead Is A Decent Horror Remake from director Zack Snyder whose admirable in making this movie about a group of people who hold find themselves trapped in a shopping mall with aggressive flesh eating zombies outside waiting for them to make a mistake. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mehki Phifer. The rest of the supporting cast are okay in their limited screen time. This remake felt more like an action film than horror because it didn't really scare me but that didn't hurt the movie. The action sequences most involving the character being killed in gruesome ways by the zombies or vise-versa are well executed. The zombies did look terrifying and were fast too but you could help but get this feeling you've seen before. The effect worked none the less though. There was a little suspense but the ending was a bit predictable. Despite some flaws Dawn Of The Dead really isn't that bad of a movie because it's sure to please any die hard fan of the genre. Overall Dawn Of The Dead has just enough gruesome deaths, chases, some suspense, a little humor, and decent performances by the cast who make this one of the better remakes out there."

The film is packed with action, some new suspenseful situations, and some nicely done humor. This remake is all the more intense because it doesn't use the typical 'zombie' image, but rather re-invents the flesh-eaters as more cunning creatures, after all they do run in this film! There's also plenty of freakishly good make up FX to be had and a great rock soundtrack.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good, Polley, Rhames, Weber, Kelly, Booth, and Zegers being especially good characters.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead 2004 remains the most critically acclaimed horror remake thus far, and it's not hard to see why.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","I can't say I'm a big horror movie fan, but this was a decent, fun movie to watch. The movie was put together well, and begins horrifyingly. The sweeping shots of the unbelievable chaos going on as Sarah Polley escapes her neighborhood are well done.<br/><br/>I was really taken with the opening montage, portrayed with a Johnny Cash song, which I'm guessing is called ""When the man comes around"". Very good movie opening; well done, and provides a visual and musical taste of the ugliness to come.<br/><br/>The movie provides a little black humor in the middle, as the occupants of the mall indulge in silly fantasies to temporarily escape the terrifying situation they are in (Sex, rooftop golf, dress-up, etc.), all done to a tune that seems to be called ""Get down with the sickness"". There is also a segment of ""Zombie-Celebrity-look-a-like"" shooting gallery that is humorous.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames, Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer are excellent actors who lend name recognition, and strong screen presence to this remake. The other actors all do a fine job rounding out the characters trapped in the mall.<br/><br/>Not overly gory, but an enjoyable, and well done, horror movie.<br/><br/>Stick around for the end credits, for a montage hinting at the fate of our heroes."

","First Watched: November 26, 2004; 1:30 p.m. ...that's 12 months, or 52 weeks, or 366 days, or 8,784 hours, or 527,040 minutes, or 31,622,400 seconds since I first saw this little zombie flick, and to this day remains my favorite horror film ever.<br/><br/>After missing it in the theater's(which I GREATLY regret), I rented this on DirecTv PPV, and after being glued to the screen for 101 minutes, I turned to my two brothers and said word for word, ""That was the single best movie we've ever rented on PPV."", and it was. It was at the top of my X-Mas list, and sure enough I got it, but it just wasn't good enough, then came the director's cut which I of course own and consider my most important DVD. I just finished watching it today as it is the one year anniversary of the first time I saw it, and if I had to guess, I'd say it was probably the 20-25th time I've seen it, and I'm just getting' started. If you haven't guessed by now, I am completely and totally in love with this movie... but enough about me, let's talk a bit about the movie.<br/><br/>***Warning: Possible Spoiler's Ahead!!!*** <br/><br/>-First and foremost, the cast and characters are dead-on perfect. I could go through and name every character and actor, but I'd just be saying how perfect they all are for their roles, they are all extremely convincing as people in a very hard situation. Even Mekhi Pheifer give's a believable performance, though he could have made shooting a gun look a little more believable... CJ is my favorite movie character of any movie I've seen(Michael Kelly rules!). His character while not the most featured in the film has the best development and the best demise in the film, which if you've seen the movie, you know how damn cool it is, even though it was sad to see him die... Ving Rhames is awesome as usual, but as I said before, EVERY actor was excellent in their roles.<br/><br/>-The look of the movie is great, very dark, eerie, and creepy. The cinematography is superb, it just looks so real you feel you are in the movie itself; the color and lighting in the mall really gives off a sickly feeling of dread and entrapment, which is exactly as it should be.<br/><br/>-The director of this movie, Zack Snyder, is a god to me. Every time I watch Dawn of the Dead, I feel he made it especially for me. As I said before, he and his Director of Photography, Matthew F. Leonetti made this movie look and feel so real, combine that with Niven Howie's excellent editing you get a film that is as visually appealing as ANYTHING I have ever seen put to film. The way this movie looks just cannot be beat, it is how every horror movie SHOULD look in my opinion, because it set's a mood that is just so special for a horror movie. I especially love his opening, just great how he has everything go from a ""perfect world"", to complete chaos... possibly the best opening to a horror movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>-The music, is, without a doubt some of the best horror movie music I've ever heard, I'll leave it at that, cause I'm really just speechless on it, it's that good. As far as non-original music goes, Zack Snyder is a genius, using Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" in the opening credits just works so perfectly, combined with the awesome images for the credit's sequence, I could just watch it over and over and over(and I have). The soundtrack simply rules!<br/><br/>-Of course, I gotta mention the zombies. ""WOW"", is all I can say, if you don't like this for any other reason, nobody can deny that this film has the best zombie effects since... ever. Every one is just a beauty for horror fan's. As far as running zombie's go, I'll just say that I loved it, I found them to be more threatening, and a hell of a lot more scary, but, you'll either love it or you'll hate it. If you're a die hard fan of Romero, you may not like it, if you're ready for a new generation of horror/zombie movies, like me, you'll love it.<br/><br/>-Finally, if you like violence, blood, gore, action, this IS the movie for you, there is so much blood and zombie head-shot's in this movie, you'd think you'd get sick of it, but trust me, you wont.<br/><br/>***End of Spoilers!*** <br/><br/>Well, that's about all I'm really gonna say, you really have to watch this movie to decide for yourself how poetic it really is, and that it's not just a mindless gore-fest, it is a gore-fest, but it has a mind, and a heart...<br/><br/>I want you to go out and get this movie, get the director's cut, if you're a horror fan, you're gonna love this, you have to, it's what we've been waiting for, a brutal, gory, bloody, funny, fast, and overall fun movie, that is most importantly of all NOT a B-Movie. Personally, I think this movie deserves a spot on the IMDb's Top 250. They say you can't have everything, but for me, this movie has just that, EVERYTHING I wanted to see.<br/><br/>I would just like to thank and congratulate EVERYONE involved. I would especially like to thank and congratulate Zack Snyder, what a great debut feature... you are truly my favorite director, and I will pay money to see anything you do. (please make Dawn of the Dead 2!!)<br/><br/>Lastly I want to say that if the young and upcoming filmmaker's of today(myself being one) take note(I will) on how this movie turned out, and help to make movies like this the future of horror movies, then the future look's bright, and very bloody. 10/10"
"supertom-3","7","1","1","1 November 2004"," Etertaining gore-fest!
","This is a remake of the seminal zombie classic and the second zombie film of the year, so how does it match up to the original and indeed Shaun Of The Dead? Well in truth it gets thoroughly beaten hard by the other two but this is still a very enjoyable gore fest. The film is a loving homage to the original taking pretty much the same story and setting of a group of survivors holding up in a mall while thousands of peckish zombies try to break in and eat them. It's got a clich√©d group of characters as is usually the case and lacks the heart of the original but this is a very polished and expertly crafted piece of schlock horror. <br/><br/>Cast wise there is no star name to headline and ride this like an ego-vehicle and stink up the place, this relies on unknowns and cult actors. In fact the biggest names in this are Vhing Rhames, Mekhi Phifer and Sarah Polley. All the cast are good and Jake Weber in particular is excellent. There is certainly a good mixture in the cast and each character is different. Director Zack Snyder handles things well and creates tension while letting lose when the action hits overdrive. <br/><br/>Like Dawn Of The Dead in 78, this film has superlative gore effects. In fact this was a superbly gruesome movie with plenty of zombie biting and flying entrails to keep the gore nuts happy. It is a key element for a film such as this and thankfully the effects are spot on. The film is entertaining and while it's not the best zombie film it has a great beginning that grabs the audience by the nuts and then does so again with the superb ending. ***¬Ω"

","This is the first time I've been back to the cinema in Aylesbury since my date with that girl from the Internet (see my ¬ëSilence of the Lambs' review) but everyone was really cool about it. Richie showed them his ID and told them it was part of my rehabilitation, and the manager let us in.<br/><br/>
We went to see ¬ëDawn of the Dead' which had sequel written all over it in my opinion. I was cool about seeing it though, but told Richie that I'd seen the first one and remembered that it was rubbish (see my ¬ëDead Poets Society' review). Richie said he didn't really want to watch it either, but knew a few people who did.<br/><br/>Because the seat numbers kept changing I couldn't work out where we had to sit, so Richie sat me down at the front and made a few phone calls whilst I watched the adverts. When they were finished Richie gave me a video camera and told me to focus on the screen, press record and then not move. Richie then tells me he's got to go because there's a mammoth lose in the hospital and to wait here for him, because it's a test.<br/><br/>The film was really crazy and scary though, so I had to concentrate hard on not moving. It's about the dead coming back to life and attacking people and in many ways reminded me of ¬ëLast of the Summer Wine'. But these undead people have a taste for human flesh and so these people have to hide in a shopping centre to escape.<br/><br/>I kept thinking that a better place to hide would be at the hospital were Richie works. That's where babies come from and babies are life, so that would scare the dead away. Also the mammoth could trample any undead that got inside.<br/><br/>All the people in the film were really nice and friendly and when some of them died it made me feel sad, but the film's colours made me feel happy and kind of drunk. Towards the end some of the ushers came to talk to me but because of the test I couldn't reply, so I pretended not to see them. They got quite angry, but luckily Richie turned up and told them about ¬ëcapturing my fears' and ¬ëanger transference' so they left us alone.<br/><br/>The good news is that I must be making progress because on the way out Richie told me that the ¬ëushers are even dumber than you'. That's progress.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Movie Rating: B+<br/><br/>Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality."
"boondocksaint20","9","1","1","16 April 2004"," Top notch action/horror entertainment
","I am a huge horror movie buff, but the movies that I consider 'quality' horror films, either high rate horror or blissfully B-budget masterpieces are few and far between.  When I heard that they were remaking Romero's Dawn, the first thought in my mind was that this one was going to suck...hard.  Then I saw the 10 minute preview on tv prior to the movie's release, and I was very impressed.  It was at that point I said what the hay, and I decided to do what I usually do when a new horror film comes out...cough up the 6 bucks and blindly give it a chance, expecting the wor st but hoping for the best.<br/><br/>I was totally blown away by this remake.  The acting, direction and dialogue are all very compelling and well done.  I know, I'm surprised I'm actually saying this about a horror film, but it's true (even a good number of the self righteous critics out there praised this one, which is a feat within itself for any horror film).  The cast do an incredible job with fleshing out their characters, and making us give a damn about most of them.  Sure, you have you 'zombie fodder' stock characters including the cynical smartass metrosexual, the blonde slut, the clueless and scared girl, the gun totin' redneck, and others, but they all play their characters' one of two traits very well and convincingly (even Matt Frewer...that's right, Max Headroom, has a small part in this as the ill-fated father of one of the survivors). In addition to this, we also have an interesting combination of main characters, all of whom are played well, and play their stereotypes well, but each give a hint of confliction that makes them all interesting.<br/><br/>
***Possible Spoilers*** For example, one character, played by Michael Kelly portrays the token remorseless self serving jerk, a character who most of the audience loathes and knows will get his comeuppance, but then completes a 180 halfway through and becomes one of the heroes.  This character to me, was the most compelling, and the unexpected transformation was a welcome change from the usual bad guy in a panic situation (i.e. Cooper from Night of the Living Dead).  Others are Jake Weber's Michael, a guy who wants to do right and lives through practicality, yet find confliction when faced with killing someone who is infected, along with Sarah Polley, whose character also wants to do the right thing, but thinks with her emotions more than what is happening in reality.  And of course Ving Rhames, whose tough guy character opens a soft spot for a stranded survivor ontop a roof across the street whose only means of communication is holding up a dry erase board and writing messages back and forth.  Speaking of this character, Andy, gun shop owner stranded on his roof, this was an excellent addition to the story and made for a compelling subplot.<br/><br/>**End of Spoilers***<br/><br/>Though for all it's greatness, there are still moments of pure stupidity where you literally want to scream at the characters for their lack of common sense (scenes where no sane person would ever do, no matter how rattled by stress or fear) but for a horror movie, these scenes are surprisingly few and far between.  This isn't the social commentary that Romero made, this is a film on it's own that only borrows the zombies (who now run at supersonic speed) and the shopping mall from him.  This is an entirely new film and it succeeds at being what it wants to be...a slick action film with thrilling suspense.  I think in a lot of respects, this movie beats the original in terms of characterization.<br/><br/>
A lot of ppl praise the original and say this movie is nowhere near it...I used to love the original, but after watching it again recently am a little shocked I ever loved such a movie with horrible acting, no character development, crappy effects makeup and the most horrendous musical score I have ever heard in a movie.  Granted I still enjoy the original, but my point is that the new dawn exceeds in many areas where the original failed.<br/><br/>At any rate, this is the best horror film I have seen in years...it is exciting, humorous, and a very bloody good time at the movies.  It is not going to win oscars, but it is going to win over many more ppl when it comes out on dvd.  This is a horror film buff's wetdream...an actioner that provides the scares, suspense and dark humor.  9/10 stars."

","I think the remake improved on some things, but fell short in others.<br/><br/>In the remake they had no where else to go but the mall. As opposed to the original where they stay there even though they have a fully functional helicopter. There were a lot of times they should have just hopped in the copter and got out of there.<br/><br/>A lot of purists like the sluggish, mentally retarded zombies over the high speed zombies of the remake. But I thought the newer zombies were a lot scarier. You can't just run by them and give them a good right cross to the jaw. Or throw a pie in their face!<br/><br/>The original was better in character development, and really driving home the isolation of this new world.<br/><br/>And of course in the original they showed the horror of being eaten alive.<br/><br/>The biggest advantage the original has over the remake is the creatures were real zombies. The real undead. Enough of this stupid virus stuff!"

","If you are a big fan of Zombie or suspense filled horror movies then this is a movie for you. Not exactly a remake but a retelling of the old 'Dawn of the dead. The same premise is there, survivors seek refuge in a mall from the Zombie horde, but all else is gone. The Special Effects are well done and the acting is on par with a decent movie. Much better than the Zombie movies of old. Not to mention the shambling zombies of old are gone.

(shaft always comes to mind on this one.)<br/><br/>as i entered the theatre with my wife and brother, my expectations were high for this. after a few trailers we were off and running. i had already previewed the first ten minutes of this film on the USA network and i was already intrigued.

When they arrive in the mall, they meet up with a few security guards and decide to whole up there for a while. later on, a few more survivors show up and carnage ensues.<br/><br/>Now, what makes this one more different and better to me than the original are these few things:<br/><br/>1.)when they arrive at the mall, it's closed. hasn't even open for business yet so there are no zombies inside.<br/><br/>2.) the use of shuttle busses at the end was creative. i like that touch. use what you got.<br/><br/>3.) the humor was excellent<br/><br/>4.) the characters were great, especially cj and michael and ving rhames character. sarah polley was given a strong female character in ana. thank you for giving a strong actress a strong role.<br/><br/>this movie is far better than the original and if you don't sit through the credits, you may miss something special.<br/><br/>by the way, the whole baby thing almost lost me on this movie, that was the only one cheese factor."

"reb_lan","10","1","1","21 March 2004"," Gore galore, with witty humor and an interesting soundtrack
","(Warning, some spoilers ahead) Starting off, I have not seen the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", but i have read about it.  I must say that after watching this version it makes me wanna see the original. Let me say this, however, i think this movie should be judged on it's own, not compared to the original in every detail. The movie starts off with no credits, the first ten minutes show the main character(Sarah Polley) going through her normal routine of being a nurse, getting home late from work and chatting with a little neighbor girl, and the going inside and talking with her husband. Let me just say they get a little romantic in the shower.  The next morning the husband wakes up and sees the same little neighbor girl at the bedroom door. The boy approaches the little girl and gets bitten on the neck and goes after his wife, who narrowly escapes through the bathroom window and drives away through the neighborhood seeing all the chaos and gore going on.  Then the credits start playing with Johnny Cash's The Man Comes Around Playing in the background.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie deals with the nurse meeting up with several other survivors who seek refuge in a shopping mall and then eventually make a plan to make it to the marina and get a boat to escape to an island.  I won't mention anything about the escape, except that it involves armored buses and chainsaws.<br/><br/>This movie is not really scary, it is however very gory.  The zombies are really terrified looking (especially the little girl).  The special effects are solid, mainly because they are not overused and nothing in this movie is too over-the-top or fake.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is about average, but you don't need Jack Nicholson or Russell Crowe playing main points for this movie to be a success.  The actors do their job in this movie, which is to move the story along and not overact and screw everything up. The best acting in this movie belongs to Jake Webber, who plays an everyday guy named Michael who is just trying to help as many people as he can while still saving his own skin.  He is the only character that you care about and you want him to live.<br/><br/>The most intriguing thing about this movie is the soundtrack. The Johnny Cash song during the credits, the Air Supply song, ""I'm All Out of Love"" playing in the elevator as they make their escape. The best part of the movie for me was the montage showing what all the character's in the mall were doing to pass the time.  During this, the song ""Down with the Sickness"" is being sang and played with an acoustic guitar, which, to anybody who knows who the band Disturbed is, it will make you laugh or at least smile.<br/><br/>The way to sum up this movie is to say, it's very enjoyable and very interesting.  It really doesn't fit into any movie category, except maybe future classic.  ""Dawn of the Dead"" has just as many humorous moments as it does terrifying, but that is what makes it enjoyable.  The only problem i had with the movie is the sudden ending, but that works well, i just didn't want it to end.  Director Zack Snyder has done something special, and i look forward to his future productions.<br/><br/> I give this movie 9.5/10"
"jackastro","8","1","1","17 March 2004"," Entertaining as Hell
","Having recently seen the original (I bought it so I could get the Hellboy Sneak Preview DVD, plus I own Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead, I went into seeing the reimagining (the new Hollywood buzzword for remake) with an idea of why the first has such a huge reputation among horror fans.<br/><br/>The original is slowly paced with a small cast.  The makeup is generally crappy, but some of the splatter effects are pretty good.  The blood looks like reddish paint.  The characters are pretty well drawn out and well-rounded.  The shopper mentality allegory still holds up well.  All in all, a pretty good movie, and I can see how it would have been somewhat revolutionary for it's time.  Romero knows his zombies.<br/><br/>Fast forward almost 20 years and enter James Gunn, the writer of Scooby Doo the Movie and The Specials.<br/><br/>The Specials, if you haven't seen it, is an extremely funny superhero parody film, and in my opinion, better than the bigger budgeted Mystery Men, which came out at the same time.  However you couldn't pay me enough to watch Scooby Doo.  I won't even watch the cartoons.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is definitely a post-28 Days Later zombie film.  The camerawork is flashy, yet at times, grainy, the zombies move at a lightning pace, chasing and often outrunning their victims.  Even aside from being a remake, the ideas are culled from every other influential zombie flick of the past twenty years, with subtle nods to the Evil Dead series, Dead Alive, 28 Days Later, etc.<br/><br/>Despite the inherent flaws, the movie accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.  It's a scary movie.  Everyone in the audience jumped exactly when we were supposed to.  We were grossed out when we needed to be, and we laughed when it was deliberately funny.  Overall, it's just a highly entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The basic plot follows Ana (Sarah Polley from Go) as she wakes up one morning to find her neighbor's daughter in her hallway.  Ana's husband goes to the girl, only to get his throat ripped out, kicking off the action for<br/><br/>the rest of the film.  Ana flees, horrified, refusing to be approached by anyone, living or dead.  Shortly thereafter, she runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames of Pulp Fiction), a cop heading toward an alleged safe area. Almost as soon as they set off together, they meet three survivors who have decided to seek refuge in the local mall.  Of course, at the mall, they meet a handful of other survivors, and begin to formulate a plan of escape.<br/><br/>There are quite a few scenes of solid character building, making the major characters into real individuals, however the supporting cast are generally just caricatures.  But overall, there are just simply a lot of ""cool"" bits that, sure, they may be just filler, but it's interesting and exciting filler.<br/><br/>Some of the cast of the original ""Dawn"" make cameos.  Ken Foree (Peter from the original) plays a televangelist, and gets to say the tagline in both films (When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth). Tom Savini (Special FX guru, and a biker from the original film) plays a sheriff who figures out a way to kill the zombies.<br/><br/>Matt Frewer also has about 2 minutes worth of screen time in the film.  It made me sad, mostly to think that this is now his career.  Poor Matt Frewer.<br/><br/>There is another character in the film named Steve, and the entire time he was onscreen, I could only think one thing: ""That should have been Bruce Campbell.""  The actor playing Steve looks like a younger Bruce Campbell, the character has that sort of smarmy, cocky charm of a Bruce Campbell character, he just should have been Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>The soundtrack surprised and impressed me.  Being a big budget studio popcorn/action film, I expected a soundtrack full of the latest altnewxradio friendly fm rock bands.  Instead, the music is mostly very offsetting to the film, giving it a little more of a creepy edge.  The opening credits are run to the tune of Johnny Cash's ""When the Man Comes Around"".  On the other hand, the end credits have Disturbed's ""Sickness"" playing, but to offset that, during the movie, the same song is played, but performed by Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine.  I may seek out the soundtrack.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved this movie, it creeped me out.  I love/hate zombies, and this did well by the zombie genre.<br/><br/>Stick around for the end credits.  All of them."

The cast features a couple of not so well known actors and the performances are decent by many and well, not so decent by a few.

"khoekstra","9","1","1","17 March 2004"," A Re-Envisioning That's Actually Good!
","Okay, I saw Dawn of the Dead tonight in a sneak preview and here's what I think... (Beware of random ""stream of consciousness"" thoughts)<br/><br/>
I'm a huge fan of the original and I think this is a worthy remake. It's not without its flaws, but it is a solid film all around. I would recommend seeing it. <br/><br/>There are several moments (for me) when I found myself saying ""what the f*** are you doing????!"" but I guess that's true of any horror film. For the most part, characters behave as I believe they would (and should) in this situation, but a few things are kind of ""out there."" <br/><br/>The opening is fantastic (as those who've seen the first ten minutes on Sci-Fi channel can attest) and it doesn't let up from there. It draws the audience in. <br/><br/>Many of the characters actually DEVELOP over the course of the film...a novel concept for horror buffs. Only a few characters don't grow...and you can imagine why. <br/><br/>The ""fast zombies"" don't really bother me...they add a new dimension of terror, but might seem weird to the purists out there. Personally, I think they're TOO fast. I'd have opted for something faster than the classic zombies, but not THIS fast. I'm thinking ""speed walking"" would be ideal.<br/><br/>
There's a rather large cast here and, with the exception of one guy who can't act his way out of a wet paper bag (you'll know who he is), the acting is very solid. <br/><br/>Whoever did the soundtrack (or made the soundtrack choices) is brilliant. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. I nearly wet myself laughing at one point. <br/><br/>Makeup effects are nice, as is the film quality in general. You'll know at the end why they sent the movie to the MPAA four times to get an ""R"" rating. As a side note, however, I think Passion of the Christ was probably more violent.   <br/><br/>Great dialogue...only one or two (or three) lines in the whole film could be considered ""off"" or groaners. <br/><br/>Great sense of humor... There were a lot of ""laugh out loud"" moments to break up the tension...all well placed.  The audience really got into it.<br/><br/>
In short, go see it if you're a fan of the original or of horror films in general. You'll enjoy it. I'm about the most cynical person I know when it comes to ""remakes"" or ""re-envisionings"" of classic films and I thought this was a great effort. <br/><br/>As I said, not perfect, but worth seeing... Enjoy!"

","Somehow or another, when every other 2000-something remake of an old horror movie set off most horror purists' ""Hollywood BS"" alarms, this one managed to sneak under them. The irony is that this might be the worst of the lot, as well as the most insulting considering the original's incisive anti-consumerism subtext.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's directing style is everything soulless, overproduced and superficial about Hollywood regurgitated and dumbed down 10 times over, left in the freezer for a year and microwaved. Who needs grisly and grainy when everything can be shot super-clean and ""sexy"" like an MTV music video? Ah, the art of missing the point.<br/><br/>The running zombies are stupid. I don't care about or want realism in my walking corpse movies, but turning zombies into athletic killers affects something fundamental: fear. With slow but savage, drone-like enemies, you get a sense of hope, and your mind starts mapping things out. Conversely, when everything starts falling apart, there's genuine panic, balanced and exacerbated by a faint possibility of survival. When the characters are surrounded by a thousand leopard-fast killing machines, there is no hope, so you don't care what happens, thus, there is no fear. <br/><br/>More importantly, though, the characters are cardboard cutouts. To top it off, when the movie ends and the credits roll, we get nu-metal. The cycle of 13 year old appeal is complete.<br/><br/>Horrible."

","I have to say, though fairly new to the zombie genre, this has to be one of the worst zombie films I have ever seen. I do say that Tom Savini's work is one of his best, but still, flashy gory make up, and flashy explosions do not make up for the loss of plot, depth, character development or over all story in general. This movie breaks with the tradition of zombie characteristics (they can't run, they're dead for God's sake!). I rated this around a 4. This movie would not as bad if solely on it's own merit,however, the fact the director is piggy backing on George Romero's current Trilogy, with out the social messages, or overall script complexity really hurts its rating over all. To dispel accusations that I am anti-new zombie films, or that anyone but Romero can't do a zombie flick, just know this, if you really want to see a good zombie film, go see Sean of the dead. THat parody is twice as zombie-riffic as this."

","I thought the movie was excellent! I didn't really care for the 1978 original. Sorry! This 2004 remake was full of action, surprises, and a bit of humor here and there. The only part that I found to be really stupid was where Sarah Polley's character, Anna, SAW what happened to her husband, but said absolutely nothing to the rest of the gang about it until the next day or two. How dumb? It wasn't difficult to figure out. She saw the condition of ""Vivian"" the little girl who lived on her street, and she saw what Vivian did to her husband, Louis. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that he died and then ""came back"" due to the bite from the little girl. I just didn't like the way they had Anna so closed-mouth and clueless about how the ""sickness"" spreads until darn near the end. Also, it would have been a nice touch for them to go a little in depth about HOW the ""Zombie-Virus"" started. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie and I've watched it at least a million times!"

","I watched this film for the first time recently, and I have to say, I was very disappointed. This film was clearly made for the ""20-something"" MTV crowd who is more into films with instant gratification than anything that might require some thought. The fast zombies made it seem even more unbelievable and silly (why would dying make a 400 pound woman all of a sudden be able to run faster than Carl Lewis in his prime?), and the characters were incredibly one-dimensional and quite frankly, boring. The plot line is so silly that a 3rd grader could have done better. To have the ending shown during the final credits was completely ridiculous. The film started off with some promise, and could have had a satisfying ending, but for some reason, the producers chose to obliterate the entire cast and leave nothing at all to the imagination. A waste of time. 3 stars out of 10."

","Why remake a good movie? (Oh! the money...duh!) Personally, I'd like to see more movies that WEREN'T done right the first time get remade.<br/><br/>My expectations were a little low. Then the movie starts!...and Hey! there's hope after all. A creepy beginning that gets sca-aarr-rry! OK! I can live with 'super-zombies' if this quality is maintained. Unfortunately, the opening is the best part.<br/><br/>For any film to succeed ya gotta have something called characterization. And except for Sarah Polley and (the always reliable) Ving Rames; everyone else is snoresville. There's just too many characters filling up space and not enough quality writing to justify their being there. Where's the acting? The shock or panic? They seem to be just running thru their lines as if they can't wait for ""lunch is here"" to be announced. <br/><br/>Even in horror movies, a certain logic has to prevail to make the surrounding apocalypse feel believable. This has holes large enough for a fleet of semis. It feels like everyone was so impressed with themselves that they were somehow part of horror history with their involvement with a 'Romero Dead Remake' that the logical details were forsaken for shock sake. And this list of plot holes are too long to take up time to start listing.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Stick with the original and rent for curiosity sake. Not without merit, but it just didn't work for me...I'd rather watch a scary movie the scares!"
"milescorn","Null","3","6","25 October 2004"," The un-dead?
","I came. I saw, I was so.....confused! Zombies are slow moving monsters, no more is the blood flowing in the veins, only motivation to movie is to eat warm blooded humans, or bugs, or animals. But because they are dead, now un-dead, limbs are harder to move because, I don't know..rigor mortus has kind of taken over, they should not move really fast or run, they may fall apart. The only thing that I can think of is that we have ""Return of the living Dead"" to thank for this, those zombies could even talk! But that film was all in fun, this film, which really should not have been remade to begin with, is just awful. And I say that it should not have been remade because the first film was way better. If they wanted the public to see it again, than what is wrong with bringing the move back to theaters the way they used to do before VHS and DVD. I would much rather see the original back on the big screen anyway than pay three seventy-five for this video crap.

"Derek237","8","3","6","25 April 2004"," Apocalyptic
","More than any 'zombie' movie I've ever seen, this remake of Dawn Of The Dead feels most as if the world was actually ending. There's no surprise that Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" plays during the credits as we see news footage of the chaos occurring all over the world. Most of the movie takes place in a mall, so basically we're left in the dark as to what's going on everywhere else. The TV broadcasts have shut down, rescue helicopters have stopped coming, there's some guy on the roof of a building across the street. You start to wonder if these characters are the last surviving people on earth. Unlike the original Dawn Of The Dead, we aren't shown any other groups of people. <br/><br/>And of course I have to bring this up: the running zombies. I actually thought it's scarier when they're running and screaming. Especially when they're in huge numbers like in one of the last sequences where the characters are trying to escape. But that's just my opinion. I guess overall more people prefer the slower, more reserved zombies. <br/><br/>So to add it all up, there isn't anything really new or unique about this movie except maybe that the aspect of the apocalypse is accentuated more than it usually is in these kinds of movies. You have the long quiet scenes followed by a loud scare, the gruesome deaths, the comic relief thrown in here and there (really great comic relief by the way), all the ingredients to make a zombie movie. I probably would have liked it better if the ending wasn't so stupid but for the most part its really enjoyable and mildly scary. If you like zombie movies I don't see any reason why you wouldn't like this. It's a powerful horror/action flick. <br/><br/>My rating: 8.5/10"
"Quinoa1984","7","3","6","25 March 2004"," A post-modernist's take on Romero's masterpiece- a good film, for what it's worth...
","(SPOILER WARNING)<br/><br/>I won't be a complete close-minded critic of the remake of the new Dawn of the Dead remake, but I do have to be critical about it, not just for my own piece of mind, but because I think the original happens to have a crucial place in horror, and indeed all of cinema, history.  When Romero created his film it was definitely original, or at least an original riff on what he had started a decade before.  It had laughs, but it didn't over-do it in cheesy-ness, and there was a constant sense of doom and satire when dealing with the apocalyptic climate of his slow-moving, blue-ish & pale zombies roaming the country-sides.<br/><br/>Now we have Zack Snyder, working from a script by James Gunn, who has decided to take on Romero's view of society and sense of horror for 2004. As I left the theater I felt similar, coincidentally, to how I felt after I first watched Tom Savini's remake of 'Night' years ago - yes, the make-up and special effects are improved, yes there are some effective scares here and there, and yes, every once in a while there's a laugh at a zombie's expense.  But, and here's a question for horror fans, why should it have been titled Dawn of the Dead?  Yeah, it takes the concept of the survivors in the mall, and it has some bits of dialog lifted from Romero's script. However, there I would say draws the line for the similarities.  In a way, I felt like the filmmakers could've just ripped Romero's material off, given the film a different title, and I wouldn't of thought and felt the story and attack sequences were not entirely improvements on the original but, well, mutations.<br/><br/>Because, as a zombie film in and of itself, set aside from the reality that it is a remake (this is for all you who didn't see the original yet and are thinking of seeing this one first), it's not a poorly made or deplorable work.  The acting is also dependable, especially by the likes of a strong lead in Rhames, an interesting female lead in Polley, a chilling supporting role in Phiefer, and plenty of well-balanced work turned in by character actors like Weber and Burrell.  As I said, the make-up is impressive (er, for it's Hollywood budget), and there's one scene involving a pregnant woman that did have me glued to my seat.<br/><br/>But then there came the problems I had with the film, and it wasn't just that not enough time and patience was given to develop the characters more appropriately or give the story a certain juicy-ness Romero had pouring out of him.  Now, I don't think running zombies are a cause for total uproar - I thought it was highly effective in 28 Days Later, as prime example - yet I may not be the only one who thinks that there's something just slightly eerie and exact to how the living-dead moved in Romero's films as opposed to Snyder's.  There are the explanations I've heard from various zombie fanatics (many on this site) to explain it, but it's almost irrelevant to explain it for a genre such as this.  The living-dead exist entirely in the 'movie world', and since this film doesn't even bother to explain how the virus got started (the original didn't explain it either, but it didn't have to as it was a sequel to a film that did explain it in its sci-fi quality), saying one is more shocking than the other doesn't give much justice to how people will react person to person.  As for the other flaws, I thought the dog element was a little under-cooked (is dog too good for their tastes, huh?), a number of times the dialog felt forced, and also the very end left a bad taste in my mouth.  I won't say much about it, but the last scenes in this film remind me what separates such a remake from an original horror film from the 1970's - a minor lack of respect for audience intelligence and expectations.<br/><br/>Maybe I've been sounding biased in parts of my review, that I should recognize that it's a revision, and it should be respected.  I do respect it, and it wasn't a disappointment.  As I left the theater though, I realized something that also came to me after I left the Texas Chain Saw Massacre remake (which was a huge mess any way to look at it), and also after seeing the remake of Cape Fear recently (a film of which I haven't seen the original yet, which I fear I may not like as much, though time will tell).  Some movies may be seen when we are young, and they may leave such an impression, especially after multiple viewings, that the first notion of a remake sounds ridiculous.  It's not to say that when a director has an idea of how they personally want to improve on a classic it's not warranted. But, with some films, it's often very challenging to be equalized let alone top them.  A number of films may improve on originals, giving the original director a taste of what new blood has to offer for the genre.  In dealing with Dawn of the Dead, I won't be a movie-snob and say that a remake should not have been attempted let alone executed.  It's not a failure - it's just not anything I'll pay to see again unless it's on cable.  Note of interest to fans, they're (for gag value I suppose) cameos with original stars like Ken Foree and Tom Savini, though for not much other purpose than to remind viewers it's a remake.  Oh well - (strong) B"

","Zack Snyder, who at the time of this writing is such a new director that his photo is not even posted on the great IMDb, has started off his career by reminding the world that the horror genre is not quite dead yet, that it is not doomed to spout endless crap like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Jeepers Creepers I and II, House of the Dead, Cabin Fever, etc. Rob Zombie did a wonderful job of jumpstarting the horror genre with his wonderfully unapologetic House of 1000 Corpses, and I have to say that I was endlessly thrilled to see this remake of a horror classic come off so successfully, especially since modernizations of classics generally tend to strike me as little more than cashing in on past successes due to a current lack of ideas.<br/><br/>The revised Dawn of the Dead comes at a time when the cineplexes are saturated with bad horror escapades, not the least of which are mentioned above, with others including Resident Evil, 28 Days Later, Gothika, etc. All of the standard remake things are there, the famous actors, the enhanced comic relief, bigger special effects (and, much less common, also better), and also in this case, importantly clarified plot points. It was nice to see the characters act more logically than was displayed in the original, the ridiculous biker gang was scrapped in favor of better zombies, a group of touristy people who show up in their motor home, a guy on the roof across the parking lot (tempting the cast and the viewers with the fact that he is heavily armed because he's on top of a gun shop) and one of several mall security guards, constantly demanding authority.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames takes on the lead role in the film, leading the cast because he's a law enforcement officer, but also challenged by the jerk security guard mentioned above, determined to be obeyed to the point that it endangers all of them. He's the only really irritating character, wanting to basically imprison everyone except himself because he is so distrustful, which is strange since they are hiding from the walking dead who are all instantly recognizable. These people are all struggling for their very lives, what does he think they're going to do, steal from The Sunglass Hut?<br/><br/>
The zombies themselves have been upgraded as well. In the first film (as well as the original Dawn of the Dead), they are slow, loping creatures similar to the killers in slasher movies. They're extremely slow-moving but scary because they're so relentless. In this movie, not only do the zombies move fast, they run and even jump. In the original Dawn, they wouldn't even duck down to get past an obstacle. They were so mentally absent that they would simply keep walking into an obstruction over and over, like one of those little robots from Stephen King's The Waste Lands.<br/><br/>
(spoilers) Much of the plot has been changed for the remake. There is no snide content about the innate need to shop that was mentioned in the original film (maybe this has become so deeply ingrained that they were afraid the audience would be genuinely offended this time?), there is no biker gang, there is much more worry about what is going on in the rest of the world (concentrating on a particular rescue post that they are desperately trying to come up with a way to get to), and the final escape attempt is made in a boat rather than a helicopter. Today's audience is too impatient to watch these people struggle for their lives in this mall while they had a helicopter on the roof.<br/><br/>
Also, the zombies are no longer the bad guys, just the walking dead who have no control over their actions. The idiot who kept hooting and hollering until he was attacked several times by the zombies in the original Dawn once referred to them as `bastards,' in this movie the characters are simply trying to escape from them. Their confused wandering as seen from the rooftops in this movie may even be an attempt to create sympathy for the people that these creatures once were. Unfortunately, in the absence of a real antagonist they decided instead to have this one security guard act like a complete jerk to everyone until they have to lock him up in the mall's holding cell, until he miraculously has a change of heart late in the film so that his anger doesn't render him a loose end.<br/><br/>One of the things that I liked about the movie was that the black guy was one of the powerful characters. This is to be expected from Ving Rhames, but unfortunately there was another black guy whose portrayal is not as easily deciphered. Mekhi Phifer plays Andre, the guy with the very pregnant wife. I liked that he is portrayed as more interested in saving the life of his wife and baby than in his own well being, but then when his wife and baby are both turned into zombies, one of the other characters runs into the room, sees the zombie tied to the bed (where she gave birth to the zombie baby) and shoots her. Andre, still foolishly thinking that the zombie was his wife, accuses the woman of killing his family, and so pulls out a gun and shoots her as she shoots him. Yes, the black guy was the strong character in the movie, but does the other black guy have to get shot by the woman that he's shooting?<br/><br/>That being said, I guess I have to admit that it is one of several clever scenes that were invented for the remake. Nothing even remotely like this appeared in the original film, especially with the baby zombie. Oddly enough, the baby zombie was one of the funniest moments in the film, a reaction about which I'm not sure I should be amused or repulsed. But hey, I thought it was funny, too, so I guess I shouldn't say anything. I think that a pretty big point of a movie like this is that it is meant to be funny (hence the success of such scenes as the one where Rhames holds up a sign for the guy across the way to pick out and shoot people in the wandering zombie crowd who look like celebrities.<br/><br/>There are some great additions to this version in the escape as well, one of which surprisingly utilizes the cute dog in the movie. The characters find a couple of vans in the mall basement and turn them into heavily armored transport vehicles, with the intended purpose of taking them to the dock, where one of the characters has a boat that they may all use to escape the horror of the mainland. Interesting ideas are hatched as far as keeping the zombies from climbing onto the outside of the vans. There are some genuinely creepy scenes in the opening of the film, one of which involves a little roller-blading girl, also invented for this version of the movie.<br/><br/>I think that really the only way that the movie slips up is that it has sort of thinned the depth of its plot, although this is done in favor of one that makes more sense. The zombies are faster and smarter, living humans do not fight other living humans beyond the struggle with the one security guard (a conflict which pales in comparison to the trigger happy biker gang in the original film), and they still try to escape even though it seems clear that the zombies would eventually starve in whatever way they starve, since they have turned so many people into zombies that they have successful eradicated all of their food. Kind of like what would have happened in Blade had the vampires succeeded in the mass domination scheme which was their self-terminating goal. I would think that one good reason to wait until the zombies started to run out of gas is the little fact that they happen to be in a shopping mall, in which they could conceivably find enough sustenance to survive for weeks.<br/><br/>Luckily, in this installment, the rescue post that has reportedly become an outpost for the few remaining survivors of the human race is a pretty tempting destination. I have to admit that I would not be that anxious to sit around for weeks waiting for the zombies to die if I knew that the only survivors on the outside may have become zombies themselves by then.<br/><br/>
Oddly enough, despite being a bigger and better version of a 1978 movie that fell flat largely because it was bigger than it's predecessor, the Dawn of the Dead remake also redeems itself by ironically maintaining some of the series' original simplicity. The special effects, budget, actors/acting, and story are heavily improved, but the movie smartly avoids one of the pitfalls of many recent horror films, which is to have a trendy soundtrack to sell. There are two versions of a wildly popular Disturbed song, but other than that mostly the only music on the soundtrack is the tinny, boring mall music which, at a few points, is the only sound onscreen at all, which is a great effect which alludes back to the simplicity of the original Night of the Living Dead. Evidently this clever mix of high-technology and low-budget filmmaking makes for a good combination for modern horror. Now can other filmmakers actually notice this time?"
"george.schmidt","Null","4","10","23 March 2004"," Bloody good remake
","DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) ***1/2 Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Michael Kelly. Bloody good remake of George A. Romero's cult classic zombie sequel to his original cult classic 'Night of The Living Dead' again with a small band of people holed up in a shopping mall and forced to fight off a plague of sudden zombies that are ravenous for flesh and brains. Novice director Zack Snyder keeps the kinetic pace to a feverish giddy high with a sprinkling of humor amidst the horror thanks to James Gunn's lively screenplay mixing action and gross-out violence (an aside: could've been meatier for my tastes but what can I tell ya) with deft aplomb and clever camerawork with a bruised glaring palette by Matthew F. Leonetti, sharp editing by Niven Howie and nasty make-up effects by David LeRoy Anderson. Polley is surprisingly gung-ho while Rhames and Weber make for excellent heroic types in a sea of oncoming carnage. Look sharp for the original film's stars Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger and Tom Savini in cameos."
"acedj","9","3","7","23 April 2019"," Best remake ever
","I cannot say enough good about this movie. They took a classic and not only remade it, but improved it. A group of people during the start of the zombie outbreak find shelter at a mall. The effects here are amazing and Romero would be proud. If you like zombies, do yourself a favor and watch this."
"avallaunius","2","3","7","6 January 2005"," Braindead
","I found this film to be truly awful, mainly because I don't like action films. I don't consider it to be a zombie film or even a horror film. Zombies are supposed to be slow and stupid because they are dead. Their muscles are supposed to have been damaged, decayed or suffering from rigor mortis. Their brains are dead and thus incapable of thought, this results in stupid behaviour and lack of coordination. This unnatural behaviour contrasts with what we expect of a human being. In other words we are disturbed by the abnormal movements of the zombie-human. This is horror. In this film, the monsters run about and act more like insane but otherwise normal humans. They are not creepy at all. They do have an exciting shock value. This is action.<br/><br/>The director obviously had so little idea of how he wanted his zombie extras to behave that he resorts to some pathetically cheap shaky camera techniques. If you can somehow forget that they are supposed to be zombies you might be able to enjoy this as an action film, but not a horror film. It should not be called Dawn of the Dead."
"callanvass","10","3","7","20 December 2004"," One of the best remakes i have ever seen *Spoilers*
","One of the best remakes i have ever seen. While it's not as good as the original it's still EXTREMELY awesome in it's own right. It's not as intelligent or as thought provoking as the original but it makes up for it with TONS of action and TONS of gore (although not quite as gory as the original). I LOVED most of the characters especially the main 2!!. This is a actually a bit different then the original yes it takes place in a mall like the original yes the 2 main leads are very similar to the original, But in the original the zombies were slow these zombies are EXTREMELY fast and they Run! very fast. I have not seen the original theatrical cut just this one (frankly i don't think i missed much!. The effects are AMAZING!!!. The blood looks VERY real and the zombies look absolutely fantastic. The direction by Zack Snyder is terrific great closeups of the zombies great shots of the mall awesome camera angles. There is TONS of gore. We get Very messy looking zombies, 2 people get HUGE chunks of skin bitten off them with lots of blood spurting, some people are covered in blood, some guy gets run over graphically with an ambulance, zombie with no arm, guy with all of his guts showing then we see some gut munching (VERY Briefly) an arm graphically gets cut, stick jammed through the chin and out the top of the head , a HUGE bloody gash on someone's arm, nasty stitching sequence, TONS of people's brains get smashed in when hit by trucks (very messy), nasty bite on someone's hand, spear through the eye, blood on walls, zombie with no legs, nasty birth sequence, exploding head, TONS of extremely gory and graphic gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains splattering, TONS of bloody gunshot wounds, a few people get there legs sawed off with a chainsaw (VERY gory) chainsaw to the shoulder with tons of blood spurting, and LOTS more gunshot wounds. The acting is GREAT!. Sarah Polley is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! and does awesome here she is focused and does awesome in the dramatic scenes i LOVED her!. Ving Rhames is the man! and did awesome here, was loads of fun to watch!. Jake Weber was very good here and had pretty good chemistry with Sarah Polley and was a likable guy!. Mekhi Phifer does decent here but his character kinda annoyed me and wasn't on screen much. Ty Burrel did great with what he had to do. Michael Kelly at first was VERY VERY Unlikable (although he did it very well) but he turned out to be a okay guy. Lindy Booth is GORGEOUS! and does great here i liked her lots. Overall SEE IT THIS INSTANT Don't wait any longer if you have not seen it. By the way look out for cameos by Tom Savini and Ken Foree, and one of my favorite moments in the film was when they had fun with the look alike zombies!. ***** out of 5"
"dfranzen70","4","3","7","3 November 2004"," Gory, but not scary.
","Pardon my impertinence, but aren't zombie movies supposed to be scary? Or are they supposed to be funny? After watching this remake of George A. Romero's 1978 thriller (itself a sequel to 1968's Night of the Living Dead), I'm all confused. <br/><br/>To sum up, some kinda plague thingy breaks out, turning nearly everyone into jibbering idiots. After a while, it's hard to tell which ones are zombies and which ones have simply been watching too much election coverage. All heck breaks loose. Loved ones are killing each other. Little kids, too. Everyone's gone all higgledy-piggledy.<br/><br/>A hardy bunch of survivors makes its way to the most American of inventions, the shopping mall. They have all they need - food, shelter, TVs, XBoxes, and a zillion zombies patrolling outside the mall, desperate to get in and feast on the nice, fresh meat.<br/><br/>Lemme stop for a minute here and wonder out loud. (Note: This is a rhetorical question.) Why do zombies need fresh meat? Why can't they just feast on each other, or even themselves? Would they even notice if they bit their own hand off, for example? (Okay, that was three rhetoricals.)<br/><br/>So our intrepid gang barricades itself inside the mall. But they soon want to get out. They're holding out hope that somewhere out there, there's someone who's not quite dead yet. You know, somewhere where the zombies haven't quite taken over. Like Canada, or something. But we the viewers know better, don't we? This is as good as it gets, staying in a mall all the time. If it were me, I don't know if I'd ever leave. <br/><br/>But oh, those nutty survivors. They're communicating with the crazy cat a building or so over via sandwich board, playing chess long distance and the like. We see all kinds of fun and exciting activities, all set to a peppy song, whose name and beat I have conveniently forgotten for all eternity.<br/><br/>So they want to get out. Their plan is to commandeer two of the mall's shuttle buses, fortify the crap out of them, and off they go. Well, bad things happen. The end.<br/><br/>This movie failed for me because at no point was I scared. I didn't jump out of my seat, or even shudder. Sure, there's gore, but it's pretty mundane. If you've seen one head explode, you've seen 'em all. (Oddly enough, when someone shoots a zombie in the head late in the movie, Ving Rhames is inexplicably impressed.) Movies like this need to have a strong sense of reality; the viewer must be able to imagine that this is happening Right Now, outside his or her own door. And this movie utterly failed to do so for me, which made it take on a surreal and ultimately comic sheen.<br/><br/>The acting's no prize, either. I know these guys had little interesting or unique to say, but I felt little sympathy for them regardless - and that's the actor's job. Convey to me how awful your situation is. I wasn't openly rooting for the zombies, but sometimes I felt like it.<br/><br/>One final nitpick - the ending credits sequence contains footage of What Happens Next. It's very, very jarring; credits are shown on a red background, then there's a quick cut to video, then back to the credits, on and on and on. Distracting and pointless."

","An overworked nurse kicks back after her tiresome shift, only to find next morning her world has turned into the zombie apocalypse. How will she survive?<br/><br/>Perfect horror. The opening sequence is a master class in movie making, mixing tension with enjoyable character, and when we pitch into the main story the simple dialogue and performances keep the show going with wonderful pace. And after a hectic climax we're treated to the greatest end-credits ever.<br/><br/>Plenty of gore and gun-blasting, but always humour - especially through the music - and so many character arcs and pay-offs from the excellent writing. Also a healthy dose of satire on religion.<br/><br/>I come to praise. But there is a mystery - the director and writer joined the Hollywood clown show after this, so how did they come up with such brilliance in the first place? Logically, it must be Romero's influence as co-writer, but I don't buy that. (ps. The script was re-written by two uncredited writers.)<br/><br/>Overall: thankful it got made, however it got made - as enjoyable to re-watch as Jaws and The Shining."
"Uriah43","8","2","4","26 July 2014"," Better in Some Ways Than Its Famous Predecessor
","Although this movie is a remake it has a few differences that make it better in some ways than its famous predecessor which goes by the same name. For starters, this movie was filmed 26 years later and it obviously has better technology at its disposal. Additionally, the first movie depended almost exclusively upon the horror aspect showcasing slow-moving zombies and relying heavily upon the gore factor. It also seemed to place a greater emphasis on character development which tended to give the audience a greater feel for the characters. This movie has fast zombies which results in plenty of action sequences. That said, viewers who enjoy an action movie will probably like this film over the older version. On the other hand, those who prefer a bit more shock and gore will almost certainly prefer the original movie. Be that as it may, I thought Ving Rhames (as the policeman named ""Kenneth"") was tailor-made for this role and he performed it very well. I also liked the performances of Sarah Polley (""Ana"") and Jake Weber (""Michael""). Along with that, I thought that Kim Poirier (""Monica"") was absolutely gorgeous and wished that she had been given a larger role. In any case, the original movie was extremely good and even though there were some elements in it which may have been better, this remake had some improvements which I believe tended to balance things out. As a result, I rate this movie the same as I rated the original ""Dawn of the Dead"". If you like zombie movies then I think you should check this one out."
"PlatypusesRus","9","2","4","25 March 2011"," One of the best zombie movies ever...(minor spoilers)
","I love zombie movies. I'm a big horror/scary movie fan and, as a rule, prefer suspenseful and creepy to gory and bloody, but zombie movies just blow me away for some reason. Ever since the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD which gave me nightmares as a kid, I just can't get enough of the genre.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the best I've ever seen. The mixture of creepiness, spine-tingling ""gotcha"" moments, and prevalent humor is absolutely perfect. Even the typical asshole-redeems-himself-in-the-end is done in a fresh and believable way. His transformation is gradual so we buy it completely as true.<br/><br/>The characters are truly fleshed out, and you get to know them all and care about them, which makes you kind of fight right along side them.<br/><br/>I think one of the most disturbing parts to me is near the end before they leave the mall. Up till now, all through most of the movie, the cop and the gun-shop owner across the street have been communicating from their respective rooftops via binoculars and dry-wipe boards. First they play a game where the cop writes to the gun shop guy, ""Do Burt Reynolds..."" and you look down in the crowd of zombies lurching about the street and, sure enough, there's a zombie who's the spitting image of Burt. BLAM, the gun shop guy blows him away.<br/><br/>Later, the group at the mall prepare a couple of large vehicles to be as defensible as possible so they can smash their way through the zombies and possibly find safety somewhere. They intend to go by the gun shop first and rescue the owner. But, something happens and he is bitten. The cop radios him through a walkie talkie he managed to get over to him to ask if he's okay. You see it coming. You know it's coming. You KNOW it. But, when the cop sees the gun guy climb up to the roof and begin writing on the dry wipe board, and the cop puts the binoculars to his eyes, well...it still breaks my heart to see it and it still makes the little hairs on my arms stand on end.<br/><br/>Great screenplay, great acting, fantastic cinematography, impeccable directing. Probably the most entertaining couple of hours you'll have watching a scary movie."
"Emphinix","5","2","4","4 December 2007"," A quite decent movie, but with many flaws
","Although the storyline of this movie was decent, there are too many flaws, but do not read if you have not seen the movie, because some things I might say, might spoil it for you. Before I tell what the flaws are, I gotta say that I am not a very big fan of remakes of the original, almost nothing is original made these days, because we got adaptations and remakes all over Hollywood.<br/><br/>The tagline of the original and the remake is: ""When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth"". In my opinion for this movie is: ""When there are no more fresh ideas in Hollywood, the lazy shall make a god-awful remake"".<br/><br/>Now I gotta say the flaws that this movie has: This movie is actually trying to be like ""28 Days Later"". Why, because they think that running zombies will make it much scarier. Wrong! Zombies don't run, climb like monkeys in a zoo or give birth to children. Some of the characters are awesome like CJ (Michael Kelly), Andy (Bruce Bohne) and Kenneth (Ving Rhames), my most hated characters are Steve (Ty Burrell) and Nicole (Lindy Booth).<br/><br/>My rating for this movie is a 5 out of 10"
"pachl","10","2","4","4 October 2007"," This movie proves the cinema experience dwarfs that of TV!
","If you're reading this review, you probably already know the general plot: an unexplained plague has created incredibly fast, strong, rabidly hungry flesh-eating zombies. The few human survivors take refuge in a shopping mall.<br/><br/>Rather that describe the movie, let me tell you how it affected me, because the true test of cinema is if it made an emotional impact on you. Keep in mind that movie makers have an almost impossible task. Nowadays, we're all jaded movie goers. Seeing realistic dinosaurs, or spaceships hurtling through space often elicit yawns, not wide-eyed amazement.<br/><br/>I saw Dawn of the Dead at a 10:30pm show on a Sunday night. When I left the theatre, it was pitch black, and my heart was pounding in my chest. Even though I am a very rational person, I couldn't overcome an overwhelming sense of fear. Just like a little kid who sees his first monster movie, I was scared and deeply affected.<br/><br/>When I opened my car, I made sure that no one was hiding in the back seat (yes, that is ridiculous, but is shows what an astoundingly strong impression the movie had on me). I drove home in complete silence. I kept the radio off, and I drove through the blackness and the empty streets common after midnight on a Sunday in suburbia.<br/><br/>I drove quietly down the same street I had been 10,000 times before, but very oddly, there was a police car sitting next to a cul-de-sac. In 30 years of driving, I had never seen a police car there. The lights were off, so I couldn't discern anything in the blackness. The first thought that went through my head was whether the policman inside was still alive, or already a zombie. Perhaps his partner was already feasting on his corpse. (What am I thinking??!! This is ridiculous. Get that movie out of your head. Pay attention to the road and just get home.)<br/><br/>When I arrived home, it actually occurred to me that if I used the garage door opener, I would alert any zombies in the area that living people are in the house (mental note to self: stop! This is ridiculous. It's just a movie. It's just a movie. It's just a movie.) When I closed the door behind me, I made sure no one slipped in at the last moment. I walked carefully to the dark, unlit landing and........ pow!!!! A light bulb met a noisy, flashbulb type death as it burnt out. That scared the hell out of me, as if my heart weren't racing enough.<br/><br/>As I walked through the kitchen, it occurred to me how vulnerable the house would be to a zombie attack. Too many windows. (another mental note: stop! Pull yourself together. It's just a movie) I closed my bedroom door, and did something I had never done in all the years I lived there: I locked it.<br/><br/>If a movie can have this kind of effect on a normally unflappable adult, there is no question the movie accomplished what it set out to do: it scared the hell out of the audience.<br/><br/>Note: Dawn of the Dead must be seen in a theatre to get the full experience. On TV, it's like watering down a beer. On TV, (even a nice big 50"" plasma, all the doomsday visuals that previously astounded me seemed not only less impressive just whizzed right past me. In particular, the scene where they have retro-fitted a bus to make an escape. In the theatre, that scene looked like something out of Armageddon. It was awe-inspiring and awesome, rolled into one. On TV, the scene appeared to just race by me."
"johnnyboyz","8","2","4","2 September 2007"," It's better than the original because it's faster, better paced and doesn't have any 'consumer society' nonsense in it.
","It's a reworking of a 1970s, George A. Romero cult classic and its premise is a load of people in a mall with zombies trying to get them: sounds like a recipe for disaster, right? Wrong because Dawn of the Dead (2004) is anything but.<br/><br/>I think I was one of the few people who liked this film so much, it actually made me want to dislike the original even more. I'd seen the 1978 version twice before this one and now I've seen this one twice, I can safely say that it is better. Romero's original is sort of weak and how it managed to gain its cult status is a little beyond me. Its premise of: 'stuck in a mall with zombies all around you ¬ñ what do you do?' still works in this version but Romero's sloppy direction, sloppy editing, poor script and lack of a star cast to give it good acting are four reasons why I didn't take to it. Maybe people like it in the same vein people like 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' (1959) but are too fickle to admit that Dawn of the Dead is a cult film because it's so bad.<br/><br/>This reboot rights some wrongs and at the same time tells a story in a quick, pleasing, bloody and suspenseful way which makes it so enjoyable. The set up is focuses on speed more than anything as ignoring some plot details yet adding in a few of its own. We don't know where the disease that turns people into zombies comes from and we don't really know an awful lot about Ana (Polley) our protagonist apart from the fact she's a nurse and has maybe a husband or boyfriend that is removed almost as quickly as he is introduced. In fact, the film is so fast in its set up that the little girl that Ana has two confrontations with (the first being outside and all friendly, the second being quite the opposite) I mistook as her daughter.<br/><br/>What Dawn of the Dead does that keeps it eerie and entertaining is that it mixes up several elements to keep it going. We are given the customary group of survivors of different ethnical race, age and social background and then given some more when they get to the mall in the form of security guards and then some more the next day in the form of even more survivors who have made their way to the mall. All these people add up to good zombie fodder for when the time comes but Dawn of the Dead doesn't just do it in an immature and guilty way because it retains sensibility of its situation and incorporates well set up and suspenseful action scenes as well as including gore, humour, action and feint romance whenever necessary. Not only does it get the basics right but it spaces them nicely. We never get overloaded with gore or manic gunfire; we are also spared the numerous shots of zombies on the outside looking in through windows or extensive shots of shop fronts as zombies trudge past them like we weren't spared in the original. The reboot also adds in running zombies and even child zombies which act as an interesting spin on zombies on a whole (the running part obviously inspired by 28 Days Later).<br/><br/>Whatever faults the film does have often are there to invoke tension or push forward the plot. No, I don't think the dog could have been that intelligent and yes, I feel the zombies would've gone for it ¬ñ no, I couldn't believe the intelligence of Nicole when she puts herself at unbelievable risk just to save the dog and I was also confused over the fact Ana shows no emotion or sadness towards her partner from the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>I feel the running zombies are not just mere copies from 28 Days Later but signify a deeper meaning: where the 1978 version of this film's zombies trudge and moan ¬ñ this version's run and scream. The remake, just like its zombies; is faster, louder and better."

Packed with lots and lots of gore, blood and violence, This is one roller-coaster ride of Fun. The 70s version was a Classic, but this version is Much better. The 70s dead walked very slowly, one step at a time. It will be easy for the survivors to escape. This version the dead run fast and attack their victim, making it tough for the survivors. Ving Rhames gives a good performance. I saw this movie first day at 11pm. Great experience to watch a horror film. A must see for horror fans."
"wtbe7560","8","2","4","11 July 2005"," Romero needs to take some notes
","George Romero should rent this movie and take notes, this is how a zombie movie SHOULD BE! All the Romero fanboys decried this movie as horrible and whined about how Dawn '78 was better, but they were WRONG. This movie does it all the right way - fast pacing, good dialog, and it's not weighed down by the ""social commentary"".<br/><br/>The Romero defenders were quick to point out how running zombies were ""not believable"". If you're willing to give enough leeway to accept that the dead are coming back to life, then why couldn't they run? Running zombies sure make more sense than the ""intelligent"" zombies Romero is putting out now.<br/><br/>It takes a lot to make my hair stand on end, and this movie did it. Within the first ten minutes even the most hardened horror fan should be disturbed and entertained. This movie offers a fresher, and in my opinion more realistic, look at the end of times than its predecessor. The scene with the birth of Andre's baby in the mall is perhaps the most disturbing of any film of recent note. Some scenes do drag out - the dinner scene at the mall seems to go on forever - but these lapses are more than covered by the action scenes. Hopefully, Snyder and crew will be making another Dead movie soon."
"Brianbroadaxe","10","2","4","9 July 2005"," It's a keeper vs a twitcher.
","It's a solid zombie movie but with a twist: a cast you can actually care when they end up munched. All of the characters are much deeper than more or less any horror film I've seen. You actually feel sorry for Anna being an overworked nurse, Kenneth is just trying to get to his brother, Michael is just trying to stay alive, and Mekhi Phifer's character is just trying to become the husband and father he never had. Jack the playboy, is the group a$%^*&e and plays it perfectly.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are things that wouldn't make a lot of sense in real life. Like why would a police officer have the shotgun from his cruiser but not his sidearm for which he'd doubtlessly have 50 or more rounds of ammo? Why not find every possible weapon and use them to kill as many zombies as possible? A gas pump that works without electricity? Minor things with minimal impact on the movie but just don't make sense either.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoy watching this flick frequently and just ordered the DVD of the original as well as the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" A little known fact about ""Night of the Living Dead"" is that the TV reporter (Bill Cardille) in the film actually did work for WIIC in Pittsburgh as the host for the Saturday late night horror double feature."

","Has to the best horror with action film I've seen , the style , gore and pure tension is just superb. The DVD version i just watched has got great extra's that definitely add to the film . the reason i think that the film has such a great feel is that the gore and effects are spot on not the over kill of some , where lets just splatter some more blood on just ends up ruining the effects like so many old horrors do e.g Hammer or Romero.If someone suffered injuries they looked like they ought to , the special effects guy should get some sort of an award . I thought the fact that the zombies could move quickly was a good idea after all why not , its not like they are going to get tired of running like we do is it ! All in all better than the original in thats it looks and feels real in a way that Romero would love to have been and just wasn't."
"drownnnsoda","8","2","4","23 March 2005"," I'm Not A Zombie Fan, But I Liked This.
","The ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake is one good zombie flick, I'm the first to admit it. I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies, I prefer slashers and supernatural horror, but this movie stuck in my mind for a while and was an excellent remake of the zombie classic. It basically is the same plot line as George Romero's original version- people hiding out in a shopping mall after zombies began to walk the earth and mankind begins to die off. The group of people who wind up in the mall begin to bond and form friendships, while the dead are outside taking over the world. They think they are safe, but little do they know, one of the women staying with them was bitten by a zombie, and is now giving birth to a zombie infant. As time goes on and they begin to run out of natural necessities, they face the fact that they can only stay in the mall for so long, before they run out of food and water. They decide it's best to break out of the mall and fight against the zombies in a mad dash for survival.<br/><br/>The performances in this film were great, Sarah Polley was excellent as the leading heroine in the film. The characters here kick some serious zombie ass, but sadly they fail in the end, and the zombies win (you have to watch the entire credits to actually see this). The interactions with the characters were genuine and well acted, it was interesting to watch them as they go through such a drastic and bad situation. Can you imagine zombies taking over the world? The gore and zombie makeup effects looked great, and there were plenty of action sequences that were enjoyable and entertaining to watch. I especially enjoyed the scene where the characters actually break out of the mall, armed with a load of weapons, in their zombie-proof buses.<br/><br/>The ending was abrupt and harsh, but I think it fit the brutality of the film very well. Bottom line is - good acting + good story + lots of gore = very good zombie film. All in all, this is an above average zombie movie, and horror fans should enjoy it. Not to mention, it's excellent for a remake. 8/10."
"AvonKerr","2","2","4","25 November 2004"," Why?
","In brief : It would have been an average zombie movie if it hadn't tried to connect itself to Romero. By doing that though it set it's standards miles too high and never came anywhere near them. If it had a different name and had dropped 2 or 3 stolen lines it would have been a 4 or maybe a 5/10. By reminding the viewer of better films though it rates at best a 3.<br/><br/>Direction : Lazy best describes it. Zombie movies are not a genre big on story so to make a good one you need to make the world and it's characters really come alive. Snyder does OK with some of the characters but fails to do anything with most. Too many things happen without reason or purpose and he could have done with a few less survivors inside the mall.<br/><br/>Cinematography/Editing - Amateurish and very annoying. Most scenes fell into two categories - ""ooh look at my new camera's zoom lens"" or ""I liked this shot in [other movie] I'll just steal that"". The two worst examples of the latter are the American Beauty ""look closer"" teaser shot used at the beginning and the 28 Days Later stutter shots used at the end. The AB one just ruined any attempt to build tension and the 28 Days Later rip-off totally missed the point. In that film it was used for scenes featuring the ""infected"" to differentiate their chaotic nature from that of the normal people. In this film it was just stuck over the last ten minutes because someone thought ""me likee, me steal"". Without context it was just annoying and cheap.<br/><br/>Acting/Characters - The primaries were generally good and one or two were very good. Unfortunately there were a few that just got ignored and even the best ones were tainted at some point. For example - Ana and Michael - what on Earth was that about? I'll tell you what - some suit demanded a romance regardless of context or reason. Another example, the guards - they started out great and could have added a lot more substance to the film but instead everyone had to get along and ""bond"". Again I assume someone didn't like the idea of a film containing any kind of social commentary or depth. The gun-shop guy was a really nice idea, I wish they had used him a lot more and only had one or two people arrive in the truck. The couple with the baby are the best thing in the film, hands down. In fact they are the only thing that is in any small way worthy of the films claimed heritage.<br/><br/>Gore/SFX - Not enough of it basically and nothing new or interesting.<br/><br/>Plot - As I said above zombie movies aren't big here but this one had none, zero, zip. nada, not a bean. Nothing drove it on at all and consecutive scenes rarely connected at all after the first half hour. There is no sense of time passing in the film at all, they could have been there a week or a year but there's no way at all to tell. The passage of time and it's effect on the cast is central to the original but totally missing here.<br/><br/>CHUDs - Adequate for the task but nothing special. Their behaviour and abilities are rather inconsistent but not so much as to be a major annoyance. The makeup required is now run-off-the-mill so it's hard to say much but that it was up to the job. I didn't like the way they ran - running is not so bad on it's own but they were just too co-ordinated by far. If they had stumbled more or something they would have looked a lot better. Biggest complaint I had here though was that there was nowhere near enough moaning and groaning.<br/><br/>The Romero connection - I have no idea why they bothered. With the title changed and a few lines removed the only link would have been the mall and they could have just about got away with that. When compared to the original this film loses in every single way, including those where technological advances could have made it better. Almost all the things that mark the original out as a masterpiece are completely absent here and nothing is added to replace them."

","I don't have much of positive to say about this movie that hasn't been said here before by other persons, but i truly loved this movie. Unfortunely i haven't seen in in the theaters, but i just saw the new DVD with th directors cut, and i was truly surprised by what he achieved with this pic. It was more like an un-official sequel to 28 Days Later but that was one of the reasons i really enjoyed this movie now. It gave me more of what i wanted to see in 28 Days Later, and it was perfectly successful in creating an atmosphere of pure end of the world in a bigger scale. And it was as much scary as it was thrilling to watch. Very good characters we cared about and excellent action scenes which didn't compromised the atmosphere just to flash off some effects. A very well balanced film with also a fantastic beginning.<br/><br/>I loved all the old versions of Romero and much of all the zombie stuff, but this remake now kept me on the edge of my sofa the entire time. I bought the DVD two days ago, (along with Star Wars), and Star Wars is still inside the box, while i've seen Dawn of the Dead twice now. By the way great audio commentary also on the DVD.<br/><br/>This movie brought me back the thrills i had when i first saw Aliens. The character of JC even reminded me of Hicks in some way and so in an age where most of the blockbusters who come out of Hollywood are nothing but a bunch of boring junk-food for the eyes, it was great to find an action movie who totally delivered what it promised. Scary and exciting. One of the best adventure movies in a veeeery long time also. 10, out of 10<br/><br/>Please make another !"

","A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Midwestern shopping mall.<br/><br/>Director: Zack Snyder
Writers: George A. Romero, James Gunn (screenplay)
Stars: Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is not just a good remake ..it is a good zombie film in general. 28 Days Later basically kicked started the zombie genre again in 2003 and in a sense helped this movie get green lighted. It shows that the zombie genre is in full force because Dawn of the Dead 2004 does not disappoint. The director Zack Snyder really knew what we wanted. He did not just do a remake and carbon copied the original. He made the film stand out on its own and one of the thing he added was fast moving zombies. In my opinion it worked and made the film intense.<br/><br/>The movie waste no time getting to the blood and gore. Within the first 10 minutes we are treated to an intense zombie opening . Not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked; followed by one of the best opening credits ever. What better way to start off this bloody film than with Johnny Cash?<br/><br/>This is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. Spoiler :a zombie baby. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. This is one hell of a horror movie."
"comicboy-95358","10","0","0","16 May 2020"," The ending could've used some work, but it's still an amazing movie...
","So usually when I liked a movie I saw a few years back, I revisit it and it's not as good. But this remake, is really good, probably one of my favorite zombie movies to be honest. I'm just glad that this remake exists, because to be honest, I couldn't sit through Dawn of the dead (1978) because it is over 2 hours long. I think the version I attempted to watch on YouTube was a special edition because it was almost 3 hours long, which is just way too long for any movie, especially a zombie movie.<br/><br/>Anyway the gore is good, maybe it was because I watched the unrated cut, but there were a few scenes that were just brutal. The zombies looked okay but I've seen better. I like that when I first saw this movie a couple of years ago I was terrified about every second, but even though I forgot almost everything that happened from the first time, it didn't scare me that much this time.<br/><br/>Now the plot is that many people are hiding out in the mall from the zombies until they can find a way to safety. The characters are some of my favorite, like Andy (Bruce Bohne) gave a pretty good performance and I actually felt kind of sad when he died, even thought he had barely and screentime and didn't get to say anything until he was almost dead. I feel like that's probably why I felt bad, was because he was alone on a roof, starving to death and then he gets bitten when the mall group brings him food. And the ending wasn't that bad, but it felt like it was a last second edition.<br/><br/>Overall, I really like this movie, and even though the ending feels rushed, the movie overall is definitely worthy of a 10/10. Sorry that this review was so short, but enjoy you day or have a nice night and thank you for reading my review!"
"Cineanalyst","4","0","0","24 April 2020"," Undead Remake
","Remakes prove that even when a film is done and dead, it may be reanimated and, like the undead here, oft in a more sickly form. If you're looking for improved zombie make-up and effects and more frills in the flesh-eating and head-shooting action, this ""Dawn of the Dead"" may be for you, but if you expect a more compelling reason for one of the classics of the subgenre, George A. Romero's 1978 original version, to be remade, this is a pretty pointless endeavor. Between the additional cluttering of characters in this second iteration and continual set pieces of the living fighting the ghouls mixed with episodes of the living yelling at each other, one may be forgiven for not noticing the utter lack of comic relief, social commentary, or merely even trust in the audience to piece things together relative to Romero's film.<br/><br/>The after-credits sequence here is a good example of how nothing is left to the imagination. With Romero, we may wonder what ultimately happens to the remaining heroes. Director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn, instead, prefer to keep everything simplistic and tidy--something that also served them well with superhero franchises. At least, I suppose, this final sequence involves a character video taping it, which is rather unexpectedly reflexive. TV is also employed earlier on as surveillance and, as Romero did, for largely unnecessary news broadcasts. Regardless, there's also no insinuation, as with Romero, that the living are like zombies in their unreflective materialism, as well as with the warring with each other. Heck, the remake even goes to pains to explain the mechanics of zombies--head shots, effects of bites, etc.--as though we aren't already overly familiar with said conventions.<br/><br/>It's no wonder the gang here is so eager to get on with what seems to be a suicide mission for the climax; they have little apparent reason to live in the first place. Families die. Jobs are gone. The only guy from a church is an atheist, while others consider an alternative worse than death. And chess, sex, shooting and smoking only entertain one for so long. Romero's group had lives inside the mall worth protecting and appreciated their bounty. This gang, on the other hand, just seem to be looking for a diversion to pass the time and overly willing to risk their lives for an adrenaline rush."

It delivers the thrills, chills, and plenty of gore and blood.<br/><br/>This is the feature film debut of Zach Snyder and it's an impressive debut.

I hear from other people that the acting is better than the original. Unlike most horror films, you get to care for the main characters and feel sympathy towards them.

","Dawn of the Dead tells the tale of zombies attacking a group of human survivors who take refuge inside a large shopping center. This is of course the remake to the amazing 1978 film by George A. Romero. While it has it's moments, this remake fails to match or surpass that original for a few reasons. Anyways, the movie begins with the world BEFORE the zombie invasion. We meet our ""main"" character Ana who is coming home from a shift at the hospital. She goes to bed with her husband and then is awoken to a little girl standing in the hallway. Yes, she is a zombie. It is a very tense and creepy opening scene. That's when the excitement begins and Ana takes herself to safety at the mall.<br/><br/>Other than the fact that it's a zombie film and it's location is inside of a large shopping mall, the Dawn of the Dead remake is very different from the original (which I liked a lot). This one had a much bigger budget and a more well known cast, but wasn't as good as the 1978 version. It's a good movie but failed to surpass the original. I HATE the fact that zombies can run, it takes away from the eerie moments we witnessed in the original 'Dead' films. Them running does add some intensity to a few scenes, but it just isn't the same as the 1978 version.<br/><br/>'Dawn of the Dead (2004)' does have some creepy moments, and of course has gore galore.

"Mr-Fusion","5","0","0","11 July 2011"," Hyper-violent action movie with zombies
","George Romero's '78 classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" gets a cosmetic facelift in this √ºber-gory remake from newcomer Zack Snyder. I will say this: it's a terrific movie if you've never seen the original. Snyder put together a pretty good zombie movie. But it's clear that he (and screenwriter James Gunn) wanted no part of the satirical humor of the original. Snyder just set out to make a kickass zombie movie, while at the same time upping the ante. And in some respects, he succeeded.<br/><br/>The action this time around takes place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The pandemic (like the original) springs from out of nowhere, taking the country by surprise. A group of survivors bands together and seeks refuge in an abandoned shopping mall while they formulate an escape plan. All the while, zombie hordes gather on the outside of the mall, looking for a way in.<br/><br/>The most noticeable change is in the zombies, themselves. No longer do they shuffle around like geriatrics. Snyder turns it up a notch with running, leaping and screaming. His zombies are indeed much more of a threat (not to mention terrifying). But the makeup here (compared with Romero's original) is on a whole different level. The pallid complexions of 1978 give way to bloody, decaying pieces of meat (nothing like a zombie with half a mouth!).<br/><br/>What's interesting about Snyder's version is that it's almost more action movie than horror. Here, running and gun-play are just as important as blood-spatter and severed limbs. It makes for a lean, mean zombie flick, and in that regard, I think it works. I tend to wonder if the powers-that-be should've just concentrated on upping-the-ante with the zombie movie, but not even associate it with ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), which is why I was ultimately disappointed. It's as if Snyder & Co. made this movie because they found the original ""too boring"", and felt it needed to be faster, bloodier, etc. Lost in that update is the sense of fun inherent in the original. The remake also eschews the social commentary of the zombies being attracted to a shopping mall (mindless consumers), in favor of the shopping mall just being a place to convene in relative safety. In that respect, it seems rather arbitrary to set the movie in a shopping mall in the first place.<br/><br/>It's clear they used the same title for brand-recognition, but it should've been its own thing; Snyder's throwing down the gauntlet with his own movie, not a remake.<br/><br/>5/10"

Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.<br/><br/>And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters."

","I have not seen the original this was based off of, but the beginning alone of Dawn of the Dead makes the film worthwhile. I also really liked that there was a concept of the reason that there are people like this is because there is no more room in hell. I thought that is a pretty different idea than other zombie flicks (of course, it is probably owed to the 1978 version). The performances are solid, and honestly the whole film is pretty entertaining, even if nothing remarkable. It is in between a serious horror and a horror/comedy, more serious than Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead, but more campy than 28 Days Later. Still, it makes for a good time."
"Reef-Shark","6","0","0","21 August 2010"," Okay, but was it needed?
","George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a classic horror movie that really didn't need to be retold...but that's exactly what director Zack Snyder has done so I guess I should review it after having seen it twice. I admit there have been far worse remakes, but I can't help but sense how unnecessary this was especially since these two films are worlds apart in many ways. They don't really remake Dawn of the Dead so much as they re-use some elements from the original script and slap the title ""Dawn of the Dead"" on it to get attention.<br/><br/>In the original film George A. Romero had used the setting of a mall to make satire of human nature. In the Snyder film everything has been refit for zombie action. George A. Romero used the stumbling zombies from his 'Night of the Living Dead'. Zach Snyder uses the Olympic Sprinter Zombies from '28 Days Later'. Romero knew how to spread his movie out with a casual pace. Snyder in the vain of all modern action movies uses quick cuts and generally seems to have everything moving as fast as it can giving no time for character development other that easily recognizable stereotypes.<br/><br/>I think its clear that I prefer the original...<br/><br/>But I don't think this is remake is bad. Its just another zombie movie is all. Nothing really special, nothing really bad about it. It doesn't stand up to films like those of George A. Romero or 28 Days Later, but it is better than things like Resident Evil.<br/><br/>So, this new Dawn of the Dead is quite a bit of gore-filled fun, but as a whole is flat and uninteresting compared to the 1978 original."
"Zombeefan","7","0","0","13 May 2010"," A remake that is entertaining
","Tried to make this Spoiler Free, but warning is in place just in case.<br/><br/>Remakes have been the studio biz model for quite some time now and the craze seemed to have kicked into high gear around 2002. Now most people can't stand the thought of a remake because as we age we have already fell in love with the original and it is hard for a remake of a film we love to capture the magic of its original/parent.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder was tapped to helm the 2004 reboot of George A. Romero's Zombie classic DAWN of the DEAD, a commercial and documentary director making his debut in feature film motion pictures. Zack brought a different kind of energy to the table with this reboot of the classic film, but he didn't bring the epic feel and vibe from the original film.<br/><br/>While Romero has gone on record saying DAWN was like comic book romp, it still had a very deep horror vibe and even though you spend the majority of the film inside the mall with the cast, the film always felt bigger, and this was done effectively by setting up the chaos of the zombie uprising from the get go by having the commentators arguing on TV about how to deal with the situation. That single moment set the entire tone for DAWN of the DEAD and while it has its campier moments it was forever cemented in celluloid history as a zombie horror film.<br/><br/>Zack doesn't try that approach, nor does DAWN of the DEAD 2004 contain anything remotely related to what you would consider horror. Instead what DAWN of the DEAD 2004 does do is become a terror action film. Zack sets up the story and visuals nicely within the first ten minutes, but loses that epic feel by not following the successful formula Romero used in DAWN 1978. Now of course had he copied what Romero did it would have been pointless, but DAWN 2004 manages to move in a completely different direction where the mall is just a safe haven, not a social commentary on consumerism. To get the film into a somewhat quasi horror mode he uses the track star style zombies found in the recent 28 Days Later film from 2002. While this is great to create moments of terror it doesn't create the element of horror.<br/><br/>Now you'd think I hate DAWN 2004 by what I am saying, but I don't. I just don't hold it in high regard like the original film. Zack effectively made a commercialized version of DAWN of the DEAD, but he didn't have the magic to make it what it could have been and that can be contributed to the screenplay written by James Gunn, which was kind of weak, but what made up for the screenplay was some of the cast and characters.<br/><br/>Michael (Jake Webber) is probably the most fascinating character in the film, not a man of a lot f words his feeling and emotions are expressed by facial expressions and body language. He wants to fight, he wants to survive and he is not just thinking of himself but of everyone stuck in the situation. This is a great trait in modern horror films that you don't see very often and it is Jake's acting that seals the deal and makes Dawn 2004 work well.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was the lack of use for actor Ving Rhames. Ving, a great character actor is good to have on screen, but is so under used that it seemed like a waste to have him in the cast. Tis a shame because I think had the screenplay been given another pass through by another writer they could have flushed his character out more. What you do learn of his character is minimal, but it is told in such a way you want to know more. One of the original drafts of the DAWN 2004 screenplay had a set up of how VING ended up meeting Sarah Polley, why he was on foot and what he witnessed that had him toughened up, but due to budget constraints or whatever the issue this element of the screenplay was dropped in favor of a quick meeting in the woods at the wreck site of Polley's TOYOTA... (must of been a sticky gas pedal) Anyway, my biggest complaint would have to be the under use of VING in the flick.<br/><br/>Sarah Polley, a decent addition, but doesn't really bring anything to the table worth noting. She or her character really don't stand out.<br/><br/>Ty Burrell, who plays Steve the millionaire snob and Michael Kelly (CJ) really deserve some kudos's because between them both they were just about to steal the show, I wish one or the other would have pulled it off, but the mix of each of them having their own selfish attitudes worked great and made for some really entertaining moments. While CJ and Steve are the films two antagonists, you end up rooting for one before the film ends, that characters transformation was a little quick, but worthy and delivers one of the funniest and fist pumping lines when he gets himself into some tough situations.<br/><br/>The rest of the cause was OK, and you could easily tell who would be meeting their maker once they were introduced on screen, which is sort of a shame, but you can't have a horror film without a body count... and the zombies don't count.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're looking for a 2 hour entertaining action based zombie film DAWN of the DEAD 2004 is a nice treat on a boring afternoon. If you want depth, locate the original flick and give it watch. Either way though, I will say DAWN 2004 is one of the better remakes out today and it deserves to be watched and celebrated."

","Sorry for my bad English :(<br/><br/>Alright my real problem with this movie was the lacking of imagination and originality, it was just a rip off of any zombie or action film ever existed, it was just clich√© after clich√©, it was like if you take all the clich√©s in existence and bowl them into one cup. Though not everything, it has some pretty good scares and the suspense is good, also has a couple of good ideas like the conversation through the blackboard and the beginning is great<br/><br/>This movie makes no respect to the original and does not improve it but is OK, a enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>There is no character development at all, you don't care at all if everybody dies, well i exaggerated you care for them, but very little, most likely you want some of them to live and some of them to die, so there is a problem there, the acting is OK, i think they all made a great work for the lame characters that were given to them.<br/><br/>The special effects are not so special, they are OK, some good, some bad, but this proves that special effects do not cover the terrible script.<br/><br/>The setting is OK, much better than the original, because in this one it looks realistic, in the original it's just dumb, months and months and everything is just the way it was before. The comedy in this movie wasn't for me, it was just dumb, laughing just because a zombie died in a funny way? doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>Well, i hated it but as a movie, is not bad, apart from the terrible script everything is OK, a fun time.<br/><br/>7.1/10"

","Death. A common fear amongst almost all the civilizations in the world. But what if you could overcome death? Would you do it? What if, in order to overcome death, you were reduced to a brainless automaton? You get bit. You bleed to death. You come back. That is the premise of this film. However, when you come back, there is nothing left of you but your body; your mind is all but gone - wasted. There is a stark difference between vampires and zombies - vampires are sentient, zombies are not. That fact makes them all the more terrifying. Similar to the original, the few survivors take refuge in a mall (an allusion to consumerism in modern society, perhaps?). <br/><br/>Across the river of zombies trying to bite the survivors is a gun store, owned by Andy. Neither of them can reach each other, so they use a dry-erase-board to communicate. They play a game: the people in the mall write down the name of a celebrity, such as Burt Reynolds. Andy then shoots the zombie-look-a-like in the head. A classic scene.<br/><br/>The film also poses the belief: the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. A man was bit, he is slowly dying and shall eventually turn into a zombie. What do you do? Do you kill him right away, or do you let him die then resurrect as a zombie? At which point is a human beyond hope?<br/><br/>Morality and philosophy intermixed with horror and zombie fun. A masterpiece in modern film-making."

","Imagine living your uneventful life, day by day as a nurse in a county hospital. Then imagine waking up one fine morning, just in time to see your sweet little 10 year old neighbor gnaw your husband's neck open, killing him! That's not all as your husband suddenly gets up again, blood-lust in his eyes and tries to eat you! Such is the plight of poor Anna. As she flees her suburban home, she is greeted with a world of chaos. Some form of infection that turns humans into bloodthirsty undead zombies after they have been killed is spreading across the globe. This infection spreads through bites received from other zombies and there is no cure. Anna bands together with a few other survivors, and together they try to whether the zombie apocalypse inside a mall. But sometimes, the greatest danger might not be the obvious danger. What started off as a normal everyday morning has now become a DAWN OF THE DEAD! <br/><br/>Love it or hate it, this remake by Zack Snyder is one of the finest horror movie remakes of the new century. Though it downplays the whole social satire/political undertones bit, it cranks up the action and drama. It can be argued that Dawn of the Dead 2004 is more of an action thriller movie than a horror movie; it is not scary aside from a couple of cheap shock moments. Snyder's versatile camera work and effective usage of slow motion enhances the impact of every gunshot, every limb severed and every zombie blasted to kingdom come.<br/><br/>But do not let all that action fool you, this film thrives on its well written script, good acting and characters. Granted that the characters are mostly action and horror movie stereotypes (tough guy, emotional damsel, kick a55 gal, sombre hero, etc) but it is the drama that ensues as the diverse cast of characters interact with each other that drew me into this film. All of the characters are fully fleshed out with their own attitudes, motivations and reactions to their current predicaments. Every one of them is easy to relate to as they represent the ""every-man"". Under all that zombie killing action, this is a story about how grave situations can unite the most unlikeliest of allies and bring out the best in most people. It is just that easy to get emotionally invested in this movie. The fact that the cast are relative unknowns with no big name stars makes relating to the characters so much easier.<br/><br/>One thing that stood out was Zack Snyder's usage of music and little nuanced references in the background to enhance the story such as the ""hallowed grounds"" coffee house where the survivors usually congregate and where they hold their funerals (references back to the old zombie movies where Zombies were considered unholy creatures that cannot harm people on hallowed grounds). The opening theme of ""The Man Comes Around"" set to scenes of Zombie carnage worldwide sets the overall subdued mood of a bleak post-apocalyptic land where Zombies rule the streets.<br/><br/>Fans of the original 1978 classic might not be too happy with the amount of liberties this film takes. The zombies, the cast of characters, even the setting and feel of the movie are all vastly different. However, one can see these changes as an improvement. For example the savage, fast running zombies(now immortalized in recent games like Left 4 Dead) are a lot more dangerous than the dim witted lumbering ones in George A Romero's classic. Also the special effects, cinematography and story pacing are all better.<br/><br/>Overall, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is an exciting, adrenaline charged piece of modern film-making that is sure to please any blockbuster fans. Horror fans may be a little let down by the lack of scares. Great makeup and effects, excellent acting from a cast of relative unknowns, and awesome cinematography coupled with an exceptionally witty script. The movie is well paced, never drags and has its fair share of sad and light hearted moments.(the best is the montage that plays over Richard Cheese's lounge version of ""Down with the Sickness""). Easily the best remake of a classic horror movie ever and a real treat for any movie goer.<br/><br/>(Get the director's cut DVD. it's worth it)"

This movie must be good. Well, I saw the 2004 version seeing how classic movies has a tendency to suck for adolescents such as I. Here's what I thought of this movie.<br/><br/>It was pretty clever. Just had to say that. The moronic security guards at the mall who forces a pregnant Russian woman and her husband to urinate somewhere besides the bathroom, the clever betrayal of one of them, and the man who looks like the guy from My Name is Earl turning good, it's pretty clever. And if you enjoy the occasional humor in a horror movie, knock yourself out with a brick, because there is some in here. Ever wanted to see a zombie that looks like Jay Leno shot? There you go, that's a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this very much. I can see why many people like this.

While they are in the mall they find 3 security guards there armed with guns. They wait for help to arrive But they are all running out of time and the zombies are approaching the mall. The dead are retuning to roam the earth. I thought that this was a very good zombie horror film with great acting from the cast. 7/10"

As if this counts! Don't you people watch horror movies?!!!! I have watched hundreds of them and rarely do protagonists make it at the end! It's always the villain and when they do, remember the villains keep coming back! As much as I've seen movies where heroes die at the end, I started to feel like ""hollywood endings"" don't exist anymore, that's if they ever did! It truly repulses and wards me off when people say I didn't like this movie because the hero won!!!! or when they don't understand a movie which might be because the movie is rubbish, they just think it should be clever because they were stupid enough to not to understand it like the majority did with ""Eden Log"" !!!!

About 10 minutes into the masterpiece, I found myself on the edge of the seat. The movie wastes no time on the unimportant, but really gets through to the viewers.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie was probably the behavior of the people trapped in the mall - how they really looked out for each other (well, at least some of them) but meanwhile were ready to do about anything to save their own lives. Specially loved the Andy/Kenneth relationship.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The cast was also perfect, as were the dialogs, writings, etc. There really is nothing bad to say about the movie. So why did I give it 9/10? Because the red-head (can't remember her name) really angered me when she was risking her and the group's life when going after that stupid dog. But in the end it did become the breaking point of the movie - they had to leave their secure mall and head out. It's still one of my favorite movies ever. Great job! Keep 'em coming."

","I love the horror films of the 60's and 70's and the original George Romero zombie flicks are still some of my favorites but being that this is a re imagining I will try to stay away from comparisons. Okay the plot is very simple (even for a horror film) there is a deadly virus that has broken out over most of the U.S. that causes the victims to come back to life. So a band of survivors decide to take refuge in an abandoned shopping mall, I think that first and foremost this movie should be classified as an action film and not horror because there is plenty of ammo being shot and plenty of things exploding but not enough scares. Also things like character development are sorely lacking. The actors did a good job with the roles and the direction by Zah Snyder (Watchmen and 300) was good but as a die hard fan of the genre I can't call this a horror film."

","I had a low level of expectation when I rented this movie because you just can't hope for too much when preparing for a horror flick. However, a GREAT beginning immediately raised the bar. Both the ""before and after"" sequences in the Milwaukee suburbs and the opening credits were thrilling, chilling and fabulous.<br/><br/>Much to my disappointment however, things become much more predictable and clich√©d when they all get together in the mall. The characters I found hard to really care for, or at least dislike because, even in the case of a good actress like Sarah Polley, they're not very well sketched. The mall itself, what purpose did it serve? As many other reviewers have pointed out, in the original movie social commentary was everywhere and the mall, the ultimate symbol for (especially suburban, middle-class) consumerism, was an ideal location. Plus, the zombies kept wandering around the shops, which was funny! This movie lacks, besides a political slant, a good sense of humor. Even the celebrity-shooting scene I found somewhat uninspired (although many find it hilarious, so to each his/her own).<br/><br/>The good points however are the pace (which allows for repeated viewing) and, if we judge the movie strictly by its own merits (ignoring the fact that it claimed to be a remake of something else, which could have been left out because it's a DIFFERENT movie), that it's a dignified horror and action story, decently acted and has a couple of memorable moments, which is a lot right now.

All of the actors (and I mean all of them) made their characters believable and fresh. This is Zack Snyder's 3rd film in matters of directing, and I give him more than 5 stars. The action is all edge-of-your-seat type stuff, and it really makes the situation more deadly than needed, which was cool. I especially liked the scene where the survivors fight their way through the undead in the buses. That was cool.<br/><br/>The one thing that I didn't understand is why they didn't fully explain what started the whole undead epidemic in the first place. Was it a virus? Nobody knows.<br/><br/>Other than that, an absolute thrill ride."

","Dawn of Dead (remake) 9/10 This is the type of fast pacing movie makes it enjoyable film to watch with your buds. The beginning of this film is perfect for a zombie film. Gets you right in the action and never ends. There is more characters in this remake and having the gun shop owner across the mall made it even more enjoyable. The zombies have great special effects and the struggle of escaping the zombies being the strongest point of the movie. <br/><br/>Least favorite points: baby zombie.... cool but not necessary I see where the idea would come from when the original was made the female lead was preagnet. I guess director wanted to show how it be if the baby turn into a zombie. Favorite Part: setting, pacing, the buses, ending<br/><br/>Recommendation: Don't ever watch this film alone. I think it is more enjoyable with a group. So I would not own this film, but what horror movie is worth owning. If you think this is a scary and suspenseful film not for you."

","Please note that some of the content below could be considered spoilerish.<br/><br/>The 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" could definitely be a standalone from the original.

Survivors stuck in a mall.<br/><br/>Not only is the movie unique from the original, but it's not close to bad. Many of the scenes become incredibly tense, and the cast of characters don't make terrible decisions that would get them killed, like in so many other modern horrors. The ending was a little bit of a stretch, but the characters felt very real, for the most part, and the dialog and acting were quite good. <br/><br/>Make sure to stay for the credits, too.

The fast moving are like the virus infected people in 28 days/weeks later. They are just plain menacing and bloodcurdling.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder directs a solid cast of relatively unknowns, Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber. The body of the story is the same as the original only this time a nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman, and other survivors arrive at a shopping mall for protection from the hordes of zombies that await outside.<br/><br/>The effects are excellent and the first 15 minutes of the film is crafted and executed to a standard that I'm sure Hitchcock would have been proud of - it's pure tension, scares and horror.<br/><br/>In retrospect Dawn of the dead 2004 is probably the most underrated re-imagining/remake ever.

After the pointless, basically frame-for-frame colour remake of the original Night of The Living Dead in 1990, I wasn't sure remaking the best of the original trilogy was a great idea but Zack Snyder got it spot on. Instead of creating a scene-for-scene remake like the former remake he just takes the basic premise and updates it for a new generation horror audience complete with brilliant scenes of terror, stylish visuals, loads more humour than the original and last but not least buckets of gore.

I watched this movie every single day, i watched it so much that i ended up ruining it and had 2 buy another 1 LOL, but anyway, i knew word for word, line for line, and watch so much that i c and saw everything u could in a movie, noticed that littlest things in the movie that 1 wouldn't of seen at all unless u watched it over and over. I love George A Romero, he is a god in making zombie movies he is the man!!!! his dead series!!! the only movie that i didn't really cared for is Land of the dead!!! reason is that it wasn't nearly as good as dawn of the dead, Caz i was expecting something out of this world, compared 2 dawn of the dead i was like this movie is gonna blow DOD out of the water, which it didn't.<br/><br/>I did like the fact the zombies in land of the dead could kinda talk well the black guy, and they had learned few things like moving and getting somewhere and actually fighting back with weapons!!! which was kinda cool, but Dawn of the dead is the greatest zombie movie EVER!!! in my opinion, not no1 Else's, so i don't want people 2 get the wrong idea, or argue with me saying no its not the best movie or the usual crap people say 2 others remember it my favorite movie and my best zombie movie of all time in my mind and my point of view!!!! thats all, i just love this movie!!! Sarah Polly makes a great lead in this movie!!! didn't mind her at all actually, compared 2 her other movies back in the day LOL. The ending when mike got bitten and didn't tell ne1 till the bitter end kinda sucked!!! They should of started the next movie with them, going 2 the island, and picking up from there!!!<br/><br/>I think that would of been kinda neat having part#2 with the same characters and starting off the boat and walking towards the woods and finding a new breed of zombies!!! then end up figuring out where the virus came from the organs of it some how and just something like that!!! but oh well if u haven't seen this movie and r a zombie fen!!! watch this and if u hadn't already WTF u doing LOL, there is no boring parts or no break in the action, meaning the whole movie keeps u interested and wanting 2 watch it again and again!!!.<br/><br/>Well thanks a lot and hope 2 watch plenty more zombie movies!!!!"

","Title: Dawn of the Dead <br/><br/>U.S. Release Date: 19 March 2004 <br/><br/>Directed by: Zack Snyder <br/><br/>Written by: James Gunn <br/><br/>Running Time: 101 minutes <br/><br/>Synopsis: After a Milwaukee zombie outbreak, a nurse (Sarah Polley), a cop (Ving Rhames), a gang member (Mekhi Phifer), a regular Joe (Jake Weber) and others take refuge in a shopping mall along with some jerk security guards. . . and flesh-eating corpses.<br/><br/>Cause of Outbreak: Unknown, but some supernatural type (according to Snyder) <br/><br/>Review: This film is probably my favourite horror remake ever, which is pretty impressive seeing as it's a remake of the second best zombie flick in cinematic history. What makes this remake different is that Snyder and Gunn took the original idea, modernized it, but made it their own. Usually, the makers will either go for a strict modernization without making it their own (the 'Psycho' and 'The Omen' remakes come to mind), or they'll leave the original ENTIRELY with almost nothing but a few references to relate it to the original (the 'Day of the Dead' remake, for example). When it comes down to it, almost everything about this film is pretty damn good. Even for an ensemble cast, the characters are all very well formed with their own distinct voices (helped by some fine acting). The music is great and often hilarious (Cheese rendition of Disturbed). Zack Snyder's eye for action proves to be more than substantial. And, finally, James Gunn's script perfectly fuses terror and humour in a way many horror writers strive for, but rarely achieve. Overall, it's a great action-horror/popcorn flick with some genuine scares and high-quality film-making.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8/10 <br/><br/>Recommended? Yes, unless you're anti-remake and/or enjoyable modern horror and 'popcorn cinema.' <br/><br/>-AP3-"
"departed07","7","0","0","24 February 2008"," Faithful to the original classic, but there's no need to bring 28 Days Later into this.
","George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" back in 1978 was a masterpiece in horror cinema that not only did I say it is the best horror movie of it's kind, but I ranked it on my top ten list of best films of all time.<br/><br/>Just like many movie studios, everybody wants to remake classic films to give them a little edge. Some of them worked from Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear (1991) to Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) where it was about different points of view and trying so hard to be faithful to their counterparts. Other remakes never fulfilled like Gus Van Sant's Psycho (1998) where it felt like I was watching the film but in color with goofier content.<br/><br/>Here in the remake of DOTD, Zack Synder, who would later direct 300, paces up to speed where after watching 28 Days Later...(2002), he wants his zombies in America to run faster compared to the slow and smart zombies in Romero's movies. The film starts with Ana (Sarah Polley) coming home from the late shift at a hospital where she falls to bed with her husband before seeing a little girl filled with blood in her mouth approaching the married couple where Ana's husband is attacked and turned into a wild and venomous monster within seconds and after her flesh. She flees her home and sees hell breaking out from car crashes, people begging to be safe from the creatures; some are even being devoured by the cannibals in front of her eyes. She meets up with survivors Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a cop with a shotgun; Andre (Mekhi Phifer) a thug who has his Russian pregnant wife; and then there's Michael (Jake Weber) a TV salesman. The five of them head for the mall where they noticed that they're not alone with three security guards and other people getting involved where they witness that an epidemic has hit the scale with people turning into these creatures. The mall is filled with ravenous zombies but not before they make their hideout their sweat haven.<br/><br/>The film also makes references to the original masterpiece where the stores are named after actors from the 1978 movie to even cameo appearances from Ken Foree, Tom Savini and Scott Reinger.<br/><br/>I liked the film. It was a little edgier and much, much more violent and graphic than the original. But somehow there wasn't much to think about when watching this movie except waiting to see who would die next.<br/><br/>Bigger does not mean better in a remake."

","This remake of the George A Romero cult zombie slasher contains everything a remake should. For this day and age it's hard to remake a film and to pull it off to make it as good as the original. In this case it quite literally succeeds immensely. Beware that this film contains pervasive strong bloody violence, horror and strong language. Moving off the MPAA rating you are delivered with not only a normal shoot em up zombie film, but also with a film that thrives the characters emotions and characteristics that have not been shown in a zombie film for quite some time. The story and plot are really well made, the cast could not have been a better assemble and the homage to the zombie/action/thriller category could not be surpassed."

","This was a great remake of the already great Dawn of the Dead. This was pretty much a new movie based on the concept of the original. This movie did not really stick to the original...which is actually a good thing. I like when remakes come up with new ideas of their own. I liked the more modernized feel this movie brought with it. Also, there were a lot more main characters to root for, which I enjoyed. There was a variety of them too, rich, hick, jerk, crook, cop, nurse, truckers, doctor, model, you name it. I liked Andy, the gun shop owner across the street. He made me laugh a few times, along with Ving Rhames. Also there were new zombies. These zombies were faster and much more deadly than the original ones. Although I enjoyed this movie, it had its share of flaws I think. But don't let that stop you from watching this. I recommend this movie to fans of zombie movies, and maybe even to fans of the original Dawn of the Dead and the rest of Romero's ""Dead"" series. 8/10"
"scott-sw","8","0","0","7 February 2008"," Pretty good remake.
","Usually, I do not like remakes. However, the contemporary version of Dawn of the Dead breaks the usual trend and entertained me. It could never live up to the original caliber and vision of the original 1978 masterpiece, but it makes a good movie in its own rite. A nurse named Ana (Sarah Polley) wakes up one morning to find her world upside down. Her husband is immediately infected by a virus that brings back the dead. She runs to find Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Steve (Ty Burrell) along with a few other survivors. Afraid of the zombies, they decide to hide in a large mall. Unfortunately, they meet the wrong mall security guards. CJ (Michael Kelly) leads his deputies to threaten, intimidate, and harass their fellow humans whom they consider captives. Eventually, Ana, Steve and Kenneth are able to take over and allow more people to seek refuge in the mall. They make a friend across the street. Andy (Bruce Bohne) might as well be miles away as thousands of zombies litter the street in full force. They communicate with signs. Eventually, they realize they cannot stay or they will die. They make an attempt to escape to an island within the Great Lakes. To review this one, you have to compare it to the original. In the first place, I will fault the new adaptation with having too many characters. At one point, it gets weighed down. Still, the dynamic is more ripe for conflict amidst the survivors. At the same time, some characters are redeemed, like CJ who eventually comes around to be an all right guy. Also, the idea of fast moving zombies really adds to the tension. It made me wonder if they represented the disenfranchised and angry consumer as opposed to the mindless shopper zombie of the original movie. Also, while the original had a few scares, this one is more action oriented. It moves much faster to entertain instead of developing slowly to create thought. I also liked the cameos by Scott Reiniger, David Emgee and Ken Foree. I will also say this version has a more cynical and dark ending as opposed to the original. This is neither good or bad, just different. Still, I thought the movie deserved a better ending. Dawn of the Dead 2004 has enough to make it fresh, and enough to keep you interested. Just don't expect it to overshadow Romero's masterpiece."

","After having seen plenty of movies with this basic concept in which people hide in a mall for mutated creatures, I can say this was a good watch. Though I have seen better movies about strange mutants and dangerous viruses this one was certainly worth my time. I have seen this movie recently but have watched and enjoyed alike movies before. Films such as the Resident Evil series can easily be compared to Dawn of the Dead.<br/><br/>The movie and actors themselves manage to express the human emotions and thoughts at the brink of destruction very well. ""Who to trust and who not"" is an essential thought. Leaving your loved ones for the sake of your own life. It's all about certain decisions we have to make. However there is a lot of pain and misery, you will for sure not miss the several funny scenes spread over the movie.<br/><br/>One point of critic I have to make is the sometimes what awkward scenes that come out of nowhere. For instance, I did expect certain elements as nudity to stay away. Also did I not enjoy the movie as a horror movie at all, it had way more thrill than horror.<br/><br/>So if you have a night free and want to enjoy a good movie?

","(Spoilers be ahead)<br/><br/>Yeah, that's right. I thought that this movie would suck, and be a 20 minute turn off. I will willingly now eat crow. DotD was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be, which was pleasantly surprising. First and foremost, it was insanely graphic; almost a given with all zombie movies. We're also pretty much thrown right into the plot (which is unscary, but it was never meant to be), where a nurse, two black cops, and a couple of other characters that were the usual zombie-movie stock characters were thrown in. There's always the good looking blond, her boyfriend, the egotistical jerk who everyone wants to get offed as a guilty pleasure (*cough *cough, boat captain guy), and the old couple that somehow stumbled in but won't live very long. I will compliment the filmmakers, however. As another commenter said, this is a remake that didn't fall apart. The ending is clich√©, but it was supposed to be. Anything else would ruin the movie. And now, that's got me thinking. What if Chuck Norris were cast into this flick and replaced with the sniper that Ving kept writing signs to. As soon as those zombies jumped through the shoot, they would be gonners for sure. Would Chuck need a razorwire truck with a chain saw? No way. Instead, Chuck would jump off of the ammo shop roof after eating 1000 AK-47 rounds and grenades for breakfast, and would take the zombies on with brass knuckles and flatulence. After racking up a quadruple digit body count, Norris would make a gigantic wall out of the dead zombies, allowing the characters to get to safety. In the end, he would unearth the body of John Wayne, who would no doubt shoot hundreds of nukes and obliterate the zombies into pixie dust, and all is well."

","Dawn of the Dead follows the same basic plot as George Romero's 1978 original. The dead are coming back to life to prey on the living. Amid the chaos a small miss-matched group of survivors escape to a shopping mall and use the building as a last line of defense against the swarms of zombies closing in on them. However, beyond this basic back bone the two films are markedly different in how they play out.<br/><br/>This new film puts the emphasis on gore and action to drive its momentum. Contrast this with the original which stressed suspense much more effectively. The cast is also much larger than that of the original and as you'd imagine this gives considerably more fodder for elaborate death scenes. Unfortunately character development has been sacrificed considerably with only a few spouting enough personality for us to care much about them. Gone as well is the original's often scathing social commentary into consumerism and societal apathy. The new film also manages to be surprisingly humorous at times. The bit where Andy is shooting zombies from the rooftop who resemble celebrities is priceless.<br/><br/>So is the remake as good as the original? No, but it offers enough new elements to merit its existence unlike the bulk of shallow ill-conceived remakes we've had to deal with lately. Give it shot."

After the ensemble-cast ""whodunnit"" trend started by Scream, then the return to haunted houses, then the return of the ""unstoppable killer"" (Freddy, Jason, etc). Now, with this film and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there's a good blend of classic horror stories done with a current film-making-style attitude. There are two things I really liked about this movie: 1) They don't try to explain anything. You never know why the zombies exist, where it started, etc... You don't need to, that's not the point. and 2) The running zombies. Purists HATE it. They want the old ""zombie shuffle."" What the hell is scary about that? How hard is it to outrun or drive away from shuffling zombies?!? This way, they're scary. More intense.

","Wow it's been a long time since I've watched a real zombie-type horror movie. Dawn of the dead is indeed a smash to everyone's disposition, its bloodcurdling, fast phasing, new-fangled, irrefutably not tedious to watch, and a wallop to the movie industry. I guess I wasn't being too exaggerated with my appraisal, but this is the only movie were I saw zombies could scamper hastily towards their victim. Certainly Zack Snyder is a new innovator of horror flick, Dawn of the dead is entirely disturbing talking about its plot and would leave its viewer to wonder and worry what would happen next (even the resolution keeps me anxious). In our conventional experiences zombies that appear in movies are slow-moving flesh eating undead corpses, but Zack Snyder had changed the attributes into a more completely shocking outcome, but in contrast to George Romero's new hit ""Land of the Dead"", Zack Snyder's invention remains on the remnants of zombies' attributes¬óthey do not possess any sorts of intelligence, all they do is a hack a victim and feast on their flesh till nothing is left.<br/><br/>On the other hand it bother's me how the characters had passed their anxieties concerning the existence of this undead flesh-eaters, considering that they live in an abandoned mall stuffed with supplies of natural living, it still disturbs me, and all the dead in the world seems to assemble themselves in the said place to out reach their craving for the survivors.<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of horror movies, add this immediately to your ghastly collections!"

None of that slow, rocking, arms straight ahead zombie walk. These guys will chase you down. Brilliant! The film starts with one of the best opening sequences out there, very well crafted, and it only takes about a minute to get right to the action. Great editing, and great special effects.

With the new remake craze Hollywood is on, Gunn decide he wants to write a proper script before some hack writer gets a hold of DAWN OF THE DEAD rights. He writes an incredible, action packed screenplay, and with the combined talent of Zack Snyder directing, they set out and make the best remake since THE FLY '86, and in doing so slightly surpass the original in quality.<br/><br/>Instead of a heavy handed political satire with crappy make up and terrible pacing, DAWN OF THE DEAD '04 is an action packed barrel of gore, extremely dark humor, witty dialogue and creative scenes. It seems like Gunn wanted to put as much original situations as he could with a cast of 16 characters. When you really think about it, Gunn took a lot away from his experiences with Troma, and it shines through with the outrageous situations he puts these people in. Not many other horror remakes would put so much at risk with how different this is from the original, and I guess thats why not many other remakes are very well respected.<br/><br/>The makeup effects, gore and special effects in this film were of a very very high standard. And the zombies themselves were great. An obese elderly zombie woman, a zombie childbirth, a Chinese jogging zombie, a paraplegic zombie, and various celebrity look-a-like zombies, such as Jay Leno, Burt Reynolds and Rosie O'Donnell. The deaths were also awesomely creative, the scene where the old truck driving lady finds Mekhi Phifer and his ""family"" is masterful.<br/><br/>Overall DAWN OF THE DEAD is a great film that does something most remakes don't; it surpasses the original. One of my favourite films, 8/10."

","We take these sorts of movies pretty seriously here in Pittsburgh, the home of George Romero and where ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" were shot. (The shopping mall in the original is just a couple of miles from me.) I've just seen the '04 ""DOTD"" and have mixed feelings though more favorable than not. My first response was that the special effects getting better over the years is a mixed blessing -- you get that whiz-bang sense from seeing torsos chainsawed, but I think it makes directors a bit lazy in creating tension and fear.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of ""Evil Dead 2,"" the Sam Raimi movie made on a shoestring budget that forced its creators to look for different, less extravagant ways of scaring people. I'd recommend it over this movie unless you're strictly a blood and gore fan. (And both movies have chainsaws!) If you like blood and gore, this movie made for you.<br/><br/>But this movie isn't without its jump-out-of-your-seat moments and when it has them, they are pretty tasty. There are nice touches like the dry erase board chess match and the snipe-the-celebrities game.<br/><br/>I came out of watching glad I'd seen it but more glad I hadn't paid $10 for it in a theater.<br/><br/>See all of you at the (human) food court at Monroeville Mall!"

","Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the dead proves he is a good director. I was impressed with the effort put into the special effects. I was disappointed by the fact that they did not stick more to George Romero's original plot. There were major differences and more character's seeking refuge in the mall. A select few of the character's were rather annoying and a few of the actors performance's could of been better. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber gave the better performance's in this film. Their plans to go to an island on Steve's boat go awry and the ending is very vague. My thought is the ending was left that way in case they want to do a sequel in the future.

","Ana is a nurse who wakes up one morning to find the world has been overrun by an apocalypse; an infection communicated by bite has turned almost everyone into crazed cannibals. She hooks up with a group of uninfected people at a local shopping mall. Can they survive, and what does the future hold ?<br/><br/>This remake of George A. Romero's classic 1979 low-budget zombie epic has good points and bad points, but overall is marred by poor direction. The cast are good - Polley, Rhames, Weber and Kelly particularly - the sets and makeup effects are great, the locations are good (Toronto doubles for Milwaukee) and there are some scary, effective scenes, notably the creepy birth sequence and the early shots of Ana driving through the madness. But the movie falls down badly in two areas for me. Firstly, James Gunn's script doesn't take the material anywhere new - it's essentially the original movie without the social commentary or the interesting, slow-paced, character-based, middle third. It alters the classic zombie mythology (the undead can run and jump, and anyone who dies naturally isn't reanimated) which is okay, but it doesn't go anywhere with the new ideas. It's chief sin however is that for a movie filled with action, the choreography and editing is poor. For an action scene to work we need to know where the characters are in relation to each other, how fast they are moving and what the physical space they are in is like. There are moments here (like the flight from the gun store to the sewer) where the coverage and the cutting is so lame we have no idea what's going on, and so there's no tension or suspense. Despite having the great cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti (who shot Poltergeist, Johnny Handsome and many other great flicks), Zack makes the classic MTV-director mistake of thinking that if he just cuts his scenes fast enough, with plenty of off-putting slow-motion shots thrown in that somehow that will make his movie exciting. He should go back and watch the biker gang attack sequence from the original movie and really look at how it's put together. I don't want to criticise this flick too much though - it's still a lot of fun, it's an updating of a great classic that everyone should see, and it has enough gore and scares to satisfy the gourmet horror fan. It does however have the most annoying end-title sequence I think I've ever seen in any movie. Co-produced by Romero's old business partner, Richard P. Rubinstein, and featuring cameos by original cast members Reiniger, Savini and Foree. Worth catching, but for those of us with more than a two-second attention span, check out Romero's superb new zombie flick instead - Land Of The Dead."

"labtop","10","0","0","4 January 2007"," A true masterpiece, this movie is the pinnacle of the horror genre
","Never before has a film had such a remarkable combination of perfect acting, an imaginative and lurid plot, and above all, believability. No movie has ever had such an impact on me, not even any of the hundreds of movies I have watched when I was a child. No accolades or awards will ever do this film justice. Dawn of the dead is the pinnacle of the horror genre. Nowadays, many movies have resorted to sudden plot twists and ridiculous dues ex machinas and other hanky-panky acting to keep its viewers awake. This is especially true in the horror genre. However, this movie of sheer perfection is completely realistic yet still contains all the undertones and values in United States as well as all the common plot devices.<br/><br/>A mere ordinary American is subjected to an unimaginable horror in a way that seems far less distant than the other scenarios in other movies. This American is neither an omnipotent hero nor a coward, but an ordinary American. At first, the death and carnage is shocking to her, along with many others she is stuck with, but in the mall with all the now-abandoned merchandise, a disquieting routine sets in that shows the characters happily enjoying the luxury of the place rather than thinking of solutions. Eventually, conflicts between the characters threaten the survival of all, while a vastly greater conflict looms. It is under the duress of this scenario that all the facets of the ordinary Americans brought together in the mall is represented. For example, CJ, the most colorful character is a problem solver and rational man who has the most exceptional physical abilities as well. Most of the other characters get in his way but all have different ways to respond to the situation. It is because of this realism that CJ's final heroic act (that would have only been written off as senseless violence in other horror movies) is so heart warming and powerful. That simple scene was the most powerful scene in any movie I have seen because it represents what a true American hero would do in such a scenario completely accurately. He doesn't have a full two minutes to say a goodbye to his girlfriend, he isn't gonna save all mankind by single-handedly stopping a barrage of nuclear missiles, he isn't going to protect earth from destruction by aliens, but he does act in the heat of battle to perform one final believable heroic act. <br/><br/>This is the only movie I would ever give more than a perfect 10/10 for, nothing compares to its elegance."

","well i never saw a good zombie movie tell this. Plus the zombie baby made it better. Plus it had a relentless gore. It was a all around on edge movie but it had a chilling sense to the hole thing. So when you are sitting there laughing then you think about it for a second then its scarier. It had a wonderful chainsaw seen that really showed the proper safety's when be heading zombies. Its a great movie to watch all around. And watch it with friends cause some of them will hate gore and its funny to watch them get sick. Another thing i loved about this movie is the realistic. It a had a wonderful gore sense but not fake. The weapons were well creative. You have your stander pistol shotguns and a trade mark weapon the chainsaw. But u also had a few other items in the mall they used such as a Axe racket and other sporting good items. The chainsaw seen could have been longer but it succeeded my anticipation of its gore effect. I really liked the music to. It was perfect for the mode. johnny cash was a perfect, and the mall music was funny because when that door opens it all out gore and terror!!!. i also loved the end it scared me good. The last thing i loved about this movie is the fact that the zombies run. I hate movies were the villain never chase down and attack. In this movie it gave a great sense of terror.

"general-melchett","9","0","0","19 December 2006"," A brilliant horror flick - a spiffing remake.
","Dawn of the Dead is more than just a bloody zombie movie - it is a terrifying, gritty, strangely realistic depiction of an apocalyptic world. If something like this were ever to happen, this film is a troublingly-accurate portrayal of what people might do to help themselves. They would find whoever they could to join forces with, they would go somewhere they could survive in and stay safe and they would try to wait it out. But something would have to go wrong. And things do. Instead of being just a bunch of friendly, never-angry losers, our survivors whose adventures we follow in this flick are real people who have troubles, conflicts and fallouts, and also friendships and fun times that grow stronger in these desperate times.<br/><br/>But enough of that, Dawn of the Dead wasn't made to disturb for ever after (though it probably will) - it was made to supply gore-loving hounds with lots of the red stuff. And there is sure lots of it in this film. Lots of exploding heads and flying blood are combined with furious fights and brutal plans. It is pretty amazing how all this was filmed on a $28,000,000 budget - they actually had to create a realistic-looking mall and have explosions, guns, saws and generally very bloody special effects. Most films would find this hard to do on a budget three times that size - but DOTD is very flexible with its rather small budget and none of it's shoddy either, providing us with a brilliant zombie flick that has actually been quite a success (a $100 million worldwide box office gross ain't terrible, but it should have done better).<br/><br/>The film is brutally intense from the start - in about 30 seconds, we are thrown from peaceful suburban world into crazy zombie-infested hellhole. And the first 10 minutes are where the film really comes into its stride - by showing us how much things can change in so little a time. And from then onwards, it's gritty, bloody, and generally rough all the way. The goriest scene was when the zombie Andy had his head blown up by an 870 shotgun - it's the sort of thing that was made to be watched in slow motion. And with several other gory deaths and shootings, this film will not fail anyone who likes a bit of blood in their entertainment.<br/><br/>Though the DVD release was slightly underwhelming (though the Region 2 edition had an absolutely brilliant news report feature), this is a great remake of an old classic and proves that zombies never get boring. Brilliant! 9/10"

"josephtheowl","9","0","0","15 December 2006"," A look at the bigger picture
","It was in this one episode of ""The X-Files"" called Hollywood A.D., where Agents Mulder and Scully are discussing the true nature of zombies. Mulder asks why is it that when the dead come back to life they only want to hurt people. The more skeptical Scully mentions that ghosts and zombies are a representation of our own repressed violent and sexual urges, that zombies are what we fear most about our identity: deep down, we are mindless automatons that only kill and eat. There's a horrific truth to that kind of deadly simplicity. Zombies are traditionally impulsive, acting only on hunger.<br/><br/>Which is why the mall setting in both versions of Dawn of the Dead is so appropriate. Where once malls were a place for consumers to empty their wallets, it is now a target for LITERAL consumers to fill their stomachs. There may be an underlying morbid humor behind commercialism saving us from ourselves. That perhaps the only thing that separates us from them is our rationale to succeed.<br/><br/>Each character represents a generalized version of ourselves placed in emergency situations. Once we become gripped with fear, how we lose faith, how we feel helpless, how we learn the hard meaning of sacrifice, how much we change, how much we learn about ourselves, and only very rarely are we ever rational beings toward one another begins to show. There was a message behind the scene where Andre (Mekhi Phifer) shoots Norma (Jayne Eastwood) after she discovers his pregnant wife is now a member of the living dead. It said something about man's capability to murder each other out of desperation, whereas zombies never seem to harm other zombies. In fact, because of human flaws like petty arrogance and personality differences, the zombies are actually better coordinated and work more efficiently together than we do. That could be the reason why the undead were able to score such a swift victory over the living.<br/><br/>I'm convinced that the film could have started right after Ana (Sarah Polley) awakens from crashing her vehicle. Obviously the movie isn't perfect, but the scenes where the survivors in the mall are engaging in basically everyday activities (playing chess, having sex, hitting golf balls) shows that the people haven't forgotten their past, familiar lives, and that amidst all of the carnage they have a way to remember life before the end of the world."

I liked Dawn Of The Dead because it avoided this fairly well at times. But during a few scenes the irrational stupidity of characters shone through. In fact one of the best examples of any horror movie stupidity presented itself when the character Steve (alone and in the dark as usual) puts down a perfectly good weapon (a crowbar) and picks up a lesser weapon, a croquet mallet. A nearly unbreakable heavy metal bar or a fabricated piece of cheap wood, what sane person in dire circumstances would prefer the later to the former?

","I'm not normally a fan of remakes as most people ruin what was good about the original. However, the zombie genre has developed in the last few years, and what was good about the original may not be conceived as good in this day and age. The original obviously being a cult classic zombie flick, possibly the best ever, with a retro look about it that could never be re-created. So the Director had a decision to make, a gamble one might say. Try and Stick to what made the original great or try something new. He tried something new and did a very good job in my opinion.<br/><br/>He obviously stuck to the basic story line but i feel there are other aspects to this film that make it good. First off, i felt an original cast was always going to be needed and the actors were excellent. I feel Ving Rhames and Mekhi Phifer, the only well known actors in the film, do really well and all of the other actors played their part superbly.<br/><br/>Secondly, i don't know much about this director Zack Snyders work, but I'm going to look into more of his stuff as there was an aesthetic about the movie, a slickness one might say about it that seemed to make the movie flow nicely and the moods within the film be it, comical, horrific, romantic or Sad were shown well and entwined throughout. Be it the moment Ana and Michael fall for each other, Andy The Gunman Dies or when they're running from the zombies screaming and shouting into an elevator only for the screams and hectic camera work to stop and the Calm soothing Elevator Music starts, that i felt was a stroke of genius. It works in a very Dark way and this kind of humour can be seen throughout the film.<br/><br/>This film was all about the Direction the Director was going to take it. He took a chance and in my opinion it paid off. A job very well done. Any fan of the traditional zombie flick may not like it as it does steer from the tried and tested formula seen for years, but otherwise i can see most people enjoying this film, especially if you liked 28 Days Later. 7/10"

Excellent casting and writing combine to make this better than the already marvelous original. The mall setting still works as it did years ago: while the original veered towards social commentary of how we live mindlessly in a consumer society, this version implies that mall, represents sanctuary, a reminder for survivors of the familiar and comfortable, where people once went to socialize and relax, in a sooothing and familiar place. Of course, with zombies around, the mall now offers only a temorary respite. The tension between characters heightens the suspense. One last note: do not miss a second of the end credits; it provides a gut wrenching finale to the movie."

Just because it's a Romero movie gives it 2 points instantly. If you haven't watched it or didn't like it, then how do you know what they'll be like. Dawn of the dead is an immediate hit & will be seen as a cult classic for a fair while. My Rating = 10/10 My reasons = acting, direction, writing, plot, action. My verdict = Rent it out & watch it till you know the mall off by heart. Dawn of the dead is an instant comedy hit but not one to let the kids sit and watch."

","I liked this movie because it contained running zombies. I have seen a lot of ""scary"" movies that only had walking zombies, and those are boring. With walking zombies how hard is it to just run from them? But with running zombies you know you're not going to be able to get away without putting up a good fight. The makeup for the zombie's was good also. It made it seem real. None of the two dollar movie make up most ""scary"" movies use. The acting was a little off in some parts, mostly in the beginning. The ending was pretty good cliffhanger, also. This movie, in the end, does have it's faults, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for more."

","I am writing this as a fan of artsy fartsy visual storytelling rather than one who loves gory graphical horror, or the zombie theme as a whole. I can't say i disliked DOD '04, although I don't think it is as masterful as the original. Keep in mind that DOD and DOD '04 are hard to compare since they definitely differ a lot in style and audiovisual expression as well as plot-wise. Perhaps Romero would have liked the possibilities new technology in film-making has brought with it, but the '78'er's the big advantage over 04 is the fact that horror easily gets a bit pathetic and not scary. <br/><br/>A zombie model '04 is a remarkably scarier creature than its cousin of 1978; it moves as fast, or even faster than a living human and is a goal-oriented killing/eating machine. Thus one of the main points in the original movie is lost. The inefficient, slow ex-consumer stuck in a circle of reliving old habits and instincts in the mall of the '78 version is long gone, while horror movie clich√©s are planted everywhere. There is, however a very good take on the consumerism of today still left, revised but intact, and that sort of saves this new version from being gory rubbish, at least seen from an artistic and social commentary oriented point of view.<br/><br/>The very important words Us & Them and the them still have their meaning here, but sadly, in a way, the threat of other human beings in the ""chaotic end of the world zombie takeover""-sort of situation is in a way replaced by raging zombies that are pure monsters rather than stupid corpses suffering from hyperactivity The acting is, I think, more professional, even if not always much convincing here in Zack Snyder's version. I can, however say that I liked the urban, cynical, rich, modern, pathetic asshole (""Steve"") played by Ty Burrell. Visually its prettier and creepier and more dramatic but also introduces the risk of too much action, which there definitely is. Together with the industrial heavy metal inspired soundtrack the taste of splashy, mediocre horror is present, luckily combined with an interesting picture of life in the early 00's. It's also sad that the sound mix didn't have what it takes to boost horror.<br/><br/>Through the movie we get the chance to compare dignified deaths, stupid deaths and the messy deaths of fighters, but the outcome is always the same in a meaningless way that very well concludes the whole mood of the film, where the viewer can observe the danger of the most loved but always lying part of the human imagination: Hope."

","I approached this remake with a great deal of skepticism, and quite frankly would never have bothered to watch it had it not been for the casting of the always impeccable sarah Polly. Her performance in this film sums up the great intelligence with which the entire film was constructed. At risk of sounding corny, it is a mass friendly contemplation on morality, consumerism and the value of human life, and it actually scares the pants off of you. The film takes it's time developing the characters beyond one dimensional zombie fighters and leads the viewer to invest themselves emotionally in the outcome of the players, which makes the horror all the more frightening. The film accomplishes this without alienating the audience and keeps fans of Zombie flicks highly satisified. Even if this is not your genre, it is well worth a viewing, in a very dark room!"

","The director's cut of this movie is one of the best horror films ever made. I am a true fan of the original (I own both Night of the Living Dead and the special edition Dawn of the Dead) but for pure entertainment, I feel this one is better than either of them. It is both graphic and funny and gives the horror fan everything they can want. Be warned-the theater version is choppy in parts and leaves the viewer scratching their heads on how some sequences came to be. Stay with the DVD unrated version and if (and only if) you are a horror fan who can appreciate (tolerate?) gore, you will have a great time with this film."

","The original is a classic, so why bother with a remake? People don't seem to understand that a remake is made to honor the original. This is probably because most remakes aren't worth the film they are shot on. But this is worth it. The spirit of Romero's Dawn of the Dead lives on in this film which uses the same basic storyline of the original while updating the elements. The music is great. The creepy ""When The Man Comes Around"" plays over the blood soaked titles, which display scenes of human on human carnage. ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" plays in the empty mall as the plague rages outside. There is a great montage in the middle of the film that features a 50's lounge version of ""Down With The Sickness."" The barb filled script by James Gunn and claustrophobic direction by Zack Snyder are both sturdy. My two major complaints with the movie are that there are far too many characters and the ending should be more of a part of the film. It is obvious that many of the people are there solely to die and the reverse Zombie 2 ending is depressing in it's choppiness. The many references to the first three of Romero's dead films are great as are the cameos by Savini, Foree, and Reiniger. The saturated look of the film is potent and makes the gore scenes that much better. The scenes in Ana's bedroom, in the parking garage, with the bloated women, with the baby, and shooting the stars are all highly enjoyable. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames bring respect to the cast while Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell make fine jerks, one redeemable and one not.

","It is ! I've got to admit i wasn't too optimistic , the trailer made it look like another lets go get the teen audience but it didn't at all. The start sequence with Johnny Cash playing and all the chaos ensuing made for a fantastic contrast. The references to the original film were few not too many but well placed and spaced out for optimum effect. The film though had plenty of action but also took on the more emotional aspects of the crisis well like a daughter seeing her own father become a zombie. Ving does play a rather clich√© character for him but he does it well and the indirectly becomes rather attached to the group .<br/><br/>To be fair its not an amazing film but its a really good re make, the T.V clips showing Humanity trying to deal with the problem and those with the solution being ignored show the total desperation of the situation.<br/><br/>The Richard Cheeseman cover of Down with the Sickness by Disturbed was brilliant and gave the audience a startling realisation - whilst we laughed at the gay church organ player putting on high heels - they are surrounded by zombies who are intent on killing them.<br/><br/>Its simply a well shot film , the actors play their parts well and whilst many will simply dismiss it as another re make I actually think parts of it are far less camp than the original. Better effects , t,v reports particularly by Ken Foree , from the original is brilliantly spoken and quite bone chilling and controversial, make this film what it is - a great piece of work that wont live in the Hall of Fame but should at least earn its credit as a thoroughly good film -especially when you see the ending a great way to end it for me !"

","Since seeing the original Dawn Of The Dead as a teen back in 1992, I was definitely pumped about seeing the new DOTD as soon as it came out. Of course, ""remake"" is basically the kiss of death when it comes to getting fair and unbiased reviews before the movie comes out, especially when such a genre-defining film such as DOTD is remade. So I hoped against hope that my dreams of seeing a modernized DOTD that was worth seeing would materialize. Did it ever!! I entered the theater on March 21, 2004 (by myself as my girlfriend would have nothing to do with it) with great anticipation. Strangely enough, I was one of maybe a dozen or so people in the theater (which makes sense as I went about 2:30pm on a weekday) and got comfortable. The first ten minutes was among the scariest and best openings of a movie that I have ever seen. It was simply a rush to see the world go completely insane so quickly. The opening theme song (""The Man Comes Around"" by the late, great Johnny Cash) was perfect in setting the mood of hopelessness. For me, the tension and the action did not let up until the end credits (and if you've seen this movie, there is still plenty going on during the credits as well). The fast-moving zombies and the sheer numbers of them, especially during the end ""escape"" really was great, too. I was also pleased that this film did not resort to the now Hollywood-clich√© of computer-generated every thing. There are some (not many) spots where CG was used (most notably during the escape where there appears to be about 100,000 zombies in the mall parking lot attacking the shuttle buses. About my only complaint is that I wish there was more of a lead-in (as well as action) of getting into the mall as there was in the 1978 original. However, I came away very satisfied and hoping for a sequel to this fine horror film."

","this is definitely one of the better remakes. I would have to say this movie is actually better than George Romero's original 1978 version, which was also pretty damn good. Starts off with one of the most frightening scenes of the movie. A group of non-infected civilians bunker down in an abandoned shopping mall and join forces with a few rental cops. They then struggle to survive and fight off what seems to be a never ending on-slaught of zombies who want to enter the mall. One thing that differentiates these zombies from others is that they have some pep in their step, they can run! The actors play convincing roles. There is extensive violence and gore, especially in the uncut DVD. You can clearly see this was produced with a decent budget by a major studio (universal). I highly recommend this movie. Get the uncut version on DVD if possible."

","OK, so it borrows the zombies from 28 Days Later, the idea of having our heroes hide out in a shopping mall, and the rest of the film stands or fails on its own merits. I think it stands quite well, certainly superior to Romero's 2005 Land of the Dead. The ending credits were kind of silly, reminiscent of Resident Evil/music video outtakes, but otherwise this wasn't a bad movie. The acting was fine, the directing sharp, and the zombies were kind of scary. A few so-so scenes like the zombie baby, which was done far better in 1985's Dead End, but as far as pointless remakes go, this was a good one. The @sshole security guard is great; at first he's a rehash of Joe Polato's un-praiseworthy performance in 1985's Day of the Dead, then he does a complete turnaround, ultimately saving the day. Look fast for Ken Foree as a TV minister."

","From the point of view of somebody who had never seen a zombie movie before Dawn of the Dead (and I doubt there are many besides me), I was impressed and surprised by the quality and entertainment value of this gory treat. Fans of blood, guts, desperate survivors and apocalyptic situations will be glad to know that Dawn of the Dead jumps straight into the action, with neither complicated technobabble nor a long-winded back-story. The actors - who look closer to actual people than the air-brushed clones so frequently seen in other movies - are convincing and engaging as the few survivors holed up in a local shopping mall while zombies roam the streets. Rather than hiding the delightful and clearly expensive special effects in shrouds of colorless gloom, this movie has both bright sunlight and dark, tense moments. Viewers will remain enthralled as the initial fleeing from the zombies gives way to plans, character conflicts and both happy and sad moments. All in all, a brilliant piece of work with a nightmare-like atmosphere."
"heaven-heaven","9","0","0","23 February 2006"," Fast Moving, and that's just the Zombies!
","At last, a re-make that's good to watch. It's rare to find a re-make that has the perfect balance between the plot of the original and a few new features of its own. The zombies move at speed, but this is supposed to be set in the immediate aftermath of their death. Think about it for a moment, the creatures have only just passed away and the rot hasn't taken hold of them or eaten at their muscles.<br/><br/>The director handles the atmosphere perfectly. The viewer is taken from the calm of the night before and is plunged into the nightmare and chaos of the day after (and all within the first ten minutes).<br/><br/>If you're looking for the same feelings that the first version managed to generate, then see the first version. The re-make is faster, and full of gore, and is in many ways better suited to the age in which it has been made. The simple truth is that a film like the first version would flop at the cinema in the same way as a novelist in the style of Jane Austin wouldn't make a packet in the modern era. The cinema-going audience expects everything to be fast and bloody, and that's precisely what you'll get if you watch this film.<br/><br/>The best way of describing Dawn of The Dead is to imagine a mixture of Day of The Triffids meets 28 Days Later and throw in a touch of Night Of The Comet for good measure. All in all, Dawn of The Dead is an excellent film and what it may lack in dialogue it more than makes up for in fast action and good acting.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen this film then rent it at the weekend, but make certain you keep watching after the boat sails off into the sun. I'm afraid that I left the cinema as soon as I thought the film had ended and, when someone told me about the ending that unravels whilst the credits are coming up, I had to wait to rent it out once the DVD was on the shelves at the video shop. The final scene is amazing.<br/><br/>The only problem with the film is that the characters are all ordinary people with no combat experience and yet they handle themselves and their weapons with the professionalism of trained soldiers. For example: I would have liked to have seen Anna struggling a little longer with the re-animated fat woman, but if that's my only criticism, I guess I should have given the film ten stars and not nine."

","When I first saw this movie, I thought it was enjoyable and entertaining, but that it only existed on a superficial level. I believed the sole purpose of this film was to provide an action-packed reformation of the original Dawn of the Dead. Being that I had been a fan of Romero's a year prior to the release of this film, I had the notion that remaking Romero's vision would be hard, if not impossible. Although nothing will equate to the original Dawn of the Dead, this film is not that bad at all. It's just an alternate outlook on a classic zombie film.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's envisioning of such a classic concept prevails. The visuals of this film are stunning. Snyder knew the vision he was trying to create and it simply worked. The film closely follows the theologies of the end times and the Rapture; it achieves a sort of apocalyptical vision. Except instead of Satan, the Anti-Christ and demons... you have zombies. Everyone is trying to protect themselves and their homestead, some with brute force, and they are just trying to cope with this sort of ""Hell on Earth."" This film really does excel visually and retains a sort of nightmarish quality to it. <br/><br/>And one aspect of the film I particularly like is the transformation and the stages of the zombies. In the bonus features to this film, Zack Snyder tells us that he created different stages and levels of the ""zombie infection."" I found this idea to be very creative and unique.<br/><br/>Good film: 7/10."
"Dhawley-2","6","0","0","4 February 2006"," Better than I expected, but Romero's version remains the best zombie film.
","As a long-time horror movie fan, I was resistant to seeing this film when it opened in theaters. Like many who consider George Romero's original the best zombie flick made, the idea of remaking such a classic seemed unnecessary and, frankly, almost blasphemous. However, having read many fairly positive reviews of the film, I decided to get the DVD and see for myself. My comments, then, are for the 'Unrated Director's Cut', with additional scenes not found in the theatrical release. The film started off quite well; the ten minute pre-credit prologue delivered a real jolt, setting the stage for the rest of the film. While the basic premise was much like the original (see other reviews for story line), the inevitable comparison allows the differences to stand out. In this version, the main characters seem to easily walk into a nearly deserted mall; in the original, finding and getting into the zombie-infested mall was much more dramatic and realistic. This version, while entertaining, lacked the dramatic tension of the original, in large part because of the larger cast. There were simply too many characters, which detracted from the feeling of despair and isolation found in the original. There were, to be sure, some good performances. Sarah Polley was quite good as the no-nonsense heroine and Ving Rhames turned in another solid performance. The best acting, however (IMO), was that of Jake Webber as Michael, the television salesman who quickly shows leadership abilities. There were also less noteworthy performances. For me, the subplot involving Mekhi Phifer and his wife (played by Inna Korobkina) simply detracted from the overall effect. The whole business (spoiler alert) of Phifer's character, a petty crook, becoming Mr. Family Values in his unshakable desire to 'raise a family' didn't work. It really got ridiculous with his wife turning into a zombie (zombification is spread by the bite of one), and him making sure that she delivered a zombie infant (!). Those scenes stopped me cold, and seemed to be added simply to increase the gore factor. Now, the Director's cut reportedly contained more ""gore and character development"" than the theatrical release, but that may not necessarily be a good thing. In my opinion, there was just too much going on with these other characters, and they really didn't make the viewer care any more about them. On the subject of gore...yes, there are some very well-done effects (although not any more gruesome than the effects in 'Land of the Dead' or the original, for that matter). One thing that, to me, detracted from the film was making the zombies fast moving. During the film, the inclusion of 'news reports' and CDC (Center for Disease Control) spokespeople revealed that the cause of this infection is never identified, yet it is revealed that the zombies ""are dead...their circulatory, respiratory and other systems no longer work."" Okay, then how do the zombies manage to run like marathoners, break down doors, jump, etc. while their bodies decay? In the film '28 Days Later', one could accept fast-moving killers, since they were not the 'living dead' but rather people who turned into homicidal cannibals by a virus. Come on. If zombies are the reanimated dead, who are decomposing daily, it doesn't add up that they can run, jump etc. The bottom line for me is that, as another reviewer notes, it ""didn't suck,"" but certainly does not put the original in any jeopardy. Entertaining, with some solid performances and good special effects, but still inferior to the original."

","Just for the record, I'm a die-hard Romero fan. I didn't mind the running zombies one bit...I thought the opening was first-rate, as well as the title sequence/montage. The zombie baby was OUTSTANDING, and was something I'd pondered and debated with fellow Romero fans for years. Even the VERY end of the movie (during the closing credits) was rather disturbing. I'm glad they removed the proposed scene w/the ""zombie dogs"" (and truth be told, I'm equally happy that Romero removed the proposed ""zombie rats"" sequence out of LOTD). The makeup was terrific, and the gore/head-shot effects were top-notch.<br/><br/>I don't know a thing about making movies. But I can get a feel for good dialog writing as opposed to not-so-good dialog writing. I gave the movie a 6/10 solely due to the fact that most of the dialog was TERRIBLE. This was mainly the case when everyone got to the mall, and seemed to continue from there on out. Even despite CJ's redemption toward the end which makes him likable, he has some of the WORST and corny lines. Everyone (as seems to be the case in mainstream horror movies) was written to try to act and talk ""too cool,"" and at times did not behave at all the way that people would behave (even in a melodramatic way) if this situation were to actually happen.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just that I'm not sure whether the creators were going for a serious or satirical zombie movie. I don't think a good balance is achieved here. The opening is EXTREMELY serious, and then 45 minutes later, Kenneth and Andy are shooting celebrity look-alike zombies from the rooftop of the mall and laughing; Steve's getting some down below, and two twenty-somethings are having a relationship blossom by laughing and having fun after they just shot the girl's father an hour earlier (a VERY serious and sad scene). It just goes from WAY light-hearted to WAY serious too many times, IMHO.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie, and I do watch it every so often. (6/10)"

This movie is at the top of my list so far, right above Day of the Dead. Who cares about those slow, un-terrifying zombies that seem to take over the world oh so easily, when you can have faster, meaner, more fiercer running zombies that are able to smash through windows with one punch? I saw this movie the first day it came out, and I have to say I became obsessed with zombies once I saw this. It was so good, I went and saw it again about a week later.<br/><br/>Sure it has its dull moments, its stupid moments, and those famous ""Let me have my own speech"" moments.

Please, don't do that. You will just ruin the movie for yourself.<br/><br/>But I must say, the writer did pretty well for a remake, though it shouldn't really BE a remake, since it only has a few things that actually relate to the old Dawn of the Dead. The death scenes were great: a woman getting sliced by a chainsaw, little girls ripping skin and muscle out of guys neck...awesome. The actors are great too. Ving Rhames did a great job. I like his character because you barely see him laugh, he's always serious, and he doesn't seem to talk much, which you need in every zombie movie, must I say. Then there's the stupid one, Nicole, where they get everyone killed. Please, for God's sake, it's a dog! Well I guess it had to keep the movie going. And then you have to smart allick, Steve, where all he does is push everyone out of his way, and barely helps, no matter what happens.

","Young director Zack Snyder risked everything he had with this remake of George Romero's classic zombie movie, and he hit the jackpot. Snyder not only makes a movie that is as good as the original, he develops the story in a different direction and makes a movie that will be remembered as a classic on its own merit.<br/><br/>The basic premise of Romero's original screenplay is here, a group of people uses a mall as a fortress during the outbreak of the zombie epidemic; nevertheless, Snyder takes a more action-oriented approach to the story focusing in the fight for survival, instead of the social cometary Romero always gives.<br/><br/>While purists may call this a cheap change to make the movie more appealing, I believe that Snyder's work is really a good rework of the story. Sure, it is true that the fast action that the movie delivers gives few room to explore the characters the way Romero used to do, Snyder makes the whole trouble a bit more realistic, by pushing the claustrophobic tension to the limit.<br/><br/>The acting is for the most part very good, and while the characters are not really very well developed, the performances of the cast really make up for it.<br/><br/>A single expression of Ving Rhames says more than a thousand lines of script. He is truly an underrated actor. Sarah Polley and Jake Weber are very convincing as unlikely survivors of this apocalypse and while not as good as Rhames, both of them have very good chemistry.<br/><br/>The SFX are very good, frightening and convincing, and to add my two cents to the famous debate about the ""running zombies"", I think that they work very good in the context of the movie and serve the purpose that Snyder had in mind.<br/><br/>Sadly, not everything is perfect, as certain subplots are somewhat absurd and out of place in the movie, also, the lack of development of the characters at times hurts the film, in the sense that one would like to know more about the characters and their motivations; nevertheless, it is fair to point out that there is more good than bad, and that the feeling after the movie is the one of entire satisfaction.<br/><br/>The dawn of the Dead remake is a movie that lives up to the expectation, and respectfully follows the path of the original in its transformation into a genre classic by its own merit.<br/><br/>8/10.

A lot of directors choose zombies as the main characters in their horror movies. So, the films are very similar. ""Dawn of the Dead"" isn't an exception. On the other hand, this film about zombies is one of the best movies from this category. The director Zack Snyder showed really monstrous and realistic zombies (the amount of them was really big!) but they were stupid and heavy-footed like others. Moreover, I liked the acting of Sarah Polley (Ana) very much. This actress was a discovery for me. There is a lot of action in ""Dawn of the Dead"". Mostly, the scene is laid in a supermarket and in the cars. The actors lick the dust one by one and this fact frightens the film viewers. Especially I liked the end of ""Dawn of the Dead"".

Many times you see a ""newer"" version of an old horror classic and it falls well short of the thrill and chills the original gave you.

The action and thrills were on par with the original (which I watched as a child and was on the edge of my seat).

My only gripe about this movie at all was that the zombies were fast, not slow. 28 Days later introduced the ""fast"" zombie, but then they weren't zombies, they were just ""infected"".... but i know a zombie when I see one. This movie seems to me like it was trying to recapture the audience that went out to see and liked 28 days later. They did a great job, but I just wished the zombies were bit slower and they had've stuck closer to the main script. What really impressed me about this film the most I;d have to say is in the end, when they took the boat and landed on an island.... Fulci's next zombie flick took place on an island... nice hand off, someone did their homework."

","I will say right away, I HATE REMAKES OF CLASSIC FILMS, but this movie proved to be a really good movie and should not disappoint fans of the original. I saw this flick in the theaters the day it came out only because a good friend of mine talked me into it. I walked out of the theater and could not stop talking about how impressed I was. First of all, this movie is quite gory. Not as gory as the original but goes above and beyond for todays standards (which are pathetic). Plenty of head shots but no disembowelment scenes that made the original one a real gore fest. My main issue with the movie is characters. There are a few characters that you do really start to care for and a lot of characters you can't wait to see die. The owner of the gun shop in the movie you really grow to like and Ving Rhames character is reminiscent of Ken Foree's character in the original. Sara Polley did alright but I really didn't care to much for her character and same goes for the rest. The thing that they executed very well was the end of the movie which I won't say what happenins but it is very impressive. All in all, it was the best remake of a movie I have seen that I can think of and it's definitely worth watching. For people who have seen the original, look for cameo appearances by Tom Savini and Ken Foree. 8 stars"

","While the most loyal Romero fans might have you believe this remake isn't a patch on the original, this ""re-imagining"" as it should really be defined, is refreshingly good.<br/><br/>In fact, this is probably the best example of a remake in some time, and adds a much needed shot of adrenalin into the rather lacking zombie genre.<br/><br/>As i said before, this movie is less a remake and more a re-imagining of the original. There's very little in common with Romero's films, and the shopping mall aside, we're offered an entirely new cast of characters, a brand new scenario and a far less claustrophobic feel than the original. This movie tries to steer away from the safe and cautious frame by frame approach, and instead opts to go in it's own individual direction, affectionately referencing it's roots, without lifting too much.<br/><br/>As a completely stand alone movie, and not in any way connected with the Savini remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"", this movie throws it's lead (played by Sarah Polley) straight into a zombie over-run world.<br/><br/>The set up for the story is brief and speedy enough, but still manages to convey enough about the lead character whilst dropping hints that things are soon to go wrong. The pre-credit sequence is one of the most energetic moments in recent film history, acting as a highlight of the movie, and setting the scene for what's to come.<br/><br/>Abandoning the relatively slow and scattered build up of the original, this movie, like it's zombies, builds up at a sprinting pace. The film is often relentless, and with the exception of a few questionable dialogue scenes, it's unlikely anyone might find the film a boring experience.<br/><br/>However, the quick and unforgiving nature of the movie also offers up perhaps the biggest drawback. Unlike Romero's original, we barely get time to fully understand or explore the cast of characters. There is some effort to open up the various personalities (especially with the core group) but overall, we're offered two dimensional, hollow caricatures. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and for the general viewing audience, those on screen are entertaining enough in their various roles, but for those who enjoy a little character development, and valued the original movie's slow, ever unfolding pace, it might be hard to find any real handle with which to fully appreciate the characters.<br/><br/>However, saying that, the primary players in this movie all fill their roles well enough. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber put in sound performances, and the secondary cast play their roles well enough, despite their being one too many clich√É¬©s for my liking. Then again, it's good to see such a healthy and diverse cast in a horror movie like this.<br/><br/>The gore-hounds should love this movie too. There's more than enough blood and cuts on offer, and more times than not, the moments of gore are far beyond what you might expect from a horror movie. Some real attention has been played to making the most of this gross-out moments, and while it might not be to everyone's taste, it should certainly appeal to those whose taste it does accommodate to.<br/><br/>To conclude; this movie definitely knows where it's at. It doesn't delude itself to thinking it's high art, and doesn't try to convey any deep and meaningful message or make a comment on the state of society today. Although the Director's Cut of this does include some scenes of this nature (which in my opinion, just don't work) the theatrical release of the film finds just the right balance between the action, horror and drama, with more than a few moments of genuine humor thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>All in all, a strong example of the genre, and an impressive reinvention of the zombie sub-genre."
"zor_prime","9","0","0","29 November 2005"," DOTD and Zombie Theory (not really a spoiler)
","Not really any big or important spoilers in this article...<br/><br/>As a big fan of zombie movies (for some strange reason, I am somewhat senselessly entranced by zombie theory), I would have to say that this is one of the finer zombie films I've ever seen. Although some viewers might call it campy or spoofy even (due to some of the very well-placed comic relief), I believe it was a great effort on the part of Zack Snyder (never heard of Zack Snyder before this movie?--me neither). Some of the DVD extras are a testament to the attention-to-detail that was given to this treatment of the old Romero flick.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot is roughly based on the original Romero film (so I won't elaborate much here), but it has a pretty hard edge (not to mention improved zombie theory). The story follows survivors in a Wisconsin burb (yeah, it's a REAL Wisconsin Death Trip!) that's suddenly ravaged by zombie hordes. Note: If you watch the extra materials, you find that the incident happens on a global scale. Incidentally, the production company seems to be called ""Strike"", but the first few times I watched the movie, I wondered if the word ""Strike"" being shown in the opening sequence was significant of the incident(s) being an intentional terrorist ""strike"". My guess now is not, but I wondered if anyone else thought that.<br/><br/>Characters: The characters are believable (all but the kid in the begging sequence). I mean, who doesn't like a Ving Rhames joint? I think the other relatively unknown actors do a pretty great job, too. Not-to-mention the zombies: The thought that went into creating anatomically correct zombies at various stages of decomposition was apparently immense. I especially liked the Andy character, a personality close to my heart, in a situation like that ;) Interesting features: I was excited to see that this treatment incorporated the 'fast-moving' zombie mobility. 28 Days Later was (to my knowledge) the first realistic movie to theorize that zombies could be more than lumbering sub-human blobs. The idea that your first encounter with a situation like this would give you very little reaction time, is pretty scary to think about (if you allow yourself a little right-brain indulgence to really imagine it). In contrast, I'd have to say slow-moving blobs would be much easier to deal with. Which scenario (slow-movers vs. fast-movers) might be closer to a realistic possibility? You'd have to read my Zombie Theory to find out what I think (coming soon). I enjoyed the placement and appropriateness of both versions of Disturbed's Down With the Sickness.<br/><br/>Negative/detracting features: The girl in the opening scenes (her locomotion and biting 'bit' seemed a little cartoonish. The zombie birthing/baby scene was unnecessarily stupid (reminiscent of a Chucky movie--blech). The head and spinal column still 'alive' in the fishing boat's cooler. I didn't like what happened in the very end scenes (embedded in the credits--you missed it if you left the theater early). The ending before that would have been fine, IMO.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I am a big fan of this production of Romero's Dawn of the Dead. I honestly feel that this film would have been much better received by audiences had it not been a ""remake"". It would have been going a little further out on a limb, but what went into this film could have produced an extremely good original movie. I guess Zack Snyder (or someone at Strike, etc.) had to make the decision early on to go with a ""remake"" for the famesake/namesake, or something potentially better (or at least as good) that would be original and not connected to the Romero film. I enjoyed the film in the theater and at home, and it is a thought-provoking inspiration to my Zombie Theory."

But there weren't many zombies in the film especially compared to the hoards of them in the first one of the same name. Though then again the only resemblance this film bears to the first is it's name and cameo appearances by members of the first movie.<br/><br/>I was good, could have been better but was still a scary little number which I watched three times and intend to watch again. I own a copy on DVD. But I will recommend one thing to those who haven't seen it yet. I saw it first on a small 21 inch screen flat screen that is, TV with Nicam sounds on Video tape. Then again on DVD same TV sounded and looked like crap. Due to it's size you miss many aspects of the film if you watch it from a normal distance so either make sure you watch it up closer, or watch it on a big screen TV if you have access to one or build a homemade TV projector from one of the many do it yourself 100"" TV projector sites around. <br/><br/>Don't pay for the plans they are available for free for best results use a magnifying glass not a Fresnel lens make sure it doesn't have a bi focal bit though. And spray a piece of MDF board with semi gloss silver paint to get a good picture anyway I used a new 32 widescreen T.V and incredible surround functions on it and OMG what I had been missing and not just on that film but many others.<br/><br/>Good film wouldn't mind seeing another zombie movie from the same producers of this"

","I really like this film although I do like Zombie films in general. The sense of being trapped and pursued by an intransigent enemy that wants to eat you is an incredible premise for a movie. Just how rational men and women would behave in that situation is fascinating. We had petrol shortages here a few years ago and there were some folk who'd have taken a head shot for a few gallons of 4 star. The veneer of civilisation is ever so thin and this film portrays that very well. A normal guy who is sooooo proud of his chainsaw option for sawing the legs off of Zombies who cling to the ""A Team"" inspired bus, is one example. Could you have shot Matt Frewer before he turned? In the UK we have little notion of guns but I suspect even in the US very few would have been able to. But once those flesh eating monsters make a move, gimme that semi auto, I'm a blowin' some Zombie brains out! Films that add a Superhuman to battle the undead, like in the Resident Evil films lose something, it needs be Joe and Joanne public that put up the fight. Imaging a Zombie attack in Metropolis? Where's the danger there? Superman could vapourise 'em all in no time. No, it needs normal people, in the US with oodles of guns, in the UK with sharp sticks and cricket bats, to fend of the fiends. I also liked the way you never know who's gonna get bit, no-one is safe, the ending is never clear so the tension builds and builds. I've seen this movie 4 times now and if it's on again this weekend put me down for 5. Great, scary entertainment"

","This was such an excellent film that all horror fans should be raving about it until we get another in the same vein, perhaps a direct sequel signed over by Romero with Snyder and a few of the original (remake) cast on board. And if we're all very lucky Snyder will try to outdo himself the second time around. Except for having the same name and being about zombies it's kind of hard to really call this a remake or even compare it to the ""original."" They really are two entirely separate films, with two separate attitudes, ethos, and for lack of a better word, feel. It's pseudo-political timing, which every serious film that uses explicit amounts of sex or violence must ultimately be, was perfect, the escalating war in Iraq, the building of fundamentalist religious fervor bordering on madness, the almost simultaneous... compare and contrast me even though I have absolutely nothing to do with... release of the ultra-violent ""Passion.""

Not only a great work by the novel director Zack Snyder but a great example of performance and acting that show us the value of fantastic and horror movies. Actually this kind of movies have a level of acting very high, and lots of quality. What's the difference between this remake and other zombie movies? Well, is not a comedy but it has funny bits (the first musical number with the Shopping mall robbery) it has drama (like the end of Andy) and the rest of the movie is horror, horror and more horror (Scariest scene: Zombie birth). Sarah Polley does a great work as Anna the nurse, Ving Rhames is a perfect Kenneth, and Zack Snyder the best director to make it.

I went to see Dawn of the Dead on opening weekend and whoa I had an awesome time.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is not just a good remake ..it is a good zombie film in general. 28 Days Later basically kicked started the zombie genre again in 2003 and in a sense helped this movie get green lighted. It shows that the zombie genre is in full force because Dawn of the Dead 2004 does not disappoint. The director Zack Snyder really knew what we wanted. He did not just do a remake and carbon copied the original. He made the film stand out on its own and one of the thing he added was fast moving zombies. In my opinion it worked and made the film intense.<br/><br/>The movie waste no time getting to the blood and gore. Within the first 10 minutes we are treated to an intense zombie opening followed by one of the best opening credits ever. What better way to start off this bloody film than with Johnny Cash? We have some cool actors in this movie like Ving and Sarah and some actors who I have never heard of that are good in this movie. But Ving owns this movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, when the end credits roll.

The original Dawn was much more of a slow moving character developing movie. The new one though does try to develop the characters it does not really manage (have only seen this in the Cinemas) its more of a survivor movie with flight or fight instincts being played out. Were the original layed out to be a deep thinking view of humanity the second shows how most people seem to form up in situations such as this.<br/><br/>Have to say that if they gave it a different title and kept references to Dawn at a minimum it would have been a much different movie that even more of my steadfast Romero followers would have enjoyed.<br/><br/>P.s they should have kept the line 'When theirs no more room in hell...' out of the script totally, there is only one movie that can claim that line."

There were some parts in the movie where I found myself on the edge of my seat, almost shivering and sweating. My heart was pounding, too. I've seen plenty of horror movies in my time and those feelings have never bothered me. It was very interesting that those symptoms of nervousness came about. I mean, I was just expecting a zombie to pop out from behind a corner during some of those scenes.<br/><br/>I'm also happy that it had a fast pace and immediately got to the point without seeming too ambitious. It also did a good job of making it realistic (or as realistic as a zombie movie can be). After all, it wasn't like they filmed George A. Romero's script again, bringing back the same characters and occurrences. They did, however, keep the concept of consumerism Romero satirized in his version of ""Dawn of the Dead.""<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who likes horror movies (or those who specifically enjoy zombie movies), or wants a good thrill.<br/><br/>First-time director Zack Snyder appears as a soldier in front of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., during the beginning credits -- for those of you who love movie trivia."

The mall scenes are great but the scene with them getting to the mall is so fantastic. The main girl gets home and goes to bed with her boyfriend. Then the next morning her boyfriend is bitten and transforms into a zombie. So for 15 minutes shes dodging zombies in the street and people are trying to get into her car and then she crashes and the opening credits begin. NOw I've never seen a movie with an intro like that.

","Okay. Maybe I've become too jaded to horror films (unlikely; I tend to jump at the same point several times in a row) but I really don't get what's so great about this movie.<br/><br/>Point one. Fast running zombies just don't work for me. This movie should have been called Dawn of the Psychos (or Demented, if you want to stick with the alliteration theme) That could have worked; a bunch of lunatics running around trying to carve people up would probably have gotten me on the edge of my seat. To be honest, half the time I forgot these guys were supposed to be dead until I got a close up. Zombies that move slowly and seemingly unstoppably creep me out far more than ones that run around like hamsters on caffeine. To make a comparison, it's like the shower scene in Psycho; part of the reason that's so sinister is because of the slow, deliberate movements right up until the knife flashes down. If he'd rushed in, yanked the curtain off and killed her in about three seconds, it wouldn't have been nearly so nerve-racking. Same goes for here. There's nothing truly scary about a zombie that races around.<br/><br/>Point two. The suspense for me was almost non-existent, as was the character development. Basically, people need to care about characters in order to worry about whether or not the zombies/aliens/vampires/insert bad guy here will get them. Character development here was so lax that I honestly didn't care whether or not the people lived or died. End result, almost no suspense. I think the dog got better character development overall than the humans.<br/><br/>There were a couple of good bits; the communicating between the two groups on the rooftops was good, and the end credits sequence (watch it and you'll see what I mean) I was on the edge of my seat far more with those credits than the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I liked Dawn of the Dead; it's a fun film to zombie with (pun intended ;)) I just don't get why everyone was raving about it.

The peril she finds herself in is so effective because she manages to seem so ordinary, so available. I can't think of another actress who manages to convey her combination of vulnerability and tenacity (see ""The Claim"" for more proof), yet she's never precious, she seems to barely know the camera exists. It's strange to find such good performances, across the board, in a zombie movie.

It depicted a social satire, comparing us with the zombies. We are, after all, a world run by advertisements, by TV, and by everyone else in the media. Why not wind up in the mall with everyone else? Zombies are shown in all their glory, moaning and groaning about. They are as much part of the movies as the humans are, and there's even a bit of humor about them.<br/><br/>But not in the new version. The social message is thrown away, for the most part. Zombies in here are secondary. There's nothing funny about them. But there's plenty of action, and that's what this movie boils down to, an action packed-zombie fest.<br/><br/>So we are really looking at 2 different films here, with the only relationship being is that the humans shut themselves in a mall for safety. The earlier version is more violent & scarier, if a bit more preachy. I also liked the ending of the first one far better then this one. I won't reveal, but it's a distinctive flavor between possible hope and utter despair.<br/><br/>But those looking for a violent zombie action movie can't go wrong with this. It's better then Resident Evil, IMHO.<br/><br/>If you get the DVD, don't miss some of the extras ""The Lost Tape: Over 15 Minutes of Terrifying Footage Revealed"", where poor Andy shows us in a video his last few days of life.<br/><br/>Now, If your looking for a better 'zombie' type of movie, take a look at '28 days Later'"

Despite these small flaws, the film had impressive elements like a creepy almost surreal atmosphere, that gave you the sense of what it's like to live in a nightmare. I enjoyed the consistency of the action, which kept me thrilled throughout the film. Overall the film was a good suspense thriller which could had been better if there had been a little more ambition."

","This movie was good and i was surprised because it was a remake and I'm not a big fan of remakes i like original material. I found some parts to be suspenseful and creepy and other parts to be funny and comical especially if you see or watched the directors cut. I liked the characters and it didn't really copy the original in the same way and i liked it because it was different. I mean originally the movie was rated NC-17 because of the further inappropriate material in the movie, but then they cut it down, and some of that material is in the directors cut. I mean the director really showed his skills, and i mean the movie was taken totally seriously, but i mean it was better then i thought it was going to be, so good job!

","If you're a fan of the genre, this is definitely worth a look. And, keep your eyes peeled for Ken Foree (as the televangelist), who starred in the original '76 movie of the same name...while you're at it, check out Tom Savini (horror make-up/special effects man extraordinaire) as the sheriff! Same plot as the 1st one, but different ending, and much better special effects/make-up than way back in the olden days of the first. Also, Ving Rhames is nothing' to sneeze at, either, and pulls off a great 'bruiser with a heart of gold' act. Although there were some predictable parts, the acting and the tech aspects of the film worked very well, and presented an excellent new-millennium perspective.<br/><br/>Eat your heart out, Romero!"

","It's been years since a horror film left me thinking, DAMN that was pretty darned scary. Last film that did that was SQUIRM, and i was 6 years old. Why does this movie work ? Well, some people won't like this comment, but RUNNING ZOMBIES. Yes, it's a new Hollywood trend, but the fact these human eating fools can run as fast if not faster than you is absolutely terrifying and helps make this one of the better zombie films made in my opinion. Solid script, solid writing, surprisingly great acting, and I think Romero himself might be impressed slightly . However, unlike the original which showed a perspective on ""society"" as a whole , this movie tends to be more for action and scares. Which works for me. Because when I think of zombies, i want to run and hide, not get a lesson on life's inconsistencies and pitfalls. This movie is fun, scary, and if zombies took over the world, this is the way I would NOT want them to be. Which means I was scared and eating popcorn for 2 great hours of movie theater fun."

","I've wanted to see this film for awhile now. A lot of people said that Dawn of the Dead is a great horror film and it's gotten good reviews, so why not? I watched it. The film wasn't as good as I thought it would be. In fact, I thought it was more funny than scary because of how the dead zombies acted. The acting was alright, a few corny lines and some bad dialouge but they did alright, I guess. The gun owner named Andy was my favorite character because I thought he was a bad ass. Too bad things didn't exactly happen right for him. Overall, a decent horror film with some freaky scenes and the movie entertains you for sure. Usually, I tend to think that most all of horror films are really bad but this film wasn't bad at all, but just not exactly good. Decent film to say the most for Dawn of the Dead.

Good action scenes they were too, well paced, well acted and the tension was well developed by the direction.

It's seems movies with underlying, yet obvious, motives are far more entertaining than straight action. This is also true of the brilliant 28 Days Later, although in a different, less humorous way.

","I absolutely love movies about the apocalypse. I'm sorry, but I find it absolutely romantic to watch movies about the end of the world. Yeah, I know I am crazy, but it is my weird fetish. This movie did not disappoint. The first 20 minutes of this movie was absolutely horrifying. I could literally feel my blood pressure and my heart rate climb to fear induced levels. Yes, I was actually scared, and my body was responding to it. It is crazy to be attacked by someone you love. In this movie her own husband and a trusted girl attack the main character Sara. I loved it when she ran out of her house to escape to see the whole city in chaos. Her neighbor was pointing a gun at her, and all the houses were on fire. Her neighbors were being slaughtered right in front of her. It made the hair on my neck stand up! The first 20 minutes of the move had me hooked. She escapes the situation and gets together with survivors at the local mall. Unfortunately the rest of the movie was situated in the mall. I would have preferred a movie where the characters were continuously on the run, (similar to 28 Days). The mall scenes were mildly scary, but the situation was different in the mall. The mall gave the characters a sense of security that lessened the fear of the situation. The mall kept the ""living dead"" out, and it gave the characters a security that actually made me relax. I would have like them to be put in uncomfortable situations throughout the movie. I felt that they were given too much control. The mall was a barrier between the living and the dead, and I feel that the barrier should have been blurred. Beyond my negativity, I still feel that this movie was an above average horror movie. I wish I had monitors hooked up to me during this movie. There were certain scenes that would have caused the monitors to go off in ""code blue"" mode. I can say that I was scared at moments, and I feel that a movie has succeeded if it can cause emotion such as panic.<br/><br/>I would like to add I was the only person that stayed in the theater to see the end credits. The end credits showed what happened when the boat reached the island. Freaking' Awesome ending! It was the most exciting end credits I have seen in a movie."

","It seems most comments are coming from horror aficionados who have seen the original. I'm not one of them. I have neither the time nor the inclination to watch a movie more than once... Indeed I rarely watch a movie in its entirety unless it is really compelling. <br/><br/>I didn't expect this one would hold my attention longer than a heartbeat. To date, I've seen it three times. It's a fun escape.<br/><br/>At 40 I'm at the tail end of the baby boom. A lot of consumer goods and services are targeted at us boomers; it's a big demographic. This includes movies. As I've gotten older, my tastes have changed - mindless gore no longer cuts it. A lot of idealistic, corny, social commentary makes me roll my cynical eyes dismissively. And blaringly, loud, shock scenes are just annoying. <br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead 2004 seems to have been made for boomers. The vicarious experience was just right. The non-zombie characters could be my friends or co-workers. The story doesn't stretch reality to the point of being silly; you only have to suspend your belief where necessary (vis-a-vis zombies). At the same time, it doesn't attempt to be too serious either. To put it in some perspective, the Die Hard films don't use a supernatural element, but are they really any more probable?<br/><br/>***Potential spoiler ahead*** I enjoy pondering what I would have done differently had I been there. The mall was a good idea though an airport might have been better. I think that Andy would have had a hunting bow and could have shot an arrow trailing a fishing line across to the mall roof. With that they could have passed a rope across allowing weapons, food, and even Andy himself to get over. <br/><br/>Anyway, enough said. See the movie."
"malkane316","8","0","0","3 March 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","Being a zombie movie fan, i have much enjoyed the recent (continuing) resurgence of the genre. As i believe that Romero's Dawn is not only the best zombie movie ever, but one of the best horror movies, i was both excited and sceptical to hear about a remake. Reasons for excitement- 1. It's zombies. 2. A big budget. 3. If done right, could be brilliant. Reasons for scepticism- 1. A big budget. 2. Less gore, less shock value. 3. If done wrong could be awful, and possibly tarnish the name of the original in some people's eyes.<br/><br/>I soon heard that the zombies would be able to run- a source of many arguments among fans and purists. On one side, the zombies were scarier because their slow speed was irrelevant, they would probably get you in the end through sheer numbers or by the fact that they don't get tired. Slow zombies were scary because they were falling to pieces. However, on the other side, people who have recently turned may still be in good shape so should be able to run until they begin to decay. Fast zombies make the threat more immediate and therefore give rise to more jumpy moments. Fast zombies mean we have an even smaller chance of survival as we may not be able to outrun them. Some have said the zombies in this are 'super-fast', but this is nonsense. A zombie should only be as fast as it was before it turned, more likely slower, but will not get out of breath. All this running will however mean quicker decay. What it all boils down too in the end is whether you can make your choice effective, and in both films, both directors succeed.<br/><br/>A Nurse, Ana, during and after a heavy shift fails to notice the news reports that the dead are attacking the living. It is probably rubbish anyway, and she just wants to get home to suburbia. The next morning, her young neighbour enters her bedroom; She seems to be hurt. When her husband investigates, she attacks him, biting off part of his throat. He dies, the phone is engaged, but he quickly rises again and goes for his wife. When she escapes the house she witnesses chaos, people screaming, houses on fire and being attacked, her neighbour with a gun, promptly run over by an ambulance. She escapes in her car only to crash after seeing the scale of the madness. Soon she meets with a cop- Kenneth, Michael, Andre and his pregnant girlfriend Luda. They decide to hide in a local mall only to find that Store guards have claimed it for their own. However, they work out a compromise and soon other survivors join them. As the days pass, they try to work out a solution, how to maintain their safety and sanity. When an attempt to send food to Andy, a survivor on the roof of a gun shop a few hundred yards away goes wrong, the zombies get into the mall, and the remaining survivors flee. Their plan to escape to an island by boat seems good, but it is based on pure hope, and the desire to get out of their present situation, rushed, and the hordes continue to chase.<br/><br/>The film lacks the brains and atmosphere of Romero's masterpiece. But it makes up for this by giving an excellent view of how contemporary people would likely react to the situation. The film begins quickly, and to the director's credit, the pace continues throughout. Anytime something good happens, something worse happens to bring the characters to an even lower state. It is frantic, but never out of control, and their is a fair amount of tension. Once we realise the zombies are fast, we are on edge, prepared for one or one hundred to come racing round the nearest shadowy corner. The actors all do well, particularly Polley and the excellent Weber. His character is just a normal guy, a failure at many things, but who will not give up. Rhames is tough, but doesn't set out on his own, knowing that he is needed. The soundtrack is more conventional,with booming rock songs being played over each attack, but this heightens the chaos. There is little hope left at the end, and little time for discussion over why this has happened. There are a few good set pieces, and the gore is good for a modern mainstream film. There are a few funny moments, and of course, another staple of zombie films, an annoying character-Steve. The best of the recent serious zombie films by a wide margin, lets see if Romero can regain his crown.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Well, I remember renting Dawn of the Dead last year on video after reading some enthusiastic reviews and hearing about other zombie flicks. Well, I borrowed it... and I was blown away. Just like when I borrowed Braindead a few months earlier.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is a very good zombie film. The plot is almost identical to the original (which I am currently trying to watch), and it makes for very good viewing. Even more amazing about the film is the fact that it is a DIRECTORIAL DEBUT. How about that?!<br/><br/>Well, if you haven't seen it, here is the plot: Something - a virus, possibly; it is never explained - is causing the dead to rise. Not just in a small area, but worldwide. Spreading like wildfire, anybody bitten by one of these things will transform anywhere from a few minutes to a few days later. And these things need to feast on the flesh of the living. A group of survivors, including a nurse, a cop and a pregnant woman (and a guy that sells TV's at Best Buy) take refuge in a massive shopping centre.<br/><br/>Well, that's all I am revealing for now.<br/><br/>The opening sequence - which is one of the most breathtaking I have ever seen - is slightly more edgy than the rest of the film. But just slightly. Ever so slightly.<br/><br/>Some classic moments - the ""flying"" zombie, for instance - are just ingenious.

","I just saw this one yesterday on video. I must first off confess that I haven't seen the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" except for brief clips(which really shouldn't count). I must say I was impressed.<br/><br/>I will also cop to the fact that I am not ordinarily a horror film fan. That isn't to say I haven't seen my fair share of scary flicks be it cheesy and formulaic(i.e. most of the Friday the 13th series,the first ""Poltergeist for examples) or classic(""Psycho"",""Carrie"",""NIght of the Living Dead"" come to mind),but I don't think I could call myself an aficionado of the genre. Having said that,I would recommend this film to either horror buffs and even non-buffs,but the latter on one condition:that you have a high tolerance for gore.<br/><br/>By now,you know the scenario:a group of basically ordinary people hide out at a mall,trying to stay safe and stave off a seemingly endless waves of flesh and brain-eating undead. Naturally,a level of claustrophobia envelops the group and it becomes as much a psychological drama as it is an emotional thriller. For all you uber violence fans out there,there's plenty of killing,crashing and explosions to keep you sated. Ving Rhames and JAke Webber really stand out among the survivors here,though I gotta give credit to Sarah Polley for adding a level of thoughtful dignity to her character in a film type she's not ordinarily associated with. A mostly obscure cast(that seems predominantly Canadian!hmmmmn) fills out this cast,exceptions being Mekhi Pfeifer and Matt Frewer(Max Headroom,anyone?). The makeup effects for the zombies are strangely showcased in full in only two parts of the movie: the very beginning and toward the end. The credits were probably consisting of mostly fx,makeup,pyrotech,stunts and cameras.No surprise there really,and they do their jobs superbly!<br/><br/>To those who want to see a wild,explosive action/horror hybrid of a film,I recommend it. 8 out of 10 stars."

","As a fan of the original DotD I was partially satisfied with this remake. The storyline is just right at creating the necessary end of the world feel. The acting, while not remarkable, does the job. The blood bath, which was a very important part as this was supposed the be a remake of a Romero movie, a gore god in the horror community, was also satisfactory, with some awesome scenes like the zombie-leg-chopping chainsaw sequence. Plus, I really enjoyed the use of music in this film. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I thought the characters could've been paid a little more attention to. Some of them are extremely one-dimensional that you don't even care about what happens with them. No, I don't think the movie needed to develop each individual, but there are ways to make a character interesting without wasting too much time, just ask Tarantino or Guy Ritchie. <br/><br/>But these are minor flaws. Like I said, I really enjoyed the movie and as horror fan I sure will soon be adding the DVD to my collection."

","Dawn of the Dead features no survivors, no happy endings, no self-aware dialogue, just straight forward action and horror, and after roughly 8 years of Scream imitations-it's a welcome change. This movie didn't necessarily chill me like George Romero's original Night Of The Living Dead, but that was a bit of a different scenario. Where that one was a few people holed up in a house with dozens of zombies outside, Dawn features an army of hundreds of zombies waiting outside a suburban mall for our dozen or so survivors inside. There are plenty of good old 80's horror movie situations, where you say to yourself ""Why is this idiot doing this?"", but director Zack Snyder doesn't let things get too out of hand, and keeps things as realistic as possible. Michael Kelly (CJ) and Ty Burrell (Steve) offer some funny lines, and Mekhi Phifer (Andre) gives a performance that steadily becomes creepier as the movie goes on. Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later have cemented the return of the zombie film after a long absence."

Wow! in the right hands the story has all the ingredients for a great movie. I thought the remake was great. From the unusually sharp script to the believable acting of most of the characters ( the female lead in particular ). The use of Johnny Cash's ""When The Man Comes Around"" for the opening titles is one of the most inspired choices I have ever heard from an opening sequence. The film has many memorable moments, particularly chilling was the scene where the White House/Government spokesman answered terror stricken reporters questions about the reanimation of the dead with the heartbreakingly honest reply .......""We don't know.""

"Cliche_Guevara","7","0","0","30 December 2004"," Not that bad, actually
","First of all, I would like to say that I saw this before I saw the Romero version. Now with that out of the way, I think that despite the fact that nearly all satire is gone from this film, it was still very good, the first fifteen minutes of the film were awesome, by itself it could have been a very, very good short film, but then the credits ended and the film got slightly worser and worser as it went along. The acting was not that bad, even though a lot of the dialog was immensely cheesy, mostly due to Ving Rhames, nearly no character development, except for the main security guard. The zombies were very impressive, but on the topic of zombies, they were fast, I'm not a fan of fast zombies, but maybe because I really love old-school zombie movies. But the main thing here that I did not like was that there are about Seven or Eight people in the mall this time, unlike in the original where there is four, giving very little times to really know most of the characters. But in the end it is still a better-than-average zombie movies. Not anywhere near as good as the original but still good.<br/><br/>7/10"
"cmivie","7","0","0","30 December 2004"," Another remake, but at least Dawn isn't all that bad.
","Hollywood is suffering from a new disease...........remakeitis! So far in 2004, we have seen remakes of Flight of the Phoenix, Stepford Wives, Walking Tall and Dawn of the Dead. And their are more to come in 2005, which tells me that ideas are scarce in Hollywood. I'm not dogging remakes. But with the increase we have seen just in the last few years, I really am starting to worry that studios are abandoning ""original"" ideas. In any case, when I heard that Dawn was going to be remade, my first thought was that it really couldn't be any worse than the original. I know the original Dawn has a cult-like following, but in all honesty that film is not very good.<br/><br/>So..........what about the 2004 version? Well, let me say this. The remake is good, when you compare it to the original. But, I do have several problems with this film. I'll get to those in a second. Let me address the positives.<br/><br/>First of all, this film does not follow the original in every detail. Most remakes don't, but for Dawn this was actually the best choice. Dawn is all about one thing...........survival. We have a group of people that are simply trying to survive. I like the fact that the group becomes a family of sorts, realizing that they need one another to survive. I also liked how Ving Rhames was the only true bad-ass in the film. He is a cop, so it is to be expected. But Rhames (as he usually does) plays this part so well that you love it when he starts to accumulate a high body count of zombies. I liked the diversity of characters. A salesman, a nurse, a gay organ player for a church, a playboy, a jerk security guard...........as that diversity meshes really well in this film. I also liked how in the midst of all the chaos, the characters get to know one another, meaning we get to know who they are. A lot of time, films like Dawn look past this aspect. I'm glad the director didn't do that. And then their is the segment that had me rolling..........and for you Disturbed fans out their, you know what I am talking about. Using Disturbed's ""The Sickness"", they had some guy singing the song in a Frank Sinatra style that just was so funny, I had to play the over again. It is pure genius to use this song in the film, but to do it in this way was just so damn funny.<br/><br/>Now, the bad stuff. I guess their is a handbook out their entitled ""What to do when Zombies attack"". And in that book, the author must have stated that the first place to seek shelter is..........The Mall! And wouldn't you know, the zombies must have known this (or maybe the author turned into a zombie and told all his zombie buddies that survivors will flock to the mall) cause right before our group of survivors can get into the mall, the zombies show up. Okay, I can live with this. But I refuse to accept that mall security guards will be packing heat. In Dawn, the security guys are packing, which was a terrible thing to have in the film. Then, this movie wasted Mekhi Phiefer's talents. If you watch ER, then you know this guy is one hell of an actor. Here, he is wasted. Lastly, this film is not a horror movie. It is an action film with zombies. Their really isn't anything scary about this film. The zombies look great, meaning they look hideous and scary. But the film is not a horror film.<br/><br/>Overall, Dawn is good for what it is, and it is actually a remake that is better than the original. Having Rhames as the lead character was a great call, cause anybody else in that role just wouldn't work. I think Ving is one of the most under-appreciated actors today. But I also have to mention Jake Weber, mostly because I hope this film will give him more exposure. The guy is a great talent, and he plays his part so well that you really feel for him in the end. Those two made this movie for me."
"Eleutherios","7","0","0","26 December 2004"," Pretty Average Movie
","As far as horror movies go, this was pretty average. Its best feature was, quite definitively, the special effects. The zombies looked pretty realistic, along with the blood and gore which would accompany their deaths. Unlike other horror movies, you feel more immersed because of the realistic zombies.<br/><br/>It lacked in other departments, though. For me, it was only exciting in the beginning and the end. The middle was long and tedious, broken up only by the occasional event -- which often turned out to be a dud. There was one really strange part (more strange than scary, which is a reoccurring theme in this movie) which sort of livened things up, but other than that, it was dull in the center.<br/><br/>The acting was convincing. There were few lines that sounded forced, and it all seemed pretty natural.<br/><br/>Overall, a good watch if you're a fan of the horror movie genre, or if you love special effects. Most people will probably find it about average."

With his great visual style and well timed scares, Snyder re-animated (pun intended) the zombiegenre. A nice treat to horrorveterans is the return of the original cast. The 3 leadactors of the classic have small appearances in this film. Extra titbit: i enjoyed the small intro from the director on the DVD.<br/><br/>This movie SCREAMS for a sequel. I sure as hell would love to see one.<br/><br/>9/10"

","It was interesting that Zack Snyder decided to take the 28 days later path than the original Romero route, if he had done then i believe the film would have been slated simply because it is not as intelligent nor does it possess the social commentary that Romero's original did.<br/><br/>What i did enjoy about the film was the fact that it made its Zombies out to be a real threat to the characters, unlike Romero's who really mounted nothing more than a nuisance.

","i have yet to see the original, so i don't have anything to compare it to, so this is probably going to change. i hate movies, where characters are stupid, like going back to check on her husband, even though its obvious he's the living dead. however it was fun being a smartass and yelling at the screen littering the dialogue with sarcasm and cynicism. i was exceptionally pleased with the slow version of ""get down with the sickness"" and ving rhames was surprisingly strong. The pregnant lady and baby thing was pretty nasty, but i can see how this could become a cult classic very quickly. i am sure that some die hard fans of the original will call this crap, but we need remakes to give the newer generations a hint at what they missed, and what it took to get us here in today's cinema"
"Grosik_Stim","8","0","0","15 December 2004"," Finally A Good Modern Zombie Film!
","**MILD SPOILERS***<br/><br/>This film works. The reason, quite simply, is moderation. Now moderation may be a strange concept in a zombie film, but it is the reason that so many modern gore and horror films have failed. Yes, Dawn Of The Dead is bloody. Yes it is violent. You can't really go too far with those elements when killing the undead is an integral part of your story¬Ö but it is story that is most often sacrificed in favour of more killing. This film doesn't fall into that trap. Back to moderation:<br/><br/>1)Horror movies in general rely on some degree of macho stereotypes and dialogue. Dawn Of The Dead is no different, but they keep it to a minimum and characters like Sarah Polley's are there to diffuse it before you are overwhelmed by it. The macho one-liners and tag lines serve their purpose well, creating the campy comic relief that makes these movies fun without sending the film all the way into the category of ridiculous pumped up action film.<br/><br/>2)Some comments here have accused the film of using a lot of CGI. They're wrong. I hate overuse of CGI and this film holds back, favouring the good old method of making up hundreds upon hundreds of extras (watch the special features on the DVD if you don't believe me). A good special effects team who hire quality local make-up artists and stunt personnel can still outdo the best CGI effects and this movie is a prime example. House Of The Dead went cheap on the make-up and put all their eggs in the CGI basket ¬ñ wrong choice. This film gets it right.<br/><br/>3)Sappy, passive females and tacked on love stories will ruin a fun, fast-paced horror/slasher film every time. There is a little of that here, but it is inventive ¬ñ a pregnant couple, brief 'the world is ending' sex, and a sacrifice ending that actually avoids being heavy-handed. I was surprised. Very surprised. Good job.<br/><br/>4)Modern heavy music has come to replace ominous synth pads and orchestral atmosphere in the genre. Dawn Of The Dead mixes both quite well. A few well placed contemporary tracks serve to update the feel without turning it into a music video or a vehicle by which to sell a soundtrack album.<br/><br/>5)Editing. The new school seems to be obsessed with fast cuts and rock video pacing (28 Days Later relies on the digital format and its editing tricks - and loses tons of atmosphere because of it). This does nothing to build tension, suspense or fear. I'm not saying that Dawn Of The Dead is by any means a Tartovsky art film, but they at least let the camera linger a little longer than 2 seconds and you can get a sense of the isolation with some well designed long shots and single takes. The juxtaposition between the ominously empty mall and the claustrophobic streets is well conceived and executed.<br/><br/>Recent films like 28 Days Later and House Of The Dead didn't find a way to use these elements in moderation and the results were laughable, annoying, and just plain awful. Kudos to the Dawn Of The Dead team for making a zombie movie that is true to the genre, true to its history and yet, still a watchable and wildly entertaining film. In the end, the film pulls off being engaging, suspenseful, realistic (in context of course), and still a heck of a lot of campy, gory fun. Recommended to all sceptics of remakes and modern horror!"
"TelevisionJunkie","8","0","0","12 December 2004"," Not Romero's vision, but it's not supposed to be
","I must preface this by saying that I am a fan of the original (1978) version of the movie (though to this day, I can't understand the appeal of the original ""Night of the Living...""). Unlike many fans of the original, however, I found this version more than satisfactory. It's been my position for eons that if someone is going to do a remake of a classic film, they need to bring something new to the table -- and that's exactly what the re-makers of ""Dawn of the Dead"" have done. The original went for the satire of consumerism, while this one plays out merely for character pathos and scares. While satire seemed to work for the Romero version (though it ultimately collapsed under its own weight with a silly biker invasion), it simply couldn't work today... at least not as the semi-spoof that the original tried to be.<br/><br/>This far-less-intimate version follows the exploits of a gang of people who wind up taking refuge in a shopping mall, whilst hoards of zombies congregate outside of the walls (in the original, the zombies were loose within the mall itself). These zombies are from the ""28 Days Later"" school of zombies -- they move swiftly and are relentless in their hunger for human flesh. While the characters are secondary to the action (particularly in the version I saw at the theatre), all of the actors seem to bring a flair to the characters that they portray. And the ending, which ultimately plays out through the ending credits, is superior to the biker-invasion-cum-escape that Romero left us with in the original version.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers for the original: The Romero version featured some scenes that I really miss in this version -- including the infamous screwdriver-through-the-head (though homage was paid with the mallet-through-the-head) and a slide down the the railing of the escalator, but the original was its own entity. Nothing like it had existed before it... and nothing ever will again. <br/><br/>Though this version doesn't keep the tight photography and innovative camera angles used in the first version (with many scenes that have been endlessly imitated), it does its best to deliver scares for a new generation. What more can you ask of a remake?"

","Another year, another remake of a classic horror film. Last year it was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and now we have a re-working of George Romero's 1978 classic. It seems there really are no original ideas left! Anyway, what we have here is more of an action film than a splatterfest. The basic plot is the same - the world has been taken over by flesh-eating zombies, and a small group of survivors hole up in a suburban shopping mall.<br/><br/>The main difference with the original is the zombies themselves. No longer the slow, stumbling creatures that were easily out-run, these new 21st Century monsters run. And boy, do they run quick! I shan't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but do yourselves a favour - don't compare this to the original. I know it's hard, but seeing this movie with a biased opinion (we all know it's never going to be as good as the original) will spoil it. I had to watch it a couple of times, but once I got all the comparisons to the original out of the way, I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you haven't seen this or the original, see this one first.

","When I started this movie I was expecting something completely stupid and uninspired. Well it is still a remake and that kinda sucks, but I got over it and now enjoy a lot. My college major is Film and watching this movie had me glued to the screen. The look was so unique, the colors in the opening are awesome and I totally dug the aerial shot of Ana driving to her house in her neighborhood. The first 15 minutes is one of the most exciting openings I have seen in a long time. And the way it showed the end of the world through someone who is clueless was great and it was very effecting. The aerial shot of Ana driving on the highway while tragedy is all around her was one of the best shots in a movie I have seen in forever and it too had me glued. The opening credits rocked as well and is very unique for its music choice which made even more great. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty interesting, well the main ones are I mean. I liked Ana and found her quite dependable. Michael rocked and his presence added magic to the screen. Kenneth was your stereotypical tough cop but Ving Rhames was awesome at it! C.J who is my favorite character did a standout job as the asshole turned friend and hero. Andre was annoying because I hate the tough guy type of characters and Luda was sweet and I felt for her when she was going through, well you know what if you've seen it. Everyone else did good as well, even the little parts such as Glen, Monica, Terry, and Nicole. To sum it up I was on their side the whole way.<br/><br/>This movie is not your Oscar type so you just let go of your logic and enjoy it, it is exciting, funny, and scary. Vivien was awesome as the little girl and I love her jump up off the floor shot. It did have some drawbacks such as the group wearing short sleeves and such, but oh well I guess they didn't want a bunch of people running around in hockey suits which I can understand. I cannot stress how awesome this movie is, and believe me I am not a stupid movie lover, I love the originals and I am very hard on what horror movie I watch. This one just had this feel to it which made it so enjoyable to me.<br/><br/>The directing by Snyder was great as well. His choice of colors made everything look washed out and unique, Matthew Fleonetti did the cinematography and he also did Poltergeist, just thought that was cool to know. Snyder's choice of certain shots is kind of weird but it worked out well, and by this I mean why show a toilet in slo motion, well for whatever reason it was a good choice. The direction has enthusiasm and you can tell that Snyder cared and lot and had a blast as well. Music wise the score was good, nothing spectacular but good, and the choice of songs was very unique, When the man comes around, Down with the sickness slow version. The movie knows how far fetched it is so it just makes its own thing of it. Sometimes people are too hard on movies by picking on the little things, just don't do that its as simple as that. When you first view this just expect fun entertainment and leave your logic behind. I mean I am so amazed at how much I like it, and I am not easy to please with action but this movie had it going and at every explosion there was it was a awesome sight to see.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead (2004) ***1/2 - Pure fun and entertainment. Dawn of the Dead (1978) ***1/2 - Awesome character study and undertones with a hint of campiness which makes it unique."

"spacism","6","0","0","17 November 2004"," I had fun getting angry at this movie.
","(Possible Spoilers)<br/><br/>Mildly interesting film plagued by ""wouldn't it be cool if...?"" moments, poor character decisions, and many more negatives. Normally I don't write reviews, but I feel the need to p*ss on this movie a bit. It should have been made under its own name and attempted to be its own movie, because as it stands, nothing matches up to the original. Whatever royalty money George Romero receives from the making of this film, he should use it to have those responsible for it shot.<br/><br/>I'm sick of hack horror directors using strobe effects (think 28 Days) to make the zombies appear to move at high rates of speed. If it works in the haunted houses... Now, I'm not a fan of fast moving zombies, but they do bring something to the zombie movie genre, but it isn't something that is necessarily good. Why make them zombies at all? Why not people under the effects of a substance that makes them go crazy and attack others. It seems unrealistic to have these zombies behave the way they do after considering the damage done to the body. After a person is ripped to shreds, or succumbs to the disease after being bitten by the zombie, they would be reanimated with a seriously damaged body. Muscles and the brain would be deteriorated, it isn't plausible for the reanimated bodies to get up and start sprinting like Carl Lewis. As opposed to the machine like zombies in this film, the zombies in Romero's films are convincing. You expect a dead person to move with difficulty and in a state of confusion, once you accept that they can move at all. I'm extremely turned off by the herky-jerky motion, and feel that it takes the viewer out of the reality of the situation. The movie becomes slick and like something out of a video game. One second the person is dead, the next, they are alert and running around. Another major problem I have with the movie is the noises made by the zombies. The zombies have all have a generic computer generated (artificial) way of moaning and hissing. A genuine, expressive, human cry of pain is much more terrifying than a zombie who runs his voice through an amplifier hooked up to a distortion box and an echo pedal. A zombie could easily front a NuMetal band should the whole running around killing thing get boring.<br/><br/>The characters are rather thin, and not just the ones we see and hear a line of dialogue from every 25 minutes. I never really believed that Andre (or anyone, ever) would do what he did. Take the standard clich√© ""I know she is going to turn into a zombie, but I love her, so I will hide it from everyone"" and add ""wouldn't it be cool if this happened?"". I don't see why he would accept the baby that burst out of his dead/zombie wife and then shoot another person to protect it. By the way, the baby's awful scream was cringe worthy. Another major problem is the event that brings about the climax. Nicole takes a truck and places herself in a situation involving certain death, and she does this all for a dog she just met. I could accept this as an example of someone losing their mind under the stress, but why does the group, who up to this point was reluctant to save anyone, rush out and put themselves at risk. This event leads to a situation where they must flee their sanctuary, they do save the girl but lose some of their team, and the zombies are allowed to enter the mall. They must evacuate the mall without time to prepare a proper escape. Never mind the ridiculous propane bombs, why didn't they use fire and bombs to clear the crowd of zombies out earlier? They could have been lobbing molotov cocktails down into the packed crowd and the fire would have easily spread among the infected. This would have cleared the way to the ammo shop, providing them with a ton of ammunition and cleared a path for the gun shop guy, Andy.<br/><br/>Well, this is going pretty long. Let me just to list a few more annoyances; the girl shooting a shotgun from the hip, stick through a zombies skull, inappropriate music accompanying awful montages, not so clever used of a Disturbed song (2 counts), and the end credits interspersed with short clips of what is happening to the characters at the end of the movie..<br/><br/>My final conclusion is that the film is interesting enough, not only to compare it to the original, but as a zombie movie. Even though it is hard to like a movie that goes so far to take a crap on one's suspension of disbelief, it is worth watching. Fortunately for it, the total is greater than the sum of its hack parts."

","The movie was great,definitely one of the better films in the genre recently.Unfortantly I don't think it should have been called dawn of the dead.First of all the ""zombies""had more in common with the infected from 28 days later,in both transmission And mobility,than any resurrected dead traditional or otherwise.I don't see how they can run full speed considering they are reanimated flesh,and dead tissue goes through rigor mortise.As for similarities to the original, it has a mall and a few lines of dialog lifted from the original.but with those gripes out of the way,I must say the movie was great.The story was tight ,if not to deep.The inclusion of a zombie baby birth was something i've wanted to see in a movie ever since reading Brian Keene's novel The Rising.I also thought the character dynamics as they were stripped down to their essence in the struggle for survival to be very interesting.All in all though,I personally think this movie is best viewed by forgetting its a remake of Romero's film,and take it in as it's own creature.Under those circumstances the film is in my opinion a very welcome addition to the undead canon."

While I could never slam Romero's groundbreaking original, this update was well worth the remake, unlike the '90s version of NOtLD. The pacing and intensity of this new version certainly matches the frantic energy of today's lifestyle, and truly seems to update the story, bringing it into the modern world. I was even pleased with a number of the characters. CJ had a great character arc, and many of the others were reasonably well-rounded (especially coming from the Hollywood horror factory, if you know what I mean). Andy was an interesting touch.

","In this remake of the classic 70's zombie movie, a mysterious virus has turned the population of Minneapolis into flesh-eating zombies, forcing a group of survivors to hole up at the local abandoned mall, where they are surrounded by thousands of the blood-crazed savages. Can they survive, let alone escape, with the odd so set against them? <br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is a fast paced, horror film that will actually scare you. It's gory, scary and a lot of fun to watch. The original film is overrated in my eyes. It was corny and dull though that's probably because it is outdated. So, the remake surpasses the original film in pretty much everything. The original had a good chance to tell a really scary story and it kind of blew it. The remake does a better job at telling the story and it adds more characters. There's more suspense and a lot more action. The zombies also run in this version. I know some people will complain that it goes against the whole point but it was a lot scarier. Watching thousands of zombies run after humans just sounds scarier and it looks scarier as well.<br/><br/>The acting was also pretty good and convincing with the best being Ving Rhames. He can change his emotions easily and gave a really good performance. Sarah Polley also gives a good performance without going over the top. Mekhi Phifer gives an okay performance, nothing special. The rest of the cast are made up of unknowns but they all do a good job. Most of the characters are interesting to watch and you want to root for most of them to survive. It's been a while since I have actually cared about the characters in a horror film.<br/><br/>The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously. It can be serious and scary when it wants to be. It can have a funny side as well and that keeps the film from becoming boring. There's hardly a dull moment as everything is pretty interesting. This is Zack Snyder's first movie he has directed and he should get more opportunities to direct in the future. He keeps the film tense and scary the whole time. He really does have a good eye for suspense and horror. Would you believe the guy who wrote the screenplay for the Scooby Doo movies also wrote the screenplay for this remake? He does a pretty good job and I can't wait for his next movie. This is by far the best horror film of 2004 and it's a must see for horror fans. In the end, this very bloody and entertaining remake is worth checking out. Rating 9/10"
"ghoulieguru","8","0","0","19 November 2004"," The Coming Dawn
","I went into this thinking it was gonna suck. I love the original Dawn of the Dead, and I thought that having James Gunn (of Scooby Doo fame) writing it was going to ensure its place in the bad remakes of history... Right next to the Psycho remake. I mean, when you have a great piece of material, why remake it? Only remake movies that stunk in the first place. Don't remake the classics. That was my attitude. But this movie surprised me. The filmmakers successfully took George Romero's dystopic view of modern society and reinvented it for a new generation. My main question is, did this really need to be a remake? I mean, clearly it shared some things conceptually with Romero's (like the mall, and some of the moments) but this also felt like a pretty complete reboot. I wonder if they could have created this movie as a stand alone zombie flick? Perhaps there is value in the title ""Dawn of the Dead"". Who knows what drives those studio execs? In the end, this was a successful, fun zombie movie. The characters were a little flat and some of the action was predictable, but the overall effect was good enough for me to give this movie 7 out of 10 stars. Teamed with ""28 Days Later"", I think these two films have brought about a nice zombie rebirth. Unfortunately, that also gives you the B versions like ""Corpses are Forever"" and ""Bloody Bill"", but I still think a resurgence of the zombie genre is a good thing."

","If you are looking for an intellectual development of the meaning of life, or for a script full of spirituality that shows the depth of human behavior 'Dawn of the Dead' would be a wrong choice. But if you are the type of moviegoer that appreciates the different genres of movie-making and enjoys a good scare once in a while this movie won't disappoint.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a group of people trying to stay alive and doing their best to avoid great danger. What is the great danger? Well, a very large group of former human beings turned zombies by a deadly virus are after them with the main purpose of eating their flesh. Not a very romantic notion and maybe not a very attractive one if you are thinking about serious cinema, but this is a very well made horror flick that manage to be tense, darkly funny, scary, and well paced. <br/><br/>The direction is agile allowing the movie to move with a very nice rhythm keeping the viewer involved for its entire running length. The level of gore is high (I watched the Director's cut) but is a type of blood fest that feels satiric, not sadistic. <br/><br/>The acting is good. Sara Polly as a nurse who lost her husband because of the virus and Ving Rhames as a tough but goodhearted police officer are worthy to highlight. The rest of the actors involved also give adequate and credible performances. <br/><br/>This movie is a remake of the 1970's horror cult classic of the same name directed by George Romero, and in my opinion is much better film than the original. <br/><br/>This remake maintains the B-Movie feel and the creepiness of Romero's film but does it with more technical skills and a more imaginative visual style. The acting is superior to say the less, and the action and suspenseful scenes are better crafted and richer in intensity.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this modern 'Dawn of the Dead' is a solid effort in the horror department, and a rare example of a remake outdoing its original source."

","""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth!""<br/><br/>Before watching Zack Snyder's new zombie-film ""Dawn Of The Dead"", I was a little bothered by the fact that I haven't seen any of the films in George Romero classic zombie-trilogy (Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, Day Of The Dead), and as most people know, this film is a remake of one of Romero's films. I'm the kind of person that doesn't like that people is making remakes, and especially not remakes of classic films. I haven't seen ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2004"" yet, but the original from 1974 is one of my favorite horror-movies. But since I haven't seen the original ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (1978), I wasn't THAT skeptical when I decided to watch this film, and after all...I didn't really expect more from this film than great entertainment.<br/><br/>This film takes place in a town where people, one day, wakes up to a invasion by flesh-hungry zombies. We follow a group of people who seeks cover in a mall. The zombies doesn't manage to get into the mall, but the people know that they can't stay there forever and they starts planning what they should do to survive.<br/><br/>Even though I haven't seen too many of them, zombie-films aren't exactly my favorites. Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"" (1992) is the only one I've seen that I really like, but the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is on my ""to-be-watched"" list. Still, it's a fact that ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a very entertaining film with some interesting elements. It doesn't have the deepest story I've ever heard about, but it has just enough of the ingredients that should satisfy someone who would like to watch a zombie-film: lots of gore, thrilling scenes, a little humor and action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has done a approved job with this movie, and he has made a very modern-style zombie-film. When it comes to the camera-work and the zombies, he seems to be heavily inspired by British director Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" (2002). This is not the ""good old"" zombies that were slow and stupid, and that you could almost have a cup of tea in front of, before they got close enough to grab you. These zombies are just as fast as human beings, and if you don't pay attention, you may have one in your throat before you know it. This makes the zombies more scary, off course.<br/><br/>Among the actors in the cast, there wasn't anyone who impressed me. Ving Rhames is the only one I really know, and he delivered one of the best performances. But I wasn't expecting the actors to be catching the most of my attention, and they're doing a good enough job based on a script with restricted character-portrayal and development.<br/><br/>""Dawn Of The Dead"" is popcorn-entertainment. Not much depth or intelligence, just Action from beginning to end. Zack Snyder has made a debut-movie, which is refreshing compared to all the mediocre Hollywood horror-films we have been drowned in for several years now. It has charm and gives the viewers exactly what they want. Yeah, we might see some good films from Snyder in the future. <br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

","This is the second coming in the new trend of remaking great genre movies of the past: the first is THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE by Nispel. The changements here were more extreme than what happened in the remake of the movie by Tobe Hooper, since no- one of the original character appears and even the zombies are different: as the infected in 28 DAYS LATER, this new version of living dead are hypercinetics. The same happens with the atmosphere: in the '78 version by Romero, the survivors see the mall as a refuge where they could hide for a long time (basically, a somekind of home), in this remake they look at it as a temporary solution and not a very safe one. So the entire movie is dominated by the idea of escaping. As many remakes, it's obvious that it can't be compared to the original, especially if this one is a masterpiece as DAWN OF THE DEAD by Romero, one of the greatest horror movies of all time. But I've to say that this one works quiet well and has some good ideas, like the zombies that decompose as time passes. There is splatter, but is what I call ""wet but clean"", since what you see is basically a lot of coloured blood and even if some heads do explode, you don't see all the gray matter and the guts you were seeing in the original: I think this was a compulsory sacrifice to get the movie made. But they didn't sacrifice the elements of the zombi myth (as RESIDENT EVIL does instead): the ghouls eat the living, and you can see it quiet clearly. I like Snyder style but I can't say the same for the cinematography, with those colours out of a videoclip or a Nike- spot: their marriage with the dirty zombies just doesn't work. At the end, this DAWN OF THE DEAD 2004 is a good zombi- movie that don't even try to surpass the original (which is THE zombi - movie)."
"worthythorn24","8","0","0","16 November 2004"," One of the best action/horror films in recent memory
","When I first learned that they were doing a remake of George A. Romero's classic film ""Dawn of the Dead"", I admit I was more than a little skeptical. To many horror aficionados (myself included), DOTD is the holy grail of horror films. I can't help but think of some of the other remakes (or re-imaginings, rather) that fell flat on their face in my opinion, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Shining (TV). For fear that they would turn the greatest zombie movie of all time into a cross between Dawson's Creek and Valentine, I shied away from watching it until it came out to video. To be honest, the film blew me away.<br/><br/>It begins with a nurse named Ana returning home from work late one evening and she goes to sleep with her husband, which illustrates the stereotypical marriage and suburban lifestyle we have all come to enjoy. The next morning, however their perfect little world gets turned upside down when a little girl who just so happens to be missing half her upper lip viciously attacks her husband. As we all know from zombie flicks of the past, once bitten you become one of the undead as well. The husband soon turns into a zombie and attacks his wife. She flees and finds the entire city in chaos. Shortly thereafter she encounters Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who seems to be the only authority figure left alive. Together they end up in a mall to fend for themselves while awaiting on impending help. There they encounter several other individuals who are just as shocked by what's going on as they are. Little do they know that there is no help on the way.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is pretty rudimentary; living vs. non-living and survival of the fittest. The characters manage to bond inside the mall and entertain themselves with all the goodies that the mall has to offer. In this film there is no underlying social commentary as in its predecessor, but it still has its moments. Of course, a film like this doesn't have much character development and each player is basically a clich√©' in themselves, but who watched flicks like this for that anyhow? <br/><br/>One big question on everybody's mind: Is the film scary? In my opinion, yes. There are some very tense moments and the movie is filled with blood and gore. Not quite as harrowing a watch as the original, but with the MPAA there are certain things you just can't do anymore and expect a theatrical release. I won't give away the ending, but it was just a little lame I thought. But that's just me :)<br/><br/>I'll give this movie an 8/10. Excellent horror/action movie. A definite watch if you're a fan of this genre, but not a good decision if you're looking for a movie to romance anybody with :P."
"mrmark2743","Null","0","0","15 November 2004"," Things that have always bothered me
","First, let me state that while not as scary as the original, this film still gave me few chills. The unrated directors cut extras were almost better than the movie itself. However....some things still bother me.<br/><br/>Faster zombies. Somehow this makes them less menacing. There was something about the lack of speed that made them more chilling. Just when you thought someone was safe, the zombie would make that sudden lunge with just the right amount of speed and BANG, you're dinner. Pure terror.<br/><br/>More selective zombies. Sorry, I can't buy hanging a dog from a rope and the zombies NOT playing meat pinata with it when it came within reach. Dead zombies eat anything that is living or at least, recently alive.<br/><br/>The virus itself. I didn't have a problem with this until towards the end of the film when a comment is made about some recently departed characters. It is mentioned that ""they weren't bitten so when they died they won't come back"" was what was basically said. If you have to be bitten for this to spread, how did it spread so quickly and so far reaching? In the originals (and the 1st remake) ANYONE that dies recently came back to life, not just those that were bitten. That's part of the overwhelming hopelessness of the situation. No matter how many you kill there are ALWAYS more coming from somewhere, anywhere, everywhere.<br/><br/>The people. I will give credit to this film. These characters were a bit more fleshed out (so to speak) than in the original. Michael was a much more sympathetic figure this time, for example. I still don't understand how people still haven't gotten the thought through their heads that if zombies bite you, wear something they can't bite through. I'm thinking, hey, isn't there one biker type around who wears thick leather who could say ..Gee, this works, let's try it. I enjoyed the idea that after the first rush of mistrust, the people did try to work together. The interplay between the mall characters and the gunshop owner in the distance was solid and moving, especially at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, I would give this film a solid 8 out of 10 but that score is only because I have grown up with the originals. If I had to rate it by itself, I would give it a 9 out 10. The extras on the DVD would have to get a 10 for filling in the blanks on a lot of missing information. Special effects are not as gory as the original but they are more realistic this time around. Music was good, especially in the extras section which reminded me very much of Resident Evil every time they updated the plague map. Guess what I am saying is...even though I have seen the film I will be going out to buy a copy to see what I may have missed."
"lathesius","Null","0","0","14 November 2004"," Dawn Of The Dead 2004 is another shining example that remakes, if done right, can be pretty spectacular.
","From the start this didn't sound like it was going to work. Not only were they going to remake what most people and myself would call the best zombie movie around, it was going to be written by a guy who wrote Scooby Doo (a film a lot of people thought was poor at best)and it was going to be directed by a guy who's only experience was directing ads for television. But despite those odds, Dawn Of The Dead 2004 is another shining example that remakes, if done right, can be pretty spectacular.<br/><br/>The reason this works is that, despite the odds from the beginning, everyone involved in the making of this film are zombie fans from the heart. You get the distinct impression that they no way wanted to rip off George Romero's original and that they wanted to focus on their own story, and that is what you get.<br/><br/>The film, as you probably had guessed, is all about a zombie apocalypse that, without any explanation to its cause, erupts overnight and sends the world into total chaos. At the beginning we follow a nurse called Ana who wakes up to total hell. After avoiding being eaten she meets up with more survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall. Problems occur early in as the security team that works in the mall are not happy with their presence. But, as the film progresses they eventually learn to work together to solve problems they face as more survivors join the ragtag group.<br/><br/>This isn't a remake in the sense of that word. This films stands alone from Romero's original and gives it its own set of boots to fill. Apart from the title and the setting, pretty much everything here is new. Whereas Romero's film took a stab at the consumerism and showing us that, while we shop WE are mere zombies, walking around with no purpose, DOTD 2004 is more about the action. This time zombies can run and this gives a greater sense of urgency and is more adrenaline induced. A lot of fans over the world didn't like the idea that zombies could run, and that the ones in Romero's original were a lot scarier in the creepiness factor. I tend to agree. Because they can run you sort of loose the sense that they are dead, and it gives you more of the impression that they could be just infected like they are in the British film 28 Days Later, but this doesn't spoil the film and at times, helps it to move along at a frantic pace.<br/><br/>Fans of gore won't be disappointed either, with blood flowing like a river all the way through the film. However it is not as ""in your face"" as the original, there are still plenty of parts in the film that make you cringe and go ""urgh!"" But in a good way.<br/><br/>Overall Dawn Of The Dead 2004 is a great film for fans and newcomers alike. It delivers a pace that keeps you on the edge of your seat, great acting and directing and was well written. This is another fine example that remakes can be brilliant and that, just as long as the writer, director and producers are fans of the genre then the film can work."

","THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. I'm not going to rag on or declaim this film, because I think it's a good enough film for what it tries to be--a gory action film based on Romero's classic. <br/><br/>Beyond the splattering brains, however, there's very little true substance here. At least in Romero's original there was a subtext of social commentary, and a number of important themes (for example, individualism, the way human beings react in times of crisis, the inability of civil and political authorities to cope with disaster). However, the remake does deliver some very solid action and acting, some nice surprises, and a very cool scene involving a fortified shuttle bus. <br/><br/>I didn't like how Snyder ripped off the fast zombies from 28 Days Later (if you think about it, a reanimated corpse probably wouldn't be able to run that fast, so Romero's vision is actually more realistic).<br/><br/>Snyder has offered us, on the whole, a thoroughly postmodern take on Romero's classic--style over substance. While that is sometimes great for a genre that is in danger of becoming totally irrelevant due to overexposure (think of what Tarantino did for American crime films), I think there's still plenty that can be done within the zombie subgenre. Overall, I give this movie a C+/B-."

","Yes, I was at first pretty skeptical of this remake to Romero's memorable class-sick. WHY??? It's not like it was an older B&W B film, although I always preferred the original NOTLD in B&W for the grim mood it conveyed.<br/><br/>Anyways, a friend convinced me to watch this 'remake' on DVD. I'm now very glad he talked me into it. The opening was smashing, and had me immediately engaged - not a single wasted second, thanks to good camera-work and tight editing. The sense of tension really grows as it appears that most of the world is now under siege from the killer-zombies. There is a strong, building momentum to the pacing and escalating menace which the characters now find themselves cast adrift in.<br/><br/>The zombies move at a very fast pace in this version, giving it a riveting action edge. Comparing both the original and this remake is an 'apples & oranges' thing to me. Both stand on their separate merits, and actually compliment each other. Like showing two different perspectives of the zombie invasion from two different towns, and the similar gut reactions of both groups of desperate characters. Yay, I know, how does that explain why they are swift in one area and near-crippled in another??!! I'll consider any sound suggestions.<br/><br/>For a taut entertaining horror/thriller this does deliver and it held my suspenseful interest til the end. The lead woman was the best character, followed by Ving Rhames who is solid and believable. I cared about the fates of everyone, and that is always a good sign, or, in this case, a bad sign. The sense of dread is prevalent throughout.<br/><br/>One problem I had was that no one ever asks what is happening, what caused this; etc. They just accept it like recurring characters on a TV series. If you were suddenly caught up in this bloody nightmare, wouldn't you wonder what has caused this, and what the authorities are doing about it? The news announcers don't ever mention anything either or even express any wonder. Things like this can erode any suspense the film is trying to create.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the zombies bear similarities to the infected 'zombie-like' killers in 28 DAYS LATER, but I found this to be a far better film. There are only a few gory moments, but they work within the film's tight structure. <br/><br/>You may want to rent it some night when you're in the mood for a good zombie thriller. Just don't expect a great masterpiece."

I was convinced by a friend, and by this movie's end, I knew that I liked it. However, it was not until the DVD release that I became re-acquainted with it once more.<br/><br/>It has now become one of my favorite B-movies of all time. I am one to appreciate classic films, and this movie is by no means a classic, but it has a vitality all it's own; likable characters, believable situations, some intense moments and a sense of kinetic, frantic high octane action scenes. Interesting character development of C.J., the security guard.<br/><br/>This one stayed with me for weeks. To fully appreciate this film it is best to view it with no expectations whatsoever. It is cheesy. It isn't an Oscar contender, but if you want a genuine roller-coaster ride that grabs you from the opening and does not relent from that point on, then perhaps you may want to check this out. <br/><br/>It is short enough not to take up too much of your time but it's worth it.

The farther you are from it, the prettier it is or the more enticing and the closer you get to it, the more mystery and mushier and unknown it looks. It's like looking at the TV screen and looking at it upclose, you can't see the whole picture but looking farther away, you can see the whole picture.<br/><br/>The gore is awesome, because you can never get enough of gore. I liked the fact they were creative, added humor into it with the elevator scenes and the characters were very different from each other because of their personalities. I just didn't like the fact that the movie didn't touch base on the characters so much that we didn't get attach to them/relate to them.<br/><br/>All I have to say is that, it was tiring living those days and nights with them at the mall for such a long time (not really knowing how long they were there for, days? weeks? months?!) and then come to find out where they actually ended up. You're not really sure if it's an open ended store, or there were three conclusions at the end or what, but I wans't happy with it. The ending was short, BRIEF, fast, like a quick suicide or something but then after the movie, there were credits, and then you see an epilogue and THAT I did not like. Why bother wasting your money on building on a set at the mall and all your time and effort and come to find out you're going to end up with such a lousy conclusion of a story? There were so many other ways to deliver the movie. <br/><br/>I didn't like the ending at all because it was inevitable. Unsatisfactory. The title itself is poetic, yet I felt the movie was far from poetic. Although, I was very inspired by the bits in pieces of how they created the movie from the architectural design of the mall, the creativity on the make up to make the zombies look more human and real, and the characters were interesting.

","Passable zombie fare. Abandoning the overt political statement of the original doesn't really hurt the film much--to be honest, Romero's 'Dawn' was somewhat overdone in its anti-consumerist message, a 'Night of the Living Dead' writ too large. Zack Snyder's new version touches on politics only in passing, and concentrates instead on its action. It's not a perfect film by any standard--it's at least half an hour too long, and many of the characters are poorly defined (star players Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames are pretty much wasted in their ostensible lead roles). Worst of all is the tired familiarity of the material--its one real innovation is having the living dead move quickly, and even that was done before in the messy '28 Days Later . . . .' But it's basically likable, with well-managed scare setpieces, and occasional witty touches (of which Johnny Cash's end-of-the-world anthem 'The Man Comes Around' is a particularly nice one). In the end, 'Dawn of the Dead' is a basically entertaining, if not terribly memorable, horror film. 6.5 out of 10."

""28 Days Later"" meets ""Resident Evil"" meets ""The Breakfast Club"". The only redeeming thing about this movie was the cameos from Tom Savini,Ken Foree, and Scott Reiniger from the original Dawn. There was hardly any gore and I was also disappointed with the ""turbo charged"" zombies because the slower zombies in the original gave you the impression that the un-dead were wandering the earth with a bit of mysticism meaning they didn't know why they were there. The only difference between the original and the updated version was that the acting was better. I also didn't like the ending which in my opinion was totally unnecessary and for that matter just plain stupid."

","Zombie horror has been around for much longer than most moviegoers might imagine, beginning with the 1920's fiction of August Derleth and William Seabrook, whose ripping tales of voodoo gone awry populated the pulp magazines of their day. The pulp has long disappeared, but not the concept, which survived to a healthy film career, starting in the 1960's. Cultural psychologists might draw parallels between the proliferation of this theme and world events, social upheaval, and real human atrocity, but most horror film buffs would agree that there is a perennial attraction in the genre to the ""scorched-earth"" scenario of a world gone mad in which all things are turned upside down, inverted, and--ultimately--perverted. The structure of human society, interpersonal relations, and core values get a massive flaying when your neighbor, your husband, your children turn on you with the intent of consuming your living flesh. The best horror films play directly to the eternally taboo subjects, those which we keep under the tightest wraps, giving us the chance to explore them vicariously, without the risk of actual threat. There is a catharsis in throwing everything away for a time, in entering a world where the rules have been re-written, and all the things you worry about in your day-to-day life are gone, replaced by the immediacy of a feral and all-too-human need to survive.<br/><br/>""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a fairly respectful re-telling of the plot from its eponymous 1978 predecessor, in which a group of survivors, stranded in a shopping mall, attempt to survive the onslaught of the carnivorous hordes outside as well as the menace within, represented by the tendency of those living wounded to convert upon death. The special effects have been updated, similar to Tom Savini's 1990's treatment of Dawn's predecessor, ""Night Of The Living Dead"", and the requisite gore is laid on equally thickly. I thought about counting how many zombie heads are splattered or perhaps calculating how many gallons of imitation blood were used in production, but such an effort would prove futile. Suffice it to say, the splatter lives up to the ""Dead"" legacy.<br/><br/>Mood is all-important in this genre, and director Zack Snyder makes some interesting and effective choices. The riskiest is in the title sequence, over which we've come to expect either the bombast of metal, the soulless trance of techno, or dark, Trent-Reznorish psycho-with-a-multi-tracker throb. Snyder, however, chooses to use, of all things, Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" and the effect is both unsettling and ultimately satisfying. Cash's portentous, apocalyptic lyric over the flash-cut images of both the film's zombies along with random, bizarre news footage creates a mix which informs us that whatever we were expecting isn't necessarily what we're going to get. Aside from the standard incidental-music cues (Ana's digital bedroom clock flicks it's numbers with the requisite and impossible bass chunng) most of the other music choices bear this promise out.<br/><br/>""Dawn's"" main protagonists are: Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse whose young daughter makes a surprise morning visit, setting the story rolling; Kenneth (Ving Rhames), the cop who's trying to get to the next town to save his brother; and Michael (Jake Weber), the former Best Buy television salesman who seems almost amused to discover his until-now-dormant leadership ability in the course of trying to save the few living souls he's been thrown in with. For a zombie movie, there is surprisingly good acting throughout. Rhames, Polley, and especially Weber (who so efficiently played the womanizing co-worker on the HBO series ""The Mind Of The Married Man"") convey much more complexity than any of the actors in the original, and the believability factor created by their performances greatly enhances the creeping dread. It's as if someone finally noticed that if you actually care about flesh and blood characters, you might not giggle so comfortably when they get eviscerated.<br/><br/>Our little group takes refuge in a virtually empty shopping mall, where they encounter only a few members of the cleaning crew (Weber's shirt gets fairly bloody in this little exchange) and mall security, who immediately attempt to establish alpha-male dominance. The leader of this group of guards is played admirably by Kevin Zegers, who manages to embody petty authority in every gesture. His transformation as the film progresses is one of the most interesting and satisfying aspects of the overall ensemble piece, and he is--quite deservedly--given the best ending line of the film. A subplot involving a husband (Mekhi Phifer) with his oh-so-pregnant wife feels oddly flat, until its ultimate conclusion provides one of the ickier moments of the many gross-outs this movie has to offer. Yes, there are some plot holes, but they don't necessarily spoil the fun.<br/><br/>Snyder keeps the pace up, and his use of continued story through the closing credits is admirable, concluding his tale using the jumpy, hand-held reality-TV camera-work to which we've all now become accustomed.<br/><br/>It is a grim world ""Dawn Of The Dead"" paints for us, and like the best horror films, we leave unnerved, re-entering our daily lives perhaps a little the better for having walked our demons around the block and tucked them neatly back in their beds, knowing that--in the tagline for another early-70's low-budget horror flick, ""The Last House On The Left""--it's only a movie, it's only a movie."

This one has a special spot, as it is not an improvement really, but it isn't worse than the original either. The debate over slow v fast dead, about how this isn't really much of a remake...all of that is valid, but it doesn't wind up contributing to how good the movie is. Dead movies are not about how good they are in the traditional sense. It's more about thinking through the scenario, considering what you would do in these situations. There are a few weaknesses which make me dislike the movie. Some sequences move a little slow, which is partly because of the 90s style horror script. Characters are too witty, and in an effort to be 'realistic,' the negative traits are made to be overwhelmingly obvious. Please - despite what you've heard, horror fans would like complex characters, especially if their deaths in a film are going to mean anything. And the ending during the credits left a bad taste in my mouth. By leaving a definitive ending, it destroys the creative audience opportunity to speculate. Some of the MTV-style direction is annoying. Some of it works effectively, notably during the opening credits. It's a good watch, especially if you are a fan of the genre.

Well, several things. While the premise may be a clich√© in itself, the script steers well clear of them. The walking dead aside, the whole thing's pulled off with a decent degree of realism. The story proceeds in a believable way, without resorting to ¬°¬∞shock-horror¬°¬±twists or climactic plot devices. You can tell in advance what's going to happen with the pregnant girl, for example, or the old woman with the bite on her arm, but the enjoyment comes from watching events unfold, rather than having them suddenly sprung on you. It¬°¬Øs a different way to tell this kind of story, and it works.<br/><br/>The screenplay also dispenses with the baggage that usually accompanies a horror movie. For example, it doesn't bother to explain where the zombie virus came from, because... who cares? Most of us are familiar with the concept of flesh-eating zombies, and can accept the idea without wasting any screen time giving us clever reasons for them to exist. The same brevity of information is employed with the characters ¬®C we don't know any more about them than they know about each other, because we don¬°¬Øt need to. This is not the kind of film where in-depth character development is necessary. There are a couple of budding romances but no deep romantic dramas, and although there's a lot of bonding, there's no overnight journeys of self-discovery ¬®C the arrogant yuppie is still an arrogant yuppie at the end, just as the hardboiled cop is still a hardboiled cop. Nor is there a ¬°¬∞core¬°¬± group of characters as such. Anna the nurse (Sarah Polley) is the closest thing the story has to a central protagonist, but it's really a true ensemble piece with characters coming and going as new refugees arrive at the mall, or fall ¬®C one way or another ¬®C to the undead.<br/><br/>If I have a gripe, it's that the characters do seem to get over their trauma pretty quickly. They know that the city's overrun with zombies and their families are dead, but ¬®C aside from a brief bit of crying here and there ¬®C nobody seems terribly fraught with grief and they all have a surprisingly pragmatic approach to the whole situation.<br/><br/>One point I must make ¬®C this movie deserves an award for the credits alone. The opening sequence tells the ¬°¬∞big story¬°¬± through newsreels and footage which show the gradual disintegration of society as the zombie plague sweeps the country. But it's the closing credits ¬®C where the final chapter of the tale unfolds via a series of brief, flickering images on a camcorder ¬®C that had me almost applauding at the end. Pure genius."

","I saw it in the theatre when it first came out and really enjoyed it but noticed a few pretty glaring plot holes. Anyway when the DVD came out I watched it again to see if the missing scenes from the theatre release made any sense of the gaps, unfortunately it mostly didn't. For a start I'm still confused over who the kid at the start was, is she Sarah Polley's kid (she says something to the girl about ""your mum"")? if not how did she get in the house? At least they cleared up how the survivors got in the mall think that was some pretty bad editing in the theatre release, one minute they're in the parking lot next scene they're in. Personally, I can't see why Snyder left out the scene with the one-armed zombie. Next thing, when they get attcked by the zombies in the underground parking we don't see how they escaped yeah they set some on fire but how did they handle the rest without any ammunition? As for the stupidity of the characters well, it knows no bounds really doesn't it. Firstly, if I was going out into the middle of a zombie horde who basically as good as kill you with one bite I think I'd put on a little protective clothing, motorcycle leathers, maybe heavy duty Carhart type jacket, protective hockey gear instead they go out in short sleeves.<br/><br/>Enough complaints the first 10 minutes or so are as good as everyone says and quite disturbing because that looks exactly like the neighbourhood I used to, and my family does still live in."

","I peeped this movie out at the neighborhood GALAXY THEATER and though that cinema is underemployed and sickeningly messy, I'm still able to say I got the most out of DOTD2004. It's not a particularly brainy idea, but what it lacks in depth, it makes up for in entertainment value.<br/><br/>A horror movie is meant to entertain. <br/><br/>Every guy I know who religiously watches horror films is not an impressive individual. The audience intended for this movie does not crave depth. If you want depth, Dawn of the Dead is not for you. Spend your 8 bucks on Garden State or something.<br/><br/>This movie did exactly what I expected it to do. It gave me a quick wow. Well, it gave me a 2 hour wow. It immediately delves straight into action and continues relentlessly with the occasional humorous intermission complete with ironic, mismatched music choices and gratuitous sex.<br/><br/>My entire band joined me when we went to this movie and 2 of the 4 of us liked the original better. I am still baffled at their reasoning behind this. There was much talk about themes and moods, complexity and commentary, layers and depth, feelings and expression... It was a zombie movie.<br/><br/>I don't know about the common movie-viewer, but I whole-heartedly loathe the following:<br/><br/><ul><li>bikers - bikers starting whipped cream pie fights with zombies - horrible, greenish makeup - cheesy gore</li></ul><br/><br/>Coincidentally, all these elements were included in the original. I almost turned off the VCR when I saw that pie fight scene. One can't help wondering where Marc Summers was to start Nickelodeon's Family Double Dare. They should've wheeled out that green slime and dumped it on the zombies too. Then give them all prizes for participating.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that DOTD2004 took what royally sucked, and made it suck a lot less. Both movies are mindless (yes, even with the amateur symbolism Romero portrayed in the first), but I was definitely more impressed with the remake.<br/><br/>--OMGOMGOMGOMG SPOIleR ALeRT!! LOLZ--<br/><br/>If anyone has seen DEADALIVE, they would know of that God-awful infant zombie featured in that movie. I am so very thankful that the new Dawn didn't go too in-depth with that stupid pregnant lady and her worthless baby.<br/><br/>My main criticism on the new Dawn of the Dead is that that baby should have burst out of that girl in a flurry of blood and guts. Oh, and they should have shown its head splatter all over the place when they blew its brains out. I really hate babies."

","Dawn of the Dead (2004) was pretty good. I was very surprised when I saw this movie on V.C.D. a few months back. I have to say that I was very impressed. The script by James Gunn and the direction was on par with the original. Ving Rhames was the man. He played his role quite well and was creditable as the tough cop. The set pieces were up to snuff and the gore effects were excellent.<br/><br/>A strange mutation has quickly spread across the land. It hit so fast and so hard that nobody was prepared for what was to come. Society collapsed along with the military and the government's ability to try and contain the situation. Thousands of the living dead roam the streets and what's left of the survivors are either squabbling, bickering or killing each other off. A local mall as become a magnet not only for survivors but for the hungry and ever growing horde of the living dead. A nurse, cop, a family man and a young couple seek refuge in the mall that's under the control of three security guards who are still ""on duty"". Can any of them make it through the ""dawn"" so they can survive another ""day""?<br/><br/>Like I said before hand. A very good remake of the original. Instead of trying to do a scene for scene remake or an ""inspired"" by version, the film makers wisely incorporated both elements to create this release. I haven't seen the new director's cut yet but from what I have already watched I have to say that I'm very impressed. Impressed indeed!<br/><br/>Highly recommended!<br/><br/>A<br/><br/>Keep an eye out for three stars from the original film. A nice treat fro fans of the original film."

","Although I don't usually approve this is quite simply one of Hollywood's best efforts at reinventing a classic. The opening sequence alone is amazing, it is a perfect view of what the apocalypse would look and feel like from a single person's point of view, and it sets the tone for the rest of the film beautifully. And with obvious additions of FX(which weren't available, I know), more characters, a wider scope, and more comedy (great cameos) as well, as much as I know it cant replace the original it comes calling.

"dee.reid","10","0","0","30 October 2004"," ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004)
","Zack Snyder's 2004 revision of the 1978 action epic of zombie mayhem, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" is less a remake of George A. Romero's classic of the same title than it is its own individual vision of zombies and the survivors who band together to keep them out of the huge shopping mall they've barricaded themselves in.<br/><br/>The new ""Dawn"" is not a better film than the original, but is better made and is more streamlined and fluid. The zombies in the revision run, instead of merely lurching up and down escalators or are otherwise slow to capture victims. These zombies are quite vicious and relentless in their pursuit of potential victims.<br/><br/>I'm hesitant to call ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) a remake because in my opinion, what allows the new ""Dawn"" to surpass the 1978 version is that the new version doesn't try to outdo the original; it instead builds on that film's reputation. The original's idea of humans barricading themselves in a mall to avoid the hordes of flesh-hungry zombies that run rampant outside is only a template for the new version's more nefarious agenda of scaring the daylights out of the audience.<br/><br/>The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" treads in places where Romero's film didn't ¬ñ it delivers genuine shocks ¬ñ not satire and is heavy on gore (which is extended in the director's cut) and characters you come to know and care about. Yet, you can't completely dismiss Romero's original. And whereas the mall in the original was a haven for the four main characters to keep the hording masses of zombies outside at bay, the mall in ""Dawn"" (2004) is merely a rest stop; the survivors here in 2004 aim to escape from the living dead as soon as possible.<br/><br/>As a fan of George A. Romero's highly praised and daring ""Living Dead"" trilogy, it only seemed natural that a remake of the most popular film was reasonable. Already ""Night of the Living Dead"" was remade in 1990 and was directed by Romero's right-hand special effects man Tom Savini. As far as I can see, a remake of 1985's ""Day of the Dead"" is not that far off, as well as a FOURTH ""Living Dead"" film.<br/><br/>And several 1978 ""Dawn"" alumni make cameo appearances: Ken Foree (""Peter"" in the original) plays a priest who delivers ""Dawn's"" most famous punch line (""When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth""), Scott H. Reiniger (""Roger"" in the original) as a military general, and special effects wizard Tom Savini (""Blades"" in the original) as a sheriff leading an operation to eradicate the zombies.<br/><br/>""When there is no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth"" has a greater relevance in the new ""Dawn"" because here, the zombies walking around and consuming the flesh of the living is seen to be a worldwide epidemic ¬ñ the Apocalypse. In the original, the zombies were simply seen as more of a nuisance, not the end of the world.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Ten Point Review:<br/><br/>1) In a nutshell, this movie is not as good as the original but is still a surprisingly good flick. It is a respectful homage, even if you could argue that the only real similarity is that they are both set in malls.<br/><br/>2) The zombies run pretty fast. Fast enough to make the movie a little more unsettling. Think Return of the Living Dead and you'll know what kind of zombies you have here, though the ones in this movie don't call for more cops and paramedics over CB radios.<br/><br/>3) There is hardly any kind of character development. What little there is is effective to some degree. It's kind of a shame that the movie wasn't over two hours like the original was because it would've given us a bit more time to get to know these characters. I thought the character of Michael was great while some of the others were really just one note performances. Some of the acting sucked pretty bad also but hey what do you expect, Macbeth?<br/><br/>4) Tom Savini, Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger make cameo appearances in the movie. I thought that Ken Foree's in particular was pretty cool. I also dug the fact that there was a store named ""Gaylen Ross"".<br/><br/>5) I really hate when they make horror movies that have a lot of hard rock/ thrash/ whatever music in them. Gore and guitars don't mix well for me. At the same time, I thought there were some pretty inspired music choices, like Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" and Jim Carroll's ""People Who Died"". I have to say that Richard Cheese's cover of ""Down With the Sickness"" was a high point as far as the music went.<br/><br/>6) This movie pulls no punches when it comes to taking out the main characters. While I said earlier that there was no character development to speak of really, you do feel it when certain characters die.<br/><br/>7) The special effects are very impressive. While not as visceral as Savini's were (sorry, but when people got bit in the original, they got BIT, meaning they got a nice healthy chunk taken out of them), they are still pretty effective. And there are several kills, both human and zombie, that were executed very well. I would've liked the movie to be even gorier and that's after having seen the original in theaters and the uncut on video.<br/><br/>8) The opening sequence, all the way up to the beginning credits, is excellent. It may be the best part of the movie. The direction is a little flashy at times with some unnecessary fancy shots but is still tight regardless. I think the look of the movie is pretty interesting also, with this bleached out color scheme that seems to get more and more washed out as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>9) This movie isn't particularly scary. There are barely any shock scares. The horror lies mainly in imagining yourself in the predicaments that the characters face. <br/><br/>10) The story doesn't end when you might think. Make sure to sit through the credits.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of *****."

","If you're looking for an edge-of-your-seat horror flick, Dawn of the Dead (2004) is the ticket. It's a fast-paced ride the whole way through with enough gore to satisfy most audiences, although on the latter point purists of the genre may disagree. As they might disagree with running zombies instead of lumbering ones, a large group of mall rats instead of a select few, or a remake at all. <br/><br/>Like the original, you can look for a deeper meaning, if you choose. For example, running zombies are more formidable enemies that their 1970s counterparts, perhaps a reflection of how our life has 'sped up'. But unless you're a film critic, student or zombie philosopher, who really cares? <br/><br/>The plot isn't new or well-developed, but neither is it weighed down by bad acting or unnecessary special effects.

","OK, I do not know exactly what qualifies as a spoiler so I will just go ahead and warn that what I am going to say about the movie Dawn of the Dead can and possibly will be considered a spoiler, so be warned if you haven't seen the movie as there is some info here that is in the movie. I personally go to a horror flick to be scared, but I also value a good storyline as in order for me to be properly frightened I need a ""good"" logical reason, and not something stupid. I feel that Dawn of the Dead did just that, for the most part there was a good storyline and I did have to stop eating my nachos a couple of times (naw, I kept eating them). I do not care what other people's opinion of this movie was, but I can say in good faith that for a movie in this genre it was good. My reasoning for the movie being good was the storyline was SCARY and there was a personal connection with the characters, also I feel that instead of a remake this was another zombie movie all on its own. The whole part that scares our inner self about zombies is the personal part, and the director KNEW that, he made us connect with the characters before they died...even the ones at the beginning of the movie...you know how hard it would be to see the child zombie at the beginning of the movie...I made my husband lock the bedroom door when we went to bed for months after seeing that scene! (Still do) That is how scary this film is. Also, this zombie movie hit home, and movies that show something that could possibly happen are the scariest. I was in the military, just got out, and I was in Iraq. When I saw the movie I kept thinking of the biological threat in the Middle East that is threatening the United States. I kept thinking that who knows what is being experimented with biologically, and then the speed in which the disease spread added to that innate fear...hence...reeeeaaaally scary movie. So for those who think that the zombie movie remake Dawn of the Dead doesn't touch on things going on in today's world...oh well!!! This is a great movie, scary, I was disappointed by the unfinished ending, but overall I give it an 8.....oh, and the RUNNING zombies that was the scariest of all!!!!"

","It is not everyday that you would consider Romero's original a cinematic masterpiece, but compared to this abortion it's Citizen Kaine. If the creators of this movie had spent less time whacking off over each other and concentrated on what makes a good zombie movie then this could have been a better film than the original. Sadly it's not. The original had humour and an edginess that this film lacks. If possible it is even less feasible and the characters less believable than the original. The sole reason I stayed in the cinema was because of the obvious potential of the pregnant woman. ""Hooray, a high-cost special effect zombie baby would save this film,"" I said. After wading through the abysmal dialogue and one dimensional characters for what seemed like eternity (80 minutes is as long as this type of movie should last. Tops) as the original story was ""improved upon"", finally the feted scene arrived. Whoosh, it's over. And it was rubbish. Jackson's Brain Dead is my standard for reanimated infants and he did that on a tuppence ha'penny budget. This film assumes you have never seen any other slasher or zombie movies and I would only consider it suitable for small children. Preferably ones who are already dead."

","The horror genre is, at times, a contentious mix of everything from the sublime to the ridiculous. I know that's a well-worn clich√©, but it is true perhaps more for this genre than for others. Audiences will often stay away in droves and consign otherwise good movies to cult status simply because they ARE remakes: indeed, often just because they are classified as horror. And let's face it - some remakes are woeful; some horror flix miss the point that INTENTIONAL humour and INTENTIONAL textual references add to the enjoyment. Even irony gets lost in the drive to be as gory as possible. The suspension of disbelief is made easier if there is at least a semblance of plot line and, in these days of fear re the use of biochemical and bacteriological weapons by terrorists, any film using same NEEDS humour to ensure the audience doesn't go home and commit mass suicide.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead (2004) is one of the best remakes ever. Zack Snyder has created something new - a juxtaposition, if you will, between the original screenplay, new editing techniques, and a fresh, vibrant cast.<br/><br/>Who is Sarah Polley? She gives a great performance as Ana. Ving Rhames is excellent as is Michael Kelly as CJ. Overall, an inspired casting of all the characters. We really FEEL for all of them and thus get ""sucked-in"" to engage with each. What happens to them means something.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent. Perhaps my only criticism would be the lack of unusual perspectives, i.e. unusual camera angles. This, of course, is more to do with costing than intent. One can only do so much within the strictures established by the bean-counters. However, Snyder and crew do a bloody-good job. (Pun intended.)<br/><br/>It is interesting, to say the least, that the dog becomes a central part of both the action and the pathos.<br/><br/>Sorry. There's a huge thunderstorm overhead and I don't want to fry the computer or the phone. More to follow...<br/><br/>Paul"

","Taking an older classic into the modern day, Dawn of the Dead is a more than effective remake with its own charm.<br/><br/>Quite a few years have passed since the original Dawn of the Dead. In my own humble opinion it was actually the weakest of all 3, but the majority seem to disagree with this, citing it as the best.<br/><br/>Universal agreed with this consensus and commissioned this remake, bringing a slightly new angle and characters into a similar situation as previously set. As with the original, DOTD is set in a shopping mall for the most part, and sees the protagonists trying to survive the onslaught of zombies in an apocalyptic environment.<br/><br/>Sarah Polley is Ana, a nurse whose partner is attacked by a member of the undead in the family home. When he, after being killed, regains 'life' and goes for her she escapes and encounters Kenneth, a cop along with a group of 3 other survivors.<br/><br/>Together they go to the mall and set up sanctuary along with power-crazed security guards who initially have them under their control. The rest of the movie unfolds from this point onwards as all the party endeavour to remain alive.<br/><br/>The acting isn't expected to be A-class but it is more than decent to be quite honest. With Rhames, as Kenneth, you're getting a presence on screen like few others - he *makes* you pay attention, and that's something an actor cannot buy - he either has it or not. Polley is decent enough as Ana, doing an acceptable job of being a Ripley style character without quite stealing the show. Jake Weber, as Michael, is pretty decent as well and it's commendable than even though Rhames is a heck of a powerhouse, he never really overshadows Weber.<br/><br/>Other characters are reasonably well played too, and it's a testament to the improvement in the standard of Hollywood in this type of film that even the *relatively* peripheral characters are played well.<br/><br/>The special effects are more than worth a mention as well, with some very exciting moments and some truly awe-inspiring moments aiding the film's narrative extremely well. The only weakness is the truly awful looking CGI helicopter. At least I hope it's CGI otherwise something went badly wrong with the way it was filmed.<br/><br/>The movie, naturally, is a gore fest far in excess of the appalling Resident Evil, and more akin to its true father trilogy. Using modern standards on those old gory but unconvincing effects really smarts well, and to those with weaker stomachs this film would be hard to watch.<br/><br/>The direction cannot be faulted - it pushes along the story and there's always plenty of action in each scene to keep interest.<br/><br/>The plot itself was never *that* strong, and that's not changed here. It's relatively peripheral such is the claustrophobic nature of the movie, and is more a tale of survival than an epic yarn.<br/><br/>Sure, the oldies are always 'the best' but in this remake they've done a good job of making a movie worthy of the name."

","Hm, where do I begin. I guess I'll have to start from the beginning, eh?<br/><br/>***MILD SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>I remember reading something on IMDb on a Dawn Of The Dead remake somewhere last year I think. I clicked it, but no info was available yet, only the trailer. It didn't surprise me that I was thinking that this was going to be another flash-bang Hollywood stinker. (This movie may contain some Hollywood trademarks, but it's separate from the majority of crap).<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong. There was something about that trailer, especially the shot where Ana runs towards her car and sees the undead running across the street. That particularly shot sent shivers down my spine. The sound in that shot is slightly different in the actual movie, but that doesn't rob it from it's shock value.<br/><br/>From that moment on, that movie was going to make me a Snyder fan.<br/><br/>The week before the movie was going to be released, I was on a mission to find theaters where they would actually play this movie. Because I was concerned that it would play for only a week or so. And I was right pretty much, it disappeared out of theaters in less than a month. So I had to be quickly and race down to a theatre to see it day first.<br/><br/>And I even didn't give a f**k that I had to see it without any company. I had to see this. <br/><br/>The movie pretty much punches you in the back of your head from the first minutes, and doesn't stop until the very last seconds of the ending credits (the credits are VERY important, so don't flip it off when the story ends). You know, when the story immediately kicks in (no bullshit, just the story), that you are seeing a young and motivated director's film and tries to develop his own style (the amount of top shots for example).<br/><br/>What really got me convinced that I had made the right choice seeing this movie is, were the opening credits. An incredible job in editing stock footage with actual shot footage and Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around'. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and wouldn't go down.<br/><br/>From that moment on, you're in for a ride...<br/><br/>Just enough character development to care about some of 'em and the amazing direction by Snyder. The decision to make the undead (I use the word 'undead' as the word 'zombie' isn't mentioned at ALL in the entire movie) run as fast as hell has proved to be a major plus. OK, slow zombies may be scary as s**t, but when they come after you like lightning, you're not even given the moment to p**s your pants. Because when you finally have, they are already chomping on your guts. How's that for a change, huh?<br/><br/>The amount of gore they put into this pic, is not for the faint of heart. A lot of blood here, a whole lot! But hey, it's a fast and dynamic film, why not give the audience something they are craving for in an 'undead' flick: guts 'n' gore.<br/><br/>I don't know if the 'light' moments in the film are suitable, but it gives the people some laughs before they get dragged in to the horror and action again (Andy is a great side character, whose ending is pretty graphic).<br/><br/>I can't think of much that I disliked about this movie. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was a great breath of fresh air after the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, who lost all of it's shock value.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the extras on the DVD are top notch. This is what I call extra's, more story development (Andy's last days and 'We interrupt this program') and just enough 'making of' stuff to keep you interested. You should definitely listen to the director's comment by director Zack Snyder and a producer (his name I just forgot, there were eight producers or something like that).<br/><br/>One of the best remakes to grace the silver screen. Good job!"

It has all the morbid tension and sick feel of the first film. It also manages to add a few personal touches which makes it both original and even more scary then the first one. I love it!! I would love for more directors to do what Zhan have done for this one. I see nothing wrong in a good remake, especially if it steps away from the original and creates something new and better as this one does. Then again you don't really have to compare the two. The original have many things in it that this one can never live up to since that production is of a totally different nature."

","It has been months since I originally saw this film in the theatre, and having caught sight of the director's apparently preferred cut of the film on DVD-Video (which, from memory, doesn't seem all that different to what was shown in Australian theaters), I felt some things needed to be said. For all of the praises sung for this film, it really is quite a hollow and disingenuous shell.<br/><br/>I don't know where the fast zombie trend came from, but it really does the whole concept a disservice. George Romero's zombie films, to me, represented a commentary on modern commercial society. No matter how slow, pathetic, and stupid the zombies were, they would eventually get their hands on you simply because there were so many of them. In this day and age where garbage like American Idiot supposedly gets untold millions of viewers while more intelligent television such as Quantum (no, not Quantum Leap, just Quantum) gets cancelled faster than a baby at Planned Parenthood, the zombie film commentary on society has grown more relevant with every passing day. Zombies are the lowest common denominator, and the good zombie film shows how their numbers grow as those who can think for themselves diminish.<br/><br/>One featured comment has the gall to compare this shallow piece of trash to Paul Verhoeven's work on the basis of having ""completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore"". Wrong. Paul Verhoeven's unique characteristic, at least where Hollywood was concerned, was his ability and desire to show the consequences of violence. You never saw a ""you got me"" reaction shot in a Verhoeven film. What separates his work from this bottle of parade gloss is that he also had something quite relevant to say about society in between his bouts of putting his characters through every layer of hell. Without the use of what the zombie represents, relative to modern society, this remake has absolutely nothing for the viewer to think about.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, more or less entirely composed of contemporary numbers chosen by the MPAA/RIAA machine, is one of the most insipid things you will hear outside of a political spiel. It furthers the theory that Hollywood's film and rock stars live in their own self-contained bubble from which they gain absolutely no insight into the functioning of the rest of the world. Really, the number they try to use to show how ""x-treme"" they are is about as hardcore as my seventy-two year old, Bing Crosby-worshiping neighbour.<br/><br/>It is somewhat ironic that of all the zombie films that could be remade to modern standards, this is the one they chose. The original Dead series had meaningful, relevant things to say. In spite of a generally languid pace, they created tension that the viewer could really feel. This modernisation tries to move along at a rocket pace, but in so doing loses everything that the viewer can have an emotional investment in. The characters are little more than pieces in a chess game like that played by two of them a little of the way through the film.<br/><br/>Plot improbabilities also plague the film. I don't know exactly where a sixteen year old girl is going to learn to drive a truck like that, but I'd love to find out. Exactly how one becomes a zombie isn't really even defined until the last minute, and then it smacks more of plot convenience than a planned plot element. Exactly why they had to situate our heroes in a shopping mall that doesn't have a gun store boggles the mind, too.<br/><br/>In all, this Dawn is worthy of about five points. It keeps the viewer amused for a couple of hours, but once you start to scratch away the gloss and polish, you find that there is very little underneath."

","In 2003, the horror remake 'The Texas Chainsaw massacre' re- freaked all audiences- but was this movie, being another remake,do the same?<br/><br/>The gore in this movie, was horrfying enough, along with that, the gruesome make up, and the motion of the zombies made it an aggravating factor. Sarah Polley's performance was average - there was nothing great about it. However- performances was not the main target in this movie- it was all about getting people freaked out, and making the world of reality collide with the world of the unrealistic.<br/><br/>Well i believe it did freak out many people - but was it better then the Texas chainsaw massacre? well i believe it was equally horrifying."

","George Romero's 1978 Dawn Of The Dead is one of the best horror films ever, a grim, bloody and apocalyptic satire of consumerism, and remaking it sounded a thoroughly cynical move, so it's all the more surprising the end result is so enjoyable.<br/><br/>The original film is essentially stripped back to its title, shopping mall location, three cameos and some in-jokes (although it still supplies all the best lines).<br/><br/>In place of satire and shambling cadavers, director Zack Snyder goes for ironically juxtaposed songs and sprinting zombies modeled on the infected from 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Dawn 2003 eventually finds its own identity in a welter of meaty gore effects and one excellent escape attempt in armoured camper vans towards the end, which makes it all the more disappointing it chose to ride on the coat-tails of a giant rather than ditch the mall setting and lurch on its own two feet as the perfectly serviceable, pulse-pounding zombie frightener it is."

","'Dawn' always was the most appealing of the Romero trilogy, so I guess they made a good choice remaking this one.<br/><br/>The movie starts literally like a blast. When coming home from work Ana (Sarah Polley) finds her husband becoming a zombie after being bit by a little girl. She flees with her car while around her the neighbourhood and the whole city collapses. Fantastic heli shots in this one, you should see the movie just for that.<br/><br/>She then meets up with a group of people, and they all get trapped inside a mall while thousands of zombies try to get in, like in the original. Of course not everybody will make the end alive...<br/><br/>There's some pretty gory shots in this one (check out the birth!), but it's all great fun.

","Romero's original Dawn of the dead is without question one of the best horror films ever made, as is the Original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". With the re-make of that last film in mind, one could have very easily disregarded the remake of Dawn. But within minutes in Dawn's re-make you know you are in for a much more original film than Texas re-make.<br/><br/>Dawn starts with Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"", how is that for an introduction, and what follows is just as good. The story floats around fluently, and just as in the original, much comment is given on today's society. This could easily have become an over-producted-special effects-gore fest, but instead, most scary moments are just brilliant editing and directing,as was the original. The difference between Dawn's re-make and Texas re-make is that both the original films had good story lines,a terrific premise,and were much better production than most horror films. The producers and director of the new Dead, have staid very close to the good elements of the original and have put in some new ingredients. Texas re-make kept only the premise and became, well a film massacre. This new Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror films of recent years, and should give the director much recognition as was given to Romero after his first Dead film. Scary as hell, well made, good performances, excellent camera and editing makes Dawn of the Dead a must see film."

","Possible spoilers alert!<br/><br/>It looks like the army of ardent fans of the critically acclaimed zombie sensation from the first-time director Zack Snyder has been propagating to proportions commensurable with the scale of plague that evoked legions of the undead in the movie.<br/><br/>At least the voting history statistics for the 2004 version is nearly to catch up with the one for the George Romero's classic in the course of 6 years since 1998 (i.e. from the time the first comment on 1978 movie has been posted).<br/><br/>If I may consider myself a devoted fan of the horror genre, I can't say I'm a zombie film buff, considering sensitive nature of life and death issue, which is normally provided with a kind of cynical treatment in such movies. However judgment on moral aspects should be tossed away, once we can afford watching that sort of stuff.<br/><br/>Unlike Savini's earlier (good but per se frame-by-frame) remake of the Night of the Living Dead, this one in comparison with the original definitely has agenda and style of its own.<br/><br/>Except for the shopping mall as the main set of the film the new Dawn is totally different (neither better nor worse): more characters (both dead and alive), wilder action, more realistic and graphic violence (even disabled stunts were employed in the movie), more gory mayhem, more sinister black humor (I wonder if Reynolds admits the alleged distant likeness to the handsome mustached folk in the crowd?).<br/><br/>Of course striking visual style and great fx are its primary merits. But I can hardly uphold the opinions accusing the creators in lack of characterization and personality development.<br/><br/>Of course the emotional experience of the leads that found themselves in a situation like that, loss of relatives and dramatic change in usual way of life are concealed behind the opaque veil but it is reasonable compromise for the sake of frantic momentum.<br/><br/>Sarah Polley (together with her stunt doubles) has demonstrated more than decent performance.<br/><br/>Terse and tough as a cliff Rhames is always fun to watch.<br/><br/>Kelly' CJ was simply awesome, while Burrell as a bit zany Steve is a standout.<br/><br/>Two scenes, one with CJ heroically sacrificing his life to save the rest of the gang, and the other depicting Michael's utterly respectable retreat in the end, nearly made me cry.<br/><br/>Note cameos from those behind the original Dawn (Tom Savini, Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger) as well as brief appearance of the director himself (shooting towards the audience with an automatic rifle during opening titles).<br/><br/>Now I may say that I know a true definition to a word ""thrilling"": I felt my guts shriveled, my lower jaw dangled and my eyes pinned to the screen from the terrific 5th minute take-off until the final flash of the closing credits.<br/><br/>Despite worn out topic the movie has to deal with, it is surprisingly refreshing and truly riveting even if considered to be more action than horror. <br/><br/>A definitive roller-coaster ride from start to finish and a rarely good nasty little hell of a pure entertainment.<br/><br/>I dare to assume (contrary to some prevailing views): The die-hard fans of the Romero's masterpiece shouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Just a parting thought - it was always a mystery to me: if they are so dumb (zombies, not fans) how do they tell the living from the dead and why don't they gnaw each other as much easier food?"

","Okay, first: this isn't as good as the Romero original. It does away with the vast majority of the thematic impact, symbolism and subtext. It's less distressing and less troubling.<br/><br/>But it's absolutely fantastic entertainment. Zack Snyder gets much of the exposition out of the way a.s.a.p. and includes some impressive photography to demonstrate how the characters cloistered lives are about to explode with unfathomable events. Then he holds the survivors up in a deserted mall, surrounds them with the undead and lets the flesh fly. It takes a different enough approach to stand independently from the original.<br/><br/>Sure, DotD doesn't show any great narrative flair. Of course its pacy and exciting, but is powered by incident: action sequences and dilemmas keep the action bowling along, not thematic issues. Furthermore, James Gunn's screenplay is fairly conventional and there are perhaps too many characters here. But I say again: it's fantastic fun.<br/><br/>Crash, bang and wallop. People die in large numbers. Guns go blam. People do stupid stuff in Armageddon. And there is a bucket load of sick humour. Plus stupid gags about obesity and the cult of celebrity (DIE!!!).<br/><br/>Those of sensitive disposition/easily offended would do well to avoid this because Snyder takes no prisoners and makes no concessions. This is tailor made for the anti-establishment or (more likely) the GoreHound Gang. Either way, you're in for a ball. The film has great energy in pushing things forward to an unpleasant conclusion, never relenting and constantly pounding you with sound and fury. Matthew F. Leonetti contributes great cinematography, shooting everything in an appropriately rotten colour pallet, Tyler Bates scores excoriating music and Ving Rhames (great) and Sarah Polley (just as good) go through hell with heads held high. And numerous obnoxious characters get scragged.<br/><br/>I could give you a better idea of the scenario and story, but I won't. Just get the DVD, a load of friends, plenty of beer and Chinese take-away, sit back and relax ¬ñ and be battered. Some may take that as a warning, so beware that this isn't a particularly pleasant experience. But what did you expect?<br/><br/>Note to film-makers: I loved the use of Johnny Cash in the opening credits."

","Like most avid fans of the original Dead trilogy (especially Dawn), I was heartbroken when I saw they were remaking one of my all-time zombie favorites. However, when I saw the 2004 version on opening night I was in awe. Though it didn't capture the attack on consumerism of the original, the remake was astoundingly good. It contained the dark humor of the original trilogy, while having a surprising amount of gore for an R-rated movie. When I left the theater I was so happy that someone who obviously loved the original went to the lengths they did in making this film. Not only do we get a great cast, but cameos from 3 stars of the original.<br/><br/>All in all, a worthwhile and fun zombie movie. 4/4."

","I was grossly (no pun) disappointed with this remake. Everybody connected with the making and releasing of DOTD-2004 should have known better! At least the zombies in this one didn't look blue or green like the ones in the original 1978 Romero film. But still, I was not happy with '2004.' <br/><br/>I guess I'm one of few horror-movie fans still left on this planet that still likes their movie-zombies shown lumbering slowly about, and ambushing their human quarry. <br/><br/>I oppose the modern trend in making the 'walking dead' move about like some hyperactive dancer in an MTV music video. Too many video-directors lose sight of the fact that zombies are supposed to move about scary-like and slow like some blind creature who nevertheless has acute senses for sniffing-out human-blood (their danger is in the sudden ambush, and the fact that, in horror films anyway, there are so many of them).<br/><br/>I hope we get more Zombie movies where the monsters walk slowly up a suburban driveway, one of them shown dragging its foot or partially detached limb, and another shown eating a man's arm like a giant drumstick, while the creatures eyeball their next human-victim trying vainly to start his car and make his getaway. ...you get the general idea."

","Decent but not so good remake to the original gore flick lacks the brains of its predecessor and does not have its heart. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames do well with their roles but the film really does not go anywhere with the time it has, and it lacks the bravado of the original film's climax. My hats off to the director for keeping the body count high but shame on him for not getting too involved with his cast of characters, who in the original had some personality. George Romero's original had a sense of real dread and a nightmarish view on human conflict but this movie is more popcorn than a real meal. Some genuine scares here and there but nothing else in terms of real human emotion. Which is a shame because that what makes the original such a classic in modern horror."

","Now this is a film you don't get to see every day! The mere fact that this film's a remake and does only suck a little makes it special, but what nearly a real gem these days, if there weren't those stupid flaws I mean, is the exclusion of clich√©s (well, the most of 'em). Like, if this was the typical profit-oriented, no-room-for-artsy-stuff flick, it would drown with the other crappy attempts to make money of abusing the good reputation and cult of its originals. But actually, this one succeeds in combining modern video-clip aesthetics with effective cinematography and good storytelling.<br/><br/>The films first ten minutes are hilarious. Not only because the opening begins with the end of the world right away, but also because the credits begin not until those ten minutes. Another plus is the avoidance of any explanations for the zombie-phenomenon and, oh the word ""zombie"" isn't mentioned at all! It's disappointing, to be honest, that the heroes don't coincidentally find a book, left on a table somewhere, that describes them how to get rid of the plague and that standard lines, like ""I won't leave you here!"", are missing. Well, for the satirical aspect: it is really ironic seeing that, with the problems that come from the 4th amendment, only gun carrying people survive at the beginning - Matt Groening will probably like this message. What unfortunately really flaws the film and nearly destroys it, if there weren't those action-packed scenes following after, is firstly the aspect of everyone shooting the zombies in the head (the only way to kill them) with a near 99% accuracy, which is something one can live with since only gun-crazy people survive the attacks and reach the mall. Secondly, there is a scene which really is ridiculous (and I don't mind spoiling it), where a woman risks her life for a dog and after that having everyone risk their lives for the same stupid woman. What also bothered me was the Character of Steve, whose job is nothing but being an asshole and - surprise! - dying at the end, leaving all the ""good guys"" to survive. But aside from that, it is a really good film which has its moments - whether they are funny, action-loaded or exciting."

","OK, remakes haven't the same merit than the original thing and the most of the times are unnecessary and quite worst than the movie they're ""remaking"". However, there're exceptions to that rule, and Dawn Of The Dead (2004) is one of those. <br/><br/>The starting point is the same as in George A. Romero's version: a group of people take refuge from the attack of the living dead in a shopping centre. But there're some differences that makes this remake much better and much frantic than the 1978's Dawn Of The Dead:<br/><br/>1) It's not as long as the first version. Almost 40 minutes shorter.<br/><br/>2) The living dead are fast as hell, which makes them much more terrorific.<br/><br/>3) This movie is pure action, there's not a second's break.<br/><br/>4) The use of digital cameras intensify the action scenes (especially to the of the movie)<br/><br/>5) Obviously they've spent much more money than Romero did. Spending more money doesn't mean that you're gonna make a better film; but in this case it does. <br/><br/>6) There're no easy frights.<br/><br/>7) (This may not be an advantage) Is not as darker an oppressive as the first version.<br/><br/>Well, that's it.

","The action settles in an abandoned shopping mall, where Anna, a police officer named Kenneth and a few other survivors - gun-toting Andre, his pregnant girlfriend Luda and mysterious Mike. In the mall they are confronted by the local security, who suddenly have delusions of power. The group winds up locked in a home furnishings store before turning tables on the rent-a-cops. Setting up shop in the mall, they have a little fun, playing basketball and working out with gear from the sports store.<br/><br/>Most comical is Ken forming a bond with a gun store owner across the street named Andy, with the two communicating by writing on erasable message boards. They play chess and take pot shots at the horde of zombies below them for laughs. In a true sign of a sick mind at work, there's a montage of mayhem done to a lounge band covering The Disturbed's ""The Sickness."" Snyder is crazy, and I love it.<br/><br/>The strongest character studies in the film show how people react under pressure as society collapses. We see it in the rent-a-cops trying to display power they don't really have, and in the development of Michael, who shows strength of character despite a less-than-impressive background. <br/><br/>Like many, I found myself anxious about the news that Dawn was being remade. I wasn't particularly worried about the choice of director or screenwriter (like some outspoken folks). I was more concerned with the ""uber-stupid-teenification"" that seems to haunt most of the decent ideas that surface in cinema nowadays - particularly in horror films.<br/><br/>That said, there were a couple instances in the new Dawn that I could've lived without.

Is this how Americans greet each other? In a disaster area? They kind of grow and become more humane during the movie, but no reason is given for their ape like behavior in the first place.

","Yep, it is rare that remakes do much for me. Usually they're crappily done rehashes that lose all of the original's charm and messages (if any). Either that, or they ""re-imagine"" the original (God, I hate that term!) and muck the original about so much that you wonder why they gave it the same name (eg. Battlestar Galactica)<br/><br/>But in DoD we get a movie that, like the original, is full of dark humour and menace, updated for today's audience. The original Romero version was good, and remains one of my favourites of all time. But this remake can stand proudly alongside it without feeling inferior in any way.<br/><br/>The plot is virtually the same. People fleeing from zombies hold up inside a mall and try to wait out the apocalypse. This version has a whole lot more characters, although I'm giving nothing away by saying most of them die, and a few new ideas thrown in.<br/><br/>The zombies owe more to Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" than they do to Romero's shambling originals. But that serves only to make them more menacing, since you can't necessarily outrun/outmaneuver them easily.<br/><br/>The characters are reasonably stereotypical. But it is nice to see a movie where the heroes have ordinary jobs and aren't all ex-Green Berets or Navy Seals. Just average Joes and Janes. In fact, the most competent (in this kind of situation) individuals are a cop and some security guards, and none of them are eager to take charge (except one of the security guys, and he's messed up).<br/><br/>There isn't a huge amount of character development. In fact, the aforementioned security guard undergoes the biggest development, losing his selfish attitude and becoming one of the more likable characters of the group.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the group diminishes in size as the film progresses, lost to the zombies mostly, though with the occasional accident thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>There are a few things to mar this film. If you were trapped in a gun shop and had thousands of rounds of ammunition, wouldn't you just kill as many zombies from the rooftop as you could? What would be the point in not shooting them? Similarly, when using gas containers as bombs to be shot at as they lie on the ground, why not tape thousands of nails and screws to them and make them even more dangerous? But these are minor gripes more concerned with what I would do in that situation, rather than actual movie problems. In fact, most of the characters act with far more intelligence than you are used to seeing in a horror film, which in itself is a refreshing change.<br/><br/>But, on the whole, this film scores highly for entertainment and rewatchability. There's plenty of gore to keep the splatter fans happy and plenty of fear for the easily frightened to bite their fingernails at. Likewise lots of ""Yeah!"" moments to cheer at.<br/><br/>Easily the best movie I've watched this year."

","Now, I'm not really a stranger when it comes to zombie movies, having seen more than just a handful of them. But I think that it is still safe to say that this movie certainly is among the lines of one of the better zombie movies out there.<br/><br/>I can't remember ever having been that impressed with any 'modern horror movie' for a while now. There isn't a single aspect about this movie that I could have imagined to be better. Although there are a lot more characters than in the original, each of them does manage to maintain a different personality which therefor doesn't make them appear to be just 'fill-ins'. The gore and effects are undeniably amazing and there are scenes that might even make the biggest gore fans cringe (chainsaw). What's also interesting is that this remake manages to capture the same dark humor as well as the claustrophobic feel (although not as intense) as the original. There isn't a single minute that's remotely 'boring' (even though many people will deny it, it's probably even more exiting than Romero's version) and it has some nice twists in it. Overall, this is an amazing movie that I would recommend to anyone .."

","When i first heard that a remake of a classic zombie flic was in the works, i was thinking about how Hollywood is doing that a lot lately. Most of the remakes suck to. I was scared that it was going to butcher one of the greatest horror movies ever. Well, i was wrong. This movie is very good and scary, great gore for the most part. WARNING SPOILERS: This movie stars only one actor that comes to mind Ving Rhimes. This remake basically takes everything in the remake and makes it more ""Hollywood"" but that doesn't mean that its bad. Same plot, it doesn't explain why people turn into zombies much like the original, strangers take a shelter in a mall. The difference about this one, being that the zombies are outside the mall. With exception of a couple zombies inside. I don't want to give that much away because there isn't much to give away if you have seen the original. Don't go into this movie expecting it to top the original because it doesn't. As far as the direction it was OK, except the MTV style editing which i cant stand. Acting was good to."

","Zack Snyder. Who is this guy? I've never heard the name before and yet he has managed to make the best remake in recent times. ""Dawn of the dead"" has always been one of my favorite zombie flicks, so naturally it should be impossible to better it, at least by remaking it. I can't really say that the remake is better than the original in any way but it's stands for itself.<br/><br/>The tempo, compared to the old movie, is very high. The movie kicks off even before you know it. I somehow feel the movie could have been better if it was a little slower, since you often get to know people for about a second before they turn into zombies. Also the zombies run around like someone has filled their pants with fire-ants, which is a bit sad. I mean zombies are supposed to be slow and stupid.<br/><br/>The FX are well made and the atmosphere is reasonably chilling. Whereas the old movie was a clever satire of the consumption and materialistic needs of our society this is more of a full frontal action/horror movie which makes it a lot less original but it's still made in such a good way that it smacks most of the opposition on the fingers.<br/><br/>So, while it's not a patch on the original it's a pretty fine movie on it's own and probably the best remake this side of ""The Fly"". And by the way, gorehounds will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I have to first admit that i have a bias, since i feel that 28 days later is one of the best FILMS i have ever seen (of all genres). I know a lot of horror and zombie movie maniacs didn't enjoy 28dl and some have called it the worst in history. However i felt they were given a wrong impression by the adverts. Dawn of the dead fits the advertisements of 28dl better than 28dl did. 28 days later scared the hell, better put it didn't scare as much as it haunted me, out of me because i am more affected by psychological fears than knee jerking suspense. Thus the use of ""deja vu"" like editing and shots which were claustrophobic as well as shots off level and through bars gave me a depth of feeling with the plot i had never before experienced (along with all the visual allusions that hit your subconscious).<br/><br/>To my knowledge Zack Snyder has admitted to looking to 28dl(when a hit in UK) and using some of the qualities he liked; faster zombies etc (that haunting shadow shot in the parkade of the infected dead running a mirror image of the hordes in the tunnel in 28dl). I think he made some good decisions of what improvements were made in 28dl to the zombie genre.<br/><br/>I have seen all of the dead series numerous times and have to tell you that, for me, they were never, EVER, scary... being surprised is not being scared. But the zombies were always dumb and slow... so why would i be scared? Some idiot always trips. Am i supposed to be scared for him or her? No. My first reaction for dumb characters is ""please eat him already"". In the Moron vs. Zombie title fight i always cheer for the zombie; after all its the moron who is wasting my time and aggravating me ... not the zombie. That was the BIG thing i loved about the new zombies... because now characters don't have to be morons to get eaten. The zombies can run after you and chase you down. When You take out the stupid people crutch that the genres of zombie and slasher films lean on the film all of a sudden transcends its genre(since it is now my theory that that moron character is what defines it). Since i had not witnessed moronic choices; other than Polley getting too close to peoples faces when they were infected (must admit i said ""eat her"" a couple of times and not in the x.x.x kind of way), and that dumb girl going for her dog which the zombies already proved was not going to be hurt anyways; i feel this is no longer a zombie film but should be classified as horror.<br/><br/>I liked the reproduction of one of the eeriest shots in the original... which of course is when (in the original) a man is covered with a blanket when he dies.. and after a couple seconds the blanket gets up. I'm happy they kept that, as it is one of the trade marks from the film... along with cops raiding an apartment complex at the beginning and shooting a guys head clean off as if it were a ripe watermelon(which it may have been).<br/><br/>To put it short... i give the movie/flick (not film) an 8, still some moron moves that make you say ""eat her please"" but they kept it to one or two. The movie did well to provide better characters and a basic message--obviously same as the first, But nothing touches 28DL for those two areas. I still love the upside down ""Hell"" shot in 28dl. Oh yeah 28dl is becoming a franchise... lets see if they turn it in to an alien clone that had james cameron and David fincher take the torch or if it becomes like almost every other franchise and falls on its face. Are they re-making all the Remero films? If anyone knows id sure like to hear about it."

","This film is great. I can't rave enough about it.To be honest I would have liked to have seen a little more gore, but hey, you can't have it all. If you immerse yourself in the film and believe that this is really happening then you will not be disappointed. Did Sara's head really hit the shower wall that hard? Is there really someone who would behave like Steve in this type of crisis? How did the little girl at the beginning become a zombie? What the hell is wrong with Andre? Could he be that stupid? Is he the dumbest guy in history of movies? These were the questions I had after leaving the theater. The zombies have evolved with the ""28 Days Later"" like ability to run you down and eat you alive now. No more shuffling around like their ankles are tied together. There were some parts of the movie that truly took my breath away: the initial scenes with Sara escaping from the house, the mission to Andy's gun shop plus the return to the mall was one of the wildest rides I've had in a while. It was a lot like the whole scene in Van Helsing with Jackman and the three vamps, and the entire battle he had with them in the town square. These type of scenes really make a film worth seeing since after it's all over, you just hear a lot of people exhaling, and adjusting themselves in their seats, and trying to relax after such an action packed sequence. However, nothing affected me more than the character of Michael. This guy had me on his side from the beginning with his thoughtfulness, level head, and all around nice guy attitude. When he told Norma ""well done"", I just shook my head at how human he was. He was the heart and soul of the outfit, and when he chose to go outside to help the people in the truck it showed a level of caring for your fellow man that I have to say touched me deeply. It sounds like bull but I mean it. He was just a good guy. I liked C.J. too, but he was the guy you had to hate until Steve showed up. C.J. didn't behave like I thought he would when things broke down, and when he was in the sewer during the escape back to the mall, I had to admit I admired him for not just leaving Tucker to his doom. The escape from the mall was great too. I just loved this movie. The director did a good job of running your hear out of your chest with suspense, then giving you a few minutes to catch your breath, then running you ragged again. I'm buying this without question. I'm even going to actually buy it and not download it. I WANT to give my money for this film!!!"

","I have to tell you, I took this movie home out of sheer boredom, but was very pleasantly surprised indeed!  OK, so you already know it's a zombie movie, and you don't expect much realism.  This film, however, is done in such a realistic style that you find yourself thinking ""yeah, that's how it would be.""  The characters are developed FAR more than you would expect in a gory horror movie, and once again, there is much realism in their portrayal. You have a street punk, a jaded cop, a nurse, a sarcastic smartass, and some blue-collar mall security good old boys.  Everyone stays in character, no matter what kind of gruesome zombie scene is thrust upon them. <br/><br/>
There is also a lot of humor in the movie.  One of the funniest scenes was an elevator door closing on a mob of zombies trying to get the living inside.  One minute it's run for your life, and the next it's a small group of people listening to elevator music and looking at the floor uncomfortably.  One of them says ""I like this song."" Hilarious!<br/><br/>Anyway, for what it is, I think it's a great remake of the classic, with much scarier and more dangerous zombies, and more people making good decisions (as opposed to dopey horror-movie ""oh gee maybe I should leave my safe room and go outside unarmed to see what that scream was"" decisions). Go see it or rent it, and don't turn off the player or walk out just because the closing credits have started!"

","Upon seeing the unwatchable piece of trash that was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre REMAKE (loved the original, for the record), I was damn skeptical of subsequent remakes of any film that was a classic in its time. I was even more skeptical when I read that the writer for the Scooby Doo film was going to be handling it. Despite all that bad karma, I'm happy to say that Dawn of the Dead changed my mind and restored my faith in remakes.<br/><br/>Typical George Romero zombies are slow-moving and to the average human, not too threatening unless there's a whole bunch of them. THESE zombies were closer to the creatures in 28 Days Later - you know, the kind that'll throw you across the room and rip your throat out before you even realize you're dealing with zombies at all. While some purists might not agree with the idea of streamlining these zombies, making them faster and more deadly only brought up the terror level to an almost unbearable level and created a whole new reason to be afraid. The updated twist on the original story allowed the director to blow up the complete chaos and armaggedon that are the central premise of zombie films, all appropriately set to Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" during the opening credits. This was accompanied by grainy, chilling news-TV shots that might make you think for just a second that life as we know it just may be ending outside your door.<br/><br/>I was also impressed by the clever use of humor in this film. Its scary, but its equally REALLY funny. The sarcasm of the characters, in the manner they present themselves to the audience and to each other, provides a wonderful backdrop to the frightening, unbelievable situation they are in. While some horror films try to squeeze in comic relief moments wherever they may find room, this film combines both brilliantly. <br/><br/> From the first frame to the last (stick around for the scene after the credits), I loved it. Loved it. This is the way a remake is supposed to be done. The guilty parties behind the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake should be taking notes. George Romero would be damn proud."

If you were to encounter 5 of these creatures your only hope of escape would be the use of a rocket launcher or the ability to fly. 2)You had less gore in terms internal body parts being exposed. Even the cannibalism was curbed. 3)You had a more extensive & more interesting crew of characters, even the bit part of Kenneth's roof partner was nicely done. 4)You had a more plausible and even frightening premise on which the ""Deadish"" came to being. The possibility of such a disease agent overtaking our society does exist with the deteriorating conditions of our environment. 5)You definitely have all the components for a sequel with how it ended.

","I saw this film at the theater. I grew up on horror films and the first flick that truly scared me was the original Romero masterpiece, Night of the Living Dead. After seeing Dawn of the Dead in England and walking the dark, deserted streets home afterwards, I was hooked on the genre. Day of the Dead was the goriest of the Romero films, but the characters were not as developed as in his first two and in his remake of Night of the Living Dead, and so, in that sense, was the least successful of his four productions. I have led a somewhat adventurous life on several continents and consider myself afraid of little except free-falling from the sky and zombies. The idea of confronting either has made me question my courage. As a teenager the question of whether I would charge into the room to try to save people, knowing I would be eaten alive, tormented me. I could not answer the question. Now, after watching these films over and over, I am closer to the answer and I think I know what I would do. So, with this catharsis mostly behind me, I watched the ""remake"" of Dawn of the Dead with great interest. Being a hard core Romero fan (George, please make more!!)I had my doubts about zombies that seem to be in training for long-distance sprints in the next Olympics. Part of the horror in the Romero films (apart from the sheer disintegration of society) was the army of dead closing in with that disconcerting, shambling gait...the inevitability of them closing in and being eaten alive. At the same time, the possibility existed in these films that one could avoid that fate by moving and thinking quickly, by taking direct action to thin their awful numbers by a well-aimed shot to the head. In short, the characters in the film and more importantly, the viewer, had hope. With hope comes the chance of success and life, and this engages the viewer in the film. The original Dawn of the Dead was so successful because it was really a survival story of four people who relied on each other to recreate a sane corner of the world and they cared for each other. Therefore, they mattered to the audience. The remake -- missed a good chance in the beginning to show the progressive breakdown of society - rather, it is thrust upon us too quickly. The many characters offered a good chance for ""cannon fodder,"" but unfortunately left the ""main"" characters somewhat obscure(I had a hard time finding out who they were until the others had been ""picked off"" and process of elimination revealed them to me). The original soundtrack was also better because it gripped the viewer immediately and sounded like a heartbeat. The music literally got inside you. I found the remake's soundtrack bland by comparison and the Johnny Cash tune to be wildly out of place. As for the hordes of Olympically qualified zombies, there was really no way to fight them. And so, no hope. Without hope, human psychology can simply shut off or shut down. I did. To survive. I am not trashing this film. I would see it again. What I lament is the absence of so many of the underlying techniques that made the Romero films successful. George, our once and possibly future king -- where are you? I rate the remake a 5.0."

","The 1978 version of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" was an extremely gruesome film about zombies invading a shopping mall. This of course was the sequel to Romero's 1968 B&W cult classic ""Night of the Living Dead"". Both movies were very good in a series that would eventually end with the final film of the series, 1985's ""Day of the Dead"", which couldn't equal the first two films. Then in 1990 came the awful remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"", a movie so bad because it was almost the exact same movie as the original (except that it was in color). Now the second movie in the zombie series has been remade, and was a surprise! I actually liked this new version better than the original 1978 film.<br/><br/>The 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" pretty much has the same plotline as the earlier movie (zombies roam the countryside, and several survivors barricade themselves in a shopping mall), but unlike the ""Night of the Living Dead"" remake, this one isn't exactly the same as the 1978 version. This newer version is different. Here are three comparisons between the two films. 1) The zombies in the 1978 film moved slow; in the 2004 film they move faster. 2) Only four survivors barricaded themselves in the shopping mall in the original movie; there are more than four people who become trapped in the mall in the remake. 3) The human villains in the original were a motorcycle gang; the human villains in the remake are the shopping mall's security guards. I could go on and on about this all day, but let's move on to the other aspects of the film.<br/><br/>This new version has better actors than the original. The original movie had pretty much unknown actors in the principal roles, but the remake has a couple of familiar faces. Sarah Polley, who started out as a child actor in Terry Gilliam's 1989 fantasy ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and then grew up in movies like 1999's ""GO"", is excellent as a young nurse who helps fight off the flesh-eating zombies. Ving Rhames is equally good as a cop also trying to fight for survival. Jake Weber (""U-571""), Mekhi Phifer (TV's ER), Kevin Zegers (the ""Air Bud"" films) and Matt Frewer (""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"") round out the exceptional cast. Zack Snyder directs from a screenplay by James Gunn, and Snyder made a movie remake that's better than the original (which is rare in the movie industry). There's plenty of gore, action, laughs, and good performances (not necessarily by everybody; there are a few supporting characters that I could have done without). If there was one thing that I disliked about the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", it is the final credits sequence, which I thought was kind of ridiculous. And not to mention incompetently put together, which made it very distracting. But aside from that minor quibble, this is for the most part a terrific remake. And yes, it's very gruesome. <br/><br/>2004's ""Dawn of the Dead"" rocks!<br/><br/>****1/2 (out of four)"

","Many argue George Romero's acclaimed Dawn of the Dead from 1978 remains one of the most poignant critiques of modern mercantile society, with its zombies analogous to raving shoppers clamoring to get their hands on what's inside the mall. As a celebrated release, DOTD78 may have little use for a remake, but sadly for it, the 2004 Zack Snyder refit brings to the screen enough class to qualify not only as the best zombie flick in a while, but to put Romero's original in the history books once and for all. There's a new undead king of the block in town, and it doesn't really even call itself a zombie movie. That's right, throughout the film's entire runtime not once is the Z word uttered, although characters do insinuate that ""we all know what they are"". What are they? In a bid to out-Capcom Resident Evil, DOTD04 postulates a ravaging, global plague of the ghoul-making variety rapidly decimating humanity all over the place. In a brazenly magnificent opening sequence, the story's background becomes vividly apparent and gripping. Hope has faded into nothingness. Suburbia is done for. A loosely-knit federation of survivors fortifies a local mall populated by made-up stores and semi-hostile security guards, not to mention several hungry flesh-munchers plus a horde of pissed-off super-undead at the double glass doors. Seemingly incompatible folk such as down-to-earth nurse Ana (Sarah Polly), sturdy cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), sociopathic playboy Steve (Ty Burrell) and natural-leader Michael (Jake Weber) find themselves alone under the brunt of a surging, decaying tidal wave staffed by over-zealous Toronto-area extras. Mekhi Phifer delivers a young soon-to-be father overly protective of his young wife and unborn child, even though from the get go audiences realize this happens to be one pregnancy heading for disaster. Even Matt Frewer (Max Headroom!) stops by for a convincingly-eerie cameo. Together, the ragtag band must deal with issues like simple survival, handling infection victims with their transformation into zombies, taking in others as they arrive from the nightmarish outside, and plotting an escape route. These elements result in spurts of well-placed bloody gunfights that give an excellently urgent impression of just how unstoppable the walking corpses are. Very little suspense creeps into proceedings, partly because it stands as irrelevant. Savvy viewers with any knowledge of zombie lore should be able to fathom the story start to finish easily, meaning there's hardly any point using red herrings and plot twists in such a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>What earmarks DOTD04 as a capable picture has more to do with its relentless pace, authentic atmosphere and efficient characters, who all execute respective roles with great acumen. Snyder and Co also do admirable balancing work, keeping things sane despite copious amounts of blood, gore, dismemberments and shots to the head. Dawn of the Dead pays homage to startlingly violent, not gross. It also encompasses almost everything an R rated product should have, .i.e swearing, smoking and sex, all in modest dosages, but nonetheless in attendance. Speaking of R ratings, Snyder has made a name for himself as a director fiercely loyal to the more mature segments of the movie going crowd, having declined projects like S.W.A.T for being PG-13. Good for him. In comparing Romero's own '78 release and this one, a few facts become immediately clear. Unlike his zombies, Snyder's run fast and claw with irritating vivacity, while their older siblings shambled around apathetically (as did all zombies in the past). Character names have changed, but the story goes more or less the same, helped along by tastefully utilized CGI ingredients and a more upbeat McGuyver-esque scene where our valiant live-ons construct means of courageous degress. Overall, the new edition will likely appeal to more people, as opposed to its cultish ancestor. All this even in the face of a relatively paltry budget (28 mill). Oh, modern times. To its detriment, DOTD04 and its official website fail to acknowledge recent counterparts like Resident Evil and House of the Dead, both accomplished entries to the genre, despite including a zombie timeline (which mysteriously stops around 1999...). Furthermore, although thrilling and smooth, the movie lacks any memorable one-liners, which always help augment movies so nicely. For something a bit braver than your typical weekend foray, and definitely more colorful than most of its contemporaries combined, check out Dawn of the Dead and keep telling yourself its popcorn the guy in the back row's eating. Sure, popcorn.<br/><br/>Rating: * * * 1/2"
"medic249a2","8","0","0","12 July 2004"," Remake that's its own movie
","I think that when Zack Snyder undertook this project, he realized just what he was trying to remake. Romero's original 'Dawn' would be hard, if not impossible, to duplicate, and to try to do so would likely enrage countless Romero fans. So he wisely tried to make this 'Dawn' its own movie, with a few notable differences. Most differences add to and enhance the film.<br/><br/>***WARNING!! SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>A pretty young nurse named Ana (Sarah Polley) returns home from her hospital job, just as we get a hint of what is coming; a patient at her hospital admitted for a minor injury is in ICU - with an unknown problem. When she returns home to her husband Louis, they spend a romantic night in the shower while the TV flashes an emergency broadcast...<br/><br/>The next morning Louis wakes up to discover their next door neighbor, a little girl, standing in their doorway. When Louis gets up to investigate, he is attacked and killed by her. Ana wakes up to discover Louis bleeding heavily from a bite wound. and he rapidly succumbs to his injury. When Ana tries to call for help, 911 replies 'all circuits are busy'; the world is falling apart. In seconds Louis is on his feet, hungrily coming after Ana. She manages to escape to her car and flee, and as she does, her suburb is swarming with police and ambulances, as well as people running everywhere. As she gets onto the freeway she is forced to stop at an accident, and on a nearby city bus she sees two hideous zombies feed on a third. After crashing her car, a policeman (Ving Rhames) discovers & rescues her. They make their way to a mall with 3 other people, including a man (Mekhi Pfifer of ER) and his expectant girlfriend. They hole themselves up in the mall as the world falls apart around them; TVs in the mall show the problem is as far afield as England, India, and the Middle East. Outside the mall, mobs of undead zombies try to get in - to feast on the living...<br/><br/>***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes were an excellent take on this classic; showing the world falling apart as the mysterious plague spreads uncontrollably was something that was only hinted at in Romero's original. Some of the characters, such as the obnoxious guard C.J., were probably unnecessary, though C.J.'s character gradually develops through the movie from a self-centered man to one who sacrifices himself to let the others get away. Most 'Dawn' watchers may remember Gaylen Ross' pregnancy in the original; this one takes it a bit further with the birth of the zombie baby, after its mother becomes a zombie. It was interesting to see some of the original 'Dawn' actors in cameo roles; Tom Savini as the sheriff; Scott Reininger as an army colonel; and Ken Foree as a preacher, stating his line from the original 'Dawn' - ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"".<br/><br/>**** out of *****"

","OK I saw this movie in theaters and I already new it would be good but I walked out of the theater thinking ""O my gosh that was the best film I had ever seen. The way the characters interact for example first they all act like complete strangers to each other then as time passes become like a family. As the story goes on the characters learn to deal with the fact that if they go out side they will become someones lunch and so like real people they try to continue life while knowing this. And the action is done in such a realistic manner that the characters seem real. For example some characters who don't use guns in their everyday life have trouble shooting at first then as time passes and they have practice with said guns their shooting skills have gotten better. And for the ones who use guns all the time they also improve on there shooting but start out good already. This film also has funny bits to break the tension and it is very welcome and at times laugh-out-loud funny. If you like the old Dawn Of the Dead or if you like zombie movies or you like action or comedy or a good story this is for you. My grade: A+ its Freakin' awesome."

","I thought this movie was good, fun in many situations, not very scary if you have seen horror before but good entertainment for a Saturday night. The only thing that bothered me was the color of the blood that flooded in the movie: not natural. The bad guy did a good job playing the pain in the ass. And what's a good thing in my eyes too: the color of the people didn't matter in this plot to their chances on survival.<br/><br/>the fact that it wasn't so scary for me can be explained a bit because of the fact that similar scenes e.g. fights with the enraged undead appear in for example '28 days later'. Compared to 28D's the storyline of this movie is a little lighter. More concentrated on suspense."

","Furiously paced and grittily filmed, this remake of 1978 genre classic is strikingly effective, with characters needfully restrained. The apocalyptic atmosphere is immediate and riveting. And thank you for technical film-making improvement- no tomato soup- blood, here. Still, the 1978 original haunts me differently, with its slow-moving zombies and pastel images. There the message of human wallowing in the shopping mall materialist excess also lingers longer: Once knowing you could die the next hour, wouldn't YOU be tempted to do the same thing? <br/><br/>But hey, why compete? They're two completely different films, and equally enjoyable. But the kinetic breakout scene here is simply stunning, and the episode with Andy the rooftop gunman provides the most memorable human element. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe."

","The original Dawn of the Dead felt too bad to make a remake of at first, but when I heard that it was only going to be a tribute with a little more budget than the original - I just couldn't believe my ears and after seeing the trailer I just had to see this piece at the cinema. Once off to pay a visit at the cinema due the rain, we we're settled down in the seats of the cinema to watch the tribute to Dawn of the Dead. I got very surprised by the movie itself, since it were not a real ""splatter"", but it were not like a total rip-off from 28 days later neither. It was a good mix up with some flesh exposure together with heavy combats, and it had all those spices I like in a zombie piece like this. The best is that they add a little bit of comedy to it, who makes it even more deep and playful along the road - not only rabbit hunt with the shotguns. <br/><br/>7/10"

","The original is (or was) my favourite zombie film, and since remakes most of the time are dead on arrival, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this one.<br/><br/>It doesn't have the same depth as Romero's film (a consumer society gone very wrong, the fantasy of having a whole shopping mall to your self turning into a nightmare), but it's fast paced, gory fun that's very entertaining. It also has the benefit of having better actors - there are no slackers in this one. The camera work, and editing is fast and slick, but not nausiating as it often can be. The pacing is perfect, and there are no dull moments.<br/><br/>In style, the film bears close resemblance to 28 Days Later, but I prefer the less moody feeling of Dawn. The film was much bloodier than I expected, and I'm glad they didn't chicken out and toned down the violence (after all, it is a horror film). My biggest problem with the film is actually that I like the slow moving zombies better than the running ones that seems to be the standard today.<br/><br/>All in all, a remake that manages to top the original."

","Can a remake become a new era?<br/><br/>This was the question I asked myself, when I'd finished watching the new remake of Dawn of the Dead. <br/><br/>This movie was beyond all my expectations, and I can assure, that I actually had some pretty high thoughts about this remake.<br/><br/>The original story is a masterpiece itself, and this new one, wasn't bad in any way. Rather the opposite, it had been remodeled and redone to fit the aspects of the time we are living in today. And I'm sure Romero is pleased with the new story.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most was how god d**n beautiful this movie was. Every scene is like a masterpiece itself. The intro and outro is the absolute best I have ever witnessed on the white screen!

Every scene just felt so perfect. The lighting, the environments, camera positioning, effects etc. Everything just felt like it had been trimmed to perfection!<br/><br/>
But... Dawn of the Dead is not for everyone. My mom for instance wouldn't be able to understand what made this movie so great. It is still a hardcore zombie flick. Not like 28 days later or Resident Evil.<br/><br/>

","Dawn of the Dead<br/><br/>One day, everything seems normal. Ana (Sarah Polley) is working overtime at the hospital, where she is following up a patient who was bitten. She finally finishes, goes home to her husband, and everything seems normal. When Ana and her husband wakes up, they find their next door neighbour's daughter standing at the doorway, ready to bounce. This in turns leads to the girl biting Ana's husband, who then tries to bite Ana. But of cause she misses by inches, and drives as far as she can go.<br/><br/>Ana soon finds out that she is not the only survivor, after crashing her car. She soon meets up with: Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michel (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), and Luda (Inna Korobkina), who also have just survived a close encounter with the zombies. The survivors then head to the shopping centre to hide away from the flesh-eating zombies. As they wander about the shopping centre and find things which they can use, they encounter security guards: CJ (Michael Kelly), Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry). They mean business. Also they let in other survivors who are also trying to defend themselves: Steve (Ty Burrell), Nicole (Lindy Booth), Norma (Jayne Eastwood), Tucker (Boyd Banks), plus others.<br/><br/>So now, Ana and the other survivors must keep the zombies out of the shopping centre, so that they do not end up as flesh eating zombies.<br/><br/>My opinion...<br/><br/>I have not seen the original, so cannot compare the two. The movie was very scary at times, leaving me on the edge of my seat, and found myself tapping my feet and covering my mouth. The music helped with the atmosphere. I think that the comedic moments in the movie were well placed, and found myself giggling. There was one part in the movie which made my sister, myself and the rest of the cinema-goers gasp out loud. But this was soon followed by a faint laugh, thinking ""Did we just witness that? I can't believe it!"" The acting was pretty good, and I enjoyed watching the zombies.

","Since I've been a zombie-slasher-movie-freak for the last 15 yrs I was highly anticipating the premiere of the remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Twenty-six years has past since the original was made and horror-film making has certainly moved ahead. This is not only visible in the effects section but also in the way the remake is directed, shot and edited. The 2003-version is a fast-paced, in your face type film and the coolest thing about it is that its gruesome without really focusing on the gore, like in many other ""zombie"" films. This version isn't always as true to the original as many other remakes of other films are but thats just adds to the movies better sides. A remake is supposed to be an update. And thats just what this is. Not always true to the original, but true to the genre and evolution.<br/><br/>This remake of ""DOTD"" is in my point of view one of the best ""horror"" movies I've seen in the last one or two years. Its not pretentious like many other films in this genre is. Its just a cool horror movie. And please stay and watch the end titles! I would have to give this film **** out of 5."

","***This contains spoilers - I have tried to keep them relatively non-specific, but you have been warned :D***<br/><br/>I must confess that I have never seen the original take on this film, and to tell the truth, the teasers I had seen for this remake had me thinking that I would be spending my boyfriend's hard earned cash on yet another cheesy gore-fest. I was so incredibly wrong!<br/><br/>This film is incredible. The early normality as Ana (Polley) concludes her shift, and goes home to her suburban life only heightens the complete horror that follows. Aside from an undercurrent of foreboding, the audience can almost be lulled into a false sense of security that everything will be OK...<br/><br/>And that is when the fun starts! What follows is one of the most amazing, action packed couple of hours of horror, blood and gore that audiences have been exposed to in the past couple of years. This film delivers where recent zombie exploits (28 Days Later, Undead, Resident Evil) have failed to. For a start, we see the 'disease' spread. The footage that depicts the spread of the mayhem is AMAZING - look out for the awesome aerial shots! And have I mentioned that these zombies are FAST and totally relentless, drawn to the living like bees to honey? They aren't incredibly smart, but what they lack in intelligence they make up for in determination, speed and their incredible ugliness (kudos to the make up team). <br/><br/>Our heroine joins with other survivors, taking refuge at the local mall (all of those stores at their disposal - how sensible of them!) which was locked and somehow remained almost free of infection. One of the many highlights of this film is its ability to make the seamless switch from absolute horror to hilarious comedy, as our heroes make light of their situation; running amok in the mall (as you would!) and playing zombie celebrity shoot-out with the owner of a neighboring store. <br/><br/>There are definite problems with the introduction of characters, as other survivors join our original five. It is hard to keep track of faces, let alone all of their names and relationships to each other. However, to the actors' credit, and because of the nature of the script, the audience feels for these people, no matter how shallow, or one-dimensional they are, because they have lost all that they know; family, friends, everything to this zombie plague.<br/><br/>This film is sharp, fast-paced and well made (especially considering the director's previous credit is 'Scooby Doo'). The score and soundtrack are extremely cool, as are the opening and closing credits, and the film's ending is one of the most original I have seen in years. It is something that horror fans are going to want to see on the big screen; the explosive special effects and cool action scenes aren't going to come across as well on the small screen. <br/><br/>Not everyone will love this film, it is bloody and relentless, but if action packed horror is your genre of choice (or if you have ever dreamed of having a mall at your disposal), I recommend Dawn of the Dead... Go, go see it now!"

And those are just some of the minor characters!<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a bang, a very good high speed impact of a van t-boning a car then careening off the highway into a parking lot and exploding - seen from a helicopter shot. Excellent!<br/><br/>I loved the ending during the credits as told by the flashing movie camera - that no matter where you go, no matter how far you run, you can't escape hell on earth!<br/><br/>I loved the music too - it was entirely appropriate! I LOVED the old Johnny Cash song! Unlike other comments I found the music was more than just mood or background. It conveyed the story as much as the actors did!<br/><br/>The movie is extremely fast paced and exciting, never a dull moment except for the strategically placed mundane life to let your nerves calm down enough to get them recharged by the next rushing zombie attack.<br/><br/>The Zombies are fast! Stupid but fast! I thought the scenes in the armored buses was great! The zombies swarmed them and almost pulled them over - a totally unexpected development for the characters! That's good...<br/><br/>An excellent Zombie flick - not polluted with false humor or inane stupid characters. The characters are actually TRYING to survive, but are somewhat ill equipped or prepared to do so. An excellent social commentary. When they try the fancy ""Hollywood"" ideas, those fail miserably and they lose more of their limited numbers. Success and survival is found with sacrifice and hard work, not fancy movie ideas or easy ways out."

","First of all, I agree this film is a 9/10 effort. I haven't seen the original so I cannot compare, but I would put this movie up there with other horror movie greats like 28 Days later. The intro sequence is so absolutely haunting and apocalyptic, it sets up the rest of the movie perfectly without needing to constantly cut away from the characters and explain what was going on elsewhere.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there are a few lapses in believability such as the characters knowing exactly which boat to pick when they finally get to the Mariner - however this can be forgiven as a this is a zombie movie - the story already requires your suspension of disbelief to work at all.<br/><br/>My favourite touch was the hilarious mall 'muzak' which featured wildly inappropriate background tunes playing over the PA system - songs such as ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" as they first enter the mall, and later after they (stupidly) split up, it changes to ""Don't Wanna Be By Myself "" ... plus a few others. It's little touches like these that make the movie so good, in my opinion.<br/><br/>There are two sex scenes I can remember - the first is a romantic scene with the central nurse character and her man, seen through a shower screen - tame enough in any MA 15+ movie - with another sex scene suddenly popping up later in the movie. It goes for all of five seconds, and although it is quite graphic, I cannot agree with the assertion of some other reviewers that somehow on screen sex is disturbing and unacceptable, because the violence in this movie - such as dead children ripping out peoples throats, spikes getting stuck through peoples heads, heads exploding etc - has to be seen as far worse. You can't condemn the sex without condemning the violence, and since you know that there's going to have to be violence in a horror film, there's no point whining about that tiny bit of sex.<br/><br/>A little sex never hurt anybody; violence on the other hand is painful, cruel and inhumane."

","The original ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a masterpiece, one of the greatest horror movies of all time. This remake of ""Dawn"" is not as good, but how could it ever be? I'm not familiar with director Zack Snyder, but no doubt he did his homework on 70's horror films and studied the Romero picture countless of times.<br/><br/>The saturated colors, camera speeds and bloody violence pay homage to those movies. There's also a rather inspired use of Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" during the opening title sequence. Like the original film, a number of survivors find a safe haven in a huge shopping mall. They have their fun in it, but soon it becomes clear to leave the party behind.<br/><br/>There's a nasty sequence involving a pregnant zombie woman. The scene in which a survivor uses a sniper rifle to blow the heads off the undead is demented. And the climax in which the living attempt to escape in armored buses works well. In fact, the picture is a good exercise in style, visceral thrills, horror and pacing. Zombies don't just drag their feet and groan in this remake, they run in record speed.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, it's not a masterpiece, but this is a good horror movie for the MTV audience. Once the action gets going, it's fast-paced and intense. Grade: B    <br/><br/>P.S. Why Universal Studios would release this film and yet axe the equally bloody ""House of 1000 Corpses"" from their lineup is far beyond me."

They could have even attempted to kill the entire crowd of zombies BEFORE leaving the safety of the building.<br/><br/>It takes them an awful long time to work out that the head shot puts down a zombie, logically when you start shooting at a zombie approaching you with your semi-auto weapon you would after finding torso impacts worthless would go for the head.<br/><br/>Places like Cruise ships and Military vessels at sea wouldn't be infected at all as they would both lack dead bodies and the contact with a zombie.<br/><br/>Why didn't anyone think to go the Pharmacy in the Crossroads Mall and get a lot of antibiotics and give them to the bite victims before they turned until they found something that worked.<br/><br/>The Buses.... where to begin.

","Not having seen the original DOTD, but having seen the originals of the other two episodes, I thought I might give this remake a try. I knew the basic plot of a bunch of civilians getting trapped in a shopping mall by a horde of zombies, but that was about it. So I thought that on a night where theatre admission is $10 for two, I'd go and check it out.<br/><br/>Like a lot of remakes, or modern films in general, have both good and bad points. The good points stand out more in this case than the bad. You can stop reading now if you want to be kept in suspense about some story elements.<br/><br/>The good points:<br/><br/>* Ving Rhames does the military-man-caught-in-extraordinary-situation bit very well. He is the glue that holds together the rest of the cast. He is, in fact, the only one that stands out. Why they don't give this man more leading roles is beyond me.<br/><br/>* Sarah Polley does the ordinary woman part extremely well. The stages of shock, denial, and bitter acceptance were well-caught here. She is probably the only cast member in this piece who doesn't go through all of these stages of development within five minutes.<br/><br/>* The decision to drop the use of zombie dogs from the film was a good one. The original Dead trilogy was more of a comment about humanity, and the only series that has made mutant/zombie animals work well would be the Resident Evil games.<br/><br/>* Mekhi Phifer managed to play the ""black surburbanite hood"" stereotype without being annoying or boring. That takes some effort.<br/><br/>* The ""humour"" was kept appropriate both in level and timing, instead of being wedged in there like a turd into a pool filter exhaust. Peter Jackson could learn a thing or two from the writer and director of this remake.<br/><br/>The bad points:<br/><br/>* The zombies are shown running as fast as a bus or, worse yet, a sedan. This might quicken the pace of action sequences, but it takes away the creativity of setups. I know of few, if any, other zombie films that have done this, and I suspect that is for good reason.<br/><br/>* The human tension element was mostly absent. Apart from the birth sequence and the initial moments with the mall security guards, the tension of the situation was undermined by how cooperative the living turned out to be.<br/><br/>* The film obviously relies upon the original Dead trilogy for its story to be clear. A lot of references to events in Night Of The Living Dead are thrown in willy-nilly, and the rules as to how one becomes a zombie are not spelled out enough. The original makes it very clear that any kind of death is sufficient, whereas this version implies that one has to be bitten (yes, specifically bitten) by the zombies. A few minutes somewhere in this film to set the ground rules, instead of relying on the audience to know them from previous zombie films, would have helped a lot.<br/><br/>* Explaining why the army helicopter simply passes the heroes by would have been a big help, too.<br/><br/>* Leaving the ending to the imagination, rather the summing up what happens to our heroes during the credits, would have been much more effective. A simple shot of them floating out in the ocean, wondering where they can go, would have been far more effective.<br/><br/>All in all, this is not the worst film I have ever seen, but it isn't going to replace the original Dead films. Still, it is better than some modernisations I could name. As a zombie film, it gets 7 out of ten. As a general film where the normal rules apply, I'd rate it at about 5, but it is entertaining for most of its running length, which is more than I can say for a lot of other films that receive more acclaim."

","I'm writing this review after just having come from seeing ""Dawn"" at the cinemas. Originally when I heard about this remake of the 1978 George A Romero film (which I haven't seen yet but am very eager to) I wasn't all that keen as many of today's horror flicks, especially a lot of the remakes, often come up lacking. However, after I read a pretty good review of this film in a newspaper, and given my fondness for zombie flicks, I ended up getting pretty excited about it and decided to check it out. While this movie wasn't up to the standard of another recent zombie flick, the excellent ""28 Days Later"", it certainly had some redeeming features, that set it a cut above the rest of most modern horror flicks. First of all, there was no boring opening sequence that slowly eases the audience into a feeling of dread, as soon as the flick began, there was an immediate feeling that it could be any minute that a zombie would jump out and all hell would break loose. Also, the zombies rated fairly highly with me. Even though the style of extremely rapid and ferocious zombies (rather than slow and dull, which was the case in the older zombie flicks) was most probably borrowed from 28 DAYS, the filmmakers were very wise to use fast zombies, because, quite simply, fast zombies are much scarier than slow zombies, and, to their credit, the filmmakers do succeed in making scary zombies. **SPOILER AHEAD!!**...I thought the sequence after Ana escapes from her house, where her husband, who has become infected, tries to attack her, were particularly good. I love the way there is utter chaos outside, while Ana tries to escape in her car. Cars crashing into each other, people turning against each other, zombies chasing people left right and centre make the whole thing less choreographed and more realistic, like a sudden warzone in a suburban area.**SPOILER END!!** Regarding the human characters, most were likable enough if a little dull. The characters were pretty typically, and there wasn't much in the way of character development. From about half way through the movie onwards, the movie was a bit more boring but still had some very enjoyable moments. Overall, the movies action scenes and the LOOK of the action and the zombies was very good, the characters were average and the scares were pretty decent."

","After the poor ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake, I didn't really dare to expect much from this film. In addition, Romero's original is one of the best horror films ever made, so how could any remake hope to come close to matching that?<br/><br/>Well, the answer is, of course, that it simply cannot be done. So director Snyder does the only right thing instead: he doesn't even try. Dawn of the Dead '04 is based only loosely on the original, and it's ditched all the criticism of commercialism and discussions of racism and ignorance from the original (contemporary audiences probably wouldn't be able to understand them anyway). But that doesn't really matter, because this film has its own merits: it's a brilliant throwback to the times when horror movies genuinely were shocking. Dawn of the Dead is bloody, cruel and nihilistic, even genuinely scary at times. The movie moves along at a well developed pace, so that while the story doesn't really make all that much sense at times, one generally feels willing to ignore any minor problems. <br/><br/>The most annoying thing about this movie is that during the first half, there are way too many of those scenes where a character will be creeping down a dark hallway or whatever, then the music swells up towards a climax, and BOO!! out jumps the zombie. I suppose these bits were added just because certain segments of the audience expect them (so they have an excuse to grab their date to cop a feel). Thankfully, the latter half of the film eschews this most cliched of shock effects. <br/><br/>All in all, Dawn of the Dead marks the return of genuine horror movies, so if you're a horror fan, definitely checks this one out. However, if you like the ""like Beverly Hills 10210, but somebody's got a big knife"" kind of ""horror"" films, this just might be a bit much for you."

"Grifindor","Null","0","0","9 June 2004"," A remake that doesn't make you cry (but does make you scream)!! A short review...
","Zack Snyder, the director of Dawn of the Dead, turned down SWAT in order to make his first movie an 'R' rated. Obviously a fan of the genre, Snyder's first feature length is a remake that doesn't make you gag and scream pillage on the original (!!!). Based loosely around the 1978 George A. Romero (schlock-maestro of horror) classic, this version can certainly stand on its own merits. The screenplay is Romero's, tweaked by James Gunn ¬ñ this being his only meritable mention, as his present other screenplay is now haunting parents everywhere as Scooby Doo 2 ¬ñ and really does offer plenty of belly laughs along with out and out adrenalin-pumping terror. <br/><br/>The story begins with soft undertones of things to come ¬ñdisquiet is raging in the background of idyllic suburbia, and hell is unleashed before the movie title even lands on screen. Your blood is pumping while narrow escape after narrow escape is launched, and your skin tingles at the thoughts of waking up from a settled sleep to discover that the world has gone mad and, as the tag line goes, hell has overflowed onto earth. The zombies have graduated to movable frights ¬ñ they still have the familiar shuffle of the original 'Dead' trilogy, but once spying human flesh, they become more like the terrifying windmill speed demons of '28 Days Later'. They trail towards the mall en masse, and moan and drag until the scent of human flesh drives them into frenzies. Our heroes barricade themselves inside, all human stereotypes ¬ñ the jock, the kid, the tough- cookie, the hard man, the redneck, the mother, the pregnant woman (even a dog joins the foray), as zombies wage war on their prospective dinners.<br/><br/>The movie genuinely does make you jump, (stay past the credits for the ending) and the comedy/terror combination of the original does not falter ¬ñ watch out for the jazz version of 'Down with the Sickness' at a perfectly timed moment. Johnny Cash also provides a scary tune (no shock there), and the music ties in perfectly with high tension moments ¬ñ particularly a zombie chase which ends in a lift with elevator-music¬Ö'I like this song', quips a cast member. To follow his train of thought, and finish on a plaudit, 'I definitely like this movie'."

","In a nutshell, a successful horror-thriller.<br/><br/>Now that's no easy feat, as experience reminds us that so many aspiring ""horror"" movies do not even get close to scaring a single hair on you. Horror-thriller films should be what they are: to horrify and thrill. They have a narrower and more specific goal than other movie genres so they are judged on the single most important criterion: effectiveness. Dawn of the Dead fulfills this criterion well.<br/><br/>In fact, Dawn of the Dead is remarkable as a horror movie because it additionally has good character development, a believable plot (once you get pass to believing that zombies can exist and indeed are walking the earth), and UNOBTRUSIVE soundtrack which most other horror movies unfortunately lack, or many other non-horror movies lack for that matter. There is therefore not an element of forced manipulation as far as the soundtrack is concerned unlike some films of late like Troy and Van Helsing wherein you literally detect you are supposed to feel a certain emotion at a particular segment in the movie.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses are relatively unknown in this one, which is good for a horror film because some very popular ones you just can't believe will be doing horror and so distracts you, unless of course they offer gripping plot, but that's another matter.<br/><br/>Some 20 minutes into the movie, you'll begin to wonder how they might possibly sustain and prolong the story for another 60 minutes or so because the story seemed to have kicked off very prematurely. I expected the zombies to surface out on screen somewhere in the middle and they will have to work gradually before this point is reached. Remarkably again, the story kept on! How they did it you will have to watch for yourself.<br/><br/>This movie should remind you of another recent British-made horror movie ""28 Days Later"". The plot and setting are very similar but the tone and style differ significantly. 28 Days Later feel dead serious throughout and feels very heavy and dark. It does psyche you in a weird way. Dawn has more color, is traditional, and infused with some fun. Overall, neither is superior to the other however.<br/><br/>Personally, I think there are 2 endings and it's weird you can actually choose which one, and this is no DVD option. I will not describe the ending but you may wish to leave the theatre right after the screen blackens out in the end, right before the end credits roll, and that can be 'your' ending; or, you can elect to stay further and watch chopped video segments unfold in between credits and that can be another ending. (BTW, this is not the same as Return of the King's multiple but protracted endings.) Now isn't this something?"

","DAWN OF THE DEAD<br/><br/>Warning: In case you can't tell from the title, this is a ZOMBIE HORROR FLICK.<br/><br/>The story is SILLY. The dead live again to kill the living. It's a silly story.<br/><br/>SILLY.<br/><br/>Right. Now that's out of the way, any more declarations that this is a silly film are hereby forbidden.<br/><br/>Remember the classic slasher flicks of the 80s? The initial cause of the horror was always unknown. And happy endings were rare. Nothing was explained, nothing was resolved, and it didn't matter. What mattered was being scared. Watching our on-screen friends drop one by one in a satisfyingly politically-incorrect way. Enough to make us scream. It's all about adrenaline. Why do we like to be scared? It's another quirk of human nature. However, getting all philosphical would be missing the point. The point is having FUN.<br/><br/>And Dawn of the Dead is damn good fun! The kind of fun where the individual members of the audience become one, clapping and cheering at various intervals. A telling sign of this movie's satisfying and entertaining nature. And this is how it should be. It's silly (oops, I said it again), it's morally questionable, it's something we couldn't stand in real life. But up on the big screen it's a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>This film is a much-needed throwback to the original classic 80s horror films that were more about the horrific moment than any pretentious nonsense either side of it. It's an 80s flick at heart but refined with the technology of now. An exciting prospect when you think of it. Directors of the classics were restricted by the FX of their day, but this is no longer an issue. Unfortunately, many of today's directors have embraced the technology but forgotten about suspense, drama and what makes a movie fun. While perhaps not quite as pure and abstract as it's early cousins, Dawn of the Dead is fairly close and definitely one of the better horror films of recent times.<br/><br/>It does slow a little too much in the middle and there could've been more relentless chasing and terror (rather than horror), and there was one bollocks Security Guy who annoyed me, but these are minor qualms. You must remember that to make a shocking bit more shocking, you stick a quiet bit in front of it. The film opens in a hospital with a single case of the unexplainable 'virus', and then it's right into it. The disaster is given a decent scale but focuses on a small group who barricade themselves inside a shopping mall to consider their next move while building numbers of zombies intent on feeding on their flesh continually pound on the doors.<br/><br/>Besides Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction) the players are mainly unknowns (though former Max Headroom star Matt Frewer makes a distracting but enjoyable appearance), but this only serves to add credence to the story. I've always been a fan of unknown actors as their unfamiliarity strengthens the portrayal of their character. When I see Tom Hanks on the screen, I see Tom Hanks, not his character, and this does nothing to immerse me.<br/><br/>This is a remake of a classic by early horror master George Romero. I haven't seen the original, but this film certainly pays homage to the genre as it used to be before Scream came along and stuck it in front of a mirror.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead knows what it is and that's important, and for the most part, it stays wonderfully focussed. The opening and closing credits are just awesome, as is the sound design which is satisfyingly meaty and loud. The story actually ends DURING the end credits, so stay seated!<br/><br/>For the first time in a long time, I left the cinema with huge gaping grin and an exclamation: ""that rocked!""."
"supernothing","7","0","0","31 May 2004"," Nice Film, But Falls Still At Some Points
","I went into this film skeptical, judging from the content and quality of past ""zombie movies"", but this film surpassed my expectations at most times, but at times, it fell short of those same expectations. <br/><br/>The film has a nice soundtrack and overall, the sounds period. The music leaves you wondering what's going to be at the next corner, but most of the time it is nothing, leaving you wondering when something WILL happen, and you never know when so it just jumps out at you.<br/><br/>I had an epiphany tonight. I thought that all remakes of ""B-flicks"" had to have cheesy blood and skin effects. I was wrong here. The blood and gore is done near perfectly, the blood and wounds realistic and you feel how bad it would be if those events were taking place on you.<br/><br/>There is no long ""set-up"" for it, but we jump right into an interesting story that doesn't have many stale points. At times, the story does get kind of lame like a ""B-flick"", which is slow and overdone, but that doesn't prevent this movie from giving you the zombie goodness that you want.<br/><br/>One argument that I have with this film is that we never become enlightened on the origin of the zombies. It would of been nice if we could of at least known the reason the zombies were appearing. Maybe if they would of remade ""Night Of the Living Dead"" first that disappointment would not be in existence.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice movie, but has its bad parts, like any film. The acting isn't stale and stiff, and the actors fit into the characters perfectly. I'd recommend this movie for any zombie-movie-junkie, but if you're easily queased, don't see this unless you expect to cover your eyes a lot of the time.<br/><br/>John Hughes (with the assistance of Cory Darenzo)"

You at least have to give me props for checking it out on the big screen, even if it was at the cheap-o movie theater. It was $3.75 well spent! Even though the movie was kind of scratchy because i guess it's made it's rounds, I was still pretty much into it. <br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the original DOTD. I've owned it on video since high school and I've watched it a lot! So, I wanted to go into watching this remake with a clean slate. Even though I liked this remake, it did seem a lot like 28 Days Later, which I thought was better, but they are both still nothing crazily new or radical on the zombie genre [actually, I think 28 Days Later copied from the original DOTD]. <br/><br/>I don't think I'm giving too much away here (plus, if you haven't seen it yet and you're a horror fan, you're worse than me!!), but this is a warning that I might mention a couple of the killings. Anyway, the girl in the beginning who starts out as a nurse is very cute, in a girl next door kind of way. I know I recognize her from something else, but I think she is older and hotter now. Although, her husband in the beginning looks like he could be her dad. Showering with her. Creepy. I wonder what the director Zach's deal is? His directing was really cool, though. <br/><br/>I like the opening when the nurse has to escape her own house and then drives through all hell breaking lose in their suburb and the camera keeps backing up further away and you see a car crash into the gas station and it blows up. <br/><br/>Once they get trapped in the mall, I think the acting is really good, but I liked all mall stuff in the original DOTD better. But the acting and directing do lift the movie. I liked getting to know the characters and the tension of whose a zombie or not [that fat lady was so totally a zombie ¬ñ how could they not figure that one out faster?] And, I want to pay mad props to Mhiki Pfieffer for getting his name in a Enimen song and delivering a zombie baby all in the span of one year! <br/><br/>I Won't say what happens at the end [the very end] but I liked it. It was cool and wasn't like your typical Hollywood ending per se. So, in a nutshell... Too much like 28 Days Later, and nothing earth shatteringly new or fresh, but still a pretty cool movie, with good acting and directing. I say, go see it!!"

I read a review somewhere, as i'm sure some of you have too, that there are more characters introduced with no depth and you end up not caring about them. This is completely untrue, the characters have more depth and uniqueness than the original and i loved the original as well. The effects in this one are first rate and the action is awesome. The fights are loud and the explosions are even louder, the audience is in awe during the entire movie...I certainly was. The emotion received from the actors, such as Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber is extraordinary. You can feel their sadness, and their fear of what lies ahead. I was saddened in a part of the movie when the are all in the mall sitting around a huge dinner table with a smorgasbord of food, and someone asks Michael (Jake Weber) what he was best at. He responds, "" I know what I was best at, I was best at being a dad."" It was moving, really. The ending was so un-Hollywood too, they finally battle their way through a city full of zombies and reach the marina, they're at the boat...the survivors at least (Michael, Anna, Kenneth, Terry, and Terry's girlfriend). They all step on to the boat except for Michael who is untying it from the dock and they he pushes it away and Kenneth says hop on and he says, "" I can't"" and shows his arm has a bite mark on it from a previous fight. And throughout the movie he and Anna began to form a relationship of sorts, she starts crying and says ""i can help you michael, come with us"" and he says no its OK i think i'll stay here and watch the sun rise one last time. They are forced to take off and leave him there as the camera fades out on the boat sailing through the lake, you hear a gunshot from the dock.

I loved it then and the hundreds of times I saw it thereafter.  When I heard that a remake was in the works I immediately got excited, but then thought about how awful the remake of Night of the Living Dead was and got worried.  I had little to fear after all.  Although there were a million differences from the original to the remake, I loved it anyway.  Yes they story was changed.  Yes the zombies were faster.  Yes there were many more characters.  SO WHAT?????   Did it make the NOTLD remake great because they stuck to the original so closely? Hmmm, I thought you might see my point.   This was more of a new take on a classic and as such it was a lot of fun.  It had fast action, cool scares and I really had the same sense of despair and hopelessness that I did in the original.  These things were scarier and MUCH harder to deal with and I loved it!!!  My only issues are as follows: 1.  Why oh why would anyone agree to leave the mall for a boat trip to nowhere? 2.  How can one get so attached to a dog they just found that they are willing to go on a suicide mission to save him? 3.  Why oh why would anyone leave that mall for a boat trip to nowhere??? Thesee points aside, this was a great re-imaging of a classic and does not deserve all the bashing it gets on here.   How bad can a horror film be when it knocks The Passion out of first place at the box office.  Needless to say, The Passion only had one resurrection while Dawn had millions so its more bang for the buck."

As for the rest of you sicko's who know the truth, crank up the Pantera, throw in Dawn of the Dead, bust out the beer and live it up!!!!"

","As I first saw the trailer of DOTD 2004 I had a bad feeling. I've seen so many awful remakes of great movies. But this one really surprised me.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a great horror movie with thrill, style, very good art direction and perfect (very gory) special effects. The mood is spot on and gives me the same feel like the original. The music is totally diffrent than the old Goblin stuff, but it also works very well. I was glad to see some of the original crew like Ken Foree and Tom Savini. Nice touch.<br/><br/>All in all a ""must see"" not only for fans."
"erwan_ticheler","8","0","0","15 May 2004"," Excellent remake,but 1978 is superior
","SPOILERS:<br/><br/>This is an excellent remake of the 1978 horror classic,especially when you consider the trash that comes nowadays in the horror genre.I had my doubts about it because I really love the original movie and remakes are not my favorite movies.This movie proved my wrong though since the pace and storyline are very good.<br/><br/>In this comment I will compare the two movies and give my opinion on the changes and so forth: - First of all the dialogue,which is in both movies very cool although I think that the original has got the better lines and facial expressions that go with it. - Romero vs. Snyder is no contest but who knows in the future what we will hear from Snyder? The acting is superior in the original as are the characters.It is funny to see that the names of the characters have completely changed but the looks and appearances have somehow stayed intact. -The actors in the 2004 version are not famous except for the always cool Ving Rhames,inevitably he's my favorite character of the movie! It is nice to see that Zack Snyder used several actors of the original in cameo roles, there is Tom Savini(biker and make-up artist in 1978) as a sheriff,Scott H. Reiniger(Roger in 1978) as a general and Ken Foree(Peter in 1978 and my favorite character in the movie) as the televangelist.Just like Romero in 1978,Snyder also appears in his version. - Both movies have a pregnant woman in it,although I have to say that it's importance is not big in 1978 while it is very important(and gory,haha) in 2004. - What has been enhanced in the 2004 version is the intro and the end credits which are simply brilliant.While 1978 has a rather dull yet important intro 2004 begins with a bang.The end credits are really great with the video camera shootings during the credits. DON'T GO AWAY RIGHT AFTER THE MOVIE HAS FINISHED,CAUSE IT HASN'T!!! - The ending of 2004 (during the credits) is at an ""deserted"" island,in 1978 there is a conversation between out heroes and some police officers who are talking about going to such an island,just a minor detail yet it has probably been copied. - Very significant is the speed of the Zombies,as they are slow and almost slapstick like in 1978 they are very fast in 2004.Yet,the mindlessness of the Zombies remains the same in both movies and so it should be. - It has to be said that the humour in he original is superior to the remake.But has got a lot to do with the story and critical point of view of the original.Yet the scenes with Andy,who lives across the street from the mall,are really funny.Especially the ""kill the celebrity"" sequence! - The tagline of both movies ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"" is used in both movies and both times it is spoken out by Ken ""Peter"" Foree;Well done,Zack Snyder! - There is a scene in a weapons store in the 1978 version,which is very important since it provides our heroes the necessary armour.This has been copied in 2004 yet it has changed into a private weapons depot in Andy's house, Ving Rhames' buddy across the street from the mall.<br/><br/><ul><li>Both movies have the same Zombie contamination (both after bites from the Zombie).That means that also the killing of infected heroes is the same,one scene is copied although not with the same character.The scene in 1978 in which Roger becomes a Zombie has been copied in 2004 although now it has become a dirty fat woman.Yet the same camera technique and tension has been used. - The story is far better in 1978,the social comment of the original is not very present in 2004.Yet,the same mall has been used.Only in 1978 there is more attention to mass consumption (Francine about the mall:""What are they doing? Why do they come here? Stephen: Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives."") than in 2004 which is wise to some extent since the audience nowadays doesn't seem to want those comments in horror movies.I really enjoyed it though in the original,even if it takes some time to explain it visually.(the 1978 version is over 2 hours while the 2004 version is about 90 minutes long) - The soundtrack of the original is massive and really cool.The synthesizer like noise really gives an extra dimension to it and therefore I appreciate the original on this point.Yet,the ""mall muzak"" remains the same in both. - The addition in 1978 of the bikers has totally vanished in the remake. A pity since I really liked those sequences.Those were also the most gory sequences in the original and therefore also makes the original champion on that point.Of course there is some gore in the remake,but not as good and cheap as in the original. - Both movies have a ""bad"" ending which makes both movies even better than they already are,of course the original was a second edition of a trilogy while the remake stands on it's own.</li></ul><br/><br/>Two other things:I really enjoyed the ""A-Team,let's build an armoured car"" sequence.Of course Ving Rhames used the blow torch. Another funny thing for me as a Dutchman was to see the actor Jake Webber who is a complete look a like of our nation's football goalie Edwin van der Sar.<br/><br/>Overall I have to say that the remake is a great horror film and would be the greatest Zombie movies ever yet the original and ""Night of the Living Dead (1968)"" are classics in the genre and I truly love those two.Both are in my horror top 10. Still,the 2004 version is a very good movie and deserves the credit of a very crafty and exciting horror.<br/><br/>2004: 8/10<br/><br/>1978: 9/10 (currently number 73 in my all time top 100 list)"
"IMDBmurphy","8","0","0","18 May 2004"," Terrific Start, Solid Progress, Poor Ending.
","This flick opens on a surprisingly strong 9-star-level (until the opening credits) and holds at least a respectable 8-star-level until about the middle.<br/><br/>But then, incomprehensible to me, it crashes more and more often because of absolutely unnecessary foolish and imbecile actions of several characters, especially when Ana (SPOILER) get's back to Steven to fetch the boat key: Couldn't you just stand around there just a little longer, gazing at the scenery and the rapidly approaching zombie pack, could you? Hello-oo?? The consequences of her incongruous dullness at that moment made me really angry. Nothing comparable to this happened during the first half.<br/><br/>This gives the impression that the cast & crew, in the course of the making of this movie, ran out of time, money, skills, creativity and genius. Though this disappointed me a lot, it still deserves an overall 8/10 rating, since it's outstanding in spite of everything."
"fabarangan","Null","0","0","13 May 2004"," A similar but somewhat different movie from the original.
","Dawn of the Dead 2004 easily becomes one of the best dead movie I've seen after Resident Evil. I was expecting the same storyline with computer generated zombies when I read about the plans to remake it. However, I was surprised to see that the movie itself, though derived from the 1978 classic, presents a different storyline than the original and that makes the movie fresh and new.<br/><br/>I've seen the original Dawn of the Dead and I loved it so much that I've seen it 14 times (nine times when I was between 12 to 17 years old, five times between 30 and 34). The lumbering mass of living dead consuming and terrorizing people is a horrific 'what if' scenario that gives me goosebumps whenever I think of it. However, there is still a question of whether the slow moving mass of living dead could really bring down civilization? People are smart, and people adapts. So even though living dead exists, the people will find a way to bring them down first.<br/><br/>Which brings us back to Dawn of the Dead 2004. These zombies are fast! Strong and very vicious! DOTD 2004 presents a realistic view of the real zombies taking over the world. Though the directors did not include an explanation of how the zombies came about and if it is triggered by a virus or whatsoever, they did present an overview of the city where society is falling down fast.<br/><br/>The actors aren't too bad either. There were more characters here than the original and though only a few of them were given more screen time, the rest did well by becoming zombies or zombie food themselves. One I will notably mention is the fat dying woman who became a zombie in a few minutes. She has no lines, but the way she died and opened her mouth is so grotesque. You have to see it to believe it. But see it, is a must for this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me. I shook my head when I first read that they will do a remake of Dawn of the Dead, but now I'm glad that they did for this movie presents a fresh new view from the original. A true horror, suspense movie that I haven't seen from sometime.<br/><br/>Note: When you watch this movie, please take note of the scene when they were all on the top of the mall and were waving to a passing helicopter. The helicopter did not stop. Why? Because the helicopter is carrying the characters from the original Dawn of the Dead on their way to Monroe Mall. And you thought the director trashed the original story huh?"
"wneal","Null","0","0","14 May 2004"," Beware: the rules have changed
","This movie, the latest in the ""zombie genre"", is probably on e of the most intense movies I have seen in a long time. The fact that nobody seems to know what is really happening gives it a more realistic feel (and not necessarily a happy feel, either). Those who survive to congregate at the mall have each undergone a trial by fire to get there, and ""the fun is just beginning"". Television broadcast (and what radio broadcast they can find) all pretty much lead to the same conclusion- this seems to be happening everywhere, so there might not be any safe havens left (other than where they are right now- the mall). As far as the ""rules of zombie movies"" (which were pretty much established by George Romero in the original Night of the Living Dead) go,there have been some definite changes: 1.Not everyone who has ever died is being resurrected. Only those who are actually bitten are becoming zombies. 2.If someone gets killed by any means other than being bitten, that person is dead. 3.The infection is a blood-borne pathogen, so anything feeding directly off of the bloodstream of the victim is also infected (unborn children of infected mothers, in other words). 4.The infection heightens the adrenal gland's output to phenomenal levels, resulting in increased speed, enhanced strength, and single-mindedness of purpose: to feed! 5.Feeding seems to be as simple as a single bite of uninfected flesh, or a mouthful of uninfected blood. There are no absolute feeding frenzies resulting in the total dismemberment of the victim. 6.Animals are of no importance to zombies, and are, therefore, ignored. The only rule that seems to be the same is: shoot them in the head to totally stop them. The only thing I will say about the plot is: the best laid plans often go wrong (or just don't turn out exactly as planned). I did truly enjoy this movie ,and can't wait to see what these new rules spawn."

"Jim Griffin","Null","0","0","29 April 2004"," Pointless (spoilers)
","The history of cinema is littered with missed opportunities.  A great idea is let down by too small a budget.  A literate script is rewritten for popcorn-swilling idiots.  A poor cast wastes its good dialogue.  With an endless supply of films crying out for a second chance it's frustrating that Hollywood is determined to only remake its successes.  They may talk about retelling a story for a new generation, but cinema is eternal and its stories are forever available to every generation, so we know they're only interested in remaking the original film's money.<br/><br/>Here we have Dawn of the Dead, an entirely pointless remake of a film regarded as a genre classic.  As the dead rise and develop a taste for scrummy live flesh, nondescript humans with as much character as the gormless corpses take shelter in a shopping mall.  Here they fend off fatal attacks of the munchies and take a few swipes at our culture of consumerism. At least, they did in the original.  In the remake they hang out at a coffee place and chat.<br/><br/>There is a staggering lack of atmosphere.  Here we find ourselves surrounded by death, by walking corpses wanting to tear us apart, and there is no tension, no eeriness, no suspense.  If it weren't for the gallons of blood you'd have no idea you were watching a horror film at all.  Shot as an action movie, played as if you adjust to a plague of zombies after ten minutes, it's astounding that a film with this much gore and this strong an idea can be so dull.<br/><br/>Its characters are three-dimensional, realistic and well rounded in some kind of mirror universe where hot snow falls up.  In ours they're pitifully underwritten.  One guy is Surly, one is Sarcastic, one is Pretty Decent. The others are Nothing At All.  They apparently have names.  Mekhi Phifer, a natural charmer and one of the few good points of ER's shark-jumping later seasons, is wasted here in a nothing role and a silly and predictable subplot.  Character development only comes in the form of montage.  I slipped out of the cinema to the bathroom, and when I came back the mean guy was nice and most of the cast had paired off!  The idea that we're supposed to care about these nobodies, hope they don't get munched on and make it to the end credits alive is ridiculous.  It's like trying to be emotionally attached to a chair or a bucket.<br/><br/>The original film had a degree of intelligence not often found in horror films, and it's certainly nowhere to be found in its remake.  The shots of zombies stumbling around a shopping mall while muzak and taped announcements play unheard were priceless.  The lead characters' gluttony and gradual loss of interest in living a meaningful life in place of their consumer paradise was an interesting (if over-praised) point.  In this remake the satire is lost.  Of course it's lost.  The mall is just a location, a background on which blood will splatter, and your brain won't have to worry about thinking anything beyond `That looks cool.'  There might be an attempt at satire in the brief scene where a security guard gormlessly plonks himself down in front of a TV instead of taking care of the zombie problem, but if that makes any point at all it was probably just an accident.  The film's irrelevance and poor sense of social commentary is further exposed when you realise that a mysterious virus is killing people all over the country - possibly all over the world - and the word `terrorism' isn't spoken once, even to dismiss the idea.  In The Day the Earth Stood Still there is a conversation where an American family wonder if the little green men are actually big, Red and earthbound.  It's a throwaway moment that points to the paranoia of the time.  No such intelligence here.<br/><br/>The only areas in which the remake surpasses the original are the visual effects and the zombies themselves.  Here they are animalistic, predatory, consistent in their strength and speed, and actually able to run.  These changes make for more formidable opponents, but the increased threat is not matched by increased tension.  And it's strange that, despite Mr Computer giving us shots of cities on fire and thousands of zombies lining the streets, there is a lesser sense of apocalypse than in the small-scale original.<br/><br/>This isn't a film that needed to be made.  It adds precisely nothing to the legacy of the franchise.  It won't be remembered.  The history of cinema will be no richer for it.  And meanwhile more opportunities are being missed.  More good ideas are being cut by a low budget, more scripts are being dumbed-down, more dialogue is being wasted, and no second chance will come for these films because remaking them won't guarantee a good opening weekend."

","Refitting the anti-consumerist messages of the old Dawn of the Dead to fit the jumpy, hyperkinetic, action packed template of recent horror action exercises (even stealing increased zombie speed and a certain graininess from 28 Days Later) turns out not to have been such a bad idea after all. Of course, grabbing from the most able and/ or typically underrated of b-list actors (Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, Mekhi Pfifer and Jake Weber from TV's American Gothic) and keeping a keen focus on the characters of this remake doesn't hurt either.  Rookie feature director Zack Snyder ably exploits a witty, canny rewrite of George Romero's classic of Zombie holocaust run amok in and around a shopping mall.  The look here is less day-glo than the frequently well lit gore of 1978's Dawn, but cinematographer Matthew Leonetti is put to much better use with his dark frames here than in the reprehensible ""The Butterfly Effect.""  Action packed, intelligent and daring to be downbeat."
"CitizenCaine","7","0","0","1 May 2004"," When There's No More Room In Hell...
","The dead will walk the Earth...over my dead body! Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Mekhi Phifer lead the cast in this re-imagining of George A. Romero's horror classic: Dawn Of The Dead. I say re-imagining; because, any attempt to classify this film as a remake would be inaccurate. Aside from cameos by original ""Dead"" actors, a few in-jokes related to the original ""Dead"", the shopping mall setting, and the title, this film is its own entity. After an intense beginning full of horrifying images, the film settles into ""introduce the motley band of characters"" mode. A nurse, police officer, young interracial couple, mall security with little men syndrome, and a few others are thrown together in order to build up the zombie fodder numbers. We don't really know who is going to get it next or why. The film is absent of the social commentary that Romero's film contained, but there's a terrific scenario involving a rooftop sniper trying to survive that reduces normal human beings to mindless, non-discriminating perpetrators of equally bloodthirsty violence. I doubt whether the writer or director intended this scenario to have any effect beyond the comical one it had. The film contains a few other welcome scenes of grotesque humor as well, mostly in the middle third of the film. The film picks up again when the survivors decide that they must flee before becoming zombie stew. The film contains several extremely intense scenes of graphic gore and violence in the last third of it. It seems like nearly every object becomes a potential weapon in this film besides the wide assortment of guns and ammunition: An ax, a croquet mallet, and the horror film staple, a chainsaw. The film is supposedly set in a fictional town near Milwaukee, but it was obviously filmed elsewhere. Aside from the Wisconsin license plate on a car in the early part of the movie and a media news brief, there is nothing else that I saw that places the film in Wisconsin. Most of the movie was actually made in the Canadian substitute for the Midwest these days: Ontario. The film bears more than a passing resemblance to the recent 28 Days Later, but it stands on its own merits. There are too sudden character transformations and a few plot holes, like how did they know which boat to run to near the end? However, this film will satisfy most horror fans out there. Stay tuned through the closing credits. *** of 4 stars."

I actually wanted to see Shaun of the Dead, but it wasn't available.<br/><br/>Because I haven't ever seen the first one, I'm not going to be all judgmental about which film is superior.  I really enjoyed this one.  It was tense, funny, sad, gory and exciting all in turn.  And it didn't leave you chance to breathe between each incident.  OK, a lot of it was terribly predictable, but the agony it made you go through before you saw it happen made up for that - i am, of course, referring to the zombie mummy and baby incident.  Plus all the stuff with the annoying girl and her stupid dog was rather irritating, but not overwhelmingly so.  <br/><br/>The whole zombie thing is rather interesting though, isn't it?

","Greetings, zombie fans<br/><br/>***warning some spoilers (in all 3 sizes-small, medium & big) through out the text*** First, I am a DOWN-STRAIGHT DRUNK movieholic (lol) in general (being horror one of my beloved genres). I don't tend to become excite when a remake of a movie is in works (mostly from a classic movie), and certainly when it's a Hollywood remake (you have permission to fear the result).but.now and then, some remakes are quite good. In fact, some (like The Thing that's one of my favorite movies of all time!) warp pass the original. I am not saying that Dawn of 2004 is better than Dawn of 1978, because each movie as it's own thing going on. Well, this review and tender love is about Dawn 2004, so I will focus more on it. But I have to admit that in some things, new Dawn surpasses the original (makeup, editing, action scenes, lightning, cameos, and more departments - of course that bigger budget and things that we can use in recent years heighten in it too). Perhaps you don't agree with me but the stories of both are strong for a zombie movie and in both the interactions are top notch (of course it's easy with the 78 version because it's only four characters) And don't having the same satires in new Dawn doesn't make it a bad movie, on the contrary. The story of the original is centered in only four characters and the running time is bigger, in this one the story have more survivors and the running time is smaller.but I thought that the characters in this one were well built (not all characters have deepness but some), and if you pay attention it's the tidbits of dialogue, face expressions, actions and choices of everyone and so on that deliver the profundity of each. I know that everyone has is opinions but another thing that always bothers me (specially in this kinds of movies is that many times people start saying that `characters are flat' or `only meat to be eaten' but that's not that linear: 1) it's a zombie movie and a survival movie at the same time and we don't expect to see people reciting Shakespeare or saying `oh, I need t tell the story of my life for viewers to see that I have so much deepness that I am a walking sized black hole of development'; 2) you have to imagine if you were in the same situation, so many of the dialogues and actions would be the same or similar in many areas and events happening (you would want to search for your brother, if you were in a shop you would want to try a bunch of clothes, have fun playing videogames, etc); 3) there aren't clich√É¬©s in this movie because in real life cops, nurses, family man, pregnant lady, or even a circus clown could be among the survivors; 4) don't think that in an `end of the World' situation all the survivors will be heroes or good persons or even remain united, people change for good or worse as in all real life circumstances (many times people say about a movie `why the goody soldier gone berserker and attacked the old lady?', couldn't that happen in real life too? - the movie effectively shows that a future family father can gone crazy and a apparently asshole dude can sacrifice himself to save lives or even a bad person can remain a bad person); 5) remember again, the running time on this one is smaller and if the movie was all character development that would turn out to be zombie drama starring zombie `Burt Reynolds' wanna-be as the father of four tiny zombies (you have to imagine that they talked and interacted more than we saw in the screen - as what happens with every movie, ex: in LOTR you can't actually compute that all the times that Aragorn talked with Legolas were the ones that we saw them on screen); 6) did I forget to mentioned that's a zombie movie for crying out loud? (saying that doesn't mean that the movie itself don't have drama or comedy, and all that - in fact it possesses big doses of those too, and thank God for that). The speedy zombies: well, I already saw many zombie movies and practically in all of them the undead are clumsy and slow, in this one they are not and that's not either a bad thing.I though the zombies in this one were a lot more scarier and menacing than the ones in the original and others zombie movies (Zombie, Brain Dead, RE, Day, Nights, City of the Living Dead, Return, etc).hey, I can live with slow zombs and fast zombs, so what? The already tired comparison between the fasty zombs and fasty infected in 28 Days Later (both have terrifying freaky hombres) that many people insist: first, the infected are not zombs and because the ones in Dawn 2004 are similar to the ones in 28 Days doesn't mean that they ripped it off (it's not like this `for now on all the future movies that have wire-fu fights are rip offs of Matrix'). 28 Days Later is one of my favorite movies too and has more character development (again focused in few characters) than Dawn 2004 but Dawn is so much great in all (even the timing of character development's insertion is great) that I almost can put that in the same pedestal. About the actors & characters: first, Ving Rhames is one of my favorite actors (he has a strong presence in any movie, both physically and psychologically - as someone already told, I too can see him peal potatoes for 2 hours and sill be mesmerized by him), and he's perfect in this movie (the character was made for him) and he shows a sure and calm presence throughout the movie (the coolness and badass presence emerges many times too). He's like a big sentimental guy in a cop uniform. The chemistry between him and Andy (a distant interaction because Kenneth is in the mall and Andy is in his own store, so the communication between them is restricted to binoculars and writing signs) is an odd but true friendship both sad and endearing.but even that doesn't stop Kenneth to shoot him when he turns zombie. I saw few movies with Sarah Polley (Dawn and Go) but I building a love for her.she is amazing (the look and the emotions are beautiful in her) as the nurse of the band., Ana. Jake Weber as straight caring guy called Michael was profound and he carried many great dramatic moments. He was like the worried father of them all. Mekhi Phifer as Andre, future family man, is very good too and his obsession to `built a family in a mad World' (doesn't bother him if his family develops a hunger of human flesh) shows that people change to worse sometimes. I wanted more screen time of him. Michael Kelly as CJ stunned me in a good way, I thought he was an all-out bastard but that was not exactly right. His line in the elevator (lol) is one of my favorite moments in movie history. All the others actors (secondary and such) were all also very good in their characters (even the ones that I didn't know much about, such as Monica, Norma, etc). The character that engulfs the others is the Cross Roads Mall (the name says everything because all the survivors came from different places and are different as individuals). It can be cozy and/or threatening. There are many fantastic moments in this movie such as the celebrity target practice, the birth scene (the baby could have been a little better), the truck escape, the visit in Andy's gun store, the chaotic opening and many many more. Almost ZERO negative things about this movie, but I felt that the movie could be much longer, more things to happen, and consequently more interaction and character development, action, suspense, horror, drama, and so forth. Action pieces (different environments and weapons); lightning (light & darkness, the prove that lanterns are very handy); music (all the soundtracks are amazing and fit the movie's tune, specially the Johnny Cash music); cinematography (great); art design & art direction (the dread trucks are a mean-deadly running machine and a fortress even against hordes of zombies); special effects & visual effects (great great); sound (great); costume (great); make-up (some freakishly zombies with bloody cream on top - excellent work people); gore (heads exploding, necks being munched, inclusion of pointy instruments in various body parts, shot wounds, chainsaw mayhem, etc, did I need to say more?) are thumbs UP. The cameos (alive and inorganic ones) are more than welcome: Ken Foree as a priest says his famous line is superb, Tom Savini as a tough cop is very funny, Scott Reiniger as The General is worth big time. The inorganic that I spotted are the cameo of Gayle Ross as a cloth store's name and the helicopter from the original giving a little screen flight. In the movie, I was like one of them.among the survivors.feeling what they fell, sweating as they run, enjoying life when I could, and fighting for my life as they fight, and so on. The final is so bleak an unnerved as the original, even more so because we know the last survivors suffers one more zombie attack and we are left thinking if someone escaped or not (in the end of the original the two survivors fly to an unknown fate with little supplies but doesn't end with them being attacked). But one thing is sure, Chips the dog surely survived the zombies.and me being a big animal lover I was cheering for him too. So, did I like the movie? No, I loved it (I already seen it twice - and will definitely have it in DVD). I recommend for everyone to see it, even non-zombie fans or non-horror fans. Who knows, maybe the movie can bring more zombie adepts to our much-loved genre. As Moriarty (from AICN) says `it's a good time to be a zombie fan right now' and he's right, and this year is one great year for those `appreciators of human meat' (Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Resident Evil 2, and so on).

","Just finished watching this movie. Well, in my opinion, this movie was a really well done movie. Although I thought that the first scene was absolutely hilarious. Anyway, the movie did start very extremely fast. The makeup for the zombies was fantastic. <br/><br/>The biggest problem that I had with the film is the fact that there was absolutely no build-up whatsoever. It wasn't eerie or creepy like the first one. It pretty much just jumps right in and after that, everything moves really fast. You don't really even get time to ""bond"" with the main characters so you end up not really caring if they live or die.<br/><br/>Also, they changed the location! I know to most people, that doesn't matter at all. Other than that, it was a really fun movie. Some really great kill scenes and the zombies totally kicked ass. Some of the characters were really likable and funny and it was nice to see Tom Savini make a cameo.<br/><br/>And I don't think any movie that is supposedly remade can be called that at all. Since every director who remakes a movie wants to put there own little spin on the movie (I'm referring to Texas Chainsaw Massacre) which I loved. The only part I was really hoping to have seen in the new TCM was the part where the old grandpa guy was sucking blood outta her fingers, and well, the sledgehammer part. If you have seen the original, you will know what I am talking about. The nastiest part in that whole entire movie.<br/><br/>
Back to DOTD, good movie, it started really fast, I love the celebrity shoot-out, I loved the zombies, the ending was depressing, and it was a good take on an old movie.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."

","Throughout my time watching films, a few turkeys have crossed my path. Batman and Robin, the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the unforgettable Die Another Day to name but a few.  The 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead is right up amongst the worst of the worst.<br/><br/>I must admit that I am a fan of the original Dawn of the Dead.  Not only does it have humour and great special effects but it also has a serious message (as do the other two films in the series).  However, I won't dwell on the original film but will judge the remake of Dawn of the Dead (Dawn) on its own merits.<br/><br/>Imagine your husband and daughter have just turned into flesh-eating zombies and you have narrowly escaped being eaten by them.  I know I would be a little shaken.  Our lead character seems to get over this within a short space of time (as do all of the characters get over their own mishaps in this film).  Does the lack of emotion of characters in modern horror films highlight the de-sensitisation of the general public to violence, or are the characters just poorly written and poorly played?<br/><br/>Why do the group go to the mall?  Why do they want to go to an island?  Why does the police officer only speak in sentences of one or two words?<br/><br/>Not even the presence of a zombie baby can save this film. <br/><br/>
If you want to see a ""re-make"" of Dawn of the Dead that reflects modern society in an intelligent way, watch ""Shaun of the Dead"".<br/><br/>Imagine this scene, police officer and other pointless character enter a cinema where lots of zombies are watching the re-make of Dawn of the Dead.<br/><br/>
Character 1:  Why have they all come here? Policeman:  I don't know, memory. Character 1: You mean they think that are watching a good film. Policeman: Yeah.<br/><br/>Please, avoid this film like a fat old woman coming towards you with a bitemark in her arm."

","This is the best horror film produced by a major studio in about a decade!! Without a doubt! YEAH I SAID IT! AND I MEAN IT,TOO!  THIS REMAKE ROCKS!!! Unlike that other recent(ultimately a letdown) remake also based on a revolutionary 70's horror classic, this picture manages to be harrowing, uncompromising and audacious to the very end of the credits. Does it eclipse the carnage-laden crowning achievement that is George A. Romero's groundbreaking, oft-imitated original?  In this young man's opinion with an old school horror senseability...HELL NO! But it is a remarkable cinematic experience no matter how you slice it or dice it.  First-time feature director Zack Snyder and screen scribe James Gunn have crafted a taut, tension-filled, action packed exercise in survival horror which will continue to sear your mind long after you exit the multiplex.  The characters in DOTD 2004 may have been a sliver more than simple, but by the finale they were very effective. Kudos to the actors who solidly portrayed them.  And a round of applause for the excellent make job by FX master David Anderson. These are the best looking zombies since best zombie film of all time DAY OF THE DEAD. For moviegoers looking to hop on scary roller coaster ride or gorehounds craving to sink their sharp teeth into something bloody and raw, the new DAWN is definitely an incredible sight to see."

","Well first you have to go in understanding Dawn is part of the 'splatter' subgenre under horror. Being grotesque is by far a higher priority than scaring you, which is fine. The film has few true scares in it and the atmosphere is never really so much frightening as hopeless.<br/><br/>As a zombie movie I personally found it excellent. The 'thing' about zombies as movie villains is that they're unstoppable as a force and there's no safety in numbers, and in the end, they always win. That's very well conveyed in Dawn, which plays at times more like a documentary than a horror/suspense movie. <br/><br/>(as an aside, I also enjoy the fact that the danger to the entire group never really comes from the stupidity of one person, though as always bad decisions lead to some consequences)<br/><br/>The passage of time as hopelessness accumulates is exceptional, the use of music is incredible, and the 'feel' and pacing are rather unique. All in all as far as a quality movie goes I think it's really incredible but it never escapes its genre. If you don't see yourself enjoying even an excellent, high quality splatter movie, you can give this one a pass."

","I went into this film not expecting too much from it as the original was utterly crap, cheesy in every sense of the word. However the film took what was a great original concept and made it into the film it was destined to be. When the film began I thought it might spend the first half hour explaining how the zombies came to be, but, I was thrust right into the action about five minutes in. The very first zombie scene in the bedroom had me jumping out my chair at every second, I was astonished. The film manages to keep up it's great suspense and also throw in some great humour without making the film cheesy. I will also give you a tip for when you go to see it, do not leave right after what you think is the ending as the credits roll the real ending comes alive on the screen which I found to complete the film as the first ending was a bit too cliched and the proper ending left me wondering.

","the first time i ever got to see the original Dawn of the Dead i was 7 years old, and i absolutely loved it. the entire Dead trilogy have been some of my favourite horror films ever since. so as the remake was released not long before my 18th birthday i decided what the hell i'll go see it. i already knew that the director was probably going to make a hash of it but i was open minded and thought ""well, maybe it won't be so bad"" boy was i wrong. i know that ever since us Brit's produced 28 Days Later plenty of people (Brit's as well as Americans- i'm not going to say its only Americans) have said ""ooo cool zombie film"" if anyone paid attention 28 Days Later was not a zombie film. the whole basis of that film was that scientists had developed a virus that induced incredible rage, it did NOT turn anyone into zombies! i can understand the mistake there but when someone produces a remake of possibly one of the first zombie films, a film that set every rule about zombies, and then screws with all of the rules, i find myself unforgiving. for one thing the originals never meant to make the zombies scary, our reaction was meant to be the scary thing. we couldn't do anything to save ourselves, by the time we understood what they were we had to battle with our own beliefs and societies restrictions, and by that time we were doomed and overrun. the real thing that would destroy us would be ourselves not the undead. also any zombie film fan will know that zombies have two certain characteristics that the new director seems to forget completely. for a start zombies are slow moving creatures due to rigor mortis and muscle deteriation... second zombies work on pure instinct and eat due to instinct, they need to sustenance and aren't well known as picky eaters if its alive, moving and has meat on it, generally they'll eat it.. that includes dogs!!! in fact in several earlier zombie films there were in fact zombie dogs... i remember one character in the remake describing them as zombies when they are clearly not, if anyone recalls the news reports in the original film ""they are not cannibals... they feed only on living flesh"" a cannibal by definition must feed on its own kind, zombies don't feed on zombies. for those modern horror fans, those who are too young to remember how many wonderfully written and filmed horror b-movies there were in the 80's and prior to that you really should start watching older horror films, because personally i haven't seen a horror film in a long time that has managed to scare me and the last one that did was filmed over a decade ago. the problem with modern horror directors is that they have no concept of subtlety, you can't go for the scares every single second. which is another failing with the new film. making things jump out of nowhere, making characters so irritating that you know they'll be the ones who don't survive. for example in night of the living dead, possibly on of the best horror films i have seen to date (and i have seen most if not all) the sudden change of camera angle to the stuffed heads makes you jump and then laugh at yourself. thats how you direct a scary film.. scare, laugh, calm, laugh, cry, calm and then scare again. you don't under any circumstance scare continuously, as by the third scare the audience is bored and can see it coming ""oh no a hand grabbed that guy, phew its just his mate.. argh! a zombie at the door!"" doesn't really make for a good film... personally i think the only thing that saved the film even partly was a 30second appearance by the actor who played peter in the original so that he could say the line he made famous to begin with! a line they used as the tag for this film... in my opinion this film was a waste of time and money (¬£11.10 of it not to mention the amount the studio must've fed into this sad excuse for a film) and other than the 30 seconds i just mentioned i wish i could have that time and money back! perhaps next time i'll try to remember that modern horror films will never do justice to their predecessors."

","George A Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead is given 21st Century treatment in this cracking gore-fest from first time director Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>Hordes of zombies go on the rampage throughout Middle America, and a group of humans manage to hole themselves up in an abandoned shopping mall to avoid becoming zombie-fodder.<br/><br/>I was a bit sceptical about going to see this as zombie-movies aren't my cup of tea at all.  However, see it I did (without a previous viewing of the original) and thoroughly enjoyed it.  What makes my opinion of the remake stronger is the fact that the original was on TV a few days later!<br/><br/>
Within the first ten minutes you're given a general idea of what's going on, as the carnage and chaos spreads like wildfire around the city.  Pretty soon your reward for paying your ¬£5 or whatever is the gore: lots of it!  Oh yeah, and the action.<br/><br/>The remake has far more characters in it than the original (something like fifteen, compared to four).  As is usual in Hollywood horror movies, the number of characters in them means that predictably they will fall prey to the hordes of nasties running around the mall.  Who they will be isn't quite as predictable.<br/><br/>The remake is fast-paced and never boring, while the original dragged on and doesn't really go anywhere for a long time.  Also, the remake features zombies more along the lines of those in 28 Days Later, which aren't the shuffling, moaning, brain-chomping beasts they once were: they're faster, stronger and slightly more scary!  Plus, these new `Mk2' zombies (with new go-faster stripes!) are much more threatening and they make the film more suspenseful.  I know there is a reason for Romero's creatures to be slow and shuffling, but hoorah for the steroid-enhanced undead!<br/><br/>While the original went on into showing the characters holing themselves up in the mall for the foreseeable future, the remake has them wanting to bust out and find civilization again.  OK, so some of the acting's not great, there are a ton of clich√©s in there and the music is pretty standard fare for a horror movie (although I do love the Richard Cheese version of Disturbed's `Down With The Sickness', the original version of which chimes in at the end.  At least you can now hear what they're singing!).<br/><br/>The movie is definitely not for the faint-hearted, as the gore comes thick and fast with brains a-splattering all over the place!  And an over-enthusiastic human with a chainsaw makes for some unintended hilarity as the humans escape the zombie hordes (believe me, it IS funny! Practically the whole cinema was laughing!).<br/><br/>Four outta five stars - and definitely worth viewing is the spoof horror ""Shaun of the Dead""!"

","Good movie. Not the best but a enough to make me jump on my seat often enough. I think it's impossible to compare it to Romero's Dawn of the dead because his version and the new one fall in different categories.<br/><br/>It had to be more visual and have more plots because at the time, you didn't have that Surround Sound and state of the art FX. As most movies today, the sound as become important, more important sometimes than the dialogue. That would explain the many close ups of gun firing, door slamming, bombing, sounds of vehicles moving and other noises necessary to exploit the surround sound effects. Of course the plot is basic in many ways and is surely not very original but does not take away the claustrophobic effect and the fear among the protagonists. The main purpose of the movie is to scare us (mostly by sounds and surprising close ups) and it does right thru the end, as long as you play along with the characters and not spend your time thinking about the Romera version. One advice  : don't leave the theater BEFORE the end of the credits."

The original film is one of my all time favourites and after reading the Director's/Cast's comments i have to agree that the new ""Dawn"" cannot be compared to the 1978 classic as it is a new take on the storyline. The original is a great film because of its low budget and therefore much of the two hours 30 minutes running time time is spent on character development rather than action scenes.This also helps as more time was spent shooting empty mall scenes which gives the viewer a sense of isolation. And after all where the original grabs the imagination is that everyone would like to have an empty shopping mall to help themselves to whatever they liked from the shops therein. At one hours less running time the new ""Dawn"" is a very good thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.It is one of the best movies i have seen in a while and unless original ""Dawn"" fans take it in its own right then i am afraid they will be critical. The opening 30 minutes of society breaking down , including excellent ariel shots of the mayhem below are excellent and set the tone. It is a must see and the only critiscism i can have is it seems a bit crammed. Better editing and maybe an extra 30 minutes running time could have made it even better."

","When there's no more room in hell, Hollywood will remake a classic...completely void of any intelligence and hardly capable of any creativity.  This film relies solely on chase scenes and...well...chase scenes.  This ""re-imagining"" of the superior 1978 classic DAWN OF THE DEAD is nothing but cheap in its mindless pursuit of thrills and chills.<br/><br/>The ultimate flaw of this film is that it does not even care to treat the zombie plague as anything more than a device to have characters flee in fear.  The film completely ignores the zombie genre tradition and instead goes the route of obviously ripping-off the successful 28 DAYS LATER by making the infected run and scream.  That film at least took the zombie genre and completely reinvented it - creating an all new experience.  This film makes no such advancements.<br/><br/>I'm sorry for the harsh review. If you do not want analytical criticisms of your picture, then do not take the title of the ultimate zombie film. That picture is after all best known for its strides in atmosphere, character developments, and political/social satire - none of which appear in this remake.  In all fairness, hardly any similarities exist between these two pictures.  That's a good thing because I actually feel that I would hate this film more if it tried to emulate the original masterpiece (much like 2003's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake).<br/><br/>If this is a different film, then why work from the original 1978 George Romero screenplay and retain that title?  The only reason would be name recognition to make some cash (and of course to wound longtime horror loyalists).  Why did they have to tarnish the original's name?<br/><br/>Another serious problem with this film is its total lack of coherency. The whole film was littered with moments of inconsistency.  It is almost as if the filmmakers pondered : how can we have this group escape a barricaded shop with their only exit (one door) completely swarmed by zombies?  Hmm, I've got it!  Let's just use a cutaway and then when we come back to the survivors they are already outside and running.  Perfect!  Let's just edit their way out of trouble!<br/><br/>How do they gain entrance into the mall when its completely sealed and `shatterproof?'  Let's just cutaway to an interior department store window shattering and have the characters just stroll on in. Brilliant!  No explanation of how they got in or how zombies aren't entering the same way. Who cares about logic?  Let's just show people running and swing the camera around a lot.<br/><br/>Seriously though, the filmmakers did fail at nearly every aspect of this picture but there are two notable exceptions: the pregnancy/birth scene and the armored vans/chainsaw escape.<br/><br/>First, the pregnancy/birth scene.  All right, this was very provocative on a number of levels.  Not only was it original, but also very compelling from a dramatic/analytical standpoint.  It was not done for a mere weird/disturbing scare.  The scene was a great moment for the characters involved (it really built Mekhi Phifer's role) but it was also a statement on human nature given the abysmal events of this particular apocalypse.  Really moving.  Without a doubt - this was the highlight of the script.  Furthermore, this will most likely go into zombie movie history along with Lucio Fulci's zombie vs shark moment (1979's ZOMBIE) and Peter Jackson's zombie sex scene (1992's DEAD ALIVE) - which also spawned an offspring.  This moment is the film's only contribution to the genre.<br/><br/>Second, the armored vans escape plan (and the subsequent use of chainsaws) was a logical and brilliant move by the screenwriter.  An absolute pleasure for those horror fans more suited toward the PHANTASM and EVIL DEAD sequels.<br/><br/>Not a highlight of the film, but definitely a pleasure all its own was the brief appearance of Matt Frewer.  I almost expected his last words to be a digital stutter - for those of us who remember his MAX HEADROOM days.<br/><br/>There are also a few cameos (from the cast of the original) scattered throughout the film, but it provides only a second or two of satisfaction for fans.  A Tom Savini cameo cannot save a picture (case in point - 2001's CHILDREN OF THE LIVING DEAD) no matter how cool it might be.<br/><br/>Bottom line : the picture is a brainless blockbuster/michael bay venture that will undoubtedly be eaten up by the mindless masses of America.  Some may be happy that the zombie genre is back, but its back in the worst way. Grade D-."

","Greetings! There MAY be SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>First off I want to say that anybody who sees this movie and wants a Romero-esque zombie flick should rent something by ROMERO! I believe that Romero is a Godfather among horror movies. He IS THE MAN when it comes to zombie flicks. I also think that other films have captured zombie lightning (28 days later, Return of the Living Dead, etc...) but have not re-capitalized on the success of George. With that said I will get to the goods. This is not your fathers zombie movie. The slow shambling dead are gone and replaced by scary sprinters with bad attitudes. These zombies appear to be dead and not just painted a bluish-tint. The makeup is incredible and the film-making is polished more than your average horror movie. Sure there are some plot points that don't add up but who cares? If you can watch this and forget all about Romero and the name on the movie poster you will love this movie. If you go into it and think ""That didn't happen in the original"" you'll probably hate it. There was a comment about why they named it ""dawn of the dead"" and I partly agree with the fact they could have named it ""Dial Z for Zombie"" and it still would have been an effective horror movie, but, it wouldn't have had the big fan base wanting to see it and it wouldn't have had the name recognition that made it able to beat ""Passion"". I wouldn't recommend letting your kids see this because it is pretty gory and has brief nudity and millions of scary zombies. If my sons would have seen this they would have been sleeping with me until they turned 18. In conclusion, I think any fan of zombie horror will enjoy this movie oodles and oodles. If you liked 28 days later you will surely like this movie. regards, Matt"

","I was a bit sceptical about this when I first heard about it as remakes are usually something that I look down upon as I feel they are just aimed at the mainstream critters who have never heard of the original and they are a good cash in for the director and cast as they are digging up old material and adding there flavour to it to make some kind of improvement over the original.<br/><br/>Never the less despite Hollywood's absorbent cash in I was pleasantly surprised and entertained by the whole ordeal. This movie gets straight to the point and lets the zombie carnations out to play within the first five minutes of the film. One thing however, what's with all the fast zombies in movies at the moment? i.e. 28 days later, Chill out a bit will ya, what's wrong with sticking to traditions, zombies are slow, like a snail...a handicapped snail infact.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames as a cop? Not so sure about that. I liked Michael Kelly's character development as CJ and Sarah Polley (Ana) as the star of the show is very convincing here, it was also good to see Tom Savini making a nice little cameo here. <br/><br/>The ending could trouble some people but I felt that it was a fair establishment. Many will have natural hate in there blood at the thought of a remake of Romero's classic, naturally the film doesn't beat the original but compared to many modern day remakes I'll let this one off, now sleep my friends sleep."

","Oh yeah.  The suped up busses were from romero's idea for dead reckoning. Anyway, we're at such a loss with this movie, really.  Look, in the Dead '78, the humans found the mall--it had everything they could ever want, ever imagine ever having.  Roger, Peter, Steve, Fran became so over-satiated that they wound up becoming dead from within, dead to themselves (even more aparent in the 142 minute version).  Here, like i read somewhere else, the zombies never enter the mall--until the 3rd quarter of the movie and not because of a ""former instinct to be in a place once important to them"" it was simply to get the humans, i still can't remember their names, I think there's Mike, Ana, Luda, Ken, Andy, CJ.  but that's as much as i can remember even after the second viewing--the character's are not as descript. Dead '78 was a film lambasting the excesses of consumerisim and the gluttony it encouraged.  Dead '04 is taking a pro-consumer stance, almost blaspheming the philosophy of its paradigm (Dead '78).  because look, its rated-R, its fast-paced, almost demanding repeated viewings, its in 2:35.1 aspect ratio enabling universal to market at least 4 dvd versions:  a full-screen r-version, a full-screen unrated version, a widescreen r-version, a wide-screen unrated version, not taking into consideration a ""renegade director's cut"" possiblility.  There are over 100 dvds on my shelf in my room upstairs.  I'm a consumer.  Universal Studios with its Dead '04 wants me to buy four more dvds to fullyt experience Zach Synder's DAWN OF THE DEAD.

Naturally being such it has some gaps (hey, nobody is perfect) but what is portrayed on the screen worth it. The first 12-15 mins. and opening credits gives you a pretty good idea for what is to come (actually what is expected of a good horror movie): cool make-up and effects, grotesque action scene full with gore, some jumping moments and, of course, sex!

","One enamole that has seemed to escape the foray of modern cinema is the fact that someone could take an already magnificently executed plot and put the just right spin on it as not to come off as redundant.  You'd think with all the talented directors in Hollywood this would've happened by shear hit and miss before 2004.  But nonetheless, the art of film remaking takes a well-waited turn for the best in ""Dawn of the Dead"".  No doubt inferior than the original, (Just saying otherwise would have me condemend to the fiery depths of Movie hell with the likes of ""Fast and the Furious"", and ""Freddy Got Fingered"".) this film does stack up well next to Romero's ingenius 1978 opus of the same name.  It rivals it if you will.  This in my opinion is mainly in part of the fact that it's more or less it's own stand alone movie.  Save for the occasional exception or in-joke.  I mean when Ken Foree made his cameo and repeated his famous line from the original I literally jumped in my seat and almost wet myself. The people around me stared at me and presumaby made mental retardation jokes at me later thus destroying my faith in the movie going public but that's neither here nor there.  Anyway the bottom line is with a great remake like this finally gracing our presence the catch-22 of the whole ordeal is this will simply inspire more Hollywood remakes.  I find ""Based on a screenplay..."" to be one of those long lost credits becoming trendy again.  Well it could be worse.

'What?' you must be thinking. It has the same concepts using the Mall etc, but it does have the right to be its own film. There are a lot of new characters, new stories and it is not an exact remake of the original. After the first three minutes of the film its mainly all out action with a slow 15-20 minutes in the middle where they added a little humour which I enjoyed. The Burt Reynolds part was brilliant. Thought they could have done more with the baby. They could have at least had the little blighter bite somebody. There are a lot of positives here for the hardcore horror fans. We have a decent enough script, decent acting, decent zombies and a lot of gore factor. The chainsaw parts are very good.

","I'm a great fan of the Romero films, and own all 3 on DVD. I'm also waiting excitedly to buy the latest DOTD on DVD after having seen it at the cinema.<br/><br/>The first film is utterly different to the 'remake'. So different that it will be like owning two complimentary zombie films in my DVD collection, and it definitely won't be (and hasn't been) a case of being unable to view the old film after watching the second.<br/><br/>DOTD 2004 is an outstanding action film, with some good horror elements, and suspense, where as DOTD 1978 is more subtle and atmospheric, and more concerned with clever social satire, than with out-and-out gungho action. The latest film is a white knuckle ride like no other, but the earlier film stays in your mind long after the movie has ended, with many disturbing issues left for the viewer to mull over.<br/><br/>I don't think that DOTD 2004 is quite as successful as the first film in its portrayal of dead people coming back AS dead ghouls. I was reminded of films like 'The Exorcist' and '28 Days Later' when ever a DOTD 2004 zombie was leaping about maniacally on the screen....almost as if they were possessed by raging demons or in the throes of a viral contagion/ madness. Romero's zombies looked as if they really were dead bodies reanimated, with the lack of mobility you'd expect from a corpse that has suffered brain death and physical decay/ trauma. DOTD 2004 zombies seemed too 'fit' and capable of Olympian feats of agility and speed that were probably beyond the living person they'd replaced. Although it made for visceral hair-raising chase scenes it also added a level of implausibility to an already implausible premise.<br/><br/>It also shows how Romero's version didn't have to 'hide' behind the easier plot device of how the world was taken over by what amount to (in DOTD 2004) unstoppable foes with immense strength and savagery. In the remake, mankind really has no chance to win/ survive. The zombies are as strong/ fast as them, they outnumber them...they never sleep, have no moral compunctions to inhibit their actions. It's almost a no-brainer that everyone is going to die. In Romero's film you have slow zombies that only really succeed in vast numbers, but which can be contained if the living coordinate their attacks and help each other survive...Which is where the main difference in the films arises.<br/><br/>Romero points the finger at how ridiculous our conflicting morals are. We're avid shallow materialistic shoppers, yet cannot bring ourselves to kill/ dispose of potentially lethal corpses even when our very survival is at stake. The bikers are thoughtless anarchists who could have shared the mall with the holed-up survivors, but instead waste a golden opportunity, and even more precious lives, due to greed. But Snyder basically says 'there's this virus, so now there's all these superfast zombies, and hey, you're all going to die.'<br/><br/>But it's scary. No doubt about it. Romero gives you scares laced with the frustration that the apocalypse could have been avoided if only we'd united and nipped it in the bud at its outset. Snyder gives us the horrid realisation that his vision of the virus would absolutely catch us unprepared and leave the living with virtually no hope, almost over night.<br/><br/>The film's opening gets the enormity of the cataclysm across better than any zombie film before it. The first 9 minutes and the following credits are an absolute miracle of cinema, and deliver what DOTD 1978 probably didn't have the budget to visualise, and what 28 Days Later shied (disappointingly imho) away from in some respects...a cataclysm that horrifyingly strips the veneer away from civilized society in a shockingly short space of time.<br/><br/>The two films can (and should) co-exist, and I for one loved them both, but for very different reasons per film.<br/><br/>8/10"

","From the first 15 minutes of the film, I quickly decided the newly revamped Dawn of the Dead was my new favorite horror film. This feeling carried me to the very last moment of the credit reel. The directorial style and cinematography brilliantly blended new aspects of thriller genre camera work, basic narrative portrayal, and the same kind of old school shots found in the original version of the film. This adaptation picked up the horror where the original version left it more as subplot for the in-your-face down-your-throat satirical attempt at political statement and assult to capitalism and the blossoming consumer market. Don't get me wrong, the political aspects weren't entirely unfounded and were well thought out in some aspects. It was saturated with symbolism and hit on some major discussions of the time. My problem with it was it wasn't about the zombies! If I want political rhetoric, I'll watch an Oliver Stone flick. If I'm watching a movie entitled ""Dawn of the Dead"" I want zombies. I want ripping and eating and blood and gore and let's not forget fear for lives and too-close-for-comfort escapes.<br/><br/> The new version was full of all the aspects I crave in a good horror film. Suspense, gore, character connection, and those nice little moments where you actually pop up from your seat a bit. Honestly, I must admit I don't know what makes the original a classic but I am surely glad they decided to do the remake. Granted there were a few holes in the plot, moments that you say to yourself, ""Why the hell didn't they just do that a couple weeks ago if that was an option?"" However, I suppose that's just a constant in the horror genre. If everyone was logical not nearly as many people would be killed, situations could be better averted, and we would have no plot to unfold."

A little scary, humerous, and has a fairly decent direction. To be honest most types of horror have been done before anyway so you are scratching the bottom of the barrel for original ideas. this movie with its up-to-date slant makes it more interesting than the original.

I refused to even watch the Texas chainsaw remake as I hold the original to be one of the all time horror greats. Saying that though, i was intrigued, and felt the gorier moments of the original 'Dawn' were tainted by the unrealistic blood effects, so a gorier remake was needed. The opening 10-15 minutes were one of the most exhilarating i have ever seen and called to mind Saving Private Ryan's explosive beginning.  The action is first rate, and very rarely ceases during the whole film.  Throw in a ton of blood, multiple impalings, even more exploding zombie heads and you have a very satisfying blend.  There's even some decent comic moments, a rarity in modern day horrors and the cast all perform admirably, (especially the dude who plays CJ).  The directing is excellent for a first timer, although some ideas are taken from Danny Boyle's 28 days later.  I especially liked the end credits, (don't leave early).

I believe it stands well both on it's own and as a remake. I didn't find the movie particularly scary, although the baby scene had me going, just to see what the zombie baby would look like (insert Dead Alive reference here.) I thought the new Dawn was an excellent action movie along the same line as Aliens. The characterization was cleverly done without sticking to too many cliches. Sarah Polley's character Anna shows that ""heroine"" no longer has to mean ""tough chick."" Ving Rames was his usual badass self, his best work since 'The People Under the Stairs' (kidding.) I especially liked Michael, as played by Jake Webber, he was noble and heroic without being overly cheesy or idealistic. The moviemakers did the right thing by not trying to develop characters who only serve as window dressing. The yuppie, the hot girl, the hick, the trucker lady, the dying dad, the crying teen with the dog, and the 'other' security guards are just that, and have little pretensions about being anything more. We even have a couple changes of character, CJ the security guard starts off as a selfish, hostile asshole and eventually becomes a willing sacrifice. And Mekhi Phifer goes from a level headed, practical father-to-be to homicidal and delusional. As stated beofre, I enjoyed the action in this movie, however I would have liked to seen more gore, more 'munching' scenes. I guess they figured that the 'zombie feast' scenes are Romero's domain and are better left to him. Of course you can't have a movie called Dawn of the Dead and not have an exploding head. The zombie head in the ice chest was also a nice touch. Overall, a good movie, not just for us zombie freaks, but for the general populace. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong. -Ray"

The writers have successfully taken some of the original concepts and created a new movie from them.<br/><br/>I felt this version had a lot going for it.  It had me on the edge of my seat for much of the movie.  The suspense works well and the characters develop in ways you don't expect them too.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that the zombies are much more mobile than in previous movies (more like 28 days later than the shambling creatures from earlier movies).<br/><br/>This makes for a lot more intense scenes especially when characters are being chased.<br/><br/>I can't help feeling that if this film was not a remake people would consider it a modern classic."

","I wasn't sure if whether the original could be outdone or not. I am happy to say that this remake was totally AWESOME. The acting was great,the special effects were great and overall,I was very impressed. I am hoping that there may be a sequel to this once that all is said and done. The ending did place a little doubt in ones' mind as to what the outcome was. The updated version of how the zombies moved and carried themselves was definitely needed. The fact that the zombies moved as fast as a normal person made it even more exciting and convincing. I guarantee you that if you take it upon yourself to go and see this movie,you definitely will not be disappointed. I took a friend with me to see it who really isn't into horror flicks and science fiction,but he left the movie theater totally satisfied. He said that he couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD."

","SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>The ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake did not scare me in the slightest. For me, blood is just blood, and this amount of splatter desensitizes me after awhile.<br/><br/> One thing I certainly do not want to see ever again is someone shoot a baby. Even a zombie baby. It was absolutely despicable and breathtaking in its tastelessness and I have a high threshold for tastelessness. Hey, guys, ever hear of smothering the baby or humanely putting her to death? In fact, why kill her at all? Despite her appearance, she's still a five-minute-old baby who was apparently making no move to bite or infect anyone. She can't walk and doesn't have any teeth. What's she going to do, crawl across the floor at a terrifying speed, break down doors with her impressive newborn baby strength and kill everyone?<br/><br/> As a matter of fact, why was I even subjected to that extremely juvenile premise, which I saw coming miles away anyway? It served no purpose other than for the director to say, ""Hey, we even killed a baby. How edgy and willing to shatter taboos we are!<br/><br/> Doesn't it make you think?""<br/><br/> Of course, the dog survived, because they always do. The baby died but they couldn't kill the dog, because that would just be sick and cruel and people would be in an uproar. Killing a dog would definitely be beyond the pale. Killing a stillborn baby, on the other> hand ...<br/><br/> This movie made me think about nothing. Sure, the extremely trite theme was how consumers can be zombies. Yawn. I already knew that reading the 19 million reviews of the original and this remake established the theme again within the first 10 minutes and then did absolutely nothing to add to the premise. Worse, the movie clumsily shifted tones from horror to comedy.<br/><br/> If this director wanted to explore the idea of mindless consumers, he should have set ""Dawn of the Dead"" in a movie theater, as zombies there eagerly swallow this insipid tripe."

","Ok.  I gave this a 10 of 10 to boost its rating up from a 7.4.  This film is not perfect, but it is good.  I'd give it probably an 8 or so.  It is not like the original in terms of social commentary.  I wish it had more, but it would have needed to be 30 minutes longer.  This was an awesome action flick.<br/><br/>While some say that you dont care about the characters, I disagree.  The one blonde chick, OK, i dont know her name either.  She was hot.  Real hot. CJ was such a badass that you had to love him, Ving Rhames was awesome, and the a few others you really cared for.  And a handful you really wanted to die...Painfully... And they did.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like Zombies, guns, action, or horror, this movie is a definite must see.  Catch it in the theaters so we get a sequel!!<br/><br/>--Quickdraw--"

","When I saw this version of Dawn of the Dead of course I didn't expect this to blow away and be even better then the 1979 version of Dawn of the Dead cause hey a remake can not beat a masterpiece.  But the nontheless I still thought this version was a great movie and I enjoyed it greatly, the ending was a bit of a suprise and honestly sort of reminded me of another zombie me called well Zombie back in 1980 cause of the whole island and zombies on the island thing.  Ving Rahems, Sarah Polley, Mihkei Phifier, Jake Webber and the rest of the cast was excellent and didn't do a poor or cliche acting job as other zombie movies do often.  The violence and gore was good, but could of been more graphic and violent like the original Dawn of the Dead was, but of course the MPAA won't allow it so I understand (I guess we will have to wait for the unrated version to come on DVD lol) the fast, running zombies is a depature from the original and traditionally slow moving zombies, but we are in the 2000's now so hollywood has to conform to today's standards so the running zombies are ok.  Anyway to end my comments I do not think this movie in anyway will be nominated for an academy award, but this should certainly mark the return of the living dead or if u don't get what I'm saying the return of the zombie movies.  Now I'm just wondering if the Italians are going to remake Zombie since they made the original Zombie right after the original Dawn of the Dead was made.  Anyway from the looks of it this movie will be a huge hit as I'm writing now 4/2/2004 it grossed already $44,000,000 and still counting.  Shout out to the cast, director, and crew who made this version of Dawn of the Dead u guy's did an awesome job."

"webdesign-3","Null","0","0","2 April 2004"," Dawn of the Dead...Not a true remake, but a great film...
","Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a more brooding film that plays on the mind long after you've seen it. The atmosphere is bleaker, the actors' performances more rounded, the story layered with irony and shrewd observations on the human condition. The zombies win through sheer numbers, being slow lumbering shells of their former selves, and not raging dead athletes with frightening levels of agility, like their 2004 counterparts. They also win because mankind is too stupid to unite, too morally contradictory (example: it's wrong to kill the recently deceased to prevent the spread of the epidemic, yet it's right to be shallow and materialistic...hence shopping mall setting) to survive in a world where all the rules of wrong and right have become less complex as civilization crumbles. The incredibly savage and nimble 2004 zombies are going to win anyway, even in a one-on-one situation it seems. The biology of the zombies in the first film is more believable, and so the scariness of the zombies stays with you for longer, where as the new film's zombies scare you in the short term...like a good white knuckle ride. Romero's are more believable as actual dead things. The lack of coordination through rigor mortis and brain death of the 1978 film suggests 'zombie'. The 2004 film suggests 'demonic possession' or perhaps humans undergoing a permanent living viral madness, a la '28 Days Later.'<br/><br/>I feel that this was necessary though, because the 'shambling zombie' is now a stereotype, and the kind of subtle horror of Romero's generation is (perhaps unfortunately) out of vogue. That's not to say that DOTD 2004 doesn't scare. It's a visceral roller coaster ride that equals 28 Days Later. I'm not sure whether the concept of 'zombies' is communicated as clearly with the screaming athletic rabble of this version though...But the concept of insurmountable odds and impending death most certainly is.<br/><br/>Where DOTD 2004 improves over just about EVERY zombie film ever made, is in its effectiveness of communicating the enormity of the cataclysm...the absolute horror of the rapid decay of human civilization, and the fragility of society. The first 9 minutes, plus the ensuing credits gets the scale of the disaster across perfectly, in a way that DOTD 1978 hinted at, and 28 Days Later SEEMED to be about to do with its wonderfully edited trailers, yet ultimately failed to do.<br/><br/>The first Dawn of the Dead hints at the global apocalypse looming, with the occasional TV/ radio bulletin, shots of the rednecks gunning down zombies out in the countryside. DOTD 2004 actually delivers the goods with the stunning set pieces in the Polley's suburban estate, and then the city, and then builds on that success with a pretty standard, yet exquistely well paced gore-a-thon which takes the zombie film into a more contemporary direction.<br/><br/>A great film, but not (apart from the zombies/ people in a mall similarities) really a bonafide remake of Romero's epic. I eagerly await the DVD release. 8/10"
"MADMANMARZ","Null","0","0","4 April 2004"," Disappointing
","I have always loved horror films my whole life, always felt that they were the movies worth going out to see.  Having grown up in the late 70's and 80's, I got to see a lot of great films, including the original Dawn Of the Dead among other ""zombie movies"". It seems to me the ""zombie movie"" just is not done right anymore. I can easily name 10 MUCH better horror movies of this type. Maybe it was the annoying hand held camera shots and the way the zombies were more of like ""video game"" zombies, than walking corpses.I hated the make up effects in this film, and the cinematography made them hard to see at times. Seriously for a $26 million movie, I WAS NOT IMPRESSED. I'm easily more impressed by a good old Fulci film like ""Zombie"" or ""The Gates OF Hell"". Computer use does not work in horror movies as well as old style ""gore"" effects. Ironically, I believe Tom Savini pops up in this movie for a minute. The ""Gaylen Ross"" store in the mall was a nice touch. Gaylen Ross was  an obscure actress who starred in the original. DOTD (2004) was an overall disappointment, but this is coming from someone who has ""Zombie Lake"" and ""Dont Go In The House"" in the video collection. I have seen wayyyy to many horror movie and maybe I'm just a little biased to the old ""grind house"" cinema, more bold and uncompromising, less flashy and quickly edited. 2003 , was a decent year for horror in my opinion. SO far 2004 has been a pretty slow year for the genre and Dawn Of the Dead (2004) just does not make the grade."
"psi_fla","Null","0","0","4 April 2004"," Capable casting aids suitably scary, partly campy cult remake.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>I hereby pronounce that the remake of 1978's Dawn of the Dead is among the best of the cheap horror films that I've seen in the last few years. Slick and gory without becoming too camp, it doesn't cop out, doesn't bore and even has some wit. <br/><br/>The message of the film is simple - stop the zombies from spreading. They're everywhere! As the poster for the film says, there wasn't enough room for them in hell. And even if you do manage to escape, don't let them bite!<br/><br/>The film doesn't have the kind of character that great horror really needs, but I don't think it ever aspires to such a level. It's just a slasher film with the enemy within being zombies instead of deranged psychos, serial killers or werewolves. It has a tone reminiscent of the overlooked British werewolf flick, Dog Soldiers - that is, quite sardonic & clever, as well as genuinely chilling when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Capable casting is one of the reasons that the film works at all - during the film, you really do feel suspense and a certain degree of pity for the protagonists, even though the character-building moments seem pretty obligatory. It's especially nice to see Sarah Polley (who I haven't seen since 1999's Go) back in action, and Ving Rhames's presence is always welcome (though it's odd to see him in a low budget film).<br/><br/>OK, Dawn of the Dead is silly and unoriginal. But what would be the point of it if it wasn't at least a little of the former? All I know is, after the Wrong Turns and Michael Myers' unwelcome resurrections, you'll find this to be quite a scary surprise."
"mungflesh","7","0","0","1 April 2004"," Old vs New
","Before I say anything about the movie I'd like to add my 2cents on the old vs new argument.<br/><br/>Hold the thought that ""the old one was pants because ..."". Just bear in mind that in 20 years time people might be saying the same thing about the current one. Does that affect what you think of the movie when you see it now?<br/><br/>The original Dawn of the Dead does look lame in many ways in comparison to the remake, but how could it not on a $1.5million budget compared to however many multiples of that budget the new one cost? If a movie could be weighed on the ratio of box office takings to budget, the remake would probably have to scrape $1bn to match the original's performance.<br/><br/>Now here's what I think of the 2004 one.<br/><br/>[potential SPOILERS follow]<br/><br/>A great opening and introduction to the characters. Sfx/gore pretty impressive so far but nothing to really make me cringe. The threat of the zombies is well realised and the sense of claustrophobia as with the Romero originals is achieved very quickly.<br/><br/>Now comes the middle section full of tension and ""how are they going to get out of here"" questions arising. A few more faces get introduced. Fat woman - pretty gross.<br/><br/>Pointless bit in basement where somebody dies and then they get back upstairs. Sorry, so they've gained a dog - not pointless. Definitely better however and more concise than the really drawn out bit in DOTD 78 where David Emge plays basement zombie hide and seek for 10mins.<br/><br/>Zombie baby - sod off you're crap. Second most pointless thing after zombie vs shark scene in Lucio Fulci's imaginatively titled ""Zombie"". Oh hang on I forgot the zombie family in The Video Dead (the worst film of all time). Anyway, hate the baby - what's up next?<br/><br/>Here comes the biggest drawback of the movie so far. The disease is only spread if you're bitten. This is VERY 28 days later and really should have followed the Romero theme where the *dead* are coming back to life and not just the bitten who then died. For me, that's what was really scary in the first place because there really was no way of stopping it. People die every few seconds.<br/><br/>Now the tough blonde lady brags to shoot man after he's dead. (Sarcasm)Well I don't know, whatever could be coming later then? A suggestion: in order to achieve the unpredictability of the Romero movies you'd have to start by reversing that one and have the guy shoot the woman after *she* were dead or something. Surely it's more likely to scare people if they *don't* know what's coming?<br/><br/>Now if like me you're from the Romero school of thought and you've been used to the baddies getting their just-desserts at the hands of the hungry zombies you were probably waiting for that super-gory climax ... which never happens. Yeah they chainsaw some zombies and a poor girl gets sawed in the shoulder (the highlight of the fx for me) but no drawn out ripping to pieces of those that deserve it; no guts & organ munching for the undead. Real light snackers these Snyder zombies, always up for a quick bite but nothing more. Surprising seeing as they have so much energy.<br/><br/>The ending? It's more of a stop than an end. Not poor though.<br/><br/>Overall, I've been pretty nitpicky with the above comments but then this film *did* have the budget where DOTD 78 did not so I'm backing the underdog.<br/><br/>If you've not yet seen either then I would recommend seeing the remake first as it is definitely more current and it'd be unlikely that you would not enjoy it. Although I've not stated them, this film *does* have many good scenes and ideas and will go down as a respectable remake. However, if you're a true zombie movie fan and have seen a few low-budget movies in your time then it's gotta be the original seen first and the remake after.<br/><br/>Recommended 7.5/10"

","As a long-standing fan of the original Dawn of the Dead i was apprehensive and a little insulted to hear of news of a remake.  How dare anyone presume to remake what is in my opinion a classic movie?!<br/><br/>My initial hostility got me wondering about just how a remake could fail and i decided, to my surprise, that what made the original DotD so memorable wasn't its gory effects, convincing characters or interesting locale but its attempt at social commentary.  So jaded have i become over the past couple decades that i expected a DotD remake to be a vacuous, irrelevant Zombie effects spectacular with - ahem! - no soul.<br/><br/>How wrong i was.  What i got was not only a finely made movie with some terrific acting, effects and (notably) sound work but also a terrifying glimpse of how life might be if the infrastructures of civilisation were to collapse.  And it has left me reeling in its wake.  The remake DotD is truly disturbing...<br/><br/>Ask yourself this: ""How much do I rely on the goodwill of others and, in a crisis, how far could I honestly claim other people could rely on mine?"" and you have the terrifying question raised by this movie.<br/><br/>The central characters, of which there are three (IMO), are altrusitic archetypes: a cop, a nurse and a 'nice guy' with time for everyone.  These are the pillars of civilised society, the givers and understanders, but they soon find themselves in a situation where they are faced with selfishness, pride and fear - a sort of hell on earth, as one character observes.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, and the zombie threat grows to truly overwhelming proportions, it becomes more and more obvious that the true threat to the survival of the 'heroes' is the dependability of the people they are trapped with.  Should they admit other survivors knowing they may be 'infected', should they just bide their time and wait for a rescue they know isn't coming, should they hatch a daring escape - all of these issues are argued over with the effect that as a viewer I found myself sympathising with all views and wrestling with the fact that my own ethics and morality had become as strained as the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>Not wanting to seem trite or over-reactive, in this day of terrorist threat and tension the DotD movie does raise a very valid and frightening question which left me with a genuine sense of anxiety and dread that i hadn't felt since i was much younger and watching films like the original DotD.<br/><br/>I got what i least expected from this film, it frightened me.  But it also entertained and left me with hope for an otherwise flagging horror genre.<br/><br/>Go see it, and congratualtions to the producers."

","Yup, I would say that this is a remake worthy of the original.  Yes I know that there are people that swear by the original Romero classic, hell I myself was very apprehensive before I saw this.<br/><br/>As a fan of horror and more-so of zombie movies (Which have been too thin on the ground), this has to be the best zombie movie since the original. Better than the original?...... All I can say is decide for yourself. But as a modern day zombie movie, it has plenty of scares, gore and some good humour makes for a good watch.<br/><br/>As i have just mentioned zombie movies have been thin on the ground, but 2004 seems to be year of the zombie, with the weak and inept ""House of the Dead"", the impressive and funny looking homage that is ""Shaun of the Dead"" (Which has been getting some good reviews) ""Resident Evil Apocalypse"" which looks as if it takes off straight after the end of the first and maybe, just maybe Romero will have his ""Twilight of the dead"" out on release before the end of the year (but i doubt it).

The characters in the film are a nice mix of stereotypes - who complement each other very well while doing well not to annoy the audience. And it's good to see a bucnch of people in a horror film that actually use a bit of common sense for a change.<br/><br/>The zombies in the film are great aswell, they are still primitive but from the trailer you can see how agile they are compared to their 1978 counterparts which of course give them an extra edge that the humans have to deal with. Hats off to the Special FX and make up in the film, they do a great job, the zombies look exactly what you would expect them to be.<br/><br/>There is plenty of gore and action in the film but nothing too over the top, which is mixed in with a refreshing slice of humor aswell. The plot allows the film to build momentum, however, i think in the advent of films becoming longer it could've benefitted from an extra 30-40 mins in the middle.<br/><br/>For fellow hardcore Romero fans: i'd recommend it - good film, and theres some goodies in there for our benefit too.<br/><br/>For everyone else: Go see it, simple as because you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>My vote: 8/10"

","If you are a Dead fan then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Just about everyone reading this already knows that this is a remake of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead but beyond the title and the fact that the dead have a hankering for munching on the living the similarity (for the most part) ends there. This is an improvement over doing a scene-by-scene remake as was done for the original Night of the Living Dead. I am pleased that the producers decided to add their own interpretation of the genre.<br/><br/>Judged on its own merits this is destined to become a classic ""Dead"" movie. The Romero movies are classics, especially the first because nothing like it had ever been done before but the action, direction, make-up, and special effects of this (re-)incarnation make this film a must see. The Romero series is looking rather dated and low budget compared to what can be accomplished with the special effects these days. Do special effects and a bigger budget make a good film? Just refer to the most recent Star Wars films and you'll see that that is not the case.<br/><br/>I won't bother with the plot because, let's face it, these movies are about putting ordinary people into extraordinary situations and seeing how they respond. In that context it is easy to understand their appeal. How would you react? Would you just give up and accept your fait, would you fight back or perhaps fight your potential allies for control? This movie covers those aspects similar to how the Romero films covered them, with intelligence and insight into the human character.<br/><br/>The bottom line is if you are a fan of the Dead movies than it is worthwhile to see this in the theatre. The production values are good, the action is good, the suspense was a little lacking but overall this is one for my (Dead) dvd collection."
"fairytree","Null","0","0","2 April 2004"," Good effort
","When i first went to watch this film last weekend i was a bit sceptical after i had heard all the hype surrounding it.  I wasn't too impressed with the first opening scenes to the film, as unlike the original George A Romero trilogy the film seemed to lack the gritty and dark atmosphere they had. The story in the remake seemed to be more inventive and interesting.  I don't want to ruin too much of the story line for you so i will give you my favourite moments.  Watch out for the zombie baby, and the ample sized zombie lady!  The chainsaw scenes were also not to be missed.  These zombies were fast mothers, unlike the stiff, slow zombies that would normally blow over in a brisk breeze!  These zombies were like the ones out of ""The return of the living dead"".  The story in whole was a good balance of acting and effects and plenty of tense fear pumped into the audience, but sadly this film lacked the true zombie atmosphere.  Approximately half way through the film the story line showed the characters playing sports games, looking through telescopes on the roof and generally trying to pass the time.  These scenes were unnecessary as a zombie flick should be a bit more depressing and dark.  The zombie scenes were excellent, i was almost hanging off my chair in suspense, sadly the zombies were not as rotten and fearful as i was hoping unlike ""zombie 2"" or ""day of the dead"".   The most impressive scene was towards the end of the film when the zombies had managed to enter the mall and the remaining survivors escaped in two armoured buses, crashing through the car park gates into a sea of zombies.  There were not many gore scenes in the film, but the ones they had were nice and juicy!  As far as zombie remakes go it was a good effort.  I think for any true zombie horror fan its worth a look, but this remake is not on the same level as George A Romero and Lucio Fulci."
"steven-collins","Null","0","0","30 March 2004"," The spread of the disease worked - but . . .
","Concerning the ""spread of the disease"" and the speed of infection had to do, it seemed, with where on the body a victim was bitten. Ana's husband was bitten directly in an artery - thus all the blood - causing death quicker and infection to the Central Nervous System to take hold faster. In the case of the obese woman, she was bitten on the upper arm - so it took hours. With the pregnant victim, Luda, she was grazed on the hand - like Frank was. But Frank's bite was very deep - Luda's was not as deep. So, like with snakebite, how long it takes to make the zombie transformation is related to how long it takes the poison/virus/misc. to reach the heart and CNS. I think they were realistic with that part of the movie. But the film just was not as scary or effective as it could have been because the overwhelming feelings of dread, and boredom (which if you're in this situation you're not going to be bored,) were not realistically portrayed. This script could have done with a reading of Alas! Babylon or The Diary of Anne Frank for a little humanization in times of extreme paranoia, catastrophe and dread.<br/><br/>What we're really watching when we watch a movie like ""Dawn of The Dead"" is a morbid curiosity with Apocalyptic situations.  We want to see how we will react.  Romero's film cut's deeper than this one does due to the feelings of dread he conjures in his movie.  Those weren't addressed here as much - if not at all.  It was just as if the characters thought of the zombies as a sort of curious inconvenience, as if to say, ""Oh well the world has ended - sucks.""  That doesn't cut it - and devalues the movie as a whole.  We look to horror movies to put us in ""worst fear/situation"" situations vicariously - and hope we make it out alive or unscathed.  But more than half the journey is obtaining empathy - and this film did not accomplish that at all. And it could have - that's the disappointing part."
"trevorhart","Null","0","0","31 March 2004"," Another remake....
","another 48 million for Universal Studios.<br/><br/>Great stuff, if you like that sort of thing. Unfortunately, I don't. Hollywood has churned out yet another popcorn movie, a rehash of an idea first done by George Romero in 1978. My main problem with remakes is that they are very rarely done to express some sort of artistic license. The majority of remakes, sequels and spin offs that have come out of Hollywood in the last five or so years have all been sub-par, boring and formulaic, especially in the horror genre (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Freddy Vs Jason etc).<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is no exception. Here we get two hours of non-stop gore, sex, violence and bad language. A zombie apocalypse has wiped out the world and our heroes are trapped inside a shopping mall whilst a zombie army gathers outside waiting to eat their flesh and nibble on their nobbles. Great.<br/><br/>What made this film strong was the special effects, fast pacing, and comical lines. What made this film completely weak in every respect was that it is a remake of a really decent original horror film that has been dumbed down to include special effects, fast pacing, and comical lines.<br/><br/>
First let me get this off my chest; I know its sometimes frowned upon to look at a remake of a film and judge it as being bad simply on the basis of the original, well, that is the curse of the remake. If you are stupid enough to rehash an idea that someone has already done you are bound to get criticised because people will ALWAYS compare, and that is what I am about to do. (may be very very insignificant spoilers here)<br/><br/>First off, the remake decided to put different characters (fine) in an almost completely different situation (not so fine) with completely different style zombies (fine, i guess) and see what happens. The result is a bunch of poorly written under-developed generic characters performing ridiculous dialogue in a ridiculously stupid situation.<br/><br/>The original Dawn put four characters, who we learnt about from their actions and way of dealing with things, in a shopping mall, surrounded by SLOW zombies, shuffling about consuming material items in a barracaded shopping mall. What made the original believable and scary was the fact that even though the zombies were slow, and the four characters had almost no problem with dealing with them, the living dead were still overtaking the living. We learnt that the human race had morality issues with the dead and were hesitant in killing them (think of Miguelito from the original dawn). The original showed a nightmare situation where beaurocrats held up the human's survival, even though they had a better than average chance of sorting the problem out. That in itself is a social commentary on how the human race is too inept to work together to deal with a common threat. The remake does not have that, instead we get insanely violent zombies running around, tearing flesh from people's arms who then almost immediately turn into zombies. There is no time for any sort of analysis in this movie, its all about headshots, tearing flesh and running endlessly from zombie infestation to zombie infestation.<br/><br/>Also, we don't ever really get a chance to be scared by these so called zombies, they run around screaming and looking like variants of 28 Days Later (the filmography even changes to look like that film in the later half). They aren't terrifying, there's just a lot of them, covered in blood, screaming. Obviously Romero's stark commentary is missing from the movie, we don't ever see the zombies interact with the shopping mall, they're just outside it. What this remake has done is removed the zombies from the shopping mall, removed the characters from the shopping mall, and just thrown it together for a bunch of cheap shocks and scares that don't mean anything.<br/><br/>This movie is poor. It doesn't deserve the recognition it is getting, because it is hardly worth watching. I have seen a thousand action movies and this one just fits perfectly into the generic formular that has dogged Hollywood movies since day one. When a film is remade, it is supposed to be retold, updated for the times. This film is just a case of a wolf in sheep's clothing, on the outside it promises to deliver all the shocks, scares and rollercoaster emotion of the original, and instead gives us two hours of boring CGI effect and lots of running around using the F-Word. Great, if you like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Obviously fans of the original will see this movie, and so will all the consumers out there who swallow this **** day in and day out. It makes me angry, but not as angry as knowing that what could have potentially been a really, really great updated version of the original has now turned into an insanely inept clarification of what I have always thought about Hollywood movies."

","I recently saw this movie in the theater and I can say it was one of the better horror films I've seen in a while. There was a decent amount of suspense and quite a few moments to make your heart skip a beat. The action was good and there was plenty of in-your-face action with tons of blood and gore. This movie also had a pretty good sense of humor, which you are seeing in more and more horror movies, but this one was funny without being funny as to ruin to horror.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was the crowd at the theater I went to. The place was pretty full, which I expected, but I wish I would have waited a day or a week to see this. It seemed like every time someone killed a zombie the audience was clapping and cheering like football fans after a touchdown. I tried to count their loud clapping and cheering sessions but lost count at around 10. It's almost like they were surprised by the level of action. Anyone who knows Romero's Dead series know you'll see some intense bloody action and plenty of brains on the wall. But clapping and cheering every time a zombie loses their brains is like cheering every time a pitcher throws the ball, it's going to happen a lot. I think clapping during a movie gives you no more enjoyment of the film and can diminish the experience of those of use who just want to sit and watch the movie. So overall I would give the movie itself a B or 3 1/2 out of 5 stars and I would give my movie-going experience a D- or 1 1/2 out of 5 stars. And just remember you're at a movie, not a Metallica concert."

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>My Dad, brother and I went out to see this one. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was the first movie this year that I was really excited about seeing. Zombies, malls, Sarah Polley, it's all there! After the movie was over, we all clapped. My brother looked at us and said, ""That was absolutely terrifying!"" A day later, he was still trembling over the movie. ""Zombies. They're everywhere. Loss of control over life. Little girls attacking me. Zombies."" As for me, I wouldn't classify ""Dawn of the Dead"" as terrifying but I will say that it was one of the best flicks I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Sarah Polley and some other people head to the mall. She's having a serious zombie problem. First, they screw up her sex life when her hubby gets the zombie chomp on his neck. This happens at Dawn. A Dawn of the Dead if you will. [Note: If a strange little girl is staring at you from your bedroom door, she's probably a member of the living dead and should be killed as quickly as possible. Keep this important safety tip handy for future reference.] Then the zombies follow her to that bastion of goodness, the local mall. It's here that humanity's last hope must make their stand. Much violence follows as the hyper zombies want blood, brains and Polley. Who can blame them?<br/><br/>""Dawn of the Dead"" was a great horror movie. However, if you loved the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", you'll probably hate this one. The zombies of 2004 do a lot more running and jumping than their older versions. In fact, these people are probably more physically fit dead than they were alive. The new ""Dawn"" is more concerned with action thrills than sending any sort of message about zombie consumers. It worked for me! I prefer a more active member of the living dead. Makes them scarier if I think they can catch me.<br/><br/>""Dawn of the Dead"" hums right along and gives the audience the zombie carnage it craves. There are many fine, fine gore scenes. I won't ruin them here.  Suffice to say, you get your money's worth with this one. That's all you can ask of any movie. 8/10."

"delevar","Null","0","0","28 March 2004"," How Horror was meant to be...
","After the hype and revel and scorn that I had seen in review (even those that had not seen the film yet) I went into this flick with little expectation.  I left with the most satisfied feeling in recent memory that a horror movie actually delivered.<br/><br/>First of all, I saw the original, and the social commentary that people speak of is ridiculous.  The film is stupid.  Slow zombies are ridiculous insofar as any attempt at reasonable horror is such an uphill battle that it has yet to be done.  The idea of being eaten alive is certainly something to be queamish about, but that is where the plausibility ends.<br/><br/>In this flick, we have been given a pacing of an ""Aliens"" flick that commands our attention and doesn't release us until the bitter end.  The terror is fast and horrific on several levels.  This film catches the range of horror like no other has in history.<br/><br/>There are the scenes of taught suspense that have you bracing and begging for release.  We see the complete surrealistic apocalypse happening before our eyes.  There are scenes of dread for an overzealous hero sending themselves to certain doom.  There are plenty of scares that have us jumping in our seats.  There are scenes of emotional horror in which we sympathize with the protagonists and reel in pity and repulsion when the inevitable occurs.  We see the quintessential scenes that have the audience yelling at characters, ""DON'T DO IT!!!"" because we don't want to share in that fate. There is that LONG silence that screams and scrapes at our brains because the void inherently terrifies us all at the prospect of the unseen.  There are the scenes of complete disgust at the trauma that people (and zombies) sustain.  There is desperation in the plights and flights of our characters. Best of all, Dawn induces that horrible sinking feeling in the pit of our stomach at the futility of the situation at hand.  We are all doomed.<br/><br/>Now while many horror flicks can pull off a few of these aspects off, none have made use of all of them (though some have futily tried).  For some of these you HAVE to be able to pull off SOME character development.  Dawn used some very clever things to pull this story off. The fellow across the street atop a tiny gun shop sitting like an island afloat in a sea of ravenous death was elegant genius.  Even as the character had almost nothing to SAY in the film we were able to get to know him.  We certainly had the cursory kill-off characters, but they were far fewer than I had been led to believe. Even the girl in her tremendous stupid act of the film was understandable in the face of her recent history.  In my mind, this was pulled off adequately (though I would have liked to know how she slipped away so quickly).<br/><br/>There are also other little things that this film does to bring a film quality to it all, even if most of it was lost on the audience... the mall music playing ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" in the background was GREAT.  The coffee shop in the plaza where many ""safe"" scenes were done was aptly named ""Hallowed Grounds"".  The vanity of the news reporter in his ""last report"" (playing in the background as the characters resumed their talk in the foreground) was the social commentary that people seemed to have missed.<br/><br/>
And since so many on this board seem to put a high price on social commentary, you can take this film to be RIFE with it!  Humanity is largely made up of self-preserving creatures with a few unassuming heroes that drag us into honorable and selfless acts.  People will do dumb things for a reason.<br/><br/>The original left nothing for me when it was all said and done.  This film left my appetite completely satiated.  If you are a true fan of horror, you will love this movie."

Did anyone wonder how EVERY SINGLE shot ever fired in this film, hits a zombie square in the head? And what kind of security guards pack heat like that? I loved the Blair Witch Style for the credits, but we have been rooting for these characters the whole time, and we leave the theater with everyone dead...that kinda sucks...all that energy wasted! One change I would have liked to have made, was to extend the scene where the vans are caught in the sea of zombies. I was tense the whole time! It should have been longer rather than using the ""Jaws"" blow-up-the- propane-tank-and-kill-almost-everything-but-them technique. Also something that bothered me, maybe it can get answered...why did they paint teeth on the front of the truck. WHO CARES IF THE TRUCK LOOKS COOL, YOU ARE TRYING TO GET OUT ALIVE.

"MicktheGreat","7","0","0","30 March 2004"," Dawn of the Dead is a successful remake on most levels...
","Dawn of the Dead is a remake of Romero's earlier work of the same title. The story basically revolves around a storyline of a zombie epidemic. Fighting for their lives, a group of survivors barricade themselves inside a mall in attempts to stay alive. The group consists of a tough cop (Rhames), a nurse (Polley), a couple (Phifer & Korobkina) expecting a child, a suburbanite (Weber), a mall security guard (Kelly), and a cast of other characters.<br/><br/>-POSSIBLE SPOILERS-<br/><br/>I felt that this movie worked on most levels. I've seen the Romero original before (although it has been a few years ago) and I thought that this was just as good as the original (if not better...). I thought that the characters portrayed by Rhames and Weber were both done very well as I felt bad for those guys and felt that both of them just wanted to do the right thing. Phifer's character also has a speech in which he tells Rhames his concerns regarding the birth of his child that is briefly moving. The action is intense, the zombies are very bloodthirsty, and the story flows well for the most part.<br/><br/>My few complaints are that I thought Polley's character was under-developed. I also felt that there were a few slow spots in the movie that seemed to be there just to waste time. Also, some of the characters (notably the girl with the dog, the young security guard, and the snobby guy with the boat) are extremely annoying and for the most part serve no real purpose in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I was impressed. I typically hate most of the contemporary horror movies (from the last 10 years or so) that seem to have terrible storylines, horrible dialogue, etc. I was pleasantly surprised awhile back with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and I was pleasantly surprised with the new Dawn of the Dead. Hopefully, filmmakers will take a note from these two movies and make GOOD horror movies.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"henriennui","9","0","0","30 March 2004"," Instant classic
","I just got back from this.<br/><br/>It absolutely rocked.  I think it is the best zombie movie of all time, including the original Dawn of the Dead, although the pace was closer to Cameron than Romero.<br/><br/>I was leery of the general idea of a remake of the Romero classic, until I noticed Sarah Polley was in it.  She simply doesn't do bad movies, so her presence promised something more than just a derivative schlockfest.<br/><br/>
It masterfully combines the rollercoaster Hollywood film with the sheer creepiness of the original.  It also has enough of the light touch of the original to offset the horror enough to be just barely tolerable.<br/><br/>Additionally, the zombie makeup manages to be campy and silly and terrifying at the same time.  This is a good trick.<br/><br/>This kind of movie has to be judged with the gut, and I found myself cringing in my seat more than once.  It had a lot of similarities to 28 Days Later, but was just plain better, without the pacing problems of the last half of 28 Days.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes are superbly paced, and the situation develops with a near total lack of the stupid exposition or explanation that usually interrupts the carnage long enough to be annoying in a disaster movie. The total collapse of society is so quick that it mercifully leaves little time for stupid talking heads.  The movie dives headfirst into the absolute horror of the situation without sentimentality.<br/><br/>This also has the best opening credits I have seen since Se7en, with ""When the Man Comes Around"" by Johnny Cash setting the tone for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with scenes so rattling that the rare calm scene where little is happening is completely nerve-racking.  I still have an adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you like zombie movies, this is, in my opinion, the ultimate one.  I liked the original, but this one takes the original and kicks its ass.  My only (slight) gripe is the overuse near the end of faux-clumsy handheld-style tracking shots, but I can live with it.  The scenes in question are still paced perfectly.  I also don't have any better idea for how they could have done it.  Obviously vanilla smooth Steadicam or dolly shots would have been completely out of the question.<br/><br/>The best single performance in the film is Matt (Max Headroom) Frewer's, as a doomed zombie bite victim.  This scene includes one of the few direct Romero allusions, specifically the shot used on the most commonly seen poster for the 1978 classic.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this film is it is the perfect film to knock Mel Gibson out of the #1 spot."

","Now I admit, when my friends wanted to see this movie, I really didnt want to go with them. This movie didnt really look that entertaining, and the zombie genre has been done before. But I had nothing else to do that day, so we bought tickets to Hidalgo and snuck into Dawn Of The Dead. Now, the movie takes place in Wisconsin, and actually mentions the city where I live, and I was completely shocked. I dont think you would realize how awesome it is to hear recognition for where you live when you dont get recognized that much. The movie, although sometimes unrealistic, is overall enjoyable. It has its funny moments, and moment where you question the actors choice. Example: Why the hell would you drive through a crowd of zombies to save a dog? Stupidity as its greatest.

","The trailer for the movie was good.  Too bad the movie wasn't.  The eerie images had sensational angles, shadows, and lighting accompanied with music that matched went well during the trailer. It's a shame that we didn't see a lot of that in the movie.  It made the movie seem stylish and scary. When the film stops, melts, and the zombies try to come for the audience out of the screen, that was a pretty clever way to end the trailer.  They should have made the movie end that way, too!  Most of the scenes in the trailer were at the beginning of the movie before the opening credits.  In the movie, the director drew the viewer's attention to certain things that ended up to be insignificant.  What was the point?  Could it be to make us think it's going to have an interesting plot with twists?  Well, don't think too hard about anything that goes on because it's pointless.  Were the zombies everywhere?  How far do you have to go to get away from them?  And why did everyone end up at the mall?  Did the mall employees all turn into real zombies?  They should have put in computer generated flies around all the zombies.  Now that would have been clever!  This was supposed to be a horror movie, but it ended up more like a ""HORRORble"" drama with a few thrills thrown in during the first ten minutes."
"Mean_Joe_Weeks","Null","0","0","29 March 2004"," Ungreatful Dead
","The ungreatful dead: ""Dawn of the Dead"" 2004 remake review<br/><br/>When you remake a movie, particularly a truly classic genre film such as the original George Romero ""Dawn of the Dead"" (sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"", and occuring, as the name suggests, the morning after the night), you are faced with two somewhat bitter options: Either try to zero in on the essence of what made the original a classic, attempt to distill it, and then attempt to replicate it <i> or </i> look at the original in a broader sense, and find another aspect of its success to bring forward and focus on. Successful remakes almost inevitably have chosen to readjust the focus of the film. They correctly realize that competing with a classic, brilliant film is impossible, and that to attempt to ape its success usually comes across as derivative or just pointless. A good example would be the 1997(?) remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder"", which starred Michael Douglas and Viggo Mortessen in his first major starring role. The cast and direction were really quite excellent, and the story and script remained faithful to the original. But that was the problem: critics and audiences were bored with such a by-the-book retelling of something that had already been made perfectly. In otehr words, what's the point of even successfully immitating greatness? On the other side of the equation exists Steven Soderbergh's remake of the Rat Pack classic ""Ocean's 11"". Soderbergh steered away from the original's cynicism and celebrity-worship, instead working to create an involving and good-natured heist film, which succeeded with audiences and critics. Fortunatly for the continuing half-life of the zombie genre, the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" doesnt attempt to recreate the deft social commentary and bleak nihilism of the original. Instead, it simply tries to entertain, frighten, and compete with ""The Passion of Christ"" in terms of violence, only without such a silly plot. The plot centers around a few scattered survivors of the chaos and carnage that emerged from an urban center which suddenly has gained a plethora of inhabitants even more conversationally stunted than the yuppies that previously called it home. In addition to poor conversational skills, they crave the flesh of the living. Which poses a rather significant threat to those living who desire to keep their flesh intact. Hilarity ensues. And by hilarity, I mean vicious flesh-rending bite-related deaths. Even though the movie really can't claim to offer anything fresh to cinema (zombie movies by nature can't really diverge much from formula, and this one is a REMAKE of another zombie move) it seems content to simply deliver on the premise as much as possible, which actually ends up making it head and shoulders above most other undead flicks. The opening sequence, where mild-mannered nurse Ana (Sarah Polly, the blonde from ""Go"") without warning finds her urban paradise transformed overnight into a chaos of fire, cannibalism, and the very likely cancelation of ""Frasier"", may become something of a classic to the genre. It is impeccably executed, and really genuinely scary, with a deft realization of the outside world and a subtle but very important sense of scope. As the movie progresses, a number of other memorable scenes emerge, but none surpasses the sublime horror and careful attention to detail of the opening sequence. The movie is really quite flawlessly directed by Zack Synder, a first-time director. His sense of atmosphere serves the film beautifully, and his camerawork (much of which is tinted or saturdated), while nothing Earth-shattering, works marvelously to establish mood without being distacting. The script by dubious Hollywood writer James Gunn (""Scooby Doo"") establishes some very interesting sequences and set pieces (on in particular revolves around communicating with a gun-store owner who is trapped in his shop across the street, with what is either the Libertarain national convention or a mob of flesh-starved undead between him and the realative safty of the mall. Such sequences are unexpected pleasures with keen attention to detail, and prove essential to keeping audiences interested, particularly through the middle of the film, where the zombies take a notable backseat to some rather flismy character developement. It is unfortunate that for all the attention paid to the details of the zombies and locations, so little effort went into the characters. There are too many, first of all, so only a few even get more than a few lines on-screen. Even the ones that do suffer heavily from expositoroisis, the tragic condition wherein the victim can utter only lines of needless expository dialouge (""No! There are zombies out there!""). What little developement there is only builds characters of the most archetypical type. People leaving the theater refered to charcters as ""That trucker lady"" or ""the white guy with, you know, that funny nose""... not a strong indicator that we can sympathize much with the victims. Still, the actors, particularly Ving Rhames as the stoic policeman and Jake Weber as a former electronic salesman who becomes the makeshift leader of the group, do well in imparting a certain degree of character and humanism into a somewhat losing battle against charicature. We would certainly not be able to watch a movie just about these characters, but since the conflict is a little less specific (man vs nature, man vs undead hords) we can at least root for them by default. And after all, the original version had better developed characters, but they all, almost without exception, turned out to be completely unlikable. So, maybe we don't have to be in love with the charcters for a film like this to work. All things considered, ""Dawn of the Dead"" brings little new to the table, except a firm committment to be a serious, highly professional genre film. It falls far short, for instance, of last year's visionary and brilliant ""28 Days Later"". But its highly-focused vision pays off in the end and allows it to succeed where the vast, vast majority of movies of its ilk fail, making it almost essential viewing for the true re-animated corpse enthusiast. Even those not particularly enamored with the concept of the cravings of crusty cadavors, the film is engaging and should certainly satisfy any cravings for non-religious bloodlust or serious, focused horro r. A very light touch of black humor and some cameos by Tom Savini (make-up artist for the original ""Living Dead"" series) and Ken Foree (star or the original) should be enough to bring in those still on the borderline. And besides, you have to have a certain respect for a zombie movie that shirks the mind-numbing hardcore rap-metal that plagues most horror films these days in favor of the up-tempo, oddly haunting strains of Jonny Cash's apocalyptic classic ""The Man Comes Around"". Anyone who thinks otherwise, well, they're just, dare I say, Dead wrong."

","It has been years since I have seen the original, but this remake has inspired me to see it again.  Considering the subject matter, the dialogue holds up well under the strain of the fantastic circumstances the characters are experiencing.  The pacing is is excellent and the comic tension breakers are superb in parts.  The small crowd in the Brooklyn theater was in tune with the irony and for such a small crowd there was lots of laughing out loud.<br/><br/>The most horrifying part of the movie for me was brought home by an accident that occurs between the survivors and isn't attributable to the undead.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw was the uneven editing in the action sequences near the end of the movie (prior to the shots during the credits which one should watch until the end, btw).  The action gets choppy and it didn't feel stylistic.  There seemed to be some imitation of 28 Days Later style, but the editing to which I refer is more along the lines of our intrepid survivors being in one building and then materiallizing somewhere else.  Just seemed too much of a gap to be intentional.<br/><br/>Long story short, go see the movie and suspend that disbelief.  You'll have fun."

If you like Resident Evil, Evil Dead, or Night of the Living Dead then your going to love this! I give it 10/10."

","This year seems to be the Year of the Horror Movie Remake.  Beginning with TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE back in October, and now with DAWN OF THE DEAD, many can only imagine what other concepts are being thought up.<br/><br/>However, if any future remake has the stamina that this remake has, then the horror genre may revive itself.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is in no sense a breakthrough movie with an inventive plot.  Actually we never learn of the reason zombies exist in the first place (it is a remake of the follow up of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, where the plot is revealed).  But it is the excitement and relentlessness that this film brings about it.<br/><br/>From the fun and intense opening to the finale (which is a little predictable, I should add I have never seen the original all the way through), there is always something going on.<br/><br/>The actors in this film, while several of them have names (particularly Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pheifer), are all decent in the parts they play.  They each offer something different to the movie.<br/><br/>The message of consumerism that spawned from the first one is still used here, but not does not remain a main focus.<br/><br/>For having a great sense of style, some intense scenes, and overall fun DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) rates as a  6/10."
"marcelo-gonzalez","Null","0","0","29 March 2004"," Surprisingly good filmmaking with minimal plot and some character development
","Right off the bat, I will say DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) was an excellent surprise. This movie had all the potential of sucking off the ""teet"" of the original 1975 horror classic and last year's well-conceived 28 DAYS LATER: no matter what, DAWN would draw a crowd because the original was such a landmark film. It could have been some retread hack-thing with decayed urban locations, lots of music video quick-cutting close-ups, hot young chicks screwing and getting butchered, and a thrash punk soundtrack of the typical horror fare with good production value and still make 50 million, and the filmmakers had to know this. Well, okay, this movie had the music, the chicks, and the hacking, but it also had great storytelling. DAWN is well crafted with a good set-up, many well-realized sub-plots, and just enough character development to make the people real. DAWN is a respectable reinvention of a movie all horror fans mark on their short list of all-time great horror films. And a step further: as horror remakes go, it was not only a better movie than the lame duck 1990 NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, or the sterile boring PSYCHO with Vince Vaughn, it is the best horror remake ever made!<br/><br/>These are cheap words from an internet stranger, so let me just say I am old enough to have seen THE EXORCIST in the theatre when it first came out. Having said that, I am a pretty obsessive movie watcher with a special place in my heart for the horror genre. I find most horror movies to range from disappointing to down-right insulting because filmmakers just don't care what they put out when it comes to horror. I think they figure as long as good-looking young people get butchered up in viscerally interesting and memorable ways, most of the audience won't care about story or character. (I guess they're right because URBAND LEGEND had how many sequels?)<br/><br/>
DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) sets up really well. The world is normal with normal people, and twice we get a slight hint that something's wrong. There is a radio bulleting we don't hear and a TV newsbreak covered up with a shower scene involving the main character (Ana played by Sarah Polley). Both these hint could easily be an Iraqi war update. No big deal. Within about 18 hours of story time (15 minutes of movie time) a character we me earlier sets into motion a chain of events where Ana is thrust into survival mode, launching herself from location to location, quickly, almost mercilessly watching the entire world around her decay into utter chaos, confusion, and destruction with no clear path to safety or a logical explanation as to what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>She meets up rather quickly with the rest of the non-zombie cast and makes it into a shopping mall (the memorable location for the cannibalistic climax of the George Romero 1975 original), and it is here that the movie slows down quite a bit. The pace slows way down and the story stalls as the unbelievably horrible chain of events that disintegrate the world and all the implications grind almost to a halt. What follows is a 90 battle between zombie and humans where casualties are suffered on both sides with each new encounter. So much more could have been done here: most DAWN reviews said the movie should have made more commentary about the state of consumerism in our society with the mall as a metaphor, much like the original did. I would modernize that theme and explore how the rise of consumerism, obsession with youth, and societies polarized and fractured religious beliefs have set into motion a sudden collapse of the world more as a result of a slow degradation of the world over the last 50 years.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the bulk of the movie is still good. I especially like how Ana is given a human moment to emotionally collapse and realize all the craziness and loss around her when she gets a breather in a mall restroom. I also like the development of the relationship between Michael and gun shop owner trapped across the street from the mall and their communications on dry erase boards. The filmmakers show a lot of thoughtful reserve here where we only see the story from the point of view of the mall survivors, never getting the gun shop owner's perspective until they finally meet. This means we never see him speak unless it's coming through a walkie-talkie, and we only witness the horrible results of an excursion to get him food through the same. To me, it takes a mature vision NOT to show it all to an audience (mostly a young, attention deficit one at that) when the moment calls for it. Especially funny is a scene where the mall survivors and the gun shop owner pass the time playing a sniper killing game with the zombies that involves picking off celebrity look-a-likes.<br/><br/>The third act of this movie is the weakest part. An underdeveloped plot thread leads the survivors to leave their shelter at the mall for in hopes of sanctuary on one character's boat and some off-shore island many miles away. This is pretty much a transparent attempt to set up some gory death scenes, especially some really good ones with a chain saw. It is predictable, but also memorable fare. And don't leave during the credits. There is a Blair Witch Project-like video production sequence inner-cut with the credits which shows the fate of the surviving characters. It is what Blair Witch should have been in terms of reality horror.<br/><br/>DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) is not a perfect movie, but it is really very good. I would almost advise people to see last years very well done 28 DAYS LATER and look at this as an almost sequel to that. It surprisingly follows along very well with it as in both movies, the zombies are fairly smart and obsessively attack any non-zombie human with both speed and agility (unlike George Romero's hobbling stupid living dead). The really great thing about this movie is the filmmakers give the audience what they want with lots of creative gore and some sex, but they also step back at times and let the story unfold with a more minimalist approach. It's been a week since I saw it, and I'm still thinking about it. That says volumes. Can't wait for DAY OF THE DEAD, which is sure to follow real soon."
"owenmoney","Null","0","0","31 March 2004"," Well, it is set in a mall...
","The original Dawn of the Dead is a classic horror flick with a genuinely frightening atmosphere. This new one is a completely different film, except, of course, that there are some scenes set in a shopping mall. There are some scary scenes, but they are scary in an action-movie sense rather than a dread inducing horror-movie sense. I may be the only one who still thinks that the old-school slow zombies are more frightening than the running ones; the situation that you must appreciate as far as the slow zombies are concerned is that a false sense of confidence can be inspired in the characters because the zombies are dumb and you can out-run them. In the original Dawn, the characters who respected the sheer number of zombies and had a rational outlook concerning how to problem-solve their way out of bad situations are the ones who achieved a degree of success. In this remake, the only real problem solving is the decision to hide in a mall, which is inexplicably devoid of zombies at first, and then to build ridiculous tanks out of mall trolleys. Every evasion scene is just shoot-em up. The remake is just like the original, except stripped of all creativity and appeal. What else is wrong with the remake: character development (one of the characters you are actually supposed to care about, and I think there are only two in all, blurts out over a group dinner that he has had many jobs in life, and the worst job in his life has been as a husband and his best has been as a father. Well so what? If those are the first and last bits of significant personal information that we hear from you, why do we care about your past or your future?) All motivation in the characters seems completely alien to me. Why does that girl go after the dog (at such risk), why does the group go after her (at such risk), and another thing, how doesn't zombie Andy get her out of that closet? Also, how does the head mall security guard go from jerk to team player without a visible trigger event? And why was he such an unreasonable jerk from the beginning? Contrivance. There doesn't seem to be human logic at play in the minds of the characters. There seems to be the logic of a screenwriter who is trying to get the most out of stock characters and failing miserably, in the process omitting any human logic in an attempt to get certain character types to clash with others. I hope there was an hour or so edited from this film that will be released on the dvd so the director can explain how this tepid final product came about. Hopefully there were a lot of important things that had to be cut out, which crippled the picture. If the theater version was how the film was intended to be, then I would be completely speechless. I am not sure what Romero thinks about the remake, but if he is sane, he should just walk his fat royalties check over to the bank, set to work at publicly denouncing the remake, and then finally get another 'Dead' movie of his own out."
"andrewarkless","Null","0","0","29 March 2004"," really rather good!
","I once thought that the idea of a remake, was a cheap, lazy and unimaginative way of flogging an old product to a new audience with minimal care or effort. However the last few remakes have been surprisingly good, Ring, Texas Chain Saw Massacre and now Dawn of the Dead. I was really pleasantly surprised as to how excellent this film is.  The story was tight, the acting excellent (Ving Rhames bringing real presence) and it plays the horror straight, with non of this ironic nonsense which seemed to infect every horror film made in the 90's. Perhaps this is why the current wave of horror directors are looking back to the 70s for their inspiration. This was when horror took itself seriously and pushed the boundaries of taste and acceptability. This is what I admire about this remake of Dawn, it is not frightened of being brutal and the violence is scary. Updating it with running zombies and shooting some segments of it on handheld cameras - although probably inspired by the equally excellent 28 Days Later - brings a rawness and veracity to the film. Ok so it may lack the originals pokes at consumerism, but this doesn't detract it from being one of the more superior horror films of the last few years.  And it has to be mentioned, the choice of  Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" as the title music is a stroke of genius, completely unexpected but thoroughly appropriate.  Don't leave as the credits roll as the film has still not finished and things take another turn. In all an excellent film and shows that the long awaited renaissance in horror films may be upon us."

","There are moments in this film where you WILL lurch, gasp, shudder, and, depending on your stomach, vomit.  I was very impressed with this remake. It does not strive to regurgitate the original.  Instead what we get is a fresh and dynamic take on the original film.  In the very basic sense, the plot structure is the same:  people seek shelter from cannibalistic horror in a shopping mall.<br/><br/>However, the visual style, the acting, the characters, and the details are all different.  Whereas the original was more socially conscious, this remake seeks only to frighten and entertain.<br/><br/>If you enjoy being scared and you enjoy that intense kind of anticipation and adrenalin rush, go see it.

","As a longtime fan of the ""Dead"" series, which has stretched out for over three decades, I wasn't sure how much entertainment I was going to get for my hard earned dollar, so I did the matinee thing.  I had nothing to worry about.  This movie had comedy, drama, a little love thing goin', some gore, some tension and some very nice acting.  The undead were even much more believable than in any of the originals.  I think the running sarcasm played out among the characters set the tone for the film which help offset the well-established tension.  I really enjoyed this movie, much more than I had hoped too, which is always a great surprise.<br/><br/>Two popcorns way up!"

","The first 45 minutes of this film I was frightened, intrigued, on the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, that initial impression did not last. It wasn't long before I became, well, frankly bored with the gore. The movie became one long...entirely too long...gore-fest. I thought if I saw one more ""zombie"" with bits of brain flying from his head, I might scream. Yes, these ""zombies"" are more frightening than the leg dragging sloths of the original but how much can be done to make the story more intriguing? Evidently the makers of this movie were trying to draw in the twentysomethings because they managed to stick in a quicky boob shot with the obligatory derriere slapping, not to mention having every other word being ""f--k"".  Perhaps I am too old-fashioned."

"Magicdust29","Null","0","0","26 March 2004"," A new dawn for the turbo charged generation
","After seeing this film and then the original shortly after it certainly does breath new life into the Zombie genre. Romero had his day with the living dead walking around all docile and and easily fended off (you always wandered how really they could take over the planet). But Romero always allowed you associate them with the human situation, ie. Whos worse the remaining humans or the living dead (this idea even heightened by the excellent Day of the Dead.) The spruced up remake now has zombies that have the physical capabilities of humans such as speed, reflexes and the same flesh eating instincts as before, thus making them generally scarier and more believable should we be faced with an apocolypse of this magnetude. The opening is very effective a mention of a bite and a nurse doing her daily business blissfully unaware of what is going on. The next morning total chaos of a world ripped apart by zombies and the mayhem that ensues. After that they hit the mall. That is where the film becomes run of the mill Hollywood with the same old cliched charaters, helpless females who lose there dad and find solice in a dog. The token black man (Ving Rhames) you know is gonna survive, the feisty female in Sarah Polley and some hick security guards. Just when this film was doing well and and they have to have the usual run of the mill characters and who dies and who doesn't. Oh and please leave to the imagination the ending the uncertainty works wanders you know just as it did in the original. All in all good but a bit more imagination wouldn't go a miss, but did like the chainsaw bit though!"
"Dicky_monster","Null","0","0","26 March 2004"," Low expectations, high rewards...
","Like many others, I wasnt too optimistic about the quality of this Dawn of the Dead remake, especially after heading rumours of it having a similar style to the Resident Evil film (which seemed to neglect the feel of the video games), but I was really surprised with the quality of the finished film. The remake opens far faster than the original, with less story background, and exposition, preferring to blow straight into the action from the start, which is a great thing I feel, because what would be achieved from explaining the well known story (started by Night of the Living Dead)? Instead, the film goes for edgy action for the majority of it's length, before exploding into all out war in the last 25 to 30 minutes (Remind you of Aliens anyone?), which really works in it's favour. The vicious, running and leaping zombies are genuinely unnerving, and some of the lead characters are engaging (admittedly, some of the less developed characters fall by the wayside in terms of characterisation), and the direction is stylish and effective. Overall, a well engineered, exciting thrill ride. But the big question is, how does it stand up to the original? I have a feeling this question is going to cause a lot of debate, for some time to come, because the 2 films are so hard to compare, (the plots only relate to each other because of the mall location really, the themes are totally different, and there are 25 years between each one) so it's probably best to take the new Dawn of the Dead for what it is: a totally new film, and a damn good one at that."
"LordSlaytan","8","0","0","22 March 2004"," It's not Romero, but it's not Rob Zombie either.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I haven't seen George Romero's version of Dawn of the Dead since it was first released on videotape, so I really can't say how faithful Gunn and Snyder followed the original story. I have heard that the original was more than a standard horror movie, but also a social commentary on American commercialism and consumption. Be that as it may, it doesn't detract from the fact that this newer version is a fun, fun movie with its own strengths and message. The message of course is that if you run across a zombie that looks like Jay Leno or Burt Reynolds, shoot the hell out of it and laugh your ass off, because there aren't too many things to guffaw at when the whole world wants to chew on you.<br/><br/>The opening begins with Ana (Polley), a registered nurse in Everett, Wisconsin who is just leaving the hospital when her shift is over. When she pulls into her driveway, she sees the precocious Vivian, an 11-year-old neighbor girl who wants to show off just how adorable she is by showing Ana her newest rollerblading skill. Ana goes into her home, has amazing standing up in the shower while the water chafes your skin sex with her loving and perfect husband (who cares what his name is, he's Alpo five minutes later), and lays down for a peaceful sleep befitting an Angel.<br/><br/>When morning comes, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, all is pure Disney until cute little Vivian enters the bedroom because either her television is on the blink, or there's no more raw meat at home to satiate her new born hunger. Poor old no-name husband feels sorry for the bloody darling because he knows what it's like to miss The Power Puff Girls and runs to Vivian's side to console her; then wham-o! No-name is running around with teeth marks in his neck and trying to scream, which is hard to do when you have a gaping hole in your throat. Somehow, Ana is able to put a door in between her and Vivian, who happens to still be hungry, and watches as her husband dies.and rises again. Instead of jumping joyously screaming, `It's a miracle!' Ana is fighting for her life because no-name would rather eat her instead of his usual bran muffin, which is wholly understandable. Ana barely escapes with her breasts still on her chest instead of in no-names gullet, runs out to their car, and there we get to see one of the coolest, `We're not in Kansas anymore' sequences ever made. Her once peaceful and placid neighborhood is now an open buffet for the undead. Fire and screaming is everywhere she looks, people running for their lives, and other people running for their breakfast. Ana gets into her car just in time before her husband can goose her from behind, peels out of her driveway, and hauls ass to anywhere but there while her husband chases her, which he quits doing once he sees some other prey unlucky enough not to make it to his Desoto. From a bird's eye view, we see Ana driving pell-mell on the highway where she causes a truck to swerve into an old farmhouse causing a spectacular explosion.then the opening credits appear.<br/><br/>I was hooked, so was most of the packed theater there to see the show. I've got to hand it to Gunn and Snyder, because they really know how fish. I was baited, hooked, and reeled in only 10 minutes into the movie. The audience was thrilled. People were yelling, cheering, and laughing from beginning to end. Everyone was overjoyed with the special effects, the shock, and the dark humor that's prevalent throughout the film. I really enjoyed the subtle humor used with the 'muzak' used over the loud speakers in the mall.<br/><br/>I'm sure that you all know that the survivors make it to a mall and that's where they make their stand, if you want to call it that. We meet the cop Kenneth (Rhames), a big giant bad-ass with a shotgun and an attitude, Michael (Webber), a guy that first appears to be there to either be a living villain or weakling, but becomes a principle character with fortitude and intelligence, Andre (Phifer), who is accompanied with his soon-to-be-bursting-baby wife, Luda (Korobkina) and CJ (Kelly), a security guard who has a superiority complex and a gun. The rest of the people may as well have worn their red Star Trek uniforms, which doesn't mean they all bite it, but that they aren't the emotional center of the movie at this point.<br/><br/>But, the true stars of any zombie film are the zombies. I know that, you know that, and fortunately for us, Gunn and Snyder know that. No more of the lumbering hulks that are only dangerous if a character gets trapped or if the character happens to be a female. In Dawn of the Dead, the zombies have all taken track in high school. They run at blistering speeds, show acrobatic talents as they fly through the air, and swallow their food without adhering to the Surgeon General's warning that every bite should be chewed 26 times. They also show a greater strength in their problem solving skills, unless, of course, figuring something out would be detrimental to the plot.<br/><br/>If you're only there for the gore, you won't be disappointed. There's enough of that to keep even the most disturbed individuals anchored in their seats. There are also some really cool explosions, imaginative death scenes, a cute little doggy to feel afraid for, and a very large body count. It also shows why you shouldn't play with Daddy's chainsaw while standing up in a fast moving truck, just in case you weren't sure. If more horror films followed the example laid out by 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead, there just might be hope for the waning horror industry. I might just become a fan again."
"henriennui","9","0","0","22 March 2004"," Instant classic
","I was not immediately thrilled at the concept of a DotD remake.  The original seemed pretty much complete in itself, and remakes are lame.<br/><br/>Then I noticed Sarah Polley in it.  Now, for a talented actress, she has been in almost nothing south of the border since The Sweet Hereafter, and routinely turns down roles.  She simply doesn't do bad movies, and didn't here.  I found that intriguing enough to realize this was probably not a standard remake, and I bet right.<br/><br/>And it lived up to its billing.  This movie hits the ground running and doesn't stop.  The first five minutes is perfectly paced and hits with sledgehammer force.  I knew I was in good hands when Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" played over the opening credits.  Incidentally, I thought the opening and closing credits were comparable to another favorite set of credits, the ones in Se7en.<br/><br/>There were only a couple direct homages to the original Romero film, one of them a setup for the shot from the poster of the original DotD movie.  I won't spoil this by naming the actor, but I think you'll see it coming. It's an intriguing twist on that moment.<br/><br/>I won't comment on the obvious differences in the original, or the post-ironic conceit of zombies in a shopping mall in 2004.  (Zombies in a shopping mall!  Just like real life!)<br/><br/>My gripes are very minor, and involve somewhat overdoing a few camera techniques that were also overdone in 28 Days Later.  However, one area where the film excelled was in pacing.  The violence was perfectly choreographed.  (Also, I want to marry Sarah Polley, but I'll save that subject for somewhere else.)<br/><br/>I have seen reviews complaining of shallowness or repetitiveness, but I think such comments completely miss the point of a zombie movie, which is the existential horror of lurching sameness, and the complete lack of any moral complexity.  Zombies are simply insensate evil, and must be destroyed. The carnage does not involve human beings, nor villains, simply nonliving evil that must be destroyed.  Unlike the humans killed in a Dirty Harry movie or a war movie, zombies have no intrinsic value whatsoever.  There are no shades of gray, and no guilt in enjoying the slaughter.<br/><br/>As such, the only way to judge a film is how it hits you in the stomach. This film had me cringing back in my seat from the first few minutes, and never let up.  I have to commend the opening, and how, like the zombies themselves, it moved fast, with a wonderful lack of stupid expository comments, explanations, or meaning.  Without hesitation, it simply jumps headfirst into the gaping maw of horror.<br/><br/>In short, it is completely without any redeeming social value.<br/><br/>And that is how it should be.<br/><br/>This is an instant classic, and the crystallization of all zombie movies to date."

","Overall the movie was actually pretty good.  I loved the original and was excited to see the remake but feared that it would be a disappointment. It was evident that in addition to the large cast there were several other changes that were going to be made.  However, I was pleased with the outcome although it could have had more suspense.  There were a few flaws but I expected that.  After seeing the movie I was glad that the remake made several changes.  Dawn of the Dead (1978) is a classic horror movie, especially for that day in time.  It can not be duplicated.  Besides when classic horror pictures are redone and try too hard to be faithful to the original (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho, Night of the Living Dead), they suck.  I give it an 8 out of 10."

Great performances from Sarah Polley,Vingh Ramses,Mekhi Phifer,Jake Weber and Kevin Zegers. My only complaints are: 1) Even though there were some great suspense elements in this film there was no flesh eating scenes as their are in most zombie films. What's up with that?2)ANd at the end of the film where there getting off of the boat onto the island and find a rush of zombies coming after them does the turning over of the video camera mean their all being eaten at that moment? And this did pay homage to the original film in many ways that diehard DOTD fans will notice, but is in many ways more like the more recent zombie films such as Resident Evil and 28 Days Later in the zombies run after their prey and that their more intersted in infecting you with their virus then eating you whole which is what most true zombie ( AND I HATE TO SAY IT) but true Romero films are about. This is a great movie in it's own right but totally different in many ways than the original. But equally as good. Lots of great gore scenes especially the fat lady zombie who's been bit on the arm and turns and then Sarah Polleys's character has to skewer her through the eye and into the brain. The lady dying and then having the zombie baby was especially creepy and the accidental chainsawing of two of our survivors in the get-away bus was most classic and intense. Also the changing of only the infected dead rising and not all the dead changes the story a bit as well but all in all this film will be a classic for it's time.If you haven't seen the original first though do watch it first and this one second. ***** out *****"

The middle of the movie is mostly the people arguing over what to do and taking stuff from the mall.  Eventually they do decide on a plan of action which i'm not so sure is feasable but who cares.  Its was awsome.  You'll especially like ""Andy"" on the rooftop building across the street.  He owns a gun store and makes things interesting.

"amaros_danza","Null","0","0","23 March 2004"," **SPOLIERS** Why remake Dawn of the Dead?
","Zombies on the loose once more, what is new?  This remake fails to capture anything remotely close to the original, which makes me wonder why Bart Gunn (screenplay writer 2004) decided to call this movie Dawn of the Dead.  The only thing kept from the original was the fact that these survivors were at a mall.<br/><br/>The original movie is far from a perfect horror movie, and to this reviewer, the original is more of a comedy than true horror.  (Are there any true horror movies anyway?  I think not).  However, if one is to remake a movie, one should keep at least half (or more) of the ideas in it.  Also, do not kid yourself, this is a remake.  Most will say it is merely based on the original but anything based or remade is the work of the writer envisioning what he would do with the original if he had the chance.<br/><br/>In this version, there are no characters from the original, no use of the helicopter, no infestation of zombies in the mall, the characters did not live at the mall for a while, and the best part of the original was the biker fight scenes.  There is so much more I can gripe about but I'll save it.<br/><br/>This remake definitely failed to achieve anything.  This is one of the worst remakes ever, if not the worst.  If you plan to see this movie for it's original counterpart, avoid at all cost.  This movie gets three out of ten stars.<br/><br/>However, this movie is not horrible.  The one thing needed to enjoy this movie, (to a point of seven out of ten stars), is to call it something other than Dawn of the Dead.  Call it ""Panic in Wisconsin"" instead.  If you go see this movie with another title in mind you might like it.<br/><br/>But it truly is a horrible remake."

","**(May include Spoilers)** After a brutal nightmare revolving around the movie, I realized I had to go see it!  Last night, with a group of friends, I finally saw it.  The movie makers did a sick job, because it scared the sh*t out of me.  We're not sure why there are suddenly flesh-eating zombies walking around in what is implied to be every continent on earth, but there are certain suggestions as to why:  Was it a plague created by terrorists?  What psychologically freaked me out was it's implied purpose:  Hell is full, and now the dead are walking the earth.  That is horribly frightening to me, because we're all afraid of the unknown.  Who knows if one of these days, hell could suddenly be too full, and look, the dead are walking the earth, infecting hundreds of people by the minute. Like any movie it had it's ups and downs.  I think the downs outnumbered. Why all the characters?  There were far too many.  Each one was pretty shallow, including the main character, Ana.  There should have been more time for us to get to know and love her, but all the terror started within the first ten minutes of the film.  I appreciate that as well, because it was a different approach to a horror flick.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS!!!) I just don't understand something - The dead are walking the earth, correct? There is no more room in hell - but by shooting them in the head, they die for good...where do they go? Heaven?<br/><br/>A friend of mine who I saw the movie with caught some symbolism in one scene that I haven't seen anyone else comment on.  When Andre, Luda, Anna, Ken, and Michael get on the elevator, they go upstairs and meet the three security guards, who won't let them stay.  Andre tells them his girlfriend is pregnant, and they need somewhere to stay, and the three security guards won't let them - Doesn't this remind anyone of The Virgin Mary, Joseph, and the three wise men???  Hello - my girlfriend is pregnant, can we stay here? No! I don't see the purpose of that symbolism, so if anyone does, please help me understand!<br/><br/>Just for scare factor I'll give the movie a 7 out of 10"

","I just got home after seeing ""Dawn Of The Dead,"" and I immediately rushed to the computer to place my thoughts on this site. After being stoked for the past few months and after watching the 10 minute clip on USA, I settled into the seat and watched, transfixed at the screen and watched the fun begin. It is a very good film (Although the camera-work made me a bit dizzy and the sound system gave me a severe migraine)with an interesting story. No need to re-cap what it's about, but I will tell you that the humor is really on target (Especially the celebrity look-a-likes that get bumped off), the zombies are incredibly SCARY! (The thought of those things running after me scared me so much that I had to look over my shoulder on my way to my car), and it wasn't too heavy on gore (Just graphic violence). The ending reminded me of 1979's ""Zombie"" (Those who have seen this film will understand). One word of note: watch the final credits! My one gripe is with Matt Frewer, because he really wasn't in the film that long (At least 5 minutes). Other than that, this was a truly excellent film. I HIGHLY recommend the unrated version, with the bonus footage and the behind-the scenes stuff. For fun, watch it back-to-back with the original version."

","This is not a scary movie - it is a Zombie movie and it does it well. The cast performed their roles well - nothing oscar worthy of course but perfect performances for the film.<br/><br/>There are several comedy moments (intentional) and these make a welcome break in the tension of the film.<br/><br/>Everything kicks off fairly quickly - no pointless hour long examination of how origin of the Zombies (I imagine this is covered in the previous incarnation - although it is a while since i have seen the remake of The Night Of The Living Dead). I am a fan of the original trilogy and I still enjoyed this sequel - the gore is more believable as you would expect in an update (blood is slightly less fluorescent than in the original) the shocks are there, the updated Zombies are excellent - they are fast and dangerous - a big problem i had with the original was that the ""Shuffling Zombies"" required you to be very very very careless to be caught by them - not these new ones, they will chase you down and tear you apart given half the chance.<br/><br/>More could have been made of them being holed up in the Shopping Mall, like in the original, you never felt they were in any serious threat inside the Mall from the Zombies - although this was adequately replaced by a fear of each other.<br/><br/>Stay all the way to the end credits as more action occurs during these - I liked this way of ending - it would have been a ""Too many endings"" syndrome if they had tried to put this in as a traditional end of the film but making it interspersed during the credits was a nice touch.<br/><br/>See this film if you are not upset by gore, not expecting a frame-by-frame remake of the original (why would anybody bother to do this - Take Note producers of the Psycho remake), or expecting a reworking of a literary classic - this movie does not try to be any of these things and lets you enjoy it for it's own merits<br/><br/>8/10"

","Good but not so good remake to the original fright flick lacks the brains of its predecessor and does not have its heart. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames do well with their roles but the film really does not go anywhere with the time it has, and it lacks the bravado of the original film's climax.  My hats off to the director for keeping the body count high but shame on him for not getting too involved with his cast of characters, who in the original had some personality.  George Romero's original had a sense of real dread and a nightmarish view on human conflict but this movie is more popcorn than a real meal. Some genuine scares here and there but nothing else in terms of real human emotion.  Which is a shame because that what makes the original such a classic in modern horror."

","How things change. Dawn of the dead 1978 along with NoTLD 1968 show that as long as we fight with each other we will never make it. The new Dawn shows us that we no longer care for each other at all. As soon as the survivers started careing for each other they were able to make it. As far as the horror of it they could have shown more closeup the living dead and a little more of the gore. However i felt the running and power of the dead was a nice touch. I am sad to say the point of the movie was lost on my fellow movie goers. In 1978 the living still tried to have respect for the dead. In 2004 no one has any respect for anything. How sad. Maybe now with this movie having done so well we will finally see dead 4 by Romero. Fox has dead 4 rights already and have the movies working title already up on the web."

","It's been a long time that I've waited for a horror film to genuinely give you the creeps! And thankfully, Dawn Of the Dead delivers. I won't dwell too much on this, but suffice it to say, I haven't cringed so much in the first 10 minutes of a movie (don't worry, not going to spoil it). Even the opening titles remind you of when good horror movies were made (nice blood font by the way!)Oh, and good use of a Johnny Cash song.<br/><br/>Ok, I know Romero is the guy who started off this genre and hats off to him, but there's no crime in updating something and making it much better than before. They could've spoiled this by sticking in Hollywood teenagers, who'd have a helluva lot of trouble in convincing us they can save the world. What we get instead are a bunch of grown-ups who we believe in & sympathise with.<br/><br/>
The film's violence is brutal and necessary...and funny. God, it deserves its R-Rating. What differs here is that when the heroes shoot the zombies, we actually see them doing it. In the original, there were too many implied shots, so we never got to see the full damage. Blame the editor. Thankfully here, we get to see the full-works and boy, is it fun to watch! Just don't eat too many ketchup-covered hotdogs while you are though ;-)<br/><br/>Last thing I want to do is praise all concerned. Romero for thinking up the whole thing in the first place and for director Snyder, who obviously knew how to tread carefully with the genre and pick the right ensemble.Thanks for not f***ing up there Zack! Sarah Polley is better than you'd think, and pulls off the gutsy female with a certain aplomb. Plus, she's kinda cute too. Mekhi Phifer is as good as always, while Jake Weber & Michael Kelly as redneck CJ are born to do their bit. Was it me, or did CJ's look remind you of a 70s pornstar? Special praise goes to Ving Rhames as Kenneth. He's a tough arsed mother and knows it too. If this were a real-life situation, I'd definitely follow his lead. Rhames can take any line and make it 10 times funnier and memorable too. Oh, and he knows how to handle a gun.<br/><br/>Come September for the US release on DVD, I want to see a gag reel on there guys! Will I watch this again? Bet your butt I will!

"rikki-8","Null","0","0","27 March 2004"," Dawn of the what?
","Yesterday I went to watch Dawn 04 with high hopes after reading good things about the movie. After watching it the first time I must say I was dissapoited with the film. Now I like funny movies and won't hesitate to pay to watch one but I am against calling a comedy ""Dawn of the dead"" as a comedy horror is what this film really is. Ok, some people say the the new Dawn film was not ment to emulate the original and indeed they haven't done so. For this reason alone it doesn't deserve the title it has got.<br/><br/>
In case you have forgotten, the original Dawn is generally classed by most people as one of the greatest horor movies of all times and certainly the best zombie flick by quite a margin. The title of ""Dawn of the daed"" alarmed not only myself, but many other fanatical zombie fans around the world and indeed we were so excited to see some real Romero style zombie action. True zombie fans have been hungry for a zombie flick to rival Romero's classics for quite some time but sadly our hunger continues and probably always will.<br/><br/>Now I am not saying this is a poor movie as it's actually entertaining. However people with high amounts of zombie knowledge will know this film doesn't do any justice to the title. The frightening thing about the original movie was not only the creepy atmosphere, it was what one had to suffer when captured by zombies. Peoples body's were ripped open and the bites and gore were extremely graphic and disturbing which is surely the whole point of making a good zombie film. Sadly, the new Dawn film doesn't have the same feel and it certainly doesn't show enough gore and graphic detail when people are captured.<br/><br/>When people are caught in the new movie you barely see a bite and they are simply dragged to the floor before you hear screaming. This is simply not acceptable to true zombie fans and this fact alone is a huge dissapointment. Furthermore, they have relied much on comedy to compensate the lack of horror and disturbing scenes which i found extremely insulting to George Romero and zombie fanatics. On the good side, it has some nail biting moments and some tense scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat for short moments.<br/><br/>Go and see the film and expect a thrill and a good giggle. It's more like a comical version of 28 days later however these zombies do infact try to eat people rather than puke on them, even though you don't really see it. Sadly, Dawn of the dead this will never be despite what it is called and this is actually very sad for fanatical zombie fans considering the title of the movie and what we all expected."

","I just finished watching this movie and thought it was a pretty good zombie flick.  I did not compare it to the original and did not find myself thinking of the original while watching this one.  IMHO it is a vastly different movie, which made it not tread on the original so...<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>There are some very disturbing images in this movie for me, two in particular that will stay with me for a few days.  The first is when the female lead, Ana played by Sarah Polly, gets in her car and is escaping her rabid husband.  As she drives through her shattered neighborhood we see several zombie attacks on people who are mild shock at what they are seeing around them.  This really bothered me for some reason.  Shortly after this she pulls up behind a wrecked school bus and through the window of the bus we see two kid zombies attacking another kid, looks like a girl and she is fighting for her life but you know she is going to die.  This was another image that really bothered me.<br/><br/>There were some really cool things too, like the van/car accident you see from above, really well done!  The zombies were well done and you get to see some interesting looking creature effects.  There is not the variations like we have seen in the original but, zombie clowns are a little weird anyway :-)  The zombies move fast here as in 28 days later and this makes them a much tougher monster than if they were slower.  I liked this but my friend who I saw the movie with did not, he argued for the slower zombie to buid drama.  I liked the camera work, particularly when they went to the grainy shots or with the action shots.  It made me feel much closer to the action and added to the 'holy crap they are everywhere' feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>
Overall I would argue that if you like horror movies then you will enjoy this one.  I also really enjoyed the soundtrack."
"ttmfuson","Null","0","0","26 March 2004"," Awsome!
","I am a huge fan of Romero's 1978 classic. When I heard about the re-make I knew I would see the movie but I was prepared to be disappointed. This is the first horror movie as well as a re-make that has exceeded my expectations in a very long time. The fast zombies added a little more suspense to the story, more than Romero's had in 78'. The movie maintained a good action pace while at the same time developing the characters enough that you can relate and care about what happens to them. It certainly is a different film from Romero's but I did enjoy the subtle connections to the 1978 film. Naming one of the stores at the mall after the actress Gaylen Ross from the 1978 film was subtle but a tribute to the films origin. The cameo appearance by James Baffico was also a nice to see - he played one of the lead bikers in the 1978 film. In 2004 James was playing the role of the Sheriff telling a reporter that they had to be shot in the head...and he coined the phrase ""twitcher"". The 3rd connection was the BP truck which the survivors used a handful of times outside the mall. The 1978 film used BP trucks to block the mall entrances. Aside from those obvious connections with the 1978 film I would say Dawn of the Dead 2004 is very different and in its own genre. The effects were well done, it was shocking and disturbing in parts and best of all, the movie as a whole was fun. I also loved the ending, though some have criticized it. Without giving it away completely it was nice to see an ending that did not attempt to be happy. I guess the ending was similar to 1978 Dawn. Good does not win, not everyone lives and there's still no more room in hell! I left Dawn of the Dead 2004 wanting to see it again. It's a terrific film that blends humour with horror that even the most squeamish can enjoy."
"dtrcartwright","8","0","0","27 March 2004"," It's a zombie film, it credits Romero's Screenplay and it's called Dawn of the Dead; but somehow it doesn't feel like it belongs in the ""Dead"" series
","Have just seen the ""re-envisioning"" of Dawn of the Dead and overall really enjoyed this film (certainly more so than I would have expected).  The directing and shutter speed was very much in your face - this is indeed undead for the MTV generation.<br/><br/>Phantom Menace was dubbed Star Wars Episode 1.  It sounded and looked like a Star Wars movie but after watching it the first time - you kind of didn't feel like you had just watched a Star Wars film.  This movie leaves you feeling the same way - it is a zombie film, it credits Romero's Screenplay and it is called Dawn of the Dead; but somehow it doesn't feel like it belongs in the ""Dead"" series.  For me - they could have given this one a completely non-related title and it would have stood on its own merits. Not being titled Dawn of the Dead would actually have removed much of the baggage that comes with reworking such a well-loved classic.<br/><br/>SPOILERS> The opening sequence where Ana leaves her house and surveys the carnage taking place on her doorstep whilst helicopters buzz overhead was tremendous.  The aerial photography that follows as Ana takes a car journey to safety was breathtaking.  Awesome.  To be fair, as the opening credits roll - those scenes set a standard which the film struggles to maintain thereafter.<br/><br/>Whilst the Mall in the original DOTD was brightly lit by fluorescent light this new film delivers a claustrophobic, spot lit location which ensures many shocks and never actually portrays the mall as a safe haven. Watching this film is a truly gruelling experience - I felt physically exhausted as I left the Cinema.<br/><br/>In the original DOTD there is sufficient character development to ensure that we feel sympathy for the characters, we understand them and believe in them.  With the exception of Ana, Michael and Kenneth there is no characterisation in this new movie.  You never get to know the characters and writing these comments I am struggling to remember the names of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The plot suffered from many moments that just did not make sense: 1. How come Nicole drives the truck over to Andy's to fetch the dog? Couldn't they just whistle to recall the dog?  If you could get a truck over there then why didn't they save Andy earlier? 2. Why does everyone go through the sewers to rescue Nicole from Andy's shop? If you could get over there by sewer then why didn't they save Andy earlier?  Why bother messing about in sewers anyway when you have two reinforced buses in your garage? 3. Why does CJ hang around on the last bus instead of escaping?  This is purely a plot device to enable him to die an heroic death and redeem himself for earlier actions when he subjugated the other survivors. 4. Why did the bloated fat woman become athletic once undead?  Why does being undead bestow such high levels of physical fitness?  (Fitness that was not there whilst the person was in life)?<br/><br/>I really struggle with this last point and whilst I welcome the zombie movie mini-revival which is taking place - I have to say that I am a bit of a purist and prefer the undead to shuffle along.  All of this running around is clearly inspired by ""28 Days Later"" - but let's be clear - the creatures in ""28 Days Later"" are NOT zombies or undead, they are plague victims.<br/><br/>This sounds like I am moaning.  I am not.  DOTD (2004) is a great film - an 8 out of 10 for me and I eagerly anticipate the DVD release.<br/><br/>It is well reported elsewhere but if you watch all of the end credits then the fate of the survivors is revealed; you won't miss this closing footage because a thoughtfully used ""tit shot"" ensures that the credits keep your attention!  (It works for me)!<br/><br/>References to other movies I noticed included: PSYCHO - Ana falling in her bath and pulling the shower curtain down whilst covered in blood. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD - Ana's car rolls down a hill and strikes a tree. 28 DAYS LATER - Substitute mall security guards for British Army troops ruling over the survivors; the virus based contagion and the athletic zombies sprinting to catch their prey. DAWN OF THE DEAD - Protagonists holed up in a shopping mall whilst the undead roam outside. ALIEN - although the filmmakers shied away from actually having an undead baby burst from the unfortunate Luda's body. TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE - the scenes where Zombies are despatched from the outside of the bus and the horrifying scene where the blonde (don't remember her name) is sliced through - Tobe Hooper would have loved that scene in his movie! ZOMBIE FLESH-EATERS (ZOMBI 2) - Zombies occupying a remote island accessible by yacht. SE7EN - the head in the box."

It seems that 28 Days Later had more of an influence on this film than the original did.  It looks to have been shot on Digital Cameras too; the picture had that same look about it.<br/><br/>At first, I was disappointed that the Zombies were not the usual slow moving lumps of dead flesh that I knew and loved......that quality alone seemed to make them even more menacing in the Romero classics (of which I am a MASSIVE fan, by the way).  It didn't take long, tho, to accept the new look Zombies......again, probably helped by the effectiveness of the assailants in 28 Days Later (as they were obviously not Zombies in that film).......and this only added to the whole 'edge of the seat' action/horror of the movie. And as for 'jumping out of your skin' !!!   There are a few moments where I physically left my seat, I jumped so hard.<br/><br/>The special effects are obviously a little more advanced than in the original....not to take any credit away from Tom Savini, who worked wonders in the original.....and some head shooting and chainsaw scenes were some of the most bloodthirsty I have seen in a long while.<br/><br/>There are some really funny moments in this movie too.  Look out for the 'Celebrity Zombie' shoot-out  in particular....and also the fantastic parody of the 'chainsaw, blood-spurting in face scene' lifted from The Evil Dead 2. The guy that plays this scene has more than a passing resemblance to Mr Bruce Campbell.  I did get a little worried about the developing pregnancy sub-plot......was half expecting something not unlike the film 'It's Alive' about the killer baby.  Luckily, it wasn't too bad.  Fans of the Zombie genre may also spot the obvious references to the Lucio Fulchi movie ""Zombi 2"" or ""Zombie Flesheaters"", as I think it was called in the US.....tho wait for the closing credits.....whatever you do, DO NOT leave until the film absolutely ends !<br/><br/>Also look out for cameos from at least two of the Stars from the original film;  Tom Savini as a straight talking Cop, eager to dispatch the Zombies as efficiently as possible.....and Ken Foree, who utters the infamous phrase that was the Tagline to the original.......<br/><br/>' When there's no more room in Hell......the Dead shall walk the Earth '<br/><br/>9/10"

The good news was it wasn't.<br/><br/>The only similarity between the two movies was the shopping centre.  The zombies, where completely different.  I guess this movie could have been entitled something completely different but with marketing the way it is I guess a pseudo remake is going to bring in more dosh.<br/><br/>Anyway... the movie is more like a cross between DOTD and 28 Days Later; it had me on the edge of my seat, and made me jump more than once - to many.

","This has to be one of the best films ever made in the horror/ action horror genre. I was a big fan of the original George A Romero film, and went into the cinema with a cynical eye. But after ten minutes of the film I was totally won over. The first ten minutes of the film are hard hitting, and brilliantly directed. I thought the film would probably go down hill after such a great start, but the adrenalin just kept rising. There were parts of the film that made you want to cheer out loud.<br/><br/>The screenplay and direction paid homage to the original film, but slickly mixed the 'old school' zombie film style with modern action and camera techniques. I was concerned that the makers may have made a completely different slasher style movie under the franchise of Dawn Of The Dead, but have indeed made a faithful remake, which stays very true to the original story.<br/><br/>The casting in this film is superb. The actors have a good balance of not taking themselves too seriously, but being quite believable at the same time. CJ is probably the coolest warrior ever to appear in a zombie film!<br/><br/>The makers have injected a small amount of humour into the film, which is more ironic than cheesy, which create some original funny moments. The makers have been very innovative, and have added some new ideas seamlessly into the action and story, making it fresh and interesting.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see organic gore effects, as many films now depend on computer imagery. The gore is nicely sick and bloody, but here comes my only criticism; there could have been more shots of zombies devouring human flesh and organs!<br/><br/>If you like action horror, this film will blow you away.

","I loved the original, and I loved this one, maybe a little more.  To compare the two movies is like comparing apples and oranges.<br/><br/>The Similarities: The main characters are in a mall, one of them is a black cop, one of them is pregnant, and the walking dead (in Dawn 2004 the running dead) are intent on snacking on them.  That's where most of the similarities end.<br/><br/>The Differences: The original had a slow building sense of dread and tension and was full of Romeroish social commentary regarding consumerism, racism and the haves and have nots of society.  Within the first five minutes or so of Dawn 2004, you are jump-started into the fast paced world or zombie horror.  All throughout this movie, I literally found my heart thumping furiously in my chest.  As far as the social commentary was concerned, I don't think there was any.  I could care less about social commentary anyway.  I go to the movies for the entertainment value and Dawn 2004 paid off handsomely.  In the original, there was a certain amount of slap stick humor that eventually became very dark and serious (i.e. the bikers in the mall).  Fewer characters in the original led to more character development. Dark humor was present in Dawn 2004 (i.e. the celebrity shoot off).  In the original, if a zombie got after you, you might want to pick up your pace to brisk walk if you didn't want to become a protein snack.  In Dawn 2004, if a zombie got after you, you better be gettin jiggy-wit-it or you're gonna get chomped.<br/><br/>I loved both movies.  Both of them entertained and scared me thoroughly.

","In a time when good horror movies are not the norm, this is very good one. I was on the edge of my seat all night and laughed when there were some good satirical moments, but often thought I did so 'cause I was so scared.  I don't scare easy at movies, and am a horror junkie. I have seen all of the living dead's by Romero numerous times and appreciated the twist this movie gave to DotD. My gripes concern the over-similarities to ""28 Days"" (these movies were quite similar in many respects, as already noted by several reviewers), and illogic of the survivors at the very end in their escape plans (don't folks in zombie films ever see any zombie films? -- stolen from the NY Times film review of this movie..a very appropriate critique!).<br/><br/>The music was very good, the opening and closing credits very innovative and clever (and suspenseful), the cameos quite ""winky,"" and the intermittent humor necessary.<br/><br/>Most of all, this movie was suspenseful.  Fast zombies can be scary and slow zombies can be scary, depending on how the director handles the setting and action. These guys did a better job with the fast zombies than 28 Days did, but clearly, 28 Days paved the way. The acting here is strong (although their aint no Brendan Gleeson level actors, I've always loved Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley is strong, too). The guy who plays ""steve"" (noted elsewhere) has the opportunity to add some great spice, and he does it well (mr. dripping sarcasm).  The pace is frenetic, and the lack of explanation right on. That only adds to the ""dummying down"" of such movies. The destruction of suburbia was brilliant. This was a well-done movie, and when compared to contemporary horror flicks, at or near the top (10 stars). When compared to other flicks in general, I would give it 7 stars."

","This is a terrific, flesh-eating zombie film, done in the same ""vein"" as the original ""Night of the Living Dead."" The 1978 sequel was simply too graphic. This one, while still entertaining certain graphic elements, focuses more on the relationships between the victims, who are desperately trying to escape. The original ""Night of the Living Dead"" was scary as hell, but because we could empathize with the victims. So was the original ""Dawn of the Dead,"" but the latter lost its audience by throwing up so much gore into our faces. This one maintains that same level of fright as the original, but delivers it with a more humane touch. I am not against gore, as long as it is done right, and that is exactly what this movie does. The story is eloquent, including the ending, which I thought spoke to that which truly makes us ""human."" This is exactly what George Romero should have done with his sequel back in 1978."

","MASSIVE SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN - SPOILERS - SPOILERS - SPOILERS<br/><br/>This is a big budget remake of the 1978 George A. Romero classic and because it's the new millenium it comes slicker than an oiled weasel. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, the original is the better version but it does something different being more a statement of american consumerism than a straightforward horror film. This remake pretty much discards this in favour of jump out your seat shocks and lashings of gore.<br/><br/>A young nurses life is destroyed overnight by the advancing hordes of the living dead, she barely escapes from her zombified partner and hooks up with a tough cop and a young couple expecting a baby amongst others. They eventually end up seeking shelter in a local mall with the dead waiting outside for them in ever increasing numbers.<br/><br/>Gone are the blue faced shambling corpses of before and in their place are the screaming rotting RUNNING turbo zombies. A lot of people are complaing about these next generation zombies saying they're not scary. In my mind if you're not terrified by the decomposing corpse of a loved one running at you at high speed to chew your face off then there's not much in this life that holds fear for you. Personally i find them terrifying even if they have been lifted straight from ""28 Days Later"".<br/><br/>The movie is well paced, it doesn't waste anytime at the start and in doing this conveys the speed at which society collapses in the face of the zombie threat. The characters have no time to take stock or reflect as they flee and neither do we. Things slow down slightly as we reach the mall, many new characters are introduced including the obnoxious and possible slightly unhinged CJ and his security goons. Some of the new characters are somewhat pointless (old man and red lipstick girl anyone?) and by making the survivors group too large we loose time with the characters that we are meant to care about (Sarah Polleys nurse and Ving Rhames Cop for instance).<br/><br/>
The film goes it own way and doesn't stick closely to the originals plot. There is no biker gang, in this film the threat comes staight from the zombies. For a relatively inexperienced director this is a good move, given the films tone it would have felt clumsy to have shifted the focus onto a human conflict midway through. The only thing that leaves a slightly bad taste in the mouth is the inconsistancy of some of the characters, it's almost as if the second half of the script underwent some major changes without the first half being revised afterwards. CJ's character changes midway through from difficult controlling dimissive gun toting security nut to heroic save the day self sacrificing good guy. I don't know if scenes were cut showing some sort of character development but this doesn't seem to ring true. Another female character after being level headed for most of the film sacrificies the safety of the whole group to rescue a dog which has been with them for a very short period of time.<br/><br/>The films final two or three minutes are the most effective with a blair witch style camcorder section. These last minutes give a confusing snap shot of the groups progress after the mall ending with a....well i won't spoil it but let's just say those last shots stayed with me long after the film ended.<br/><br/>In conclusion this film does exactly what it says on the tin, scares the bejeezus out of you for about two hours. If you want ironic post modernism humour go rent scream or something, if you want your horror with a dash of social and political statement then rent the original. If you want to soil yourself with terror in a cinema along with the rest of the audience and see a chainsaw make a welcome return to the genre then go see this. Four of five wibbles."

","OK, OK, everybody hold on a second. First of all, let me make it perfectly clear that I am a Romero fan, no doubt about it.  Not an obsessed fan, not a zombie movie maniac, but a fan nonetheless.  I thought Night was a masterpiece.  I've never seen Day. I recently (as in the last week) watched both Dawns.  And I have to say it--I think the new one is the better film.  Here's why: 1.  Character Development--We get peeks (and only peeks) into these characters former lives, their motivations, and this is the artistic way to do it.  Granted, CJ's character change was a bit hard to swallow.  But every other major character was more than just a cardboard cutout.<br/><br/>Ving Rhames' and his desire to find his brother becomes his desire to help his new family in the mall. The dude from U-571: more than halfway through the film we find out that he was married with children, was a poor husband, was a good father, and held tons of bad jobs.  Yet he is the voice of reason, he is the father of the group, he is the good man in a storm. Sarah Polley: we've seen what she went through in the beginning of the film, and therefore we don't need to hear it again, so we don't.<br/><br/>Mekhi Phifer:  Though a complete maniac when he reaches his demise, we can understand why he's become a maniac.<br/><br/>2.  Likable characters:  This goes a long way in my book.  I'm not saying I didn't like the characters in the original.  But they were too one-dimensional for me.  The white cop just becomes a lunatic.  We don't get glimpses into their past lives or why they are who they are.  There's absolutely no chemistry between the father and mother-to-be.  The black cop just suddenly decides that he doesn't want to live anymore, but then gets his motivation back at the end.  I thought that was done pretty poorly.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I really felt for some (obviously not all) of the characters in the new one.  Even Andy from the gun shop, who has a mere two or three lines of dialogue, I felt for.  The people in the new one are more fleshed out, more human, and more likable.<br/><br/>3.  HUMOR:  This is an added-bonus for horror movies, which Romero was great to put into Night.  But, the humor in the original Dawn seems so dated now. The idea of one-stop shopping is the only line that stands out in my mind.<br/><br/>Compare that to the humor in the new one.  Take the scene where Andy's shooting zombies in the parking lot and Ving's holding up the sign to tell him which celebrity to shoot--Jay Leno, Burt Reynolds (""man he's good, that didn't even look like Burt Reynolds"").<br/><br/>4.  LESS Stupid Character Moments:  The original Dawn has many of these. With the white cop taking his sweet old time and running around like a maniac.<br/><br/>Yes, the new one has its share, but I would say there were less as a whole. Like when that chick went to save the dog.<br/><br/>5.  Fast Zombies:  Obviously, this makes zombie attacks much more intense.<br/><br/>6.  More of a feel good movie (despite the credits):  The new version felt much more hopeful.  The people all, eventually anyways, came together, formulated a plan, decided to risk themselves to help out Andy, etc.  In the original, the characters were hiding from the zombies and society, and seemed content to live their days out in a shopping mall.<br/><br/>There's more I could say, but I've already gone on for too long.  This should generate (hopefully) a lot of comments."

I have seen so many other zombie flicks and not one came close to Dawn of the Dead. Night of the Living Dead and Return of the Living Dead were good and Demons 1 and 2 were pretty awesome, but nothing ever came close to Dawn of the Dead. When I heard about the remake I was exstatic! I was so excited and I couldn't wait. When I finally saw the remake this past weekend it was good but not nearly great like the original.

If it were sold as something other then Dawn of the Dead I would have loved it.

","Having only ""28 days later"" and the Simpson's Halloween specials as reference for zombies, I'd say this is an excellent zombie-stompin movie. The roles played by the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" cast were also very cool. It lacks the social commentary of previous zombie flicks, but it doesn't detract from the experience.<br/><br/>The film makes a point of establishing the reality of the world pre-zombie takeover, so the frequent defiance against of the laws of physics is troubling for some (anal science freaks like me). A filled propane tank ways 40 lbs. and there is no freakin way that they can be thrown that far, regardless of a ripped physique. Also, the number of direct headshots delivered by handguns is completely ludicrous, but now I'm being petty. If these attacks against the laws of nature scare the bejeebas out of you, maybe zombie flicks aren't for you.<br/><br/>Snyder does a good job for a first time out director and the cinematography is superb. The music selections seem odd at first, but suit the film (all hail Richard Cheese!).<br/><br/>8/10"

","Somebody else mentioned that they have a crazy fear of zombies. I can't stop watching the movies either. I own pretty much all zombie movies. THis movie scared me so bad I didn't sleep right for two nights, and I usually sleep really well. I was afraid to get out of bed in the morning, because I figured the neighbor's daughter would be waiting for me in the hallway. I'm starting to get back to a normal state now, but dang.<br/><br/>I never got into the social aspect of Romero's Dawn of the Dead. I think the hopeless situation and the lonely feeling did it enough from me. Plus, when Savini stabbed that zombie through the neck, that was hilarious. This new movie keeps that aspect that really got to me...that the world pretty much sucks and you live in fear.<br/><br/>I really like the fact that they don't explain what happened and it went so fast. This seems a lot more realistic than 3rd person explanations of the whole situation. In real life you probably wouldn't really grasp what was occuring, especially if the worldwide problem took over fast like it did.<br/><br/>People keep calling the girl in the beginning the daughter, but it was my understanding that it was the neighbor's kid, and that she had gotten messed up from a zombie at her house and had wandered over to their house (thus the open door in the front of the house when the insane zombie husband bursts out).<br/><br/>Fast zombies scare me really bad. It's bad enough that there's so many of them, but when they can rush you, that's super problematic. The fat zombie: fat people can move fast too if they need to...especially on adrelanie. THey just can't do it as long.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really like this movie. It freaks me out really bad, but I still love it. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is the best zombie movie ever, but I don't think people should dump on this movie just because it's based on that one. Kudos to the dude who prayed for the exploding head and his prayers were answered.<br/><br/>Peace!"

And unlike 28 Days later this was supposedly a worldwide epidemic, unlike 28 Days later where it was taking place in Britain. The acting in the movie was pretty good as well, with some well known names in the credits. It had some pretty good humor in the film as well when the characters started using zombies as shooting practice. Overall if you like movies about the walking dead this is the movie to see.

","This film was fun (8/10).  Lots of big plot holes, but overall an enjoyable experience if you prefer adventure-horror vs. straight-up horror, like me. Being a HUGE fan of the original, I tried to ""leave it outside the theater"" and approach this as an entirely new film, but of course that's impossible.<br/><br/>~~Spoilers~~<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Two plot points (among several) which I did NOT care for:<br/><br/>1.  If the route to the mall was so clear at first, why did only a handful of people make it there for refuge?  I'll assume they all headed for other ""safe-havens"", like the church or fort. 2.  What was the deal with the head in the cooler during the ending credits? Who put it in there, and why (and what happened to them)?  Made no sense to me.<br/><br/>One main plot point that I didn't like was that there was very little time devoted to securing the mall/barricading.  Basically, the characters checked the doors to make sure they were locked and from that point on the mall was secure.  I guess I didn't realize mall door glass was indestructible when you've got 1000 zombies pushing/pounding on it...also, what about the glass smashed by our survivors to enter the mall in the first place?  Did they immediately patch it up?  Preparing a stronghold has always been my favorite part of zombie films (see NOTLD, DawnOTD, ReturnOTLD, and even the film Demon Night, as examples) and there was virtually none of it here.  And am I supposed to believe there was only one set of 2 elevators in the entire mall?  No stairs?!?!  I bring this up because there were a few zombies on the 1st floor in the beginning, but they seemed to make no effort to find the 3 security guards upstairs...<br/><br/>Also, the film devoted very little time to showing the breakdown of society (although, thankfully, more than the disappointing 28 Days Later).  The original's periodic television broadcasts gave you the feeling there were other people out there trying to survive, as well as give you some limited info on the status outside the mall and the phenomenon in general.  When the broadcasts end about 3/4 into the original film, it was a powerful way to illustrate the hopelessness of the situation.  For all we know in THIS film, these are the very last people alive.  We hope not, we assume not, but we have no way of knowing.<br/><br/>I enjoyed CJ's character a lot.  At first, I thought, ""Oh, great.  A cliche character who thinks he's tough but is the most cowardly of the bunch - he's going to pull a Miguel (see Day of the Dead) and screw everything up."" But I was thankfully wrong.  It was nice to see this sort of character ""grow"" as the film progressed.  Plus, by the end he was just funny and ""cool"".<br/><br/>All these complaints aside, I look forward to getting the DVD and adding this one to my Zombie Film Collection."

","The film is too short at around 100 minutes, which with this subject matter it needs to be at least 2 hours long to allow character development,and to give some background to the events etc. Because of this you dont give two hoots for any of the characters, and they are playing it for laughs as well - no one looks very concerned and they all seem to be taking it in their stride, as if the dead come back to 'life' every day. So whats wrong with this film, here goes : the Zombies run - zombies should'nt run they are dead !, the female at the start of the film is chased by her zombie boyfriend who punches the windshield through on her car, but when the survivors are in the shopping mall the zombies cant break the entrance doors ??, there is no character development, and the film builds no sense of being trapped as in the original.There are too many survivors holed up in the shopping mall, characters are introduced and then not given any time to develop. <br/><br/>In saying that if you have'nt seen the original you may well enjoy this movie - as a horror it is a good film, with plenty of action and good SFX.

A few zombies that move slow as molasses in winter? A helicopter that can take them outta there whenever it gets too dangerous? Where's the terror in that?  Most of the movie is spent playing around in the shopping mall.<br/><br/>Not so with the current version.  The zombies here are mean and *fast*--and there are zillions of them.  The terror and despair are real--as is the drama.  Everything is precisely calculated and has its reason.  Characters change as they live under the strain of balancing compassion with survival. Unlike the cardboard cutouts in the earlier version, these are real people confronted with an unimaginable horror.  Some respond better than others, but both the action and the character development make sense and ring true. Even the music is far superior to the original.

","This remake ditches the consumer satire of the 70's original, accepting that malls are too much a part of normal life to be worthy of serious scorn. Instead, Snyder goes for excitement, with zombies that are feral rather than piteous and sequences inspired as much by Aliens as the original Dawn. Characters are broadly but well drawn, and Synder is not afraid to let good people die and bad ones live. In particular, the character of ""CJ"" shows the sophistication of the film in comparison to the cut-and-dried moralising of much modern horror. Some of the gore is incredibly nasty, and the tone is refreshingly sincere, without any Scream-style ""irony"" to water down the suspense. This is not a horror film for couples on dates to cuddle to: this is grim, ferocious, mature stuff whose ideas unsettle as much as the crazed violence it depicts. Even the post-credit sequence throws a new, bleaker light on the previous carnage. The acting is good, but the sense of sadness and apocalypse of the original is traded in for excitement and extra thrills; an inevitable exchange, given the faster pace of the remake. The first ten minutes are a good indicator of the rest of the film: often disgusting, sometimes frightening, and good throughout."

You see, what made the original 'Dead' movies so amazing to me was that there was so much more to them than brains and guts spattering everywhere (though lots of this too). They were as much a comment on society as they were anything else. Look at how much the characters changed while they were trapped inside the mall, and how easily their safe-world crashed down once the bikers came on the scene. I'm not ashamed to say that I came away from these movies actually thinking. But with the new 'Dawn of the Dead', I wasn't really left with anything at all."

So if you see other people winging that, ""it's not as good as the origional"" just ignore it. GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE for yourself. Ignore the title and accept it for the quality modern horror that it is.

The comic relief between the scary, frightening, disgusting (very), and genuinely sad moments is timed perfectly.

","I have been enjoying the general consensus of reviews, that this is a worthy reinterpretation of a classic horror movie, and that there is not any point comparing it to the original plot point for plot point. I look at this movie as an homage to good old fashioned zombie-fare, that people in peril makes for as good a premise as any for a thrilling movie, and if the peril is coming from flesh-eating zombies...well it doesn't get much better than that for me!<br/><br/>I love the Romero zombie trilogy, my favorite film is Dawn of the Dead, but for sheer gore and chills, Day of the Dead is my choice. This movie is not to be included in my appreciation of Romero's low-budget genius, for how can you compare what a filmmaker does with 26 million as opposed to 2 million, Romero wins hands down! But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for its sheer exhibitionism, its modern take on the zombie genre and for having a pretty good mix of gore, thrills, humor and respect for zombiephiles! I also think it really cool that some actors who you would have thought would turn up their noses at starring in a potentially B-grade horror flick saw fit to do some slumming on such a film. Maybe, just as Toy Story made it chic to lend your voice to animation, this movie will have big name stars clamboring to join the horror cheese flick bandwagon!! (remember Piper Laurie in Carrie? Kathy Bates won an Oscar for Misery! Imagine Meryl Streep treading the boards with the Creature from the Black Lagoon :)<br/><br/>The only thing that I still find hard to accept is the fast-moving zombie. Zombies, like vampires, have a history, and when you mess with that, you risk alienating fans. I feel that the filmmakers could still have held on to the traditional zombie and had just as much fright, it's all in how you compose your film. However, I still had a great time (with my hands over my ears and my head hunkered down) watching this movie, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good scare!"

A moviegoer in the row behind me was trembling so hard he shook both rows of seats, eliciting comments from a number of others in the theater.<br/><br/>Many have compared the opening sequences of the two movies, Dawn1's opening with a chaotic news show is the more disturbing of the two, Dawn2's opening is consistent with modern horror and is above average for the genre. Both movies remain consistent to the themes established in the opening sequences, Dawn1 is slower, has more substance and shock value; Dawn2 is fast paced and goes for the throat. The pace of Dawn2 continues to quicken until the end when it becomes a struggle to comprehend the staccoto of images hammering at your brain. I am still not sure how several events exactly happened, particularly the 'rescue' and the 'escape', only that they did happen.<br/><br/>Several things were distracting in Dawn2, even annoying: The primal cat screams of the zombies for one. I found myself wincing just from the volume of the screaches and my dread of the zombies was more rooted in the sounds they made than their viciousness, which was also distracting. There is no doubt that in real life, the zombies of Dawn2 would be scarier and deadlier. Romero's zombies were a force of nature, chaotic and opportunistic; you could survive if you were quick enough and smart enough. Snyder's zombies are so vicious and fast, it is difficult to imagine surviving on wits and certainly not on speed, maybe with a tank. The one burr that really bucked my horse was the infection angle which seems directly lifted from 28 Days Later. All dead people came to life in the original (except maybe those with brain damage?), but in the remake zombification is spread via bites like rabies. If the zombies are infected with some disease, it makes the tagline, 'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' seem superfluous.<br/><br/>It is easy to nitpick, few movies survive close scrutiny. Overall the people in Dawn2 act within the normal range of human behavior, sometimes smart, sometimes stupid. There is the requisite moment when your mind is screaming 'DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR!', but if you've driven on a freeway you understand that people are sometimes inexplicably dumb. Darwin Rules!<br/><br/>I would give it a 7/10 overall, 9/10 for the genre. The remake is a visceral experience. I highly recommend you go experience it."
"Ronin47","9","0","0","28 March 2004"," Very good remake of my all-time favorite film (***1/2)
","There's no other way to start this review than to state that George A. Romero's original, 1978 masterpiece ""Dawn Of The Dead"", about 4 survivors of a zombie plague setting up house in an empty shopping mall, is my favorite movie of all time. I remember the first time I saw it like it was yesterday.<br/><br/>
A lot of the other fans of the original were upset at the idea of this remake, but I was excited. I'm not a purist, so as long as the makers paid respect to the original and made a good-enough movie that wasn't TOO stupid, I'd be happy. Well, I couldn't be happier to tell you that unlike the lame botch-job that was the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake, this ""Dawn..."" remake met my expectations...and then some. <br/><br/>Technically, it's not being called a ""remake"" but rather a ""re-envisioning"", because the characters and sequence of events are quite different. I didn't mind this, because it's far more interesting to see a reworking of a theme than an exact remake, and there is lots of interesting ground left to cover in Romero's brilliantly imagined post-apocalyptic society.<br/><br/>
After the unexplained plague hits and proceeds to turn all of society upside down within a matter of hours, a few survivors, which include a nurse (great indie actress Sarah Polley), a cop (Ving Rhames), and a young man (Mekhi Phifer) with his very pregnant Russian girlfriend (Inna Korobkina), head to the local mall looking for shelter. <br/><br/>Once they lock the entrances and it's clear that no help is coming, they proceed for a while to build a new life in the shopping mall. It's a fascinating concept, building an insulated, miniature utopian society inside this giant mall, while just outside, the whole world is crumbling.<br/><br/>
The problem, though, is that there are far too many characters in this one. In the original, there were only four, and as a result they were each extremely well developed. Here, there's at least 15 people in the mall, and many of them seem to be just filling space. <br/><br/>Though it's true that Romero's smart social commentary takes a backseat here to hard-driving action scenes, this is still a very tough and intelligent film. A few other critics and I picked up on an eerie, distinctly post-9/11 vibe, the idea of living in a burned-out, post-apocalyptic America (an American flag makes an ironic appearance near the end). Hmm, maybe the zombies are George W. Bush's followers? <br/><br/>Ultimately, writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder have gone out of their way to make a really fine film here, and it shows. They don't stray far from Romero's vision or dumb-down the material, they retained much of his dark humor, they assembled a quality cast, and included several clever cameos and in-jokes for those of us familiar with the original.<br/><br/>
So it's not Romero, but it's still a hell of a good time.<br/><br/>And be sure not to arrive late. The first 10 minutes of this film (which includes what is bar none the best opening credits sequence I've seen in years), make for a powerful experience all their own."

"dsebag","10","0","0","22 March 2004"," The definitive horror in every way. THIS IS HORROR AT ITS WORSE!
","I like to see horror movies to escape from reality at times.  The only trouble is most of them feel fake or to make Hollywood happy it's toned down or it gets a ""happy"" ending.  The original Dawn of the dead gave you a feel of terror and helplessness... but probably due to a low budget it couldn't go all the way so it wasn't ferocious enough.   Every missing aspect of the original has been integrated in this update and it never lets you down. When you leave this movie any problem you may have in your personal life is nothing compared to what the world is perceived as in this picture.  Even without reflection you feel some sort of comfort to be on the other side of the screen.  A real horror movie isn't made to give you cheap scares, it's made to terrify you.  If it achieves that, you know that the movie deserves its due credit.  In every possible way Dawn of the Dead 2004 is the best horror movie ever made in history and since the last ""best horror movie"" was the original Dawn, I don't think it will ever be topped... well maybe in one case: Since this movie was rated R, the DVD will probably be released as ""Unrated"" like the original Dawn was.  If that is the case it could well be the most disgusting movie ever made as well! (Day of the Dead (1984 Unrated) is still the champion because of its realism.)  Most people can't think with this frame of mind but if you keep the frame of mind I'm writing about, you too will enjoy this masterpiece!"
"Doctor_Cheese","7","0","0","22 March 2004"," Above-Average Entry in a Crap-Ridden Horror Subgenre
","The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it is a completely different animal from the 1978 horror masterpiece by zombie auteur George A. Romero.  The two films share a title and a few superficial details of plot and setting, but other than that, they have little in common.  This movie is not as philosophically deep, intelligent, witty, or suspenseful as Romero's. It's a strictly modern horror flick, and by `modern' I mean that it has typically shallow, flat characters; frequently stupid and vulgar dialogue; and that annoying, MTV-style, this-might-be-scary-if-you-could-tell-what-the-****-was-happening kind of editing. If you go into it with this in mind, you will enjoy it more.<br/><br/>And so the next thing that needs to be said is that, despite its self-imposed limitations as an ADD-generation movie, the new `Dawn' still manages to be above-average zombie flesh-eating entertainment -- easily the best entry in this horror subgenre in years (though, considering all the crap out there, that isn't saying a whole lot). So before I get to my list of cons/pet peeves, I'll mention some of the positive aspects of this movie.<br/><br/>First, the changes to the story go beyond the standard, gratuitous, change-for-the-sake-of-change sort. There are some truly inventive elements here, such as the impressive scenes of devastation at the beginning of the film, the lone survivor on the rooftop across from our heroes and their relationship with him, and the well done `Blair Witch' style coda during the end credits. Overall, the whole `zombie epidemic' is handled pretty slickly and without any of that snarky, postmodern self-consciousness that sinks so many remakes of well-known classics.<br/><br/>Next, although the zombie splatter action is not as over-the-top graphic as it is in Romero's classics, director Zack Snyder avoids the cop-out cutaway shot often enough to satisfy at least the casual gorehound. (Actually, some scenes serve to remind just how wimpy your average splatter horror movie has become these days.)<br/><br/>And while it's true that the powerful subtext of Romero's work and his sardonic wit are absent in the new `Dawn,' there are still some moments of black comedy that really are pretty funny. (Watch for the `celebrity' shoot-'em-up sequence for a prime example.)<br/><br/>Finally, the music selections are inspired, from Johnny Cash in the opening credits to Richard Cheese during the midpoint comic relief to `People Who Died' by the Jim Carroll Band during the closing credits (I didn't think more than a handful of people even knew that song existed). Throw in some well placed muzak selections, and it becomes clear that someone with a brain deliberately worked on the soundtrack. Awesome!<br/><br/>Now for the bad things. Perhaps most prominently, the movie suffers from the `modern' attributes mentioned above. The characters are not given a chance to truly develop; you never really know any of them and, hence, don't particularly care about them. To be fair, I think screenwriter James Gunn did make an effort to infuse some life into our intrepid heroes, but there are just too many characters (read: zombie fodder) for even the most skilled writer to develop. As a result, what characterization there is almost seems like an afterthought, and some of the actions of the characters are just inexplicable. (I suspect the DVD, when it comes out, may offer a number of deleted scenes that help, ahem, flesh things out more.)<br/><br/>Nobody watches zombie movies for the dialogue, but I wish Hollywood screenwriters didn't feel the need to gratuitously throw the `f-word' and other assorted obscenities into every other sentence. I'm not prudishly averse to cussing, but a forced excess of expletives just detracts from the import of what's actually said and reminds viewers of the inherently juvenile nature of Hollywood moviemaking these days.<br/><br/>As for the MTV-video style editing, do I really need to explain how much better it would be if the director let your eye focus on the action for more than a tenth of a second?<br/><br/>Overall, the new `Dawn' owes more to `28 Days Later' than its namesake, at least as far as the zombie mythology goes. Like Romero's films, the cause of the zombie plague is unknown, and also like in Romero's films, it doesn't matter. Unlike Romero's films, however, the clues point more to a virus, as in Danny Boyle's pseudo-zombie epic. Here the zombies are definitely dead, but they also movie rapidly, again as in `28 Days Later.' And although I prefer the creeping sense of dread of Romero's slow-moving animated corpses, I found the fast zombies didn't bother me as much as I thought they would. What really bothered me was the stupid wildcat noises they made when they attacked. Why would walking (ok, running) corpses make noises like that? Dumb.<br/><br/>However, in the movie's favor, the zombies here sometimes make more sense than Romero's.  In particular, there's one scene where a zombie is chasing down someone to eat, but then abruptly breaks off pursuit as soon as he spots an easier mark. Romero's zombies like to kill people, begin eating them, then stop as soon as they see someone else to kill, leaving you to wonder why they would bother chasing someone else when they already have something to eat.<br/><br/>Oh well. In the end, as Chief McLellan from `Night of the Living Dead' puts it, `They're dead. They're all messed up.'<br/><br/>Not a masterpiece, but still recommended for fans of the living dead."
"AMIO-PatricioMunoz","Null","0","0","22 March 2004"," This is a ""MUST SEE"" film.
","NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's good!<br/><br/>REMAKE films usually never live up to the original.  This is one of those rare few films that DO.  I have seen many zombie movies including the DEAD series films by George A. Romero.  The concept of this series is extremely fascinating.<br/><br/>Obviously, the special effects of the original film are nowhere near the effects of this movie.  There are a lot of amazing shots in this Remake that make the film worth watching again and again.<br/><br/>Yes, the zombies are fast in this movie.  I liked the ""dumb and slow"" zombie of the Romero films.  Their slow yet dangerous approach gave way to a painful anticipation that really kept you on the very edge of your seat. The new film also does this, and does it very well only in a different way.<br/><br/>You can tell by the success of Resident Evil, 28 Days Later, and Dawn of the Dead(2004), that the Zombie concept is popular again.  Based on the obvious success of this film, we are sure to see a remake of the next movie in the Romero series: ""Day of the Dead"" (Also a VERY good zombie movie). Depending on the success of that, we may even see a NEW addition to the series: ""Dusk of the Dead?""  (That's jumping ahead).<br/><br/>This movie has amazing sequences with very good shots, yet it has many plot holes, obviously.  It is not the best script in the world.  It is not full of subtext and inner-meaning.  If you are looking for that then DO NOT see this film.  Remember that it is a fast paced ZOMBIE MOVIE, not ""CITIZEN KANE"".  Embrace the concept for what it is and enjoy the flic!"
"Hero_Boy","10","0","0","22 March 2004"," Just to verify some things
","First of all, despite popular belief, rigomortis (pardon my spelling) sets in after hours of being dead. Dead bodies turn to zombies in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Rigomortis can be stopped in a dead body by simply excersizing the muscles, breaking up the rigomortis. So it makes sense that a dead body WOULD actually be able to run, jump, swim and skate normally if they wanted to. Second of all, the idea of ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the Earth,"" is just a theory of what is going on. That COULD be a possibility, but there are many others. Notice that when a person is bitten they are poisoned by the bite and die and are reanimated. (The next sentence could be a spoiler!) Yet, when Ving Rhames' character probably gets blood in his cut, he lives. Perhaps this disease or epidemic is infectuos only through the zombie's saliva, or maybe a bacteria in their mouths. There was also talks of ""If this was a disease then how'd it infect the whole world in one night?"" Try and think for yourself on this one. Maybe terrorist organizations created a man made super virus and set it off in every major country. Who knows? All in all this movie was simply put AMAZING. In my opinion it is even a better movie than the original. It seems to capture more of an apocolyptic feel to it. I'm buying the limited special collector's edition if there ever is one."

","Ok what's up with so many people making a movie about people getting infected by other people and then spreading it to other people is that like the horror in-style thing! These people are stuck in this big mall and are dumb enough to let other infected people in and go out and try to get infected themselves. Then they come up with this big old plan to plow over these people to get away.. Ok that's pretty ok except for the fact that everyone in the entire world except for like the 10 people are infected so odds are you aren't going to make to much progress. Then of course it was a dumb movie with no horror, for one you know what was going to happen and nothing was to great about the movie. Then of course to go an hour and half in a movie and have all this bad stuff happen u new the ending was to good to be true so u could predict that in the end that was going to happen. The acting wasn't too bad some of the actors really did a good part, but otherwise this was a pretty bad movie.

","Im not a massive fan of remakes (The Blob and Psycho anyone?). I avoided The Texas Chainsaw Masacre like the plague because the original is one of my favourite horror movies and dont even get me started on The Italian Job. Dont ask me why i went to see this one. The original Dawn of The Dead, even though it was overly long, was still a damn good film! I guess i was curious and i had heard good things about it (unlike Chainsaw).<br/><br/>After watching it i can conclude that other than the fact that it's set in a shopping mall this is a very different beast to the original. There's more characters, more action and the Zombies are a hellovalot more scary! This is a cross between the original and 28 Days Later (which was also a damn good film). The fact that the Zombies can now run makes it more believable that they can take over the planet. They're just so relentless.<br/><br/>The opening ten minutes of this film are possibly the most disturbing i have ever seen. i cant explain why just see the movie and find out.<br/><br/>
Like the original though this movie starts to drag in the middle. Although there are the odd moments that are disturbing or disgusting (or both, the Zombie baby is not a pleasent experience) that keep your attention until the final act, which ditches the horror aspect for all out action.<br/><br/>This is where the movies major flaw lies as the end half hour is a mission to make you feel sick and its not because of the gore. Every shot is handheld and after the first five minutes you'll be craving for a break or attempting to keep you pop-corn in. It is very dissorientating and is only for people that dont suffer from motion sickness.<br/><br/>The end of this movie does leave it open for a Day of The Dead remake to follow but how it will be done i dont know. As with every remake these days this is the very definition of the term ""re-imagining"" and if you're expecting the original walk away coz this is a totally different film and a damn good one at that.<br/><br/>4/5"
"TomPaine-3","8","0","0","28 March 2004"," Very good, but not iconic
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I had low hopes for this film, considering that the original Dawn of the Dead is my favourite horror. I was rather pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying this.<br/><br/>Where it differs for the original is that it lacks that movies political angle on consumerism and greed. In that movie the zombies go to the mall because it was something they used to do. In this version they go to the mall to eat people. And that's it. No political motivation or satire on American consumer culture. Let's call this re-make (or re-imagining) a zombie movie for the MTV generation.<br/><br/>Thats not to say the re-make has its faults. With the exception of Michael or Kenneth there is really is no sympathetic character to latch onto - most seem to fall into one-dimensional stereotypes such Steve the selfish one or Andre the street punk who is finally wiseing up to responsibilities. I could not really handle Ana at all - what was the point of her character? I figure she was there to have someone the audience could identify with - the average person who is caught up with something way beyond their control. However her behaviour seems odd. She seems to figure out what's happening and then going all gooey and showing reluctance to use that knowledge for the benefit of the group? Huh? <br/><br/>And what exactly was that ending about? Shades of Cannibal Holocaust here with the filming of the fate(?) of the final survivors. Personally I would have left a more enigmatic ending with the final fadeout of them going to a destination unknown.<br/><br/>Still what's the point of carping about what is a very good and entertaining film. It may lack the human frailties of the original and the iconic zombie figure. I suppose that's the message - when we become a zombie no one stands out.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","(WARNING - may contain spoilers. Actually, it WILL contain them.)<br/><br/> OH this came so close to perfect! I have a few gripes about it, and a few good comments.<br/><br/> First the gripes:<br/><br/>1) WHY are the dead walking?? Sure, the priest *suggests* that Hell is full, but it never really just comes out and says it. I wanna know what happened to these folks! Maybe the mystery is supposed to be part of the horror, but when I see a horror movie, I want answers!<br/><br/>2) To me, the movie starts out WAY too fast. Everything is hunkey-dorey when BOOM she's thrust into a world of terror for no particular reason. All within the first 10-15 minutes. I want a story to set up at least a little bit before I see people mutilated.<br/><br/> Now the nice compliments: 1) In this one, the dead were actually scary!! None of that ""fifty years in the grave"" look with grey make-up and old men. And none of that ""Buuhhhhh I'm coming to get you"" slow zombie stomp/walk with the arms straight forward thing, either. No chanting of ""Brains! Brains!"" The dead were like normal people only harder to kill because they were FAST!!! Now the characters actually have reason to run. The dead are more like the savages we make them out to be, not 99-year-old geezers that have the munchies.<br/><br/>
2) The ending. At first I thought it was dissappointing, but then I watched the rest of the credits and was thoroughly fulfilled of my need to NOT have a ""Drifting into the sunset"" ending. <br/><br/>All in all, I'm giving this movie an 8, which in my book is really, really good!"

Yes, its a pretty cool movie while your watching it, but beyond that, its your run of the mill hollywood horror production thats ultimately forgettable. The movie had  cool scenes here and there, but failed to develop an interesting plot besides a bunch of people shooting zombies and telling corny jokes.

","I saw the original film years ago and admired it for it for the suspense and for the social commentary it made. It was much more than just a gore film. I only wished that it could have been better acted and have a bigger budget. This remake is much slicker than the original could ever be thanks to CGI and just-plain-better actors. However most of the social commentary and satire found in the original has been replaced by video-game style gore. The original contained many jabs at America's consumer-driven society. This film misses that boat entirely and is much shallower than the original. In my opinion, 28 Days is much scarier and more suspenseful BECAUSE of the social commentary it makes. You end up caring much more for the characters in 28 Days. In this remake of Dawn, you do end up caring very much about some of the characters, but there are too many people to keep track of and for that reason, some of the gore scenes miss out on the added emotional punch that existed in the original flick. This remake of Dawn of the Dead is not a stinker by any means. It's entertaining, I just think it could have been a lot more than what it was.  I wish someone would remake this again, only better."
"ForReal84","8","0","0","27 March 2004"," This dawn is no yawn
","DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) is one of the best remakes or re-envisioning of a classic film. Actually this is not a remake at all, everything is different expect for the title and the whole mall idea. While I am a huge fan of the original and I believe that it is stupid and a waste of time to revisit an old idea, I found this film to be better then the original concept. I can't imagine what it would be like if something like this were to happen in `real' life. I'm happy that this hasn't happened yet, but it is quite an experience watching it happen to a group of characters. When I first heard that there was going to be another film called Dawn of the Dead, I was hoping that it was not going to be in any way connected to the one that I have seen a million times. I mean if you saw the remake of the original Night of the Living Dead, then you may know what I'm talking about¬Ötalk about a waste of time, that was one of the worst films I have ever seen. But back to the new Dead, I saw the first ten minutes of the film air on the USA network a couple of days ago and from then on I was hooked. It stopped right after the main character Ana crashes her car into a tree. Sitting in the theater I couldn't wait for that to finish so I could see the rest of the film. Believe me I was not let down, I think that this is an awesome movie filled with some great scares and a few laughs. So many times horror films lose steam half way through the film, but Dawn only built up steam. From the first ten minutes one can get a sense that this is going to be a fast paced film, and see that there is not going to be much time to breath. I also found all of the characters to be very interesting, although I thought there were a few too many characters. In the original there are four people who must survive, but in the remake there are a lot more people that we have to watch out for. Many of them were just there to stand in the back, and were cause for a great death scene. <br/><br/>After a hard day's work the only thing that Ana wanted was some r and r, but what she got was a whole different story. The film takes us on a wild ride in the lives of a group of strangers who come together to fight for their lives. After awaking to a horrifying sight, Ana must escape from the man that she has come to know and love. Soon Ana finds herself with of group of other desperate strangers who take refugee in a near by shopping mall. Inside the mall the meet three security guards and take in a rig full of helpless outsiders looking for a safe base. Inside the mall they keep out the living dead and try to go on with their lives while waiting for help. As everyone one knows that all good things must come to an end, so the group which has been downsized, decide to escape the mall and travel to an island where they can rebuild their broken lives. Now with a plan in hand a small group of the living must outsmart a large group of the dead.<br/><br/>
Usually in most horror films there are up and coming actors (who can't act scared if a zombie bit them in the ass) who are living in their fifteen minutes of fame. Rarely do we get the treat of watching a group of talented actors scream their way through a film, well in this fright fest we are exposed to a group of very talented actors. Playing Ana, Sarah Polley delivers a strong performance playing an even stronger character. Her mix of rage and beauty helps her to take charge of the screen. Ving Rhames, whom I believe to be one of the most underrated actors, take charge in this film. He is an amazing actor and turns in another solid performance. Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer play too very different characters and are very believable in their roles. Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth, who are reuniting a second time on screen after their small roles in another excellent horror film WRONG TURN, play their characters in unique ways. For Zegers, who has few lines, he is very demanding when he is one screen and Booth, plays the helpless girl to a tee. While all of the other actors deserve to be mentioned I think that by saying they all do an excellent job is fair enough, because many times audiences are not paying attention to the performances the actors are giving anyway.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead truly is a film worth seeing. There are good performances, a solid recreation of a classic, an awesome score, many scares, and even a few laughs. If you haven't seen it go see it right now stop reading get in your car and go¬Öif not for anything else go to at least check out the ending. Dawn has one of the best endings to a horror movie that I have seen in a long time it is scary and original. I am going to give Dawn of the Dead 3.7 stars out of 4 and an A-!"

","I am a fan of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"".  I was in high school at the time and it was the first movie that really scared the bejesus out of me.  The extreme gore, and the heartpounding opening sequence where a group of people escape within inches of their lives.  This movie feels like it would've been better with another rewrite. It's too scattered to feel that sense of danger.  Only the 3 main characters thankfully have a bit of depth.  When the rest of the troop bites it over the the course of the movie,  it's little more than scorekeeping for the audience.  <br/><br/>At least the film tried to explore a couple different angles from the first. But it feels like the first film had a bigger budget.  There are stretched out moments with no action, even our friends the zombies don't appear for long periods of time.  I liked some of the morality play,  and Jake Weber does a solid job as the voice of reason. <br/><br/>
I just didn't get the heebie jeebies like I thought I would.  ""28 Days Later"" got some good attention,  because you could sense the fear.

","The internet, because it is so high-tech, allows for many useful functions and uses. One of them is to let me tell everybody (who can read) how f***ing spectacular this movie is. No previous zombie film... maybe even ANY horror film... comes close to delivering as much terror and awe as this theatrical legend does. Any pessimist or coffee shop-employed, movie critic wannabe can just shove a cracked baseball bat up their ass instead of bitching about how ""It wasn't as good as the 1978 version."" or ""It reminded me of 28 Days Later...) WAAAH!!! Cry me a river and drown yourself in it, douchebag. This piece of work has a potpourri cast of characters that really beautifies the film and makes you think ""It's great that these people are here, respecting each other as humans, charging foward each day in an attempt to survive... however, it is sad that it took a tragedy of this magnitude to get them here."" Besides the characters, it has a great soundtrack for the type of film it is and shows vast improvement over the 1978 versions cliche disco-horror music. The lounge-version of ""Down with the Sickness"" and the closing credits song are absolutely fantastic. The movie itself is a great evolved piece of George A. Romero's screenplay and is a testament to his genius and Zack Synder's courage and prowess."

","This movie was almost as good as the first one which is a complement since the first film is a classic.  There are many movie remakes these days which try to show an updated version and usually ends up being very ""cheesey"".  While there are a few things I would have not done with this film it is VERY entertaining.  While the main idea of the movie is here and has many parallels to the original there are many differences as well.<br/><br/>Some of the similarities are the zombies of course, once you get bitten you turn into one.  Shoot them in the head and they die.  The few survivors take refuge in a mall.<br/><br/>The differences are the speed of the zombies.  The origional had them walk slowly towards you which, in my opinion, makes it more suspenseful and makes the zombies look more ... well dead I guess you can say.  The fast moving zombies in this version is exciting as well but just gives it a very different feel.  More of an adrenaline rush then a scared feeling.  There is no biker gang in this one which was a really nice touch in the first.  And in this movie seemed more of a stand-alone film while the original was obviously a sequel where everyone knew about the zombies from the beginning, again in my opinion was a little better since we already know what the zombie problem is about.<br/><br/>Some of the things I found to be kind of stupid in this movie (and there are only a few) is when ***SPOILER ALERT*** Nicole (the young girl in the movie) went out in a truck to save the dog.  And she actually made it. Give me a break...  If it was that easy to get food to the guy in the other building they should have done so earlier... Another thing is the way they hooked up the trucks... reminded me too much of the old show the A-Team... and why did they put bobwire on the tops of the trucks... they are zombies who do not feel pain.  Why put them on there. Also there were many zombies in the parking garage where the trucks were? And lastly... I wish we got to know the characters better... they all seemed a little flat.... and they should have shown Mekhi's character going a little nuts to explain better why he acted the way he did.....  other then these few things I thought this move was perfect...<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps some.  I think everyone who loves horror, action and black humor would enjoy this film.  Hopefully this movie will pave the way for more zombie movies and may have George Romero make a fourth installment to his living dead movies."

","Upon seeing Dawn of the dead 2004 I  was amazed at how they took the classic and only made it better.  I am a fan of the original dawn and felt this interpretation was good. With the advances made in the make-up effects industry, the zombie look and attitude was much more animalistic. which I think make the zombies more of a threat. the casting was a stroke of brilliance. No it isn't the original, it's not ever going to be and doesn't try. That the best part of it. This film I feel will stand on it's own.

","I have been waiting for ""Dawn Of The Dead"" for weeks.  My favorite movie as a youth is ""The Omega Man"", and this is a more visceral, exciting film. No morality plays or super heroes here.  Just some very ordinary people who trying to survive the unimaginable.<br/><br/>The key to a film like this is seeing it in the right locale.  I chose a theatre in the 'hood, and typical of urban filmgoers, the audience was unrestrained with their reactions.  Even I started yelling directions at the screen (mostly like ""Shoot her"") when the survivors would do the stupidest things (I guess people in horror films have never seen a horror film).<br/><br/>Ving Rhames gave his usual superlative performance as an implacable police officer/bad ass.  I especially liked Jake Weber as a nobody who rises to the occasion, but without any surfeit heroism.<br/><br/>There was little character development or social commentary, but you were at the wrong film if were expecting that.  I liked the small touches, like the coffee bar's name, ""Hallowed Grounds"", or the relationship by binocular with the stranded gun shop owner across the road.<br/><br/>Bottom line, after my friends dropped me off, they politely waited until I got into my building before driving away.  As I soon as I saw them pull off, I ran into the street chasing after them, like a zombie in the film.  They were laughing madly as they sped away, just like they would if a real zombie was after them.  I doubt I would have such a fun and spontaneous reaction if we had just come back from ""The Seventh Seal""."
"TMAN247","8","0","0","26 March 2004"," Excellent movie, but not worthy of the moniker.
","It is certainly refreshing to see a movie like Dawn of the Dead is doing so well in the box office.  This movie was beautiful in it's presentation of the apocalypse, full of dramatic camera angles, pulse pounding situations, and a realistic view of how people would act when faced with almost certain doom.<br/><br/>  With the above being said, it doesn't deserve the name Dawn of the Dead. Despite the originals obvious shortcomings, i.e. cheesy make-up and techni-color blood, the originals story was much better.  It's presentation is stark, which in my opinion adds to the realism.  And the original is much gorier, which is part of the reason I see zombie movies to begin with. <br/><br/>
  The similarities between the two movies are weak, basically being trapped in a mall, and the strong characters being a woman and an African-American the only similarities (for those of you who are younger, this really was an important issue back in 1978, with the original Dawn of the Dead getting praise for it use of different types of heroes).   The monsters of the new film, and the zombies of the old are not even comparable; they are completely different in their nature.<br/><br/>  I congratulate the makers of this film for what it was.  I wish it would have been released with a different name, since I feel it still would be successful.  <br/><br/>  My rating is an 8/10."

","Saw it yesterday.<br/><br/> WOW!<br/><br/> I wasn't sure I would like ""fast"" zombies (haven't seen 28 Days Later yet - so won't compare).<br/><br/> These zombies were SCARY.<br/><br/> Well acted, well shot and the editing is good (not great). The story is about as good as it gets for a zombie flick.<br/><br/> This version WORKS and it works VERY well.<br/><br/> The Opening scene is creepy to the max and before the title, you are in no doubt of what is to follow.  Probably the best build up in a zombie flick yet.<br/><br/> It begins with a ""normal"" day in the hospital for an everyday kind of nurse, Ana (Sarah Polley), but soon, the world is turned upside down and shaken.<br/><br/> Ving Rhames, as Kenneth, is AWESOME and I actually felt RELIEVED when his character entered the picture.<br/><br/> The acting is solid with performances by Jake Weber `Michael', Mekhi Phifer `Andre', Micahel Kelly `CJ', Bruce Bohne `Andy' and a bit part by Matt Frewer that is poignant and effective.<br/><br/> I was impressed by the casting. I was immediately and easily able to suspend disbelief and accept the characters as `real'.  I do not expect character studies in these films, I expect sketches and fairly 2 dimensional attitudes. Kenneth, Michael and Andy were my favorite characters, but all of the `A' parts were well acted.<br/><br/> What was REALLY nice to see is that they stayed away from the Survival Horror stereotype characters - perhaps even introducing new ones.  The characters responded `realistically' and ""logically"" to their situations (based on THEIR perspectives and perceived values.)<br/><br/> Andy on the Gunshop was clever and a very interesting part of the story.<br/><br/> While there are indeed some SHOCKS, I regret to say that they did ""pull some punches"".  While not as pornographically gory as the Italian Splatterflicks or even the original, there were definitely guts, blood and exploding heads.  But Private Ryan still holds the title for pure gore (I haven't seen the Passion yet).  This was disappointing because instead of an original zombie flick this was a remake of a classic, one that defined a genre.  To whimp out on the gore is nearly unforgivable.<br/><br/> Also missing was the campiness of the original, though there are plenty of intentional humorous incidents to punctuate the horror.  Also gone are Romero's social commentaries.  This film isn't about society, it is about surviving the insane.<br/><br/> The original holds a special place in my heart and I was VERY concerned about the remake - Hollywood has screwed up a lot of decent opportunities lately.  I am pleased to say that this film was ""done right"".<br/><br/> Could it have been done better? Sure, but it will do as is, at least until the ""uncut"" version is released on DVD.<br/><br/> BTW, I really liked Savini's remake of Night of the Living Dead and in many ways prefer it over the original.  Not that it is better, but I think it is better executed and I liked his spin. Therefore, since I liked the remakes of NotLD and DotD, then I actually look forward to and HOPE they remake Day of the Dead.<br/><br/> The Mad Hobbit's rating:  ""See it now"".<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/> Setting the stage with longshots of the city were AWESOME - a LOT to look at and just enough time to look, before we go back to action.  In the first long shot of the city, watch the lower center of the screen at first, before gazing at the rest - you will have time.<br/><br/> The meeting of Ana and Kenneth was a bit contrived, but trust me, the movie quickly gets back on track.<br/><br/> The intro of the mall brought a delighted giggle from me.<br/><br/> The editing is a bit muddled at times, occasionally `skipping parts' that you need to mentally fill in, for instance how they gain entrance to the locked mall.  These are few, and easily ignored, but I couldn't help but wonder why the cuts were made.<br/><br/> I wasn't fond of the change in how the dead are created.  Bite only seems to make it a virus, I always preferred the `we just don't know' explanation.<br/><br/> A lot of people complained about the absence of `character' zombies, like> the Hare Krishnans, cheerleaders etc.  I actually didn't mind the loss, in fact it would have been distracting.<br/><br/> I didn't like the whole dog storyline and thought that they pussied out by passing on some zombie dog possibilities.<br/><br/> Also, when the girl `Nicole'(?) goes to 'rescue' the dog, not only did I groan at the clich√É¬© but I couldn't help wondering that if it was so easy for her to drive over to Andy's Gun Shop, why didn't they do it earlier?<br/><br/> When they finally leave in the shuttles, I still am not sure why the second one crashed - I felt it was again `contrived' instead of `natural or logical'.<br/><br/> BTW - do not jump up when credits roll, throughout the credits are glimpses of the REAL ending of the film.  Which is not only cool but raises ANOTHER gripe, and a reason why I can't rave as heartily about this film, we really don't get to SEE the zombies in this film. Oh, sure there a few obligatory scenes, but the glimpses in the end credits really had me wishing there had been MORE."

The beginning of the film before the credits rolled got the audience to clap and cheer, it was just that exciting and brutal. Civilization at the very moment of collapse, the point where 911 fails, police and paramedics just can't do their jobs anymore and our main characters are left to jump in their car and floor it to safety. Excellent fun. If you want a possible happy ending, LEAVE when the final credits start. If you stay through the credits you'll be left with a sad, disturbing ending which I was not happy with because I just wanted everyone to finally be safe, and thats not what happens.

","First of all, before you spend your hard earned 8 bucks, if your looking for a film that will win any awards or touch you in a spiritual way, stay home. But if your looking to see a good zombie flick with plenty of thrills and gore, you should definately check it out.<br/><br/>As with any remake you will have the usual critics that will tear the movie down just because its a remake, wheither its good or not. Dont let them make up your mind for you.<br/><br/>The basic plot of DOTD remains the same though there are many changes to the storyline which are always welcome. The use of gore, I think was almost perfect. Not too much, and it was in very realistic ways. Also, the humor was kept to a minimum. There are a couple of one liners that could have been left out but not enough to pay attention to.<br/><br/>The ending was left wide open for a sequal, which I would welcome if done in the same style by the same director.<br/><br/>To sum it up this was the BEST zombie flick I have seen. If you enjoy a good horror flick, check it out. You wont be disappointed."

","As a zombie purist, I too was concerned about the newer, faster zombies. I guess we can thank ""28 Days Later"" for this development.  However, once you get past that objection and just go with this film, you'll find it's not that bad as a stand-alone horror film.  If you keep harking back to the Romero trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed, but if you look at this as an update of the earlier film (as was the remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" where Barbara was no longer a wimp), you may actually enjoy it! There are so many more characters to put in peril--let's face it, having only four main characters in the 1978 version limited the potential for carnage. There's lots to like about this film, including the variety of zombies (babies, obese women in slips, etc.), a cameo by the motorcycle gang leader from the original, chainsaws, and other innovations.  As to those who complain about the ending, remember the ending of the original?  None of the Romero films had satisfying endings, so why are you so upset with this one? When can we expect an updated ""Day of the Dead""?  I'm ready for it!"

","Ok, I though they played this one perfectly!  When is a remake not a remake: When it is completely re written from scratch.  The mall was a plot device used to give fans from the first movie a familiar ""place to call home"" Other than that it is not the main focus of the movie as in the first one. Next you may tout Romero and put the 1st version on a pedestal but, Romero did a great job with the budget he had.  the first was campy and the zombies shuffled around slowly but hey it worked!  In this movie as in all of the ""DEAD"" movies there is never explanation given as to why it happens it just does!  Even with the better makeup and increased action the Dead aren't the focus as much as the interplay between the characters and their isolation.<br/><br/>My main issues are with the credit scenes.  They sail off... to where? they are in Wisconsin the clips make it look like they are out of water so; last I checked they couldn't be at sea! The fuel thing was ridiculous they are in a sailboat. And why couldn't they fish for food?  Eventually the DEAD would decompose and slowdown.  And why in the remake of Night were the dead fighting over a rat but they don't eat dog?"

","Being a faithful follower of George Romero's Dead trilogy (Night, Dawn, and Day), I was somewhat satisfied with the remake of Dawn of the Dead. It has great action!!!! However, it lacks in some areas. There are too many characters, thus leading to a lack of character depth. The running zombies just didn't cut it for me as it reminded us of the ghouls in 28 days later (i.e., seemed like a sequel to 28 days later at times). Finally, if the dead are returning to life, then why is it only those who have been bitten?!?!?!? Those shot or dying of natural causes do not re-animate!!!! That's a major difference from the trilogy and Romero's concept. MAJOR FLAW in my opinion. On the other hand, the action is great and does an amazing job at causing tension and anxiety in moviegoers (I think I checked every room in the apartment when I got home). Also, the story line is good enough to maintain one's attention. I suggest loyal and new fans go see the remake, all will enjoy!!!! Little piece of ADVICE, stay till the end of the end credits.....there are some extras to the story line...don't leave the theatre until everthing is done!!!!"

","For the record, the first 10 minutes of this film alone were worth the price of the ticket. These scenes litterally had me on the edge of my seat as Ana takes flight in a world gone hopelessly insane.<br/><br/>That being said, I have to ask: Don't any of the critics get it? So many of them are pointing to the lack of humor in this remake of the 1979 classic, or saying it moves way too fast. Baloney! Why does it have to be funny at all? This is a horror movie about the end of the world, for Pete's sake. And does anything today really move at the same slow speed that it did in 79?<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a fantastic film, finally bumping 28 Days Later off of the notch as the scariest movie in years. I'm a huge fan of the original Dawn of the Dead, but I eagerly anticipated this remake. The movie takes itself seriously, gives us a troop of heroic people to root for, and never lets up on the heart-pounding pace.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that many things that were important to the original - race relations and rampant consumerism - seem less important here. Maybe we're finally reaching the point where skin color just isn't an issue. And the mall itself, where the survivors pathetically try to hole up, doesn't even seem to be as strong a character as it was in the original. It's also interesting to note that the blood and gore, so shocking in the Romero version, doesn't shock at all now.<br/><br/>It can't. We all too quickly get caught up in the great characters. Sarah Polley, she of the deadpan delivery, has an undeniable screen presence. Ving Rhames is terrific as the tough cop, the very character you'd want to have with you when the world is ending. Jack Weber makes a completely likeable good guy, and Mekhi Phifer's desperate attempts to protect his pregnant wife are touching and tragic.<br/><br/>I had a few gripes with the sound track here and there, but for the most part, it was on target. And I loved the choice of a Johnny Cash song for background in the opening scenes.<br/><br/>If you go to the film, stay until the last credit has rolled. It will tell you how the story finally ends. If you miss it, you'll miss the end of the movie."

Hearing that Miller Park is no longer safe. Living in Milwaukee all my life, having these points made it a little more realistic for me.<br/><br/>Also very cool were the cameos by some of the cast from the 1978 version of Dawn.

","I do not understand the idea of remaking good movies. I think I'll re-paint the Mona Lisa. Why not remake bad movies? Just think, a big budget remake of Plan Nine from Outer Space.  Then again, if you wash and polish a piece of crap, it's still going to be a piece of crap. Ignoring the fact that it is a remake, the new Dawn of the Dead is a good movie.  I would call it a gore filled action movie as opposed to a horror movie. It was not scary at all. 28 Days Later is more of an actual 'horror movie.' Not many modern horror movies are actually scary any more.  They have become so post-modern that it is almost impossible to have unique scares anymore.  The good thing about this movie is that it does not take it self seriously.  James Gunn set out to write a balls to the wall zombie movie and that is exactly what he did. It is obvious that he is a student of Lloyd Kaufmann.  The zombie baby scene is something right out of the Troma Universe.  It is obvious that Gunn is a big horror movie fan.  He knows all of the elements to throw into the mix, like the a*****e you hope gets killed, the comedic yet gruesome death scene, the 'getting and plan and preparing to kick ass scene,' and countless others.  He is the perfect person to write a 'horror' movie.<br/><br/>I can do without the MTV style of editing in movies these days.  Dawn of the Dead is full of that and it gets annoying and confusing to a degree. The cinematography was great though.  It had that kind of grainy look that any horror movie should have. The picture also seemed to stay clear and focused while the camera was rapidly moving around too.   The new Dawn of the Dead is a treat for any zombie fan.  The whole argument that the zombies move too fast is just silly. There are no rules for zombies because they DON'T EXIST, so film makers can have them do whatever they want them to do. I think they are creepier when they are slow moving and lurking around, but who cares.<br/><br/>The remake ignores the capitalist and consumer oriented society metaphors because they were already explored in the original.  That would have been crossing the line of remaking into just ripping off ideas.  Have fun and go see the remake. I'm sure Mr. Romero will forgive you."

My major gripes about this movie were the plotholes, the lack of character development (most of the time you had many characters you could care less about), and the running zombies. It just doesn't make sense. HOW do the dead RUN??? Instead of overanalyzing it, I sat back and enjoyed it on opening day. There were some humorous scenes (the infamous celebrity-look-alike zombie shooting spree scene, uhh hello, that did NOT look like Burt Reynolds!) and even scenes that made me cry- namely the scene between Lindy Booth & Matt Frewer (you'll know what I'm talking about if you saw it) and the part where Andy holds up the sign that says ""Hungry"" and you could see his ribs. Pathetic I know. I never thought *I* would cry at a horror movie. <br/><br/>In any case, the Richard Cheese version of ""Down With The Sickness"" was hilarious and a great cover, it wasn't as gory as the original but it was good.

What would be the point of making a shot-for-shot re-do?  What novel and and ambitious qualities could possibly take shape?  Well many do, and I am happy to say the new Dawn of the Dead breathes a welcome, albeit supercharged ""life"" into the zombie genre. True, Zach Snyder's undead don't waddle and plod along with blank stares, which made them much more ""corpse-like"" in the original.  Romero's zombies, despite Tom Savini's (who makes a precious cameo in this one) innovative make-up on closeups, for the most part looked like they needed a tan and a napkin to wipe the ketchup off their chin.  The 2004 Dead are vicious, fast, and driven by pure animal instinct.  Many comparisons have been made to 28 Days Later, but let's not forget the baddies in that disappointing venture were NOT zombies, but people infected with a cross between rabies and steroids.  I havent seen any comparisons to the old 1977 Marilyn Chambers classic (no, not Beyond the Green Door) from David Cronenberg called Rabid, or the 1985 sci-fi Lifeforce.  Both featured similar, fast-moving ""deadish"" villains. And the list goes on.<br/><br/>What makes this new Dawn so mortifying (forgive the pun) is what it DOESN'T tell you: like how the plague started, how universally spread it has become, where the helicopters fly off to (surely there are military safe zones if these yaps can hold up in a mall for so long), and exactly what happens to the bite victims.  Yes, it is not airborne, as the film depicts, but slowly sickens the victim to the point of death, but not for long...as soon as the brain ""shuts off"", like a switch the disease re-animates the flesh--only now the person is on survival auto-pilot: with an incredible rage and craving for food: good ole living human beings.  Why not the dog or each other? Your guess is as good as mine.  Perhaps it's a primal scent thing, who knows. Again, it's what keeps you guessing that proves so effective, along with that on the edge of your seat, adrenalin-pumping tension that these zombies provide and Romero's antiquated automatons simply do not. To compensate, Romero indulged in ""feasting"" shots of zombies gnawing on flesh for way too long (which Italian zombie movie directors took to new, um, heights). This Dawn doesn't need to splash the screen with the grotesque, in-your-face-gore that will make you upchuck your popcorn.  But it will make you jump and spill it once or twice!<br/><br/>As for the criticism that the movie lacks the social commentary of the original, well, duh, it's not 1978 anymore!  The egotistical consumerism of the 70s Romero so aptly lampooned is for our generation passe, and we can turn to I Love the 70's on VH1 for that now.  No, today things are even more fast-paced, high tech and bleak.  The film captures that brilliantly (a minute in, a doctor wonders if he will make his golf date on Sunday--isnt that a social jab?).  Is it The Real World meets Night of the Living Dead? Perhaps, but only at its most basic level.  Are there too many characters? Yes, but these days a horror film needs at least two hotties (who will make obligatory spreads in FHM and Maxim, i've no doubt) and enough ingredients of this wonderful melting pot of ours to satisfy our reality tv craving as much as they ultimately feed the dead.  Besides, havent we become braindead zombies when it comes to the crap they spew on tv and we eat up without reservation?<br/><br/>I do wish the film were longer to allow us to explore the central characters of Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Pheifer and Jake Weber more.  There is a central and integral bond between the four that goes below the surface of their superficial mall-mates, but we only catch glimpses of it.  The original was 40 minutes longer, and it was to character development that it devoted the extra time.  The closest we get to that, as others have noted, is the sentimental and doomed relationship between Rhames' stoic cop and a marooned, rooftop owner of a gun shop across the sea of zombies in the parking lot below.  I also wanted the film to slow down and take a chill pill once in a while, which would only heighten the thrills once things started to heat up again.  Some shots, though, looked like they were taken right out of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with its bled-gray, choppy footage, and this element I think added to the ""warlike"" hell of the film.  Kudos to commercial director Zach Snyder for not making this a long and saturated MTV video...but a sleek, intense and stylish film. The biting (again, forgive the pun)humor provided by Ty Burrell is a welcome treat, and highlights a clever script that doesnt become weighted down by a multi-layered, deep plot.  Save that for a movie without flesh-eating zombies, ok?<br/><br/>
So overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing this film.  The first 10 minutes is the stuff of sheer cinematic horror brilliance (wow did Johnny Cash's Man Comes Around work perfectly), the middle will have your heart pounding out of your chest, and the end offers the action-packed climactic showdown with the mall zombies you've been waiting for...just DONT LEAVE WHEN THE CREDITS START TO ROLL...(HINT HINT)  8 stars out of 10."
"producer-3","10","0","0","25 March 2004"," Excellent action for the Zombie fan.
","I think the Original Dawn of the Dead (1979) is the best horror movie ever, when I heard of this movie coming out, I was scared they might damage the original.  However, I was excited that another Zombie flick was coming out and I threw away all expectations before seeing the film.  This new version is superb.<br/><br/>It contains a lot of violence, and is probably one of the scariest movies ever made.  I would not compare this to the original because it is taken from a different point of view.  Any real Zombie fan must take this into consideration or your will ruin a great movie.  These Zombies are more vicious, faster, and smarter.<br/><br/>This movie is extremely fast paced, which makes character development weak, but that is not why you would want to see this movie at the theaters.  The acting is performed well with the brief time each character has to present themselves.  Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley do an excellent job also with their allotted time.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack is superlative for this movie.  The editing was good with a large amount of assemble edits that work really well through out the movie."
"gammaworm","8","0","0","21 March 2004"," some just might like it better than the original . . .
","I've really been looking forward to giving this a chance since i heard about it some time last year, and I've got to say that this really wasn't the movie I expected.  It was WAY better!  Zach Snyder has put a fresh spin on an old idea.  It's really impossible not to compare this with its 26 year old predacessor, but that not what I was really interested in.  This is a rethinking of the story.  New characters.  New locations.  New zombies even. In case you haven't heard the zombies run at full speed now.  While I will admit that I wasn't too thrilled to hear that they were messing with a perfect formula, it does work perfectly for THIS movie.  Lets face it, zombies of the old days aren't very scary in this day and age and especially not from a director that had previously only worked on music videos with fast cuts and quicker pacing.  I'm not knocking the guy, its just that with the pacing of this style of movie, I think the fast zombies work much better.  This movie doesn't let up for one moment.<br/><br/>The tension never lets up in this film.  Not only was I leaning forward waiting in anticipation for the next scare, but I was also very interested in the survivors.  All the characters were drawn out very well, and you really become interested in what will become of them.  There are plenty of nice situations that arise that are very subtle homages to Romero's classic as well as some of his other films as well.  Without ruining anything, I will say that there are at least 2 character types from each of the original classics.  Long time fans won't be disappointed with the story.<br/><br/>The effects were great.  From what I have heard, there were some CG enhanced scenes, but I don't really think anyone noticed.  It seemed that they were using rubber and fake blood for most of it, but some of the gorier scenes had me wondering how they would have done it.  All the effects were very well done.  A movie like this MUST have outstanding effects to stand out. It reminds me of the over the top effects that were prevelent throughout the 80's horror movies, with each new one trying to top the last by killing someone in a creative way.  There were at least a dozen times where you could here the whole audience simultaneously cheer and gasp over a creative scene of gore.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great movie for horror fans and action fans alike.  It won't win an Oscar or anything, but thats not what this kind of movie sets out to do.  You should be going to the theatre to be entertained, and that's exactly what i paid 8 dollars twice to go do.  I always seem to be critical on remakes of classics, but this one is different enough to look at it as a seperate movie all together.  These kinds of movies don't show up very often, and its nice to see one get released with a nice sized budget and get a wide release.  All you purists out there don't worry about this being a crappy remake.  Once the studios see that this knocked ""The Passion of The Christ"" out of the number one spot on its opening week, there will be a whole slew of crappy zombie movies out there to target your rants at.  Enjoy it for what it is and don't trust scuzzy mall security guards!  :D *****"

"chazrevomd","10","0","0","21 March 2004"," The dead are back.
","May contain minor spoilers<br/><br/>The dead are back.  Dawn appears to be part of a string of neo-zombie movies that have hit theaters recently, including Resident Evil and 28 days. This one, however, is the first to be directly inspired by the original zombie mastermind, Romero.  Dawn was the most engaging of the original dead series, and is the clear choice for a remake.  It is the brilliant juxtaposition of a setting familiar to all consumers, the mall, and an outrageous situation, zombie chaos.  Romero also tossed in a hearty dash of consumer bashing as the zombies waltz around the mall to ludicrous background music.<br/><br/>The 2004 version of this film takes the same concept, and injects it with a fat syringe full of adrenaline.  The zombies no longer stumble around, and bump into things.  They are ruthless hunters that know exactly what they want, and know that they have to haul ass to get it.  This makes the movie a much more tense experience than the original.  Snyder takes the serious (almost dry) nature of 28 days later, and blends it beautifully with humanistic (at times silly) tone of the original.<br/><br/>The key to the success of Dawn, however, is that it is unlike most recent remakes.  Planet of the Apes or Bedazzled, for example, were both asinine remakes that whither when in the light of the originals.  The complex ideas were lost, and replaced with action and special effects.  The Movies were not updated; they were numbed for a modern audience.  Snyder, Gunn, and company were able to update the film with out numbing it down.  Sure, there is a lot of gore and some CGI, but the story is still controls and reigns in all the special effects and big budget hoopla.<br/><br/>Of course the film does have its weak points.  One that comes to mind is when Ving Rhames attempts to recite a line from the original.  It is a thoughtful hypothosis on why the zombies flock to the mall, but Rhames gives the introspective line an awkward tough guy quality.  Still, Rhames shines in a bathroom scene with a little bit of religious rhetoric.<br/><br/>Colorful (but perhaps stereotyped) characters, fast moving action, interesting situations, the scariest zombies to grace the screen yet, and all based on a Romero classic.  Justice has been done to the original, and the bar has been raised my friends.  This film breaks new ground for edge of your seat zombie mania.<br/><br/>Zombie Fans 10/10 General Film 8.1/10"
"erich242","7","0","0","21 March 2004"," Was this a remake?
","I saw this movie yesterday and found it to be a gory squelch-fest with beautiful undead effects  and the proper tension between the remaining few humans in the Mid-West, but I can't actually call it a remake. It has a mall and a cop and hordes of zombies but it is a different movie on every level. This has no real social underscore and their aren't two schools of thought on how to deal with the zombie problem, although they begin with a two camp face off that is quickly thwarted .I am a fan of this movie and I rated it a 7-8 out of ten, but the original (not to sound all film snob)is a better picture .If this film stood on it's own instead of having the same and being shadowed by a genre classic it would be viewed as a ""28 days later"" or ""Dellamorte Dellamore"". -Erich"
"MovieMilhouse21","10","0","0","21 March 2004"," Pretty good.
","I thought that this movie was pretty darn good.  I had a decent sized amount of gore along with plenty of laughs.  I loved the part in the elevator with the music playing.  I don't know if this film is as good as the original because frankly, I have yet to see the original.  But if everybody is correct in saying that this version is crap compared to the original, than the original must be a freakin' gem.  I give this a 8/10.<br/><br/>I don't want to give to much away but I do want to mention possibly one of the scariest parts is with the baby.  Those who have seen the film will know what I am talking about."

","I am a huge fan of Romero's Dead movies and I must say this movie gets my full approval. I was completely hooked from the beginning. The fact that the whole movie was shot in my hometown also added a lot of enjoyment to the movie, the beginning sequence looked like it was happening in my neighborhood, which was really cool.  The idea of running zombies made me hesitant at first, but they served the story well.  The only complaint I would have is I wish it were longer, and I was expecting a biker gang to crash the mall, but those complaints are very minor.  Solid movie from start to finish, don't miss it in theatres.  I'm very interested to see how the new resident evil will compare to this."
"fred-287","Null","0","0","21 March 2004"," Scores the hat trick
","I use an ice hockey term in deference to this latest of umpteen recent Canadian imports: ""hat trick"" means scoring three goals; this movie avoids the three killer mistakes often made by horror flicks post-""Scream,"" and let's hope it's a trend: (1) No jokes or self-deprecating references. (2) No attempt to ""explain things.""  (3) No lame attempt at a ""happy ending.""  This is just a straight-up gore-fest and delivers the goods.<br/><br/>""Dawn of the Dead"" was my least favorite of George Romero's legendary zombie trilogy (which probably puts me at odds with about 90% of his fans) so not only did I have no problems with seeing a remake, I was hoping this would be an improvement, which it largely is.  It borrows elements from the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" and also ""Day of the Dead"" and retains the original ""Dawn""'s premise of taking place mostly at a shopping mall. Since the satire on American consumerism isn't a particularly novel idea any more, the remake wisely doesn't play it up, in fact omits the key plot element from the original of the roving biker gang and the climactic inside-the-mall battle against the zombies.  It also adds some new elements (see under ""Spoilers"").<br/><br/>Sarah Polley (Canada's answer to Uma Thurman?) finally outgrows waif status as a no-nonsense nurse working long hours underappreciated by the doctors (I'm sure nurses in the audience can dig that).  There's a conversation in the hospital about a patient who may or may not be an infected zombie, but we never see him, so we never know.  She goes home and just has time for the semi-obligatory steamy shower scene with her paramour before all hell breaks loose absolutely out of the blue.  (We're informed this takes place in Wisconsin, although I would have preferred Pennsylvania as a nod to Romero.) Her escape sequence is stunningly filmed, much of it through her cracked car window, and reminded me of scenes in Polanski's ""The Pianist"" with the protagonist observing chaotic action from a strictly subjective viewpoint, making it seem as disconcerting to us as it must to her.  Eventually she meets a shotgun-wielding cop played by Ving Rhames who has yet to find the star-making vehicle he deserves. This probably won't be it either, since he's not required to do much except glower and shoot, but boy is he fun to watch.  The nurse and the cop stumble across some other survivors and as per the original, take refuge inside an abandoned mall.  From then on if it's blood and violence you crave, you definitely get your money's worth.<br/><br/>******************  SPOILERS  ************************<br/><br/>
In order to jack up the tension level among the non-zombies, the absent roving bikers are replaced by some gun-happy redneck mall security guards whose sheer bloody-minded-ness is the only element that seems a little forced. (I mean heck, I was once a security guard and so was my brother, and we're both pretty nice guys for the most part.)  The chief security guard, who at first rivals the fascistic army captain in  ""Day of the Dead,"" eventually changes his stripes completely and even becomes a noble self-sacrificer, but then ""battlefield conversions"" are a movie tradition. There's a bizarre sequence where a vaguely lowlife character straps his pregnant girlfriend to a bed and waits for her to give birth even knowing she's ""undead""----hey, how's that for ""commitment""!  Unfortunately the director feels compelled to show us the zombie-baby---well, using the imagination's for sissies anyway, I guess.  The remake expands upon the original scene with the gun store by placing it in a building outside the mall so the owner can develop a long-distance friendship with the cop, even conducting a chess match by using signs.  The gun store owner also passes the time by sniping at the zombies milling about in the street, with the others encouraging him ""Hey, get Burt Reynolds"" or ""Rosie O'Donnell.""  Too bad they didn't name any government officials, but then these are tense times in the entertainment field.  We even see a scheme by the mall dwellers to use a dog to convey food to the gun store owner, since they're confident that zombies only eat humans, not dogs.  Well, how do they know that?  For that matter, why don't zombies eat one another?  (Not ""afraid of germs,"" are they?)   How come it takes them so long to get inside the mall?  Why would the entire military apparatus of the country just immediately disappear? (The original ""Dawn"" handled that by suggesting that the zombie attack had been ongoing for a while.) When the armored truck reaches the marina, how do they know which is the right boat, since the owner's dead?  But then who really cares?  We're here for the thrills and jolts.  The ending's a slight disappointment: could have been an ass-kicker rivalling the close of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" but it's intercut with the closing credits and left mysterious as to what happens;  gee whiz, are they angling for a sequel to the remake?  Aren't there any NEW zombie stories to tell?<br/><br/>The actors all carry their load, especially Jake Weber from HBO's ""Mind of the Married Man,"" which just for the record I wish hadn't been cancelled. Weber can convey a lot with a little and, being British, could play both the Kevin Costner and the Hugh Grant regular-guy roles.  Fun to see Tom Savini reprising the police-chief role from ""Night of the Living Dead"" ----""Shoot 'm in the head and burn 'm"" ---although I wish they'd used the classic exchange from that scene:<br/><br/>""Are they pretty slow-moving, Chief?"" ""Yeah, they're dead.... they're all messed up.""<br/><br/>One minor quibble: I'm sure every modern mall must have at least one computer-oriented store, so it would have been a nice touch to see the characters go on-line trying to make contact with someone.  But to borrow a line from Alex Cox' ""Straight to Hell"":  ""Still, mustn't grumble...."" I'm just glad they were able to get this made and released in theaters before (if a certain  incumbent office-holder gets re-elected) this country becomes a guilty-pleasure-shlock-banning theocracy altogether....."

","I had wanted to see the original before I saw this remake, but when a friend asked out of the blue if I wanted to see it, I couldn't resist. I still intend to see the original, but this 2004 version was a excellent film in its own right. I didn't find it very scary, but I didn't go to be scared. The zombies were very well done, the added humour really offsets the more graphic scenes well. I found that they took your mind off the theme of the film, so when the action set back in, it would catch you off guard. The ending left me a little disapointed, but it wasn't all bad. I found that as a horror movie, it was better than most of the more recent horror films I saw,  like F vs J, and Jeepers Creepers 2. Well, only other thing I can add, is that the action scenes were great, plot was decently done ( I have  a few holes I noticed), movie was a bit rushed, but its not a big deal, and as said before, watch the end credits, it will be worth it.<br/><br/>

"drosz22","Null","0","0","21 March 2004"," In one word I can rate this film...
","Just saw the ""remake"" of Dawn of the Dead 3 days ago. After much emotional debate with those in my group and with myself, I feel I can (in one word) rate this film... LACKLUSTER. There was NO apparent reason whatsoever for this film to have even been made. The plotline is so flimsy (Quote ""Lets go to the mall"")... hey, why not go to the gun shop right across the street, you morons! The character set-up gave the audience no care for them whatsoever! The only person that actually evolved in the film was CJ the security guard. Just for those that posted otherwise... the CGI was AWFUL! The crowd at the theater we saw it at (including us) was laughing and shaking their heads at the ridiculousness of many of the situations. This movie looked like a poor 28 Days Later wannabe! Besides a few head shots, there were no cannibalism shots! Maybe a neck bite... but where was the intestines being devoured? A few good side effects here and there (chainsaw in the shoulder), but they downsized the gore in lieu of some sub-par CGI and a cut rate script. If this movie did not have the Dawn of the Dead name, I would have seen it in a month and a half (if it was still playing) and still would have had a bad taste in my mouth. I rate this one below 28 Days Later (and I am using that as a comparison even though it IS NOT a zombie movie like all of theses dumb-ass critics are calling it) and the HORRENDOUS House of the Dead. Save your money, watch the original... you will have a better time!"

","I always go to see horror film remakes, no matter what anyone says, ""oooooh, it's an insult to the original"" and all that rubbish.  I see it as more of a tribute.  There have also been a few excellent remakes, ""The Blob"", ""TCM"". So i went into this with medium-level hopes.<br/><br/>Well i can honestly say that this is the most exciting movie I've seen so far this year.  From the jumpy beginning to the ominous end, every scene kept me interested.  There are even a few to make you laugh and remember that it's only a movie.<br/><br/>The zombies move a lot faster than they did in the original, the sprint at you screaming, something i believe that the filmmakers tried to cash-in on ""28 days later""'s success.  However, they improved on the zombies in ""28 days"" by managing to make them look like zombies, not merely nutjobs with red eyes, thus adding to the creepiness of the whole thing.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are not enything special, but the actors play their parts well and present a realistic interpretation of the situations that they face.  However I don't think that the slight attraction between the nurse and that bloke was needed as they never really explored it enough.<br/><br/>I had read a review telling me that the film was not that violent, this disappointed me at first, as I like my horror films with added red stuff. This comment was proved wrong as the film more than satisfied the gorehound in me.  Highlights include an armoured vehicle plowing through a crowd of zombies with a chainsaw sticking out the side, and a stick being thrust through a zombie's head lengthways, plus some wicked head explosions.  The other thing I liked about the gore was that it was rarely enhanced with computer graphics, it went back to the old skool methods of latex and squibs, this gives a much more realistic view of the gore. NICE!<br/><br/>All in all, one hell of a movie, and definately recommended to fans of the original, I know that I might annoy some people by saying this, but I thought it was better than the original, which i found quite boring, even though it was far more violent.  Oh well, you will have to see for yourselves!<br/><br/>Note: Watch out for Tom Savini making a cameo as a policeman on T.V, and that other bloke from the first DAWN whos name I've forgotten also making a cameo appearance.<br/><br/>Oh, and you get see one of the charchters having sex, and you see her boobies, which was nice.  Pointless, but nice."
"insane_wisdom","Null","0","0","21 March 2004"," I Loved It! It Wasn't THAT Great! (mild spoilers)
","When I stepped in to see the remake of Dawn of the Dead, I did not have any idea what to expect, but I must admit I halfway figured it to be a let down.<br/><br/>First, I LOVED IT: In a way unique from the original, the cinematography was shot well enough to really draw you into the action. This was the movie that, in my opinion, ""28 Days Later"" should have been. The atmosphere was very well conveyed and had a strong sense of realism, while maintaining a sense of Hollywood style, and I enjoyed the sudden thrills which were very unique from the original. The entire movie, everything about it in my opinion, is better than any horror movie has been for quite some time. I liked many of the situations, I liked the plot, all of the cameos, including the store called ""Gaylen Ross"", and I thought it was very seriously, and whole heartedly done by all of the main characters. I also LOVED the intro with the Johnny Cash song, which I thought conveyed a feel similar to what George envisioned for the original.<br/><br/>But, It Wasn't THAT Great: Nowadays, scary movies have to have soundtrack reminiscent of the Slipknot or Marilyn Manson sound to be considered a REAL scary movie. George's movie wasn't just scary, it was eerie and depressing. A big part of the ""DOTD '79"" atmosphere was that you could see them all around you getting closer and closer. The remake was more like, BOOM! they're here, now they're gone. While the new version is indeed a thrill a minute movie ride, the original was a work of art that had many things to say about us and our society which added to the eerie nature. I also liked the original's smaller cast. Since ""Night Of The Living Dead"" had already happened, it was more conceivable that there would be fewer people around, therefore making the situation more progressed and that much more hopeless. I also find a slower death more effective than the quick killings of the modern slasher flicks. And the nudity in the newer version was not artful/incidental nudity to help the story along like the very brief nudity in Romero's original. The original cast was more intimate, more dramatic, and more down to earth. Though the newer version had somewhat better acting (in some cases- i.e. Ving Rhames) and better effects, the original plot, script, and atmosphere, were of much higher quality and had so much over the new one given the time period. I thought the original was funnier, eerier, and I thought the make up jobs they did on the foreground zombies (not the plain blue faced ones) were better looking than the newer disease-esque zombie look.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Go see the new one if you're looking for a polished Hollywood style slasher/thriller type zombie flick. I'm going to go back and see it again. But as for the original, ""Don't knock it, it's got it's own key."""
"RJC-99","Null","0","0","21 March 2004"," George Romero, RIP
","The fears of sacrilege were misplaced!<br/><br/>Snyder and Gunn's ""Dawn"" remake is more terrifying, visually intelligent, and unsettling than Romero's groundbreaking 1978 film.  No one who loves horror will wish for that masterpiece to disappear: it's always going to be a brilliant sardonic take on the themes of 20th century American decline (consumerism, social Darwinism) and its radical vision helped take US horror cinema out of a long oafish funk. But the original ""Dawn"" is wearing its aging deathmask somewhat lopsidedly today. Next to contemporary work like this remake and the icily brilliant ""28 Days Later,"" Romero's shambling rotters are at risk of becoming the equivalent of ghosts in sheets, just as the once-poignant setting of the shopping mall is no longer revelatory as it was in the 70s.  Boo! is not the same for every age.<br/><br/>The new film lifts its sprinting zombies from Danny Boyle and its ideas, structure and best lines (""When there's no more room in hell..."") from Romero. Everything else is Snyder's feel for the texture of the new American century, frail and uncertain of hiding behind banal excess: in fact, the genius of the film is to locate its opening set piece in the midst of an anonymous, pre-fab American suburb--the very heart of sham solace. By the time we escape to hunker down in the mall for the start of the second act, the torn landscape outside is as savage an apocalyptic vision as any yet on film.<br/><br/>Snyder's cast is likable, his eye good, and his luck in an editor and fx crew superb (we are treated to an astonishing cgi spectacle: a veritable ocean of the dead). Gunn's script is perfectly serviceable, even without Romero's nuances.  8 out of 10."

","I liked New Dawn of the Dead because of the faster pace action as compared to the OG Dawn of the Dead.  Tell the truth if you walked outside and saw 20 Zombies running at you instead of walking slowly towards you, it would be alot more frightening. It makes the movie more believable with faster zombies coming after you, and makes the scenes more intense.  All you people who think this movie sucks because of fast zombies should step into the new millennium.  Anything I don't have problems running away from and taking out with ease doesn't scare me, something that is jumping, running, biting, hitting, kicking to try and kill me does.  Come on are we Michael Jackson in thriller where the slow zombies can catch you? The only thing I did not like about the movie is it seemed like no one was smart enough to put on extra clothes to try and prevent a bite. That guy named Julius is one cool MF though. They had a sporting good store didn't they?  I would have put on a rubber suit as soon as I found out that the bite kills you. @¬ø@ U Peace out!!! Bring on the Day of the Dead Next I give this one 9/10(That's two high fives)"

","Not a ""remake"" so much as a ""revision"" of Romero's famous original.  While some of the more appealing elements of the original are gone (like most of the ""mindless mall rat"" aspect of the zombies), and others of the original rules are bent or broken, I'd still rate this as the best zombie movie since, well, the last Romero-inspired film (Day of the Dead).<br/><br/>With a bigger budget, bigger stars, and bigger effects, the movie is somewhat more of an action film than the original Romero series...and that worked quite well for me.  My own personal rating of a flick like this depends heavily on the creep factor, the adrenaline factor, or a combination of both...and as far as I was concerned it delivered.<br/><br/>Could this movie (and last year's far more turgid 28 Days Later) signal the revival of the true horror flick?  Well, yes, it could.  I personally found it refreshing to have zombies that moved fast -- and the nature of the film is powered up by that notion.  Imagine BlackHawk Down crossed with the original Dawn of the Dead.  There are a number of big, fast-paced, grab-your-attention-and-don't-let-go sequences that had me gritting my teeth in both tension and enjoyment.<br/><br/>Final analysis -- there are only a few obvious improvements that could have been made, I'll go see the flick again for a second round of enjoyment, and I'm already looking forward to the eventual DVD release.  Two thumbs up (that's all I'm equipped with).<br/><br/>(Oh yeah...did I mention?  All the blood looks =real=, as do virtually all of the gore effects, a rare event in any horror film)."

","Let me begin with the ending. DO NOT LEAVE DURING THE CREDITS ROLLING. If you do, you will miss so many things. My Husband and I went to see this movie on Friday night for the opening and we so impressed, we went back the very next day and watched it again. Seeing it twice in a row took nothing away from it. When we saw the film on Friday, we went with friends. After we left we all decided we needed a drink because we had all felt like we had been on a roller coaster that just would not stop! When you leave the cinema you are just freaked. You start thinking to yourself, what if this really did happen? How would you survive, what would be your plan? As we left the cinema which was also in a MALL we decided we could find better places to go that were more advantageous than a MALL. This new film in no way takes anything away from the original. Yes, the zombies are faster but they have evolved. I didn't really think that character development was all that important so for that reason I was not disappointed that the characters were not very well defined. Let's face it, the zombies are the true characters that needed defining and it was given through the film. I screamed, laughed, cried, screamed some more and applauded at points but as I said at the beginning, if you leave during the credits rolling you miss some very important points of the film. If I am being illusive it is because I don't want to give a thing away. Just keep in mind, you are going to see a film that is about zombies so don't get caught up in the character development or anything else. Sit back and buckle your seat belts because you are in for the ride of your life. Enjoy the film and watch it more than once. Don't compare it to 28 days because that isn't fair. They are 2 different films in their own rights. This film was awesome and to those of you who love to bring your kids to the cinema, DON'T!!!!!!!!!! This film could truly have them having nightmares for a long time. We noticed a lot of people with kids and ther ages anywhere from 6-13 and for me that was a bit much. I would never bring a small kid to see this one! If you read all these posts you can see that most adults are having a hard time with it so imagine the imaginative mind of a small child.

","Now let's get one thing clear right off the bat...I LOVE GEORGE ROMERO'S ORIGINAL MOVIE!!!! It is one of THE classics of horror. BUT....the remake surpasses it! Some have written that the movie makes no social statements. WHAT? Okay, the original made digs at consumerism by equating the zombies with mindless shoppers. However this one has a more profound subtext for a few of the characters. One of the survivors is pregnant. So the question is raised, as it is by many people in the real world, ""How can I bring a child into a world that's so screwed up?"".  The characters here also deal with an issue that the survivors in the original did not...what happened to their loved ones? In Romero's movie, NOT ONCE do the characters ever wonder about the fate of their friends and families. That issue is at the forefront of the new version. So to those that say there is no human drama here....what movie were you watching? But all that is incidental, what everyone wants to see this movie for is the zombies. Let me say to the purists out there....shuffling zombies ARE NOT SCARY!!!!! You can simply run, or in fact walk, right past them. Try that in the new movie. These flesh craving monsters will run your ass down, and be snacking on your vital organs before you can say ""undead"". Now THAT'S scary! The cast is excellent. Ving Rhames is the man, and owns every time he appears onscreen. Sarah Polley is a hottie, and maintains a cool head throughout. Jake Weber is very identifiable as the nice guy ""everyman"". You really care about these characters, and hope to see them survive. There is also great humor here. While on the roof of the shopping mall, our heroes communicate through large, handwritten signs with the owner of the gunshop across the street, who has retreated to his roof. There is a great scene where the on the roof of the mall, with binoculars, pick out zombies that resemble celebrities, and then have the gun shop owner blow them away. Also watch for the shop owner and Ving Rhames using their message boards back and forth to play chess. There are many nods to the original here, but they are very subtle. Watch for the heroes of Romero's version in cameo's. My favorite homage is right at the beginning of the movie. As Ana is driving down the road, we are treated to a high ariel shot looking down at her car on the highway. A helicopter flies in and out of frame. It is the same helicopted used by the characters in the original movie to escape the zombies that have overrun the city. So in the end, a great movie. Great tension. Great scares. Great humor. Great gore. A great treat for all horror fans."

","""Dawn of the Dead,"" remake of the original 1979 film, delivers on all fronts.  It starts with a bang, submitting us to some very scary and disturbing imagery (my favorite being the bus window scene).  ""Dawn of the Dead"" continues the trend of updating the zombie for our time.  Back when ""Night of the Living Dead"" came out, it was supposedly a parable for communist paranoia - they could be anyone, anywhere, even our neighbors, and they're OUT TO GET US! The slow, encroaching threat of the red nation... ""28 Days Later"" showed us zombies that were based somewhat on modern tempers going to hell.  Air rage? road rage? consumer rage? There's a reason the virus was called ""RAGE.""  A metaphor for how seemingly decent people becoming virtually feral at the drop of a hat in our society - I see this up close every day, so that hit home with me. Here, the zombies take a note from 28 D-L and are faster, smarter and more vicious than any movie before.  Their speed and violence is also a perfect metaphor for terrorism in our age - it comes so suddenly, with such an amazing cost to humanity, and it seems that we just can't stop it no matter what we do.  It's everywhere we go, and it's not going to go out without taking a few of us with it. The writing of the movie is tight and pulls no punches.  This is a horror movie in the TRADITIONAL sense.  Forget that teen-level garbage with a bunch of nubile high schoolers being chased by some idiot in a mask.  This is a callback to when horror movies were written for an adult audience, and they're not out to be gentle or provide tongue in cheek humor.  They go for the jugular and they don't stop until they're holding half of your throat. This is an excellent, excellent movie, one that was well crafted, well acted and genuinely scary.  Intense and frightening in every sense of those words.  If it suffers from anything, it's a slight lack of character development, but they got more development in than I was expecting. 9 out of 10.  Twenty-first century horror has arrived, and it's not for your kids anymore."
"vfinkel","Null","0","0","21 March 2004"," A Stylish Remake that Strays from the Understated Beauty of the Original
","Let me preface this by saying I am a HUGE fan of the original Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I think Romero is a genius and his movies are really smart. The original Dawn of the Dead is a really sharp social commentary disguised as a basic horror movie. It takes on issues about interracial relationships, class, American nationalism, the role of the media, and most of all the original film is a HUGE critique of glossy, homogenized, consumerism.<br/><br/>The new Dawn of the Dead is... a glossy, homogenized, consumerist movie! Yeah. Put that in your pipe and smoke it Romero! Just about everything that made the original so sharp and biting is gone. This movie really shares very little with the original except the general premise, a few scenes, and maybe 3 lines of dialogue. So I was disappointed. I think if you've never seen the original, you might enjoy this because it is, like I said, a pretty glossy and well-made horror film.<br/><br/>The good: This film sets the scene probably better than any other horror film I can think of off the top of my head. I really likes the way the film established the premise so quickly, it grabbed you before you had a chance to get your guard up. I only wish it was the establishment of some OTHER movie other than a second-rate remake of one of my favorites. The acting was fine although nobody had much material to work with. Ving Rhames as the macho-military-guy character was a brilliant stoke of casting. Effects are appropriately slick and animated. I missed the neon blood of the original, but there was more than enough reddish blood to go around.<br/><br/>
The bad: This movie takes very little from the original. What it takes, it re-envisions very poorly. Many of the scenes are in different order, so they're sort of disjointed and confusing. The mall is severely underutilized. This film could have happened anywhere, the mall is merely incidental-whereas it was the central heart of the original. My real problem is that the scenes from the original Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead resonate so STRONGLY that to re-make them in a different way is really hard for me to swallow.<br/><br/>Fast zombies. Super fast zombies. Superhuman zombies. Which is all well and good, who am I to tell zombies what they can't and can't do. The problem? I think the Romero's slow moving zombies are scarier. Sure, you can outrun them and dispatch of them individually really easily. But that's not what's scary about zombies. What's scary about zombies is that they multiply, and multiply, and MULTIPLY. and the combined strength of thousands upon thousands of slow movie zombies is that they're everywhere. It's suffocating. They take over, They're methodical. They slowly but surely get you. And THAT, is suspense. Fast movie zombies, in my opinion, removes what makes zombies special. If they're fast, they might as well be vampires-right? It's the slowness that makes zombies different.<br/><br/>
Maybe it's just me, but I found this movie to really cop out on the whole interracial relationship angle. They don't allow Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley any sexual tension. Instead, almost as a throwback they give us a different interracial couple (who we all know are zombie meat anyway) rather than explore the issue through the main characters. That's such a cop out.<br/><br/>
In the end, this is a fast-paced, well shot horror film with nice effects. It's not the biting social commentary Romero's classic is. Pun intended."

This is a fun movie... make sure to see it with a group of friends, and don't get up to go to the restroom. And unlike most other zombie movies, the zombies are actually pretty scary...

Well maybe a little, but these are my pet peeves and on a whole are not meant to diminish what I felt to be a future classic remake of a classic.<br/><br/>With all of the ""Dead"" movies you find that you instantly put yourself in the character's place and while there are going to be differences in thought and action, I felt there were ""General"" concerns/emotions not being addressed by the ensemble cast that were addressed in the first one(s).<br/><br/>It's like they accepted this plight without enough question and just rolled with staying alive, So that there was an underlying frustration/chaos throughout.<br/><br/>As a result I felt this affected character development to a large degree. Where were the individual ""war"" stories discussed between the survivors regarding what they saw, heard and went through before linking up?<br/><br/>The news coverage was disjointed, frenzied and lacking. It would have been slicker to have at least one station still reporting with more information as the movie went along.<br/><br/>Reporter: Q: "" Are These Things Dead? ""<br/><br/>Government(?)Speaker: A: (With sweaty exasperation) ""....We just Don't know...""<br/><br/>In essence, this set the tone of the movie...a hopeless, frustrating, swift and almost total armageddon! And yes, it's obvious that this was intended.<br/><br/>I recall now at the start of the flick the character of Sarah simply clicking past the news on her car radio while looking for her easy listening station that sounded like ""....Reports are still sketchy...""CLICK...""This just in...""CLICK...""At this time there is no explina..."" CLICK. I don't know about you, but even after doing a double shift, bites like THAT (pun INTENDED) catch my attention. Also, there was the missing of the Special Report bulletin while in the shower with her husband.<br/><br/>Another thing I wasn't feeling was ""How"" the dead were able to come back.<br/><br/>A proper tweak here, an added 15 to 20 minutes there (I believe the running time was close to an hour and a half) and you would have had a flawless thriller!!<br/><br/>I'd say the scariest thing about the movie (other than the grizzly, bloody, sprinting dead chasing you) was, again, the almost mindless, unquestioning acceptance of their situation.<br/><br/>The original Dawn was lauded for it's social satire and commercialism.<br/><br/>This comes into play in the remake for our current times as well.

","Given the amount of dreck we horror fans have been forced to endure over the last ten years or so, it is refreshing to see some new life being pumped into the genre.  Last year's remake of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was an excellent re-imagining of the story (although producer Michael Bay's heavy handed influence was quite prevalent), and now we have the remake of George Romero's classic DAWN OF THE DEAD.<br/><br/>Is the new version good?  Yes, it is.  I enjoyed it immensely (although I'm kicking myself for not staying through the closing credits as I normally do).  Does it surpass the original?  Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>The 1979 DAWN was a cleverly written, darkly foreboding, and bitingly satirical look at the human condition.  There was a sense of dread that permeated the whole film, and you just found yourself wondering when the proverbial feces would hit the fan.  In addition, sub-level social commentary on everything from consumerism to abortion could be found; the original DAWN OF THE DEAD was that most elusive of creatures...the intelligent horror film.<br/><br/>Now the new DAWN is certainly a thrill ride, and I wasn't as put off by the running zombies as I thought I would be.  I just thought everybody accepted the end of the world a little too easily, and there were too many characters to flesh out in the film's 1 hr and 40 minute running time.  And I'll admit, I'm not much for a lot of humor in these films; if you're gonna be dark, for crying out loud be DARK.  If I want comedy, I'll watch ANIMAL HOUSE.<br/><br/>DAWN OF THE DEAD 2004 is certainly a legitimate addition to Romero's Living Dead canon (much like the excellent 1990 remake of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD), but I have a feeling I'll be sticking to my DVD of the original (gonna go watch it now, as a matter of fact!)<br/><br/>My rating: 7 1/2 out of 10...."

","#spoilers# Remakes are never as good as the original. Why should this be any different? The new Dawn was, and this was no shocker, disappointing.<br/><br/>There were too many characters, and no originality in any of them. In the original Dawn, there are four main characters, and they each have positive and negative recognizable traits. In this new Dawn, believe it or not, I now have trouble even rememberings what happened to who. There were just too many people held up in the mall. I'm not talking like 6. Im talking like 15. The script seemed to be just throwing characters in to have more deaths. The original Dawn had four characters, and only 2 of the 4 (if i remember correctly) survive. In this movie, well nevermind I shouldn't give away the ending. Also, the characters get to the mall way too quickly. The characters didn't stumble upon a landing space like in the original, one of them goes, ""We're going to the mall."" Then, they're their. Also, some of the sequences of the characters held up in the mall dragged on. However, the original put aside, this movie had some good gory action, awesome looking zombie, and the one thing they seemed to overlook in the original: CHAINSAWS!!! Hopefully the dvd will have some extra deleted gore scenes. Obviously they couldn't top the gore of the original and still maintain an R raiting. Finally, they made a stupid idea by showing the conclusion of the film in bits and pieces during the credits, so only the few people who actually sat through the credits and didn't leave got to see the ""official"" ending.<br/><br/>So, if you go see this, sit through all the credits! All in all, some points off for making it boring at times, and eliminating stuff from the original. Points on for action, gore, cool zombies, and chainsaw action.<br/><br/>Okay, there were actually some pretty creative ideas. Oh yeah and it wasn't scary either. I give it 6 out of 10. .."

","Just after seeing Dawn of the Dead, I was left in shock and giddy postcoital glee.  Man, I had SEEN a zombie movie.  You know what, I had seen a damn good movie.<br/><br/>After 5 minutes of establishing the normalcy of the Wisconsin suburbs, we get the initial attack, which starts out with a scene more akin to the original zombie film Night of the Living Dead, then goes into mass destructionland via the last string of disaster movies.<br/><br/>The opening credits are the most powerful set of titles I've ever seen in a film.  Scored to Johnny Cash's ""When the Man Comes Around"", they evoke feelings of genuine megadeth and apocalypse.  I was reminded of watching the planes crashing into the WTC on 9-11.  In fact, this is one of the first films that you will actually want to watch every second.<br/><br/>The plot picks up from there with the heroine escaping/meeting a weird cross-section of Americans en route to the refuge of the mall.  Here, they escape the devastation momentarily through the trappings of the mall. These genuinely comic scenes alleviate the near-constant tension in DOTD.  The plot picks up and gets more horrific, in a similar fashion to the original. Blah, blah--you know this part, so I'll skip it.  I will say that the people in this movie are more sensible than in other zombie movies where they run around helpless to get eaten.  The survivors, more or less, have survived for a reason--the ability to turn off their emotions and kill coldly.<br/><br/>The film as a whole was shatteringly powerful.  The ricketing force of the whole package was overwhelming.  This is the first horror film to update the genre to the level of style of other serious films from the 2000's. Forget that it is a remake; the plot is lifted, but the tone and visual style are totally original.  In fact, this may be the most original film I've seen since Being John Malkovich.  It seemed that, after the Texas Chainsaw remake and a slew of cruddy gore films with heavy metal soundtracks, the whole Gen X (or Y or whatever) attitude would never translate successfully into anyone's films beside Quentin Tarantino.  Then, blam, here it is.<br/><br/>
The handheld camera effects, believable characterizations, MTV editing, and overwhelming tone of nihilistic humor actually come together in this film. Gone are the 4th-barrier breaking self-references of the Scream generation, thank God.   I was starting to think that the next trend in horror movies would be a l√° The Ring: a revisionism of the golden era of horror cinema that would be serious and slow-paced.  I'm glad I was wrong.  Here, the director uses all the latest tricks to actually further the impact of the material.  He also mocks his characters with the playful smile of doom. Nevertheless, the tension pervades the attitude; we care about these people because they seem real.  In a word: ensnaring.<br/><br/>Say goodbye to the schlock of yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, we have evolved."

","I just saw this movie tonight, and in my opinion, is the best horror movie I have seen in 10 years. The acting from all involved seemed appropriate. The timing in the movie was excellent. It started out with some tense moments in a hospital then moved straight to a pretty intense, fast moving introduction until they got to the mall. Then the action kept up almost to the point where I would have been ready for it to stop, but then it started focusing more on the interactions of a very diverse crowd in a very stressful situation. This went on long enough until I was ready to be scared again, and they pulled it off. Admittedly you have to let yourself be scared by this movie, but if you are like me, you watch these movies just hoping that there will be more than one time that you at least jump a little, and they pulled that off for me. There was also some nice humor scattered throughout, some truly disturbing moments, just an experience overall. Anyway, this might not be as good as the original (I finally found a place to rent it, will watch that this week), but considering that they did not rely soley on special effects and gore to scare you (in fact, they didnt try at all, there was good use of moments where you expect something but you just arent entirely sure what). I'd say this is the best attempt at a horror movie since the 70's. Somebody here really had a grasp at what horror is really about and I'm glad."

","I don't care what anybody says, this movie was not a remake.  The only thing the new Dawn has in common with the original is the fact that it is a zombie movie that is set in a shopping mall at one point.  Romero, however, used the shopping mall as a means of creating a social satire while Snyder on the other hand seemed to use the shopping mall location simply so he could stamp the name ""Dawn of the Dead"" on his piece of celluoid to increase fan base and profits.<br/><br/>Now despite my gripe with it being labeled a remake, I still found the film to be fairly enjoyable.  It was a very slick blood and guts horror movie but tastefully done.  I was a little dissapointed with the character development though.  In the original Dawn, we are introduced to the four primary characters within the first fifteen minutes and find ourselves spending personal, intimate moments with them as they struggle with themselves and the elements for the next two hours.  In the remake there were just too many characters for me to become attached to any particular one and consequently, I found myself not caring whether many of them lived or died.<br/><br/>One advantage the ""remake"" had over the original was the fantastic special effects.  The zombies in the ""remake"" were very believable and terrifying while in original they were simply people with blue face paint on.  This brings me to my next point - the running zombies.  All I can say to that is - not cool Snyder, not cool."

","This is one of the best flicks I have seen in a while. I can't think of one bad thing to say about it. I mean it was a little weird that the zombies could run and stuff but it didn't take long to get used to. Plus it takes away your comfort zone, in that, you can't think to yourself, `I would just run away from them.' because those mo-fos' are fast! Great acting, great characters,realistic gore, unbelievable suspense and I don't know what I would have done without the comic relief.  Another thing I liked was they weren't afraid to show you some guts. I mean, they weren't wusses about it. They didn't cut away from the really nasty stuff. This was one of those movies where the entire audience jumps, laughs and says, `What are you doing? Don't kiss her!! She's gunna bite you!!' all in unison. Oh and let's not forget that one girl sitting behind you, who screams her head off every time something happens. This one gets an easy 10 out of 10."
"mhadley1","Null","0","0","19 March 2004"," A good movie, but not worthy of the title.
","Let's get something straight here... the only thing this movie has in common with the original Romero classic, besides the title, is ""mall"" and ""zombies"".  Everything else is different.  The characters are different, the situations are different, even the zombies are different.  I'm not saying this is a bad movie in any respect, I'm just saying that it deserved a different title.  It's already a mostly-original movie, so why spoil a classic by naming it the same?  Just because of the mall and zombies?  If that were true, then shouldn't ""Star Wars"" be called ""Star Trek"" instead? They both have spaceships and aliens...<br/><br/>It's the zombie difference that strikes me the most... speedy zombies like the ones in this film seem to be today's ""thing"" in movies, but I think it just alters the kind of horror we're expecting from a zombie movie.  Fast zombies give a SHOCK and SURPRISE kind of horror, while the original slow zombies bring a lot more tension and cold fear.  Gone are things such as being injured and backed into a corner, and watching the zombies slowly converging on your position, knowing that the inevitable will happen.  If the same situation happened in this movie, it'd be over in a second or two; the zombies would run up to you, and it's done.  Where's the creepiness there?  It's replaced by suddenness.  Maybe it's me, but I'm more creeped out by a zombie slowly coming into view from the end of a hall and shuffling towards me slowly, rather than the same zombie suddenly charging out of the darkness at full speed.  It's all about atmosphere and scaring people through actual terror rather than through 'make you jump out of your seat' action.<br/><br/>I still think it was a good movie.  I just would have been happier if they hadn't tried to make it something it isn't: a remake of Dawn of the Dead."

","****Possible Spoilers**** I had the pleasure of driving past the Monroeville Mall just after watching the Re-Make of Dawn of the Dead...(which for diehards is where the first movie was filmed)...But anyways I would have to say I loved this movie, Sure the characters weren't as developed as the orginal but this one was more fast paced and too the point.  I liked the effect of having the more people inside that mall which lead to more people being picked off one by one. The gore was done right with just enough head shots and to say head impalings to go around.  The chainsaw on the bus was pretty cool idea too and to people that have seen know what happens with said chainsaw!!! The celebrity shooting game also made me laugh out loud. My only real problem is with the ending. Which is cool in it's own but could have been a bit more clearer, hey I'm a guy that likes closure so sue me. I just hope that this movie will inspire Romero to make a fourth film or for Zack to make another sequel. But overall I think people should just sit back and enjoy a great zombie movie with plenty splats and shocks.."

","This movie was awesome. It scared the bejesus out of me as times. I am a fan of Romero's movies and a fan of horror movies. To me this movie didn't feel like a remake, it felt more like a reimagining. The opening sequence sucked me right in. I prefer zombies to be slow and stupid, but if ""28 Days Later"" was a reinvention of zombie horror, then i guess having the zombies be fast in this movie is a good follow up on that concept. Survival horror movies rule!  I loved the Jay Leno zombie part that was hilarious. The soundtrack was great too. I liked the version of Disturbed's ""Down with the Sickness"" not done by them- but as like a swing/jazzy kind of song. I hope the DVD has a lot of deleted scenes. If you liked ""The Passion of the Christ"", go see this movie."
"SnacksForAll","Null","0","0","19 March 2004"," Classic!
","First, let me say, as one of the FEW die-hard fans of the original who decided it was better to live with his mind OPEN instead of CLOSED, I embraced the idea of something *different* when I heard about this remake. For your own sake, whether you have seen this film or not, you should too. DAWN OF THE DEAD is a great experience in horror movie-going, and this film really deserves to be viewed with a scared audience in a theater.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid...DAWN 04 not only does justice to its namesake, it becomes its own film entirely while never forgetting its roots. It borrows masterfully from elements of 28 Days Later but doesn't take itself too seriousley (as that film, though also great in its own right, did). The plot is very clever, fast-paced and original; never have I seen ""zombies"" handled quite like this. James Gunn, unlikely scribe of DAWN 04 (I say unlikely because he's responsible for the so-so SCOOBY DOO film and is also a TROMA alumnus), knows how to do zombies -- he nails the action in a way every fan of the undead dreams of. The pacing is breakneck-quick, but not to DAWN's detriment; you are never allowed to feel safe or get comfortable. In this case, that's a good thing -- you are constantly on your toes and biting your nails.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, I'm not a big fan of claustrophobic closeups, and although this film has its share, it's not that distracting and it's more than made up for in the excellent camera work. Some may be reminded of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN; there is almost a documentary feel in certain scenes. The visual work in DAWN OF THE DEAD underscores the film's intended atmosphere perfectly -- you are almost thrown into the action.<br/><br/>
Some in internet gripe circles (heh, as if there's any other type of ""circle"" on the internet) have complained a bit about the ""lack"" of character development due to the large cast, but I could find no real cause for that here. True, DAWN 04 is not the social allegory, nor the drama that its namesake was, but it doesn't pretend to be what it's not. It also doesn't pretend that it wants us to get to know every single character introduced; the leads make themselves known, and the script ""develops"" them appropriately in the parameters of the kind of film that this is. There is indeed a good human element in this script -- not heavy handed, gooey or predictable, but just right for the film.<br/><br/>The cast is well-picked, and the acting top-notch -- there were a few really memorable performances here (most notably in the characters of ""CJ"" and ""Steve""), as well as a few hearty laughs thrown in for balance, but once again you never feel safe. The humans make fun of the marauding dead in the parking lot below the mall, but it merely serves to make the sense of morbidity, human mortality and fear stronger; we know they're only out for a nervous laugh to forget their miserable situations. Again, the human element is handled well for such a horror film. Kudos to James Gunn.<br/><br/>DAWN OF THE DEAD isn't perfect, but you'll be so busy hanging on to your seat, laughing and screaming that you won't notice.<br/><br/>Go see it."

","This remake is probably the best remake of all time.  The director captured everything that Romero put into the original, and added some more.  The character's are realistic, unlike those in some horror movies, and the special effects are captivating.  The comic relief bits are funny, and give you a sense of security, when you already know there is none.  But we definitely have to thank the movie ""28 days later.""  If not for that excellent film, ""Dawn of the Dead"" would not have been anywhere near as exciting as it was.  I know most of you are true fans of George Romero, as I am one myself, but this movie does not knock his name from the top; it raises it higher.  I don't know about anyone else, but I give this movie a BIG 10, and will be back in the theaters very soon!!!"

","Long version:  (no spoilers...I double checked)<br/><br/>I am more annoyed at the theatre company for bringing up the house lights over the credits (stay, by the way) than I am at the movie executives who greenlighted this project who had all ""made the list"" when I heard this mulligan was being filmed.<br/><br/>While I hope that Romero, Savini and all the other original cast members who made cameos were well paid for their time, I have to say that the new group of beseiged castaways did an okay job of making the idea of being holed up in a shopping mall surrounded by the flesh eating undead their own.<br/><br/>Okay...I still have a problem with the 28 Days Later style of agile and quick moving zombies. I am a traditionalist. But it was obvious that a significant portion of of screen writer James Gunn's  misspent youth involved an immersion in the classics of the genre, and a whole lot of video games.  So the material is treated with reverence, respect, pathos, and the right amount of jet black humour to ensure that I did not feel violated, or even cheated out of my money.  (Except for the house lights thing which REALLY annoyed me!)<br/><br/>The movie is quite artfully crafted and filled with visual allusions to the entire original trilogy.  The gore is pervasive and squishy without being overwhelming or too comical, and your first calls about who lives and who dies are probably going to be right on the money.<br/><br/>There are no suprises here, and it breaks no new ground in the genre, but the individual elements combine well to create an overall satisfying zombie stomp."
"Shotcalla39","10","0","0","19 March 2004"," Great modern day horror flick. The original 'Dawn' is of course better. But this one delivers a great plot like the original.
","I saw this movie with my mother and my sister at 6:45 Eastern Time. I'm a die hard fan of Romero's 'Dead"" Trilogy and am still very skeptical about this movie.  However,  it's one of the best horror films in years along with titles like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Ring', and for longtime fans of horror movies 'Freddy vs. Jason'.  I might add that 'Jason X' was one of the worst in years.  But it feels good that they're bringing back the classics and not ruining them as we've seen in years past.<br/><br/>
The opening scene of the 2004 re-make of 'Dawn' is a great way to get your audience involved with a movie.  The gore, the athlete fast zombies, and some disturbing images are a good way to get this movie going.  The make-up was outstanding and the 'twitching' zombies were pretty cool. Seeing Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Tom Savini in the movie were a thrill of its own.  However, they only had 20 seconds each in the film.  I believe they should have been involved a little bit more in the movie.<br/><br/>
The acting overall was great.  Ving Rhames delivers a kick-ass performance.  More characters were in this movie to make it seen on many different point of views.  The gore is alright but the DVD should give us some guts getting teared out of a biker.  Oh, no only that graphic could be on the original 'Dawn'.  But this movie is great on a different level and is guaranteed to be worth seeing once, twice, or a few times.  I think it was better than 28 Days Later.  'Dead' fans already started running to the theater.  ** 3/4 out of 4."

","George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" has been a favourite of mine since I first saw it, in a heavily censored version, in Toronto in 1978/79.<br/><br/>I eventually saw the uncut version on video, courtesy of my older brother, who snagged the REAL version from a US video store; the frenetic pacing, cool special effects, nifty music & the STORY of the original ""Dawn"" all impressed me no end, and the film is easily in my Top Ten favourite films of all time.<br/><br/>I was dismayed when I heard about the remake, but, after seeing it this afternoon, I can say that I quite liked it, even if it is not as effective as the original, but it is a movie that reflects the time(s), and I think that it is not the travesty that I thought that it'd be.<br/><br/>First time director Zack Snyder does a good job, although some of his ""tricks"" are a bit obvious, and I think that there is perhaps too much blood, and the ghastly ""thrash"" metal on the soundtrack had my ears perilously close to bleeding (that said, the use of a certain Jim Carroll Band tune over the end credits is inspired).<br/><br/>The new ""Dawn"" takes the original ""survivors of a zombie apocalypse holed-up in a shopping mall"" (Toronto's Thorncliffe Mall), and expands upon it, adding more survivors than the original had; also, it has to be noted that the cast of the new ""Dawn"" is top-heavy with fabulous babes, notably the lovely & talented Sarah Polley, who plays an ass-kicking nurse with much aplomb.<br/><br/>Other babe-a-licious cast members include Lindy Booth, Inna Korobkina, and Kim Poirer, all of whom will probably be seen sporting bikinis in the pages of ""Maxim"" any day now.<br/><br/>The guys in the film all fair pretty well, too; Ving Rhames is as solid as ever, and Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, and especially Michael Kelly as the p***ed off mall security guard, are all splendid.<br/><br/>The fact that the zombies in the new version are considerably faster than the slow-moving ghouls of the past owes more than a little to the speedy living dead of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"".<br/><br/>To sum up, the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" is pretty decent, and has babes to spare, but for a more thoughtful (and more fun) time, buy the original."

I hope that it makes mega bucks, so that hopefully George Romero can get the financial backing to make a top-notch fourth and final film in his original series. The special effects and zombies are well done, the quality of acting is far above any found in most zombie films, and it is not overly gory. It will be interesting to see what deleted scenes will be added back in the DVD version of the film. Some purist fans of the original Romero version will probably be full of complaints about this movie, but I say to them ,the original version was not a perfect film by any means either, so give this one a chance, I think it will grow on you."

","Ok, I just saw the remake of DOTD. It really scared the @#$@ out of me, I liked it. But, Because I have to do it, here is what I didn't like.<br/><br/>1. I think it makes sense that zombies might move fast. The problem is that not ALL zombies should move fast. The fat lady for example, you'd think she'd be a bit slower than the rest. Also, after they start to decay for a while (or go awhile without ""food"") you'd think they'd start to slow down a bit.<br/><br/>2. Zombie bites, even little ones that barely leave a mark always kill you and turn you into a zombie. This tends to say that there was a virus of some sort that causes the phenomenon (28 Days Later). If this is the case, then it would not have happened suddenly without warning in a single day AROUND THE WORLD. Also, if the only way to become a zombie is to be bitten by one, where did the first zombie come from? On top of that, what about the cop with the cut on his arm. He got zombie blood in that cut, so why didn't he become zombified?<br/><br/>3. This one goes along with number 2. People in this movie died in normal ways (gunshots, chainsaws, etc) In the original, those people would have become zombies. In this one, they stayed down. This adds to a less realistic (if there is such a thing) zombie movie.<br/><br/>4. If I knew that the world had been taken over by zombies, and I was coming up to an island, would I just come ashore and hang out? No, I'd circle the island in the boat, and make lots of noise, to attact zombies. If none came after several hours, then I'd come ashore. If zombies did show up, I'd leave.<br/><br/>5. Zombies don't like to eat dogs. Why would a zombie care if you were a human or a dog. It knows that you are warm living flesh. It would eat the dog!!<br/><br/>6. Isn't it convenient that Anna crashed her car right next door to the mall?<br/><br/>7. When he first shows up, CJ is a very unlikeable person. He is ready to kill everyone else to insure his survival. They even have to lock him up because of this. Then, very suddenly, near the end, he decides that he'd rather stay behind in the van, to act as a diversion. He ultimatly blows himself up so that the others might live. How Christ like of him!!<br/><br/>8. When Anna and Louis were in the shower, the TV shows a special news bulletin. Though we do not actually see this bulletin, we assume it is about the zombies. One would think that this would be all over the news once the story broke. So when they got out of the shower, somebody had to turn the tv off. They probably notice then that the news was reporting about zombies.<br/><br/>9. In the first 30 seconds of the movie, they talk about a patient who had a bite on his hand, and then had to be sent to the ER. HE WAS A ZOMBIE!! Anna works in a hospital, the zombie had been there all day long. He would have started attacking people by then! Anna would already know about the zombies!!! She is a smart girl!<br/><br/>10. In the mall parking lot, there was hundreds if not thousands of zombies. But just one block away the streets were empty. Why?<br/><br/>Anyways I'm done with my rant. Thanks!!!"

It was a tribute to the George Romero films (watch it, you'll see it).  I don't think that one measured up to Dawn though.  The completely rehashed story and characters was a fresh breath of air to we, the fans of zombie flicks. The characters were more or less real, the plot and how the characters reacted to the events was believeable, and the gore was perfect.  As far as gore goes, it finally broke the trend of using a cut away as opposed to old fashioned Savini-esque effects.  Ok, so I don't sound like I am some starry eyed fan who saw no flaws in it, I did think that some things that happened were...shall we say forced...(The baby thing...)  But coming from somone who has seen them all, I'd easily say this is the best zombie flick since 1992's Peter Jackson (thats right kids) Directed DEAD/ALIVE.

The gold standard for this genre is obviously the Romero trilogy.  While I enjoyed aspects of the DOTD update, it was pretty clear that this was a studio cash grab.  Why even use the DAWN title when this would have been more aptly titled Resident Evil Goes Shopping?  Because they know we'll show up to the theaters like the mindless flesh-eaters to the mall. Possible spoilers ahead.  There is interesting new cemetery ground broken here; Re-animated fetus storyline, different escape/rescue scenarios, Chilling CGI enhanced scenes of what appear to be thousands of the undead in the streets.  On the plus side: Cool Johnny Cash song about death over credit montage of chaotic news clips builds a sense of dread.  Strong opening, it grabs you.  It certainly doesn't waste any time getting the characters to the mall.  The acting is strong among the main cast.  Zombie make-up very impressive.  Negatives include fancy MTV/Private Ryan camera work that makes the action hard to decipher at crucial times.  Too many characters/weak characterization.  Running zombies?  Pretty co-ordinated for something just revived from the dead.  I prefer my zombies retarded and limping across the parking lot.  Gore is rather subdued, nothing's shocking. An insulting storyline involving a dog named ""Chips"" (groan).  Cliched hero sacrifices himself for the greater good bit.  ""You go on, I'll catch up...arghhh!!"" Blechhh.  6 out of 10.

"freejack21usa","10","0","0","20 March 2004"," Surprisingly Good and Fun
","Great film.  Just as good as the original but for different reasons.  You can never remake a film, so this re-imagining rocked.  This isn't the 70s, something needed to change.  After 30 yrs of zombie films some things had to change, and it worked.  people aren't going to react the same to Zombies as they would in the 70s.  If a some stumbling slow zombie came running towards you, I am sure a 12yo would know what to do.  The film had to change some things to make a Zombie film frightening in modern day.<br/><br/>Also a loved the strong female heroine.  The chick in the last one was so weak and annoying.  This film benefited with the new idea of the kick butt chick, who does what she needs to do to survive.  It also has intentional humor in it, something old horror fans will aprreciate.  It was just a rocking good time.  As far as scariness they did as much as they could with a R rating.  Got away with some gross stuff too and a few good scares.<br/><br/>The characters, and acting was really amazing.  The acting in the original was HORRIBLE.  So I'd say the the two films are equally good for different reasons.<br/><br/>Also stay for the credits, there you will see the true ending.  Whomever doesn't like the ending didn't stay for the credits."

","Its very simple, take that artsy piece of foreign crap: ""28 Days Later"" and wipe your A55 with it! becuase the ""Dawn of The Dead"" remake is the real deal. Directors Paul Anderson (Resident Evil) and the awful Danny Boyle (28 Days Later) should really use ""Dawn of The Dead"" to get a clue about how a zombie film is done correctly.<br/><br/>Dawn of The Dead has all the action and survival horror that anyone could want in a zombie movie and it sticks to the simple basics. The casting is also fantastic, Ving Rhames who plays a noble ex-marine turned cop is just the kind of bulldozer I would want watching my back when taking on the undead. Rather than Michelle Rodriguez (Res Evil) LOL or a skinny Britt running around with his shirt off (28 Days Later). ""Dawn of The Dead"" sets new standards of ""doing things right"" for present day hollywood. I give this film 3 out of 4 stars, its phenominal. Go out and buy the original also, the original Dawn and the remake are both equally well done."

I personally never saw the Romero original so i can't judge and compare the two but I do know that this movie is very good and will hopefully stay in the theaters for a while, this movie is a real ""Popcorn muncher"" There is nudity but it is at the end for about 2 seconds so for those who are worried about nudity its not packed with it like most horror movies.

","I'm a big fan of horror movies, especially the original Dawn Of The Dead. So I was quite excited when I found out a remake was on it's way! Then I found out it was being made by first time director Zack Snyder. Disappointment started to set in at this point because I thought it would be a terrible remake (as they usually are). All this aside, I left the cinema pleasantly surprised! I was happy to see Ken Foree as the televangelist (from what I've read, there were several other cameos from the original cast too). To say it is a precise remake would be lying! There are a lot more characters taking refuge in the mall and the zombies are a lot more terrifying in that they are so much faster (think 28 Days Later). I especially appreciated the little nods to the original such as when the young girl bites the husband at the beginning, when it shows the flesh being torn out and still hanging from the young girls mouth! Stupidly gory but appreciated! This surpasses most modern day horror films and doesn't seem to stick to the same cliches said horror films stick to! This movie is well worth the admission price. So, if you want your horror films full of blood, guts and gore then go see! If you are a fan of the original then go see! Who knows, maybe this could be start of a zombie flick revival (28 Days Later, Dawn Of The Dead, Shaun Of The Dead)."

","This movie met all my expectations and more.  From the trailer I know it's a movie with fast zombies instead of the slow ones from the original.  That alone hooks me and draws me to the movie; I've never been able to get into the old ""Dead"" movies Romero did.  I mean, come on, the zombies are so slow you can run circles around them.  How scary is THAT?<br/><br/>I never watched the original Dawn of the Dead (only saw Night and Day), but I liked what I see here.  Right of the bat, the action takes off 5 minutes into the movie.  This movie isn't about panic, it's pure adrenaline packed into an hour and a half.  The action is fast-paced and relentless, helped by the zombies that can probably run faster than you can.<br/><br/>And I just loved some of the irony in this movie, in moments it's deeper than most horror movies."

"allanhc","10","0","0","20 March 2004"," Great remake
","As a fan of the original Romero films and the genre in general, I was somewhat apprehensive to see what this film would do with the material. Fortunately, the result was an onslaught of gore, awesome looking modern-day `fast' zombies, well honed homage to the past, and snippets of originality from the writer/director that make this a truly excellent addition to the zombie film collection!  While House of the Dead (last year) had its good moments (and its bad as well), Dawn exhibited quality filmmaking all the way through.  I really enjoyed the energy, visual effects (gore) and cinematography, and the characters in this movie.  So many horror movies these days forget that characters are as important as the rest of the action.  Not here.  If you are a zombie fan, and you enjoyed 28 Days and/or the original Living Dead movies, you really should see this movie on the big screen.  There are some really great suspense sconces that we could never have imagined back in the 1970s.   Enjoy!"

","The new Dawn of the Dead movie is awesome. I plan to see it many times in the theater. It looks as if they mixed the original film with 28 Days Later. I fine mix if you ask me.I would give the movie 9 out of 10, only because of the baby scene and I know that there is approximately 10 minutes of footage that will appear on the dvd. Overall, anyone who remotely liked 28 Days Later or any of Romero's earlier zombie films will love this one. The scene where they were picking off zombies that looked like celebrities was a good break in the horror. It was funny in a demented sort of way. The ending that extended through the credits was a little darker than the original. I definately recommend this movie."
"octobertoph","Null","0","0","20 March 2004"," Deserves a Seat Among Zombie Greatness
","I saw this film last night with a friend of mine. I absolutely loved it, but sitting there, knowing my friend was a stickler and elitist about such things, I wondered what he was thinking. After we left the theater (yes, and into a mall), I asked him his opinion and as par for the course, he went on to talk about how ""As Dawn of The Dead had more 'stupid' action, 28 Days Later was superior because it was acted better, had a stronger plot, was tied together nicely at the end and was uplifting."" If you ask me.. do you go to a zombie flick to feel uplifted? No! You want pure hell on earth. You want chaos, and to see how people react to that situation. I won't make fun of '28 Days' because there are fans of it out there, but I think that's a niche zombie film. Dawn of The Dead deserves a seat alongside the rest of Romero's Living Dead films as classic zombie fare. Also, what's the fun of a neat-and-clean ending? Zombies ARE hell on earth. You can't possibly stop it, if it were to happen. There would be no 'nice clean endings' except your own death, given that this was for real. I won't spoil anything, but you will be satisfied at the ending, if you want this world to continue for a possible sequel.. Yes, there are some cinematic licenses taken (such as when the girl goes to save her dog, Chips. Blatant stupid plot device), but if you consider it, rational thought WOULD escape you somewhat, if you were in this situation. The first few minutes of the film try to toss you into this world, and do so excellently.Camera work was innovative, and really tossed you into this chaotic world satisfyingly quick. I knew right before the credits were rolling at the start of the film, that I was in for an excellent time. I wasn't let down.  DotD definetely delivers pure action, solid acting, solid plot, excellent, 'bought' special effects, and well done tension. I personally loved how the screenwriters explored what else someone could do in such a world..how different people might react.. (overzealous, hick security guards from Wisconsin bieng one example,) This, I feel, is the second best zombie film i've seen, only rivaling Night of The Living Dead. The original 'Dawn' was far, far too slow, acting poor, and the social commentary, while commended, was not needed. Leave that to Sci-Fi films with apes in em, okay? I'm ready for Resident Evil Apocalypse now!"

","This film was very entertaining if you take it for what it is...a story about dead people taking over the planet. Fast-paced, creepy, well done effects, great acting, etc. If you want to break down the finer points, I have only two small complaints. First, not one character showed me the ""what the hell is going on"" panic mode that I think would be overtaking me in a situation like that. And the other-the shot that Mekhi Phifer's character took at Ving Rhames' character missed by a mile at point blank range while throughout the rest of the film most everyone was dead-on accurate.<br/><br/>I love horror films. I love horror films that keep your heart racing. This one does the trick for me. Wow, my wife even liked it and I had to talk her into going with me.<br/><br/>I think I may have seen the original when I was a little kid but don't remember it.

"dirtystranger","9","0","0","20 March 2004"," A great zombie movie
","I'm a very avid fan of zombie movies, and like any huge fan I am very familiar with the original Dawn of the Dead. It set the bar for apocalyptic zombie fests and contained a brain inside its gory exterior. The new Dawn doesn't have that. In fact, the new Dawn doesn't have anything that made the original so great... aside from the mall, of course. That doesn't make it a bad movie. If this movie were named something else, I wouldn't have a single complaint... I would be raving about how fantastic of a zombie movie this was. But they decided to have this as a remake of a Romero classic, and they ripped out everything that made the original so... original. The new Dawn is scary, visceral and fast paced. If they would have slowed it down, and stepped it back a bit so the viewers could get a chance to know the characters, and see the characters reaction to their situation it would have paid better homage to the original. They're different movies, and they are both great in their own right. The new Dawn is excellent in its own way, and in itself sets a new standard for zombie movies. Hopefully the zombie movie will stay around for a while. I would like to see how this sub-genre fleshes out. Only time will tell."
"primoooze1138","9","0","0","20 March 2004"," Zombies were never so much fun.
","Though I haven't seen the original (but do intend to soon), I was drawn to this movie like the zombies to the mall.  The premise, people seeking refuge in a mall from a zombie epidemic, is a very intriguing one.  Normally, I'm not one for zombie films (The Romero's and the Raimi's being the exceptions).  But I found this to be a very entertaining film.  It is by no means scary or frightening, but it does have its share of creepy moments. Compared to 28 Days Later, this film seems to be going more for audience gratification, rather than the classiness of independent films.  In this aspect, Dawn of the Dead delivers time and again.  There's a great sequence involving celebrity look-alike zombies; though I won't ruin it for anyone. The movie's got a good sense of what it's trying to accomplish.  Director Zack Snyder and co. intend to bring George Romero's 1978 classic a modern touch, for a modern audience.  More often than not, the film works.  The plot (though altered) remains viable after 25 or so years.  Also, Dawn of the Dead has an excellent sense of humor.  Occasionally, the film seems to be mocking the whole concept of the end of the world.  Great action, great tunes (you ain't heard nothing 'til you've heard ""Down With the Sickness"" performed by a lounge singer), lots of fun.  I really enjoyed this film. 8/10."
"badbhoy","8","0","0","20 March 2004"," Pleasantly Surprised!
","First off, I've been a fan of the original for years and I was extremely skeptical on what a remake would be able to achieve considering the source material.  That being said, James Gunn and Zack Snyder have put together not only one of the best remakes of any film I have seen in years, but a true classic within the zombie genre itself.  Is it as good as the original? It's hard for me to consider that since one of the things I love about the 1979 version is that it's so...well 1979!  I couldn't expect a 2004 version to include a ultra low-budget effects department, Goblin soundtrack,  and the Brown Derby Luv Pub.  This version definitely has some elements of the Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer generation of horror film-making, but for the most part it improves the movie rather than turning it into another post-1990 crapfest.  There are enough sly nods to the original to demonstrate that Snyder is a fan of the cult classic, but he still makes sure to  let the audience know that this his own masterpiece right from the opening scene.  Most importantly, the film doesn't cop-out like last years 28 Days Later did. Snyder thankfully realizes that a movie about the apocalypse should stay true to it's theme from beginning to end. There are still a couple of minor flaws. The film does unfortunately shy away from the original's underlying message about consumerism, but that would be difficult to pull off in any film in 2004 since the film industry is now such integral part of that anyway.   I also would have loved to hear the hilarious mall muzak that played during the 1979 version's closing credits, but Jim Carroll's People Who Died and Johnny Cash's Man Comes Around are fantastic replacements.<br/><br/>In the end, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is not only a film that should satisfy purists of the original classic, but also a refreshing revisit to the zombie genre that will hopefully inspire other filmmakers to do the same.<br/><br/>8/10"
"D-Rod","Null","0","0","20 March 2004"," Toss up
","Okay, to get it out of the way, the original ""Dawn"" was better, no argument, end of story. But to look at this as an entirely different movie (which was incredibly difficult, but I always try to give a fair chance whenever I see a movie, especially a remake), but again as its own movie, the new ""Dawn"" wasn't that bad.  It was immensely better than most of the new era zombie movies we've been dealing with like Resident Evil and House of the Dead, which were both based on video games and would have been 100 times better if they had let the actual video game creators write the script instead of giving us awful dialogue such as, ""So what you're telling us it that we have to shoot them in the head?""  Please, it sounds like an eighth grader wrote that.<br/><br/>Sorry.  Anyway, what every horror movie needs in order to work is to build strong characterization so that we can feel what they're feeling and truly hope that nothing awful happens to them.  For the new ""Dawn"" I honestly didn't care, most of the time I was silently saying, ""Okay, let's drop some of these characters and get moving.""  Most of the people had no identities at all, such as the slutty blonde and the old man who was trying on the women's shoes.  Do you remember their names?  Didn't think so.<br/><br/>The only character that I truly had bad feelings for was Matt Frewer's character, ""Frank.""  Solely because I love Matt Frewer and would not be able to bare seeing the man stub his toe.  You don't want him to die, especially when they approach him to tell him he's infected, but he was busy talking to his daughter with a smile on his face.  ""No. . ."" Is what I was saying.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't awful, it had some of those obligatory ""zombie jumping out of nowhere and making you hop out of your chair a little bit, then you look around to see if anybody saw you do that.""  Otherwise, the film wasn't scary.  It was the same formula; zombies run amok, a group of people unite and isolate themselves, something goes wrong, gotta get out of there, the black character lives.  That wasn't a racist remark, it's just something I've noticed with zombie flicks."
"vortexrider","10","0","0","20 March 2004"," Much better than I expected it to be
","First of all I am not even going to compare this re-make to the original because it is unfair to do that. if people wanted it to be like the original they would rent the original from 1978.<br/><br/>On its own Dawn Of The Dead stands out for the same reasons the original stood out. You see horror and gore unlike anything you've seen before. The wounds are realistic. You see brains fly from the zombies' heads. This movie was obvously intended not to hold any realism back. When someone in it, zombie or a human, are shot you see blood sputter and smear very realistically.<br/><br/>Besides the gore realism this movie succeeds at scaring me with genuine ""pop out of your seat"" scares. You know how some horror movies just scare you with some blood murder scene and leave you scared from disgust rather than from surprise. Dawn of The Dead director skillfully overcomes this and scares you when you least expect it. There are some scenes where everyone is happy and calm and you relax your nerves than a zombie jumps out and your pants suddenly get in danger of being pooped.<br/><br/>I could truly bond with some of the characters and feel their pain and fear. You see expressions on their faces change as they see people around them die and realize that their families are dead. I do think, however, that there wasnt much social commentary in this film, that is its just action action action. There is no pauses or change of pace for viewers or characters to behave differently and reflect somehow on what has happened and possibly see some conections with real world.<br/><br/>Cinematography in this one is not bad. I am not an expert on it, but I think in some scenes the color was too intense to portray feeling, everything looked cartoonishly bright. Then, especially in zombie attack and struggle, the camera was jerking around as if its some journalist filming in a riot. The camera was moved around so much it was hard to follow whats happening. Then the frame rate was reduced as well, probably to add more realism and to cover up the special effects, but was definately not hurting my viewing experience.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9 out of 10"
"rip747","8","0","0","20 March 2004"," Awesome rework
","First off, you should know that this is not a remake of the original movie, this is a rework. What is the difference? Remake is just that, a scene by scene copy of the original with a few new elements thrown in. A rework takes the basic concepts and elements from the original and gives you a whole new movie.<br/><br/>Now that we said that, the movie was AWESOME. Personally I think it was 10 fold better than what Romero put out in 1978. The zombies were better looking, scarier than the original, waaaaay faster and more intelligent. Which in my opinion would be exactly what a freshly dead person would act like.<br/><br/>The acting was good. Rahmes did a great job, a real bad ass in the movie. Polly's performance was outstanding. She has some reals bug balls in this film and quick thinking (like remembering to grab the keys). The others performances were on par, I will admit, however that Pfier's acting abiliy was wasted. The role he got sucked big time. I wish they could have written in a better character for him.<br/><br/>There wasn't ANY Romero type gore in the movie. The movie had more supence and close calls than anything else and relied heavily on that. There is alot of blood and some great kills, but nothing I think anyone hasn't seen before.<br/><br/>I'm not going to tell you anything that happens the film other than saying that you should stay through the whole ending credits. :)<br/><br/>Rating 8"

","When I first heard of this remake, I shook my fists at the heavens and spat defiantly on the ground...cursing Hollywood for making such travesty.  However, I saw the trailers and thought I'd give it a try.  Surprisingly, I was not disappointed with this remake.  It was fast, vicious, and gruesome; Not what I thought it would be (a mindless teenybopper piece of garbage with talentless, pretty people).  However, it did lack the the key narrative points that made the original so great.  There were too many characters and, as a result, they did not develop into characters that warranted sympathy. Except for Ving Rhames and Sarah Polly, the rest of the cast were dull and annoying, I was happy when they ended up zombie fodder (I especially wanted the kid from Air Bud to be zombie-fied, but disappointingly it did  not happen).  The mall became a secondary backdrop.  The original's mall became a character itself, becoming part of the people inside.  While the outside world was going to hell, they had a safe, secure home.  Lastly, the entire idea of consumerism equaling mindless zombies was ignored.  The good points about the remake:  incrediblezombie effects, they were hideous and terrifying; the tense action sequences;  the cameos by the cast of the original, the store in the mall named Gaylen Ross; the questionable and<br/><br/>unnerving ending; and some (only just some) of the changes to the story (the zombie infestation happening so quickly, only the bites causing resurrection,etc). In sum, this was not a  bad remake.  What it lacked, the original had...and what the original lacked, the remake had."

","I have to tell you after watching the stupid teaser for this film my expectations weren't very high. And although the trailer kicked major ass I still had doubts on wheather it would even be a mediocre film, it didn't have much going for it. A brand new commerical director, a big studio, a remake of a (in my opinion) passable flaky classic.  And even after meeting the cast at the Fango Convention in January, I got a little amped to see it but still had my doubts. All of those doubts have been put to rest today. Following the same logic as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake this is more of a reimagining borrowing the basic ideas and updating for our times. Dawn of the Dead isn't just a good film, it's a great one. And a landmark genre picture at that. It follows the basic setup of the strangers meeting at a local mall, where they fend off hordes of zombies while trying to indulge themselves in an acceptable lifestyle. Only for the horrors of the world surrounding them to come crashing in. And boy do they do. The film boasts some of the most imaginative death sequences seen in a while and captures the overall dread and horror brought forth by the source material. Unlike it's simplistic and over hyped predecessor this film remains entertaining while staying respectful, clever and scary. It also helps that the film is fueled by taut direction, good performances especially from new horror heroine Sarah Polley and believable charachter growth and story development. The effects are also over the top, grotesque and very creative.  However the only way the film falls short is in the way that it doesn't match Chainsaw's story telling or overall intensity. But this film is definatly a new horror classic, the new generation can embrace and the old genration can treasure. One thats respectful to a genre fan's needs and yet can overcome critical stabs and remain succesful. Dawn of the Dead is just another example of how Remakes are beginning to rule genre territory and new flicks are just seemingly falling flat. Their are many reasons to cherish this film cinematograoghy, hilarious soundtrack choices, an intensly scary tone, great spfx, good story, believable performances, expert direction but the one main reason to go see it is that it's worth your money."

","Wow I went to see this at a special preview last night and it realy scared me and believe me ive seen a lot of horror movies. As a fan of the original movie I was expecting a soso remake with a few chills along the vein of resident evil. But what I didnt expect was to be jumping out of my skin at every sound and peeking through my fingers every 5 mins ,you may think im just a wimp but honestly it takes a lot to scare me and this is one of the only films that has managed to do so in a while, the other being Dark Water which i also recommend. I do feel  I need to say that I dont realy think that this should be classed as a remake as its very different from the original the mall is there but thats about it, its also closer in tone to something like 28 days later. I think that its not lacking when you compare it to the original because its different, where the original to me had an epic feel that was chilling as you realy felt that the problem was not just contained to the people in the mall, this movie was more action led and I felt that it focoused more on the characters we saw I didnt feel that there was a world outside that was ravaged by zombies. I also thought that a few of the characters in the remake were just there for fodder and had no real purpose as they were not developed. Those niggles aside I loved this movie and was pleasently suprised it shows films like Resident Evil (which I thought was ok when I first saw it) for the poor imitations they realy are, although dont take my word for it go see it for yourself and be afraid."

There was NO character development except for Ving Rhames. the zombies were fast and scary but this really reminded me of 28 days.....just with actually dead people  coming back to life.<br/><br/>Oh and the start, some cheesy screensaver I can recreate on my computer with the word, ""Strike"". Come on, is this referring to the zombies or to maybe a terrorist ""strike"" that caused this. the more I write the more I am thinking about this movie.<br/><br/>Best part was celebrity target practice. Burt Reynolds, Jay Leno. bwahahaha. funny stuff. That part was classic I must admit.<br/><br/>Oh, and then the part where the girl goes to get the dog. Why didnt she just whistle to get the dog back? I MEAN COME ON PEOPLE?! Then poor Andy never gets to eat his sandwich. Him and Kenneth are the only people I was really rooting for in the movie. We need George Romero to the rescue QUICK?!<br/><br/>Well, that is all I have to say about the movie, oh, and one last note. If you see a zombie in a fishing boat when you are going to an island I would've stay cleared of the island. No questions asked. and then we get the ending. not a happy one but could've showed it without all the camera jumping like Blair Witch and stuff and especially not cutting in and out of the credits.

"swhitley2000","8","0","0","20 March 2004"," More of a nod than a remake *minor spoilers*
","As the summary reads, this is more of a nod to the original Dawn than a true remake.  True, the premise is the same but that's really where it ends. First off, the cast is much larger than the original so by sheer numbers alone, there isn't as much attention given to detailed character exploration as some would like.  More due to the performances of the leading actors than the script, I did find myself caring about some of the people in this movie. A lot of the characters are one dimensional and even those fleshed out a bit are more broad sketches than multi-layered personalities.  This really isn't a complaint because, for better or worse, this is a horror film and my expectations for such a thing in this genre have been lowered to the point thru years of viewing bad films that a little bit can go a long way in this type of film.   Second, the journey to get to the mall is much faster than the original.  I didn't feel it was necessary for the characters in this version to get there any later than they did because it would have really slowed the movie down.  There isn't the sense of impending dread in the remake like there is in the original; this film simply moves at a different pace.  Not really better or worse, just different.  In fact, that can be said for the movie as a whole.  It's not the original Dawn.  They simply can't remake that film for many reasons, not the least of which is the social commentary in the original wouldn't seem particularly relevant to today's audience.<br/><br/>Now on to the review of the movie itself.  I have very few complaints with the remake.  I felt that segments were unintentionally funny, especially with Mekhi Phifer's (who really did deserve a better forum to showcase his skills than the tired subplot he was saddled with) character Andre.  I also felt there could've been more background given on Michael (Jake Weber). There seemed to be hints given about him through out that I'm not entirely certain were born more from the screenplay or the actor's performance. Also, the romantic chemistry between he and Ana (Sarah Polley) was sadly lacking.<br/><br/>Now on to what I thought worked.  Ok...I'll admit it: I liked the zombies. I've read some comparisons to 28 Days Later in the other comments which I do agree with due to timing more than anything else.  The concept of zombies that don't stumble and stagger isn't really a new one, though.  There's an Italian zombie film that features such beasties (the title escapes me). And, in all honesty, 28 Days Later did lift a bit from Day Of The Dead in the last 45 minutes or so...  The opening to this film is great.  I feel that it goes about showing the utter chaos of the situation in a more jarring fashion than the original.  I realize I'm jumping on the band wagon here, but Ving Rhames is just awesome in this movie.   This is a bit random, but I couldn't help but be reminded of Lucio Fulci's Zombie during the end credits...<br/><br/>I'd give this movie 6 1/2 out of 10 stars.  It's not great, but it's wildly entertaining.  It's not the original Dawn, either.  I think if one walks in expecting a straight retread of the original than they'll be disappointed. If it's taken as a different film with the same premise, then I think that it stand on it's own."

","Just seen Dawn at a preview screening. (Not out proper for another week in the UK.)  Goes to show you shouldn't believe everything you read on discussion boards - It is fantastic.<br/><br/>This is the film Romero would love to have made if he ever had a decent budget.  No it doesn't have his social commentary.  No it isn't making any deep statements about consumerism.  Yes the zombies run.  But it works - it's scary, it's brutal, and you believe it.  It portrays the end of the world convincingly.  To not like this film is to not like zombie movies, and horror in general.<br/><br/>Having said all that, all the usual cliches are present and correct - people acting like suicidal idiots wandering off alone, unsympathetic characters thrown in just to get eaten, etc but on the whole it doesn't hit many bum notes.<br/><br/>If anyone tells you zombies shouldn't run, and they're more scary when they're slow, I would suggest they haven't seen this yet.  These monsters are the business.<br/><br/>And the gore!  You name it it's in there.  It's a cannibal/zombie/gut-crunching/head blowing off fest.  Fan-f*cking-tastic!!!"
"mansfield_satchmo","Null","0","0","20 March 2004"," 28 Days Later meets Resident Evil
","This film remake, considered alone, is very reflective of those things that define the audience mentality today (or perhaps how Hollywood perceives the audience mentality...or possibly some combination of the two).<br/><br/>Whereas the 1970's classic was thought-provoking, smitten with anti-consumerism propaganda (zombies CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME...at a MALL, no less), and actually had a plot, this rehashing of only the most superficial themes is typical of Millennium Hollywood.<br/><br/>It's been done before.  Take the zombies from 28 Days Later, put them in Raccoon City (ala Resident Evil), and tease the opening and closing credits with Blair Witch Project- esque clips.<br/><br/>Lots of visual stimulation, ridiculously loud noises (often the scariest noises were of the most mundane origin-i.e. sharp, grating doors opening, etc) lots of shock value, craptastic dialogue, limp thematic or moralistic exploration.<br/><br/>In this day and age, if you are looking for the opposite of the aforementioned in a zombie flick, then take your patchouli-stank esoteric arse elsewhere. Because that's not what Hollywood is about anymore, as we all know.  If you're looking for the film to show to be true to its progenitor and tell a tale about the unraveling of society via mindless consumption, then this is not your film.<br/><br/>This is for the button-happy kids who love consoles.  It plays out like the Playstation inspiration from which this film draws upon.<br/><br/>The lighting in the film makes everything vivid and uncomfortable; like being interrogated under a searing lamp.  Details of gore are exploited, thrown in your face, and charged at you with the force of 1000 running zombies.<br/><br/>
Taken merely at the entertainment level, the film is indeed entertaining. It's fun to cower in a seat for 2 hours, this stuff is really freakish.  The plot moves so quickly, that you have about 2 minutes to get comfortable before you are thrown into the madness. The film will certainly please those with short attention spans (leave the Ritalin at home for this one, folks).<br/><br/>A bit of a zombie-epicure, I would've liked to see some social criticism. The most you can get out of the film is ambivalent:  ""the mall provides a safe-haven/salvation for the uninfected,"" and/or ""the mall is where thousands of mindless, insatiable zombies flock, like Eddie Bauer-loving yuppies to a 2-day sale.""  The mall is used, because it was in the original.  That's the only reason.  It's clear that Romero and Co. missed the point.<br/><br/>It's like taking a classical, well-established library, gutting the inside, and replacing all that was sacred to the place with a bunch of Starbucks kiosks and some chain- bookstores.  But still calling it a library.<br/><br/>Then again, THIS is just a movie about some zombies, with explosions and the graphic terrorizing that ensues.  It's entertaining.  Yes.  See it, it will freak you out.  It's fun to be scared.<br/><br/>The finest part of the film is the soundtrack.  Johnny Cash and Disturbed, Muzak renditions of ironic proportions.  Excellent.  This will be a must-have soundtrack, if only for the brilliant, smarmy lounge cover of the ""Down With the Sickness.""<br/><br/>It's sad, though, that the time is gone, when zombie movies could be so much more."

"nick-m","9","0","0","18 March 2004"," I'm positively surprised!
","There is no need to talk about the many qualities of the original 1978 `Dawn Of The Dead' here. George A. Romero's movie has long since  been a movie classic, not only in the horror category. It is no surprise then, that in times of annoying remakes like `The Getaway' or the upcoming `Assault On Precinct 13', a certain feeling of scepticism is at hand when it comes to Zack Snyder's updated version of `Dawn Of The Dead'. Beside the fact that there is no need to redo a perfect movie, Snyder, as a director of commercials, didn't seem the best of choices to do the job. But maybe we were a bit prejudiced here. Snyder did a good job, he even did an outstanding job. Just as Romero's movie has many satiric elements and comments on the society of the 70's, his version perfectly mirrors today's fast paced society. A lot of action replaces atmosphere, comic relief replaces irony and unstoppable killing machines replace the old somnanbulists. But it all works out extremely well. With all the action, fast cutting and contemporary music, `Dawn Of The Dead 2004' really kicks ass. And it's owing to Snyder, that even the character development doesn't come short. Needless to say that this is not a character study like Romero's original, although Snyder manages to provide his panopticum of archetypes with enough twists and turns to develop sympathy. My advice is to watch this as independently of the original as possible. You will be rewarded with a roller coaster ride and maybe with one of the best genre movies the still young century has to offer."

","<b>Title:</b> Dawn of the Dead (2004)<br/><br/><b>Director:</b> Zack Snyder<br/><br/><b>Cast:</b> Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, Jake Weber, Michael Kelly<br/><br/><b>Tagline:</b> When theres no more room in Hell the dead will walk the earth.<br/><br/><b>Review:</b><br/><br/>Going into this movie I was allready going in with the mindset of ""this is not really a remake"" so I wasnt really ready to compare every single scene or line of dialogue to Romeros zombie classic. I was just here to see yet another zombie flick thats came about thanks to the glorious revival of the zombie flick.<br/><br/>The end of the world has come, chaos has started to spread and the dead are coming back to life! A group of people get together and in order to survive the chaos thats going on in the world, they decide that its a good idea to lock themselves up in a nearby mall.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this film, I was to tell you the truth expecting to be a little dissapointed. I wasnt expecting a really really good zombie film but thats what I got anyways! Yup, you heard me, this one was good!<br/><br/>
Lets see where do I start? Oh yeah...a kick ass opening that goes for the jugular!  I was thinking to myself ""they better do a good opening sequence and blow my mind"" well, those first few minutes were great! The set the mood for the film. Hey! Its the end of the world! People running on the streets, cars crashing, choppers flying around, buildings burning...this was the beginnings of the fucking apocalypse and I devoured every last single second of it! Ok so we got a good opening...did the rest of the movie stay as good? Hell yeah!<br/><br/>We get some interesting characters to hang out with here. Ving Rhymes was a bad mofo you didnt want to mess with and a lot of his lines where some of the ones that got the most reactions from the crowd. We also get what I like to call ""zombie food"" characters. They are day for one reason alone...to be eaten by the undead. Heh...therefore aside from a few outstanding characters youll get a few cardboard ones.<br/><br/>What I liked the most about this here flick was that the characters you thought youd end up hating you actually ended up liking...and vice versa. You feel like you want the ""white trash"" dude to die...but then you kind of warm up to him. You think that the smart guy will end up being the weak guy...in fact ends up being a strong character. The movie was different in that way.<br/><br/>It was also different in the sense that the zombies are wild and crazy...they are not Fulcis or Romeros slow movie zombies. These are more like the infected people we saw in 28 days later. Savage and with hatred in their eyes. Though slow moving zombies are the traditional way to go, I have to admit that I found these fast moving zombies to be more of a threat which helped make the movie more intense.<br/><br/>It has some really original moments that really cought me off guard, like I said this movie just took me by surprise. Theres some stuff involving a pregnant mother which I thought was handled properly. It could have gone the wrong way...but thank got it was subtle yet effective.<br/><br/>
Also the movie has some touching moments. Its not a film devoid of human emotions or feelings, its actually got some nice moments in there in which you see that the characters care for each other, they show their humanity amongst all the crazyness, I thought that was a nice touch.<br/><br/>
Then we have the ending...ok Ill just say this. The last 20 minutes of this movie should not let any real horror movie/gore hound down. The last scenes where amazing in terms of delivering the goods gore wise! Dont get me wrong, the rest of the movie is great it has gore...but they saved the best for last. This movie is not a PG-13 ""safe"" type of horror movie. Oh no, this ones not afraid to go for what we zombie loving horror fans want....gore and lots of it. So Gorehounds should be pleased, theres just enough gore to keep us happy. Two words...chain saw.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Id say this was an unexpected treat. I was expecting a semi good, slightly dissapointing rehash of Romeros flick...but what I got was a solid zombie flick. Its solid I tell ya! Its got everything youd expect from a good zombie movie and a few unexpected surprises. This ones going to be a good addition to my zombie movie collection!<br/><br/><b>Rating: 41/2 out of 5</b>"

It was so much fun and better than I anticipated - let's just say that I wouldn't have minded if I had bought a ticket (which is lots more than I can say about Day of the Dead, Night of 1000 Corpeses et al).<br/><br/>Lots of gore, lots of 'boos' that make you jump out of your seat, brilliantly shot, great soundtrack, comic relief ('serious dramatic scenes' within the confines of a gore flick that make the audience laugh, and superb effects and zombie mayhem that made the audience applaud) -- basically everything a horror flick should be.

"sladens","Null","0","0","17 March 2004"," Overall Pretty Good
","First off, I'm one of the people who does like the new breed of ""super-charged"" zombies seen in movies, and this movie does as good a job as possible showcasing that. This being Zack Snyder's first major piece may have benefitted him. He doesn't fall prey to too much early plot development and concentrates on creating an isolated feeling among the people watching a holocaust. Acting wise, the top billed stars do a fine job, although Ving Rhames performance in the beginning of the movie seems forced. The real star performances come from the second tier actors though, Ty Burrell steals scene after scene and provides great comic relief. Michael Kelly puts in an interesting spin as a character you despise in the beginning, but are cheering for by the end. When compared against peers in its genre(Resident Evil, House Of The Dead, 28 Days Later, and Undead) this movie seems to excel where the others didn't, in connecting with the mainstream audience without sacraficing it's integrity. 8 out of 10 stars. Also, watch for Tom Savini's cameo."

"rberryxx","Null","0","0","17 March 2004"," As entertaining as the original
","I'm one of those guys that think you can't have enough zombie movies, so amidst the moans from die-hard fans of George Romero's `Living Dead' films that viewed the Dawn of the Dead remake as sacrilege, it didn't really bother me much.  I mean I can understand the concern.  Just like Batman fans felt that Michael Keaton was going to screw it all up, seeing a modern Hollywood take on  one of the most beloved horror films of all time written by the guy who scripted Scooby Doo would certainly make the most optimistic filmgoers leery.<br/><br/>Can you really blame people for being skeptical?  After seeing hacked out rehashes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, uninspired Freddy and Jason nonsense, why would one think that the new version of Dawn of the Dead would be any better?  In the years of swirling rumors about the project within the horror fan community, fears of a light on the gore giggle fest with a pop music soundtrack would just amount to a giant pile of suck.  I'm happy to say that you can put your fears aside and welcome this film with open arms. Simply stated, it kicks some major ass.<br/><br/>The pedigree of cool goes up several notches as you hear Johnny Cash come back from the dead himself, singing `The Man Comes Around', amidst the chaos.  There's no lengthy setup here, the female protagonist, Ana (played wonderfully by Sarah Polley) simply wakes up in a messed up world where the dead eat the living, and quickly turn them into flesh eating zombies.  And these aren't the shambling sleepwalking souls from Michael Jackson's Thriller video, but strong, fast zombies, that sprint their asses off while they chase cars down the street.<br/><br/>She finds refuge with a small band of survivors, who inevitably holes themselves up in the local mall.  It's the mall that was the poetic focal point of the original.  A symbol of how we're all shuffling around like zombies in giant shopping establishments, even before we're dead.   In first time director Zack Snyder's hands, it's merely a place to blast apart some zombie brains.  And that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>With the unrelenting violence in Mel Gibson's recent tribute to another living dead legend generating more than a quarter of a billion dollars in ticket sales, America is perhaps ready to see insanely violent films that haven't really had their heyday since the late 70s.  Though it goes a little easy on the stomach churning cannibalism that made the original so special, there's no shortage of brain showers and blood spatters in this one.<br/><br/>
The remarkably creative violence is unrelenting.  Heads are blown to bits, sticks shoved through skulls, chainsaws cut off scores of limbs at a time, and my favorite of them all involved a white truck mowing down a dozen zombies, each of which left a giant red jelly splat of blood when their heads smacked against it.<br/><br/>The cast is varied, complex, and often humorous, without being over the top. Ving Rhames is a more than worthy successor to the original film's badass, Ken Foree (who has a nice cameo in this one that will warm the hearts of those who remember), while Jake Webber and Mekhi Phifer have surprisingly good performances as well.  Michael Kelly does an amazing job as an a**hole Mall security guard named `CJ' who is a delicious jerk.<br/><br/>Though the film bathes in violence throughout, it's a necessary and occasionally hilarious way to deal with the unreal and mind-bending situation they're all in.  I mean when you've got thousands of zombies waiting to eat you in the shopping mall parking lot, you've gotta have a little fun to keep your sanity.  While passing the time by `talking' to a lone survivor on a faraway rooftop via dry erase boards, they play a game of Celebrity Zombie Shootout, challenging him to play target practice with the living dead that resemble famous people.  Hopefully Jay Leno, Burt Reynolds, and Rosie O'Donnell won't get too p**sed when they see this.<br/><br/>While I'm impressed with the lack of restraint used with the violence here, I'm equally amazed that the filmmakers made the difficult decision to avoid excessive product placement in the film.  To set a movie of this nature in a shopping mall, and not use a single real store was a refreshing site. Aside from some well known bottles of water, there was little other recognizable merchandise in the movie.<br/><br/>Tom Savini, the gore makeup legend who handled the gore chores in the original film has an entertaining cameo as a cop who's telling a news crew how they have to shoot the zombies in the brains and burn them.  He points out an unfinished kill on the road with, `Ah, there's a twitcher' before he has her disposed of on live TV.  Matt Frewer of Max Headroom fame has a nice guest appearance as well.<br/><br/>This is the horror film I've been waiting Hollywood to come out with for a long time.  And though I may get struck by a bolt of lightning by St. George, I'll go out on a limb and say it's as enjoyable as the first.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is going to be a huge hit, and hopefully will give `The Dead' films such a great shot in the arm, that Romero may actually get the right funding and creative control to make his long awaited fourth installment in the saga."

","Saw it last night, and i have to say that so far my feelings are pretty mixed. I didn't hate it, but (eventhough I will probably buy the DVD anyways) I didn't love it either.<br/><br/>But to sum it up quickly, the plot is etched out much like ""Night of the Living Dead"": sudden break-out, strangers meet in a designated location and try to hold fort, the fort is already occupied by greedy, scared folk who don't want to share their hideout, there is a strong, leading black male character and a younger, strong white female lead; must-go-there-and-come-back suicide mission, and a similar dramatic ending.<br/><br/>Now, change the farmhouse and make it a huge mall like in ""Dawn of the Dead"". Then augment the zombie factor by a hundred-fold, like apocalyptic numbers like in ""Day of the Dead""... add lots of slick shotgun-n-flashlight action like in ""Resident Evil"", and of course... to make things hipper and faster for the young generation, make the zombies *run* like in ""28 Days Later"" (who were in fact not zombies, but infected living. I don't think you could run very fast when rigor mortis sets in!)<br/><br/>Of course, borrow alot from John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", ""Prince of Darkness"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13"", but fill the movie with obvious cameos from the original film... Then, create a poster design that pays homage to the original Dead trilogy in terms of color, design and typography.<br/><br/>
It does have neat opening and closing credit sequences, though.<br/><br/>
It does have good moments and its homages to the original film are clever, and I think overall the film will have to grow on me. it can hold on it's own if you dont know the original films. Much like ""The Ring"", the remake will be a success because alot of its audience wont have seen (or cared) about the original.<br/><br/>Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu"" was so much better.<br/><br/>But, I will give ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" a second viewing."

","Many have argued that this is not the original. Well of course not, Romero did not make this. I think all the DAWN freaks should be saving their energy to debate for when Romero get his 4th Dead film out there(if he ever does). Until then I see no problem going to see this ""re-visioning"" of the classic, because its done pretty damn well.<br/><br/>        Please get me right here when I saw that the original is in my top ten of films and I dreaded this remake as much as the next guy at horror convention. But I had a lot of fun at this.  It paid up enough gore, with CGI not being prominent(or seeming to be).  It brought about some scares and was just a good movie going experience.<br/><br/>       Yes, there are things you could compare to the original that aren't there.  The Geography of the mall was not set up as well as the 1st film. You do get rushed into the situation and with more than 4 characters you don't get to know them as well as the others from Romeros film.<br/><br/>
        And lastly one will say that the original had much to say about our society being slaves(or zombies) to Consumerism and that in a America after Vietnam and Watergate, all we can think of is ""What can we buy to forget our problems? Let's go to the mall and find out!"" What one could read into in this version, can probably come from when the group of people are on the roof and their is another group of humans on the ground looking to get in the mall too. And one character says, ""We can't let them in. They will ruin it for all of us.""(it is something to that degree, but don't quote me).  This is a perfect statement about the big fear Americans have Post-911.  We are really afraid of people we don't trust, and letting them in to our safe haven/utopia could ruin it for us all?  It is that xenophobia that runs across America today unfairly and you can logically ponder that here.<br/><br/>And near the end of the film when Ving Rhames's character has an American Flag waiving over his shoulder, that sign post has to be read and you can rewatch this film to find some substance among all the scares and gore."

"Dubl_A","7","0","0","16 March 2004"," Remake? (or) 28 Dawns Later
","First of all, I have to say that I am a Romero fan, and I did thoroughly enjoy this movie and would recommend it to any horror movie buff. IMO it blows all of the recent zombie flicks (28 Days Later in at a distant second) out of the water. It is as beautiful visually as it is grotesque. If you are late to the theater, don't bother seeing the movie at all. The first ten minutes or so before the opening credits are too perfect to miss.<br/><br/>I won't sum up the movie because I hate *spoilers*, but I will point out a few of my reactions:<br/><br/>1.) Most importantly, the movie deviates so much from the concept and spirit of the original that it almost seems inappropriate to call it a remake...and I don't know if that's a bad thing (how many really great remakes are there?). There are definitely some winks and nods toward the original Dawn (and at least one to Night), but they almost seem to detract from the new storyline -- which brings me to...<br/><br/>2.) The story/script are really the weak link here.  The story seems really underdeveloped (there is no real concept of how much time is passing for instance). It feels as if the writer was trying to go someplace new but was afraid of straying too far from the original --and the plot suffers as a result.  Romero's screenplay was so unique yet so dated, and I feel that a better writer could have told a fresh and contemporary story while utilizing the strengths of the original.<br/><br/>3.) Although I think this was a much stronger movie, I will admit that it resembles 28 Days Later a little too much.  The zombies are fast...I mean really freakin' fast. Many scenes are shot with that same digital high shutter speed look that's so popular with the kids nowadays (think CSI Miami). ""Zombism"" is even a blood-borne pathogen in the new Dawn (which really p***ed me off about 28 Days -- why don't we just call it AIDS? Everybody's afraid of that, right?).  Come on folks, does anyone even remember originality?<br/><br/>All in all, despite its frailties, Dawn of the Dead '04 was one hell of a flick, and I'll probably see it again.  But I challenge you, hot young filmmakers of tomorrow: Come up with a totally new and innovative movie about zombies! One with the intelligence of 28 Days and the spirit of Night of the Living Dead, but one that is completely different. I've waited a long time for a movie like that...one to make old George proud. I thought for a fleeting moment that this remake might be it. It wasn't -- but it came closer than any movie in recent memory."

","Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a terrific, surprising, and truly horrifying horror film. It digs deep down into our minds to find true fear in all of us, and sparks a nerve in our head to go along with it. It's a terrific film because:<br/><br/>
  1) The zombies can run and jump and are therefore ten times scarier than the ones in the original. It's better and scarier this way.<br/><br/>  2) The outbreak and scary stuff happen right in the beginning of the movie and therefore is an edge of your seat thrill ride all the way through.<br/><br/>  3) You actually care for the characters, well, the humans at least.<br/><br/>   4) The sets, make up effects, and gore effects are outstanding.<br/><br/>  I can go on forever listing why this film rules, but this review would take 3 days to read. What I can write is, this film is just as good (if not better) than the original, and is a new horror classic. Props to director Zack Snyder for giving us such a treat to sit through. I loved it! To all horror fans, GO SEE DAWN OF THE DEAD!"

","Dawn Of The Dead is the best zombie movie ever. Forget 28 days later, Resident Evil and the original Dawn Of The Dead this film tops them all. The plot is somewhat similar to the original but it adds many new elements which the original lacked. There are more characters and most of which are very well developed that you grow to like them or hate them. The story is presence and clear, This movie is also extremely fast paced. From start to finish not a boring second exists. The action is raw and excellent, the gore effects are outstanding and realisitc and there are plenty of clever wise cracks and non-cliche' dialogue that mixes in very well. Hopefully their will be a Unrated version in time. Even if you are against remakes of classic films don't be discouraged this film will stand strong for a long long time. Also be on the look out for some characters from the original in cameo roles. <br/><br/>10 out 10"

","I went to both _Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_ and _Dawn of the Dead_ yesterday, and while I was expecting the former to be a great movie, I really didn't know what to expect from the latter. Surprisingly, of the two, the one that sticks in my mind is _Dawn of the Dead_. As others have noted, this really is a superior remake, in many ways better than the original--better acting, better effects, etc. Now I know the original is a classic, but this remake was just outright horrifying from beginning to end. It is doom-laden and edge-of-your-seat scary. I haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long, long time and when it was done, I wanted to see it again right away. Sarah Polley and Jake Webber are great and Ving Rhames lends able support. Mekhi Phifer is good as the young father slowly losing his mind in the aftermath of the breakdown of society. The movie is gruesome and very convincing in depicting an absolute breakdown--the first 30 minutes or so are just unrelenting in setting the scene and getting the audience in the mood--cars run over pedestrians, houses are on fire, you can't really tell who's friendly or who's a foe. I'll admit I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie, but it was just out and out fantastic! Highly recommended, if you've got the stomach for it."

","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD* I just got home from seeing this movie on a day off school, and I was impressed.  This was one of the best remakes that I have ever seen. This movie had you on the edge of your seat even before the opening credits, and it never let you calm down.  It was much more tightly done than the original, as the 97 minute running time was considerably less than the up to two and a half hour original, depending on what version you see. The one change was that there was less munching of people and more graphic gunshots shown, especially the death of gun shop owner Andy.  There was even some celebrity cameos of sorts, as someone shot ""Jay Leno"" and ""Burt Reynolds"" in the head. Overall, a great movie worth seeing multiple times. P.S. Can't wait for the special edition DVD of this movie."

","While it has some new blood pumped into it, some things suffered from unintended anemia. The first 7 minutes gave it a great sense of urgency, it covered the outside world quite well and it seemed to be a hint of things to come. But once they were intrenched at the mall, there never seemed to be a real threat nor a sense of dread. Too many characters suddenly possessed a GI Joe personality rather than a true fear of what was happening around them, so it seemed fine just to hang out at the mall. Even the older woman seemed like she could take on anything so why not just sit tight and slowly pick them off. The zombies rarely were given a role to play so the eeriness and morbidity of the original was erased. The effects were quite beautiful but I didn't feel frightened of the what was out there. If the zombies periodically made their way in, it would have been more unsettling. Beside this remake being the most ""ungory"" of gore films, it all had the feeling of being done before especially with obvious references to earlier horror films like Aliens, Dawn Of The Dead, Body Snatchers and even Rosemary's Baby. Who didn't see that coming? This is from someone who is scared of his own reflection: I never flinched. The trailers and credits were more frightening. A pretty show, with some striking images but kinda flat at the same time, not to mention another 1 note performance by Ving. I will hope for better in the DVD release which will obviously have more ghastly footage. Oh, well."

","I have to start by saying that I love the original DOTD. Romero truly created a masterpiece filled with tension, lonliness, and direct commentary on the mindless nature of man and consumerism.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this remake really doesn't capture many of the same qualities which made Romero's classic so loved, but that's not to say that this new iteration is in any way terrible. The movie is actually quite good. I really dug into it and was at the edge of my seat for much of the nail-biting chase sequences. It's just fun, and a truly visceral experience from opening shot to fade out. If you keep that in mind and don't take the genre where exploding eyeballs have become the norm too seriously, then by all means check it out. It's not perfect, but far from terrible."

","Being a huge fan of the original, I went to see this opening night with a bunch of friends. Naturally, I was going to be very critical, but was actually very pleasantly surprised. Sure, it sacrificed the satire and character development of the original for more action and more (realistic) gore, but that was nothing unexpected. All I was hoping for was a good zombie movie using a similar premise as the<br/><br/>original. And that's exactly what I got, and maybe even a little more too.<br/><br/>A lot of people will probably say that this movie will turn newcomers off from seeing the original, but I disagree. After we left the theatre, all my friends wanted to see the original movie as soon as possible. One even went as far as to buy it. So I guess at its worst, this movie is just a big advertisement for George A. Romero's classic cult film.<br/><br/>On another note, I actually don't live too far away from Thornhill Mall, where the movie was shot. I wonder if they have a movie theatre there...I think I'll go see it again."

","Summary: Dead humans are returning in the form of zombies that attack and kill living people. A group of survivors hole up in a shopping mall while deciding how best to survive. Simple story, simple fun.<br/><br/>The movies overall plot is very simplistic, but the individual events and subplots that make up the movie are very well written and well done. Almost all of the characters are written and acted like real people that one can associate with. The special effects range from needfully simple to well done on a large scale.<br/><br/>The fact that there is virtually no background to *how* the zombies came to be actually adds to the movie. It adds the element of the unknown and reduces nitpicks on *how* the zombies should be acting/behaving (unlike Resident Evil that explained almost precisely *how* the zombies came to be, opening a whole can of nitpicks).<br/><br/>Rating: Good story events, good characters, good effects, good time by all. I give this movie a 8.5 out of 10."

","I've soured on horror films lately - aren't they just the most repulsive things ever? - and yet ""Dawn of the Dead"" won me over simply by being, well...exciting!  Most of the gore is confined to the first few minutes (the worst of it, anyway), and the rest of the film relies more on tension than violence.  So there's not too many long, lingering shots of people being eaten alive - thank goodness.<br/><br/>Of course it's no masterpiece, but then again neither was the original (I don't think that a few comparisons between zombies and mall shoppers makes for an insightful social commentary!).  The main thing is that it's a bloody good siege story, and the characters - though thinly developed - are likable enough that you want them to survive.   I figured that Rhames and Polley would be good, but the surprise show-stealer here is Jake Weber's Michael, who distinguishes himself from the crowd by not shouting all the time. <br/><br/>
Huge gun battles, a pair of cool armored buses, and loads of tragic deaths keep the film rockin' on until the surprise climax, which is a bit too snide for me, but nonetheless effective.  I'm not sure I like the running zombies; they're very ""28 Days Later"" and very human-like in their movements, whereas the original lurching brand of zombie seemed more alien and therefore more frightening.  Still, faster zombies means extra action and a greater chance that the heroes will be caught, so there's both pluses and minuses to the new approach."

","I saw the original movie, and I must say this was a great remake.  I prefer the frantic, ""light on their feet"" zombies as opposed to the sluggish, slow moving ones in the original (thank you ""28 Days Later"").  The old zombies were not that scary; I mean, you could probably skip away from those guys! Or just break into a ""brisk walk"" and you'd leave them in the dust.  Not these new ones though; they full-on sprint right at you!  I dig it. Furthermore, the violence and gore in this movie was very well done.  In a movie like this, that can make or break you.  Also, it's nice to see a movie that has some CGI, but doesn't rely too heavily on it.  Bravo Mr. Snyder! I'm excited about your next project!"

","In this remake, a nurse wakes up one morning to find her once peaceful town in complete anarchy and overrun by people who've inexplicably transformed into bloodthirsty zombies. Soon she and a group of survivors, including a hardened police officer, a young man and his pregnant wife, and a callous security guard, must band together inside the town mall to try and survive. Pretty good for a remake, but the film has its ups and downs; fans of blood and gore will certainly get their money's worth, and the script certainly has a warped since of humor, but the story and characters are never fully fleshed out, and the dialogue is often clunky.

","What a ferocious horror movie! This is a remake basically in name only (with a few of the original concepts tossed in); Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a straightforward survival horror adventure - and a brutally intense one at that (not since the first Jurassic Park have I found myself trying to slip down into my seat and shield myself from what was going on up on the screen). To be perfectly honest, I was not 100% pleased - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD! - that the zombies were able to run and be so violent and I was not 100% pleased that it was a virus, rather than radiation, which caused the zombie plague (making it almost more of a homage to 28 Days Later than the original Dawn of the Dead), but these are quibbling matters. This was a superb horror movie and will probably do so well we will be seeing another spate of remakes on the way."

","Take a song and remake it, but don't just follow the original note for note. Make it your own.  I think this new version of DotD has succeeded in doing just that, and what a lovely song it is.  The zombie genre is my absolute favorite type of horror movie and I'm a big fan of the original trilogy (especially #1 - the best horror movie ever made, imo).  I don't think this remake is a disappointment at all.  It's excellent!!<br/><br/>I've read comments about the movie's lack of plot.  I think the plot is very clear, actually.  The dead are coming to eat us!!!  What more does one need? Seriously - if I may be so whilst discussing a zombie horror movie - I think DotD told it's story quite well.  There are unanswered questions because that's the way it's supposed to be.  We don't know how this plague of zombies came to be and we never will.  What we are left with is the affect on the living and how the living copes with their predicament.  Not everything in life - or unlife as it were - is clear cut.  It can be unsatisfying and unsettling and that's just that.  No happy ending, no ending period.  Just trying to make it because that's what we do.  The living are running on instinct just as much as the undead here.<br/><br/>I found the soundtrack to be very clever and integral.  Really brilliant song choices.  For example, I laughed with glee when I heard the Muzak strains of ""Don't Worry Be Happy"".  Then in the next moment appreciated the irony.  I don't imagine much joy under the circumstances.  The music conjured up such contradiction throughout the movie, and/or in some cases took on a whole new meaning, and really lent itself to the overall mood.<br/><br/>Just sit right back...and enjoy and scream and laugh!!!  Suspend belief (it's make-believe, after all....but I STILL think it really could happen!! *snarf*)  Good characters, good acting, great special effects.  It's also chock full of symbolism if one chooses to zero in on it.  I don't worry that this isn't a faithful remake and I didn't want it to be.  I'll watch the original when I want to see the original.  I think this one stands on its own."

","To horror fans I would definately recommend checking this out. Is it better, or even as good as Romero's original Dawn of the Dead, or its predecessor and sequel? HELL NO. Have I seen better re-makes? Yeees, 'Night of the Living Dead' (1990) comes to mind...Is it a great movie? Gee, ""great"" is kind of a strong word...Is it entertaining? Yes. Despite its many faults, main one being that it associated itself with Romero's original in the first place, this is a very entertaining movie. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS* Most horror fans were warned going in that, aside from the location, the film's connections to the original 'Dawn' would be minimal. The main difference between this film and Romero's Dawn of the Dead, is this film chooses that edge-of-your-seat type scare (hence, the running zombies) where a zombie's mouth snaps shut just inches away from someone's hand or foot every couple of minutes, where as Romero chose the more thoughtful, subtler and creepier approach. Personally, I like it creepy, but that doesn't mean I can't also have fun with a slightly cheaper kind of scare. It never really presents itself as a satire, like the beloved ""Return of the Living Dead"", in fact, most of the laughs you'll have probably were NOT intentional, such as the girl risking life and limb to rescue a dog (a touching gesture, granted) despite the fact that the dog was never in any real danger (in this film, zombies don't eat animals for some reason), AND despite the fact that she doesn't really seem THAT upset that her father turned into a zombie and had his head blown off only a couple of days earlier. Maybe she bonded with the dog to fill the void of her father's absence, or maybe she was just slightly retarded, I dunno, but the writer and director could have MAYBE fleshed this out a bit more. Little things like that are pretty much what lower this flick to b-grade status. It's not hilariously bad, like the Z-grade 'House of the Dead', and not unwatchably bad like ""Children of the Dead"", but I don't see it getting any 'Horror Hall of Fame' awards any time soon, then again, you never know with Fangoria.... The opening of the film is ALMOST a thing of beauty. The way Snyder filmed the suburbs being torn apart was ALMOST on par with something Romero might have done. It really works well. After that, the movie falls victim to fast pacing. Important characters are often pushed to the side, and some scenes don't really get built up like they should, but hey, you wanna make an omlet, you gotta break a few eggs. Such is the plight of the hour-and-forty-minute standard running length. It's a shame too, because it really is a pretty good cast. Ving Rhames stands out with the best, and most consistent character, followed by Ty Burrell as the despicable Steve. Sarah Polley, Jake Webber, Michael Kelly, Mekhi Pfeifer, and Inna Korobkina are all good in what were clearly intended to be larger roles, but their characters all suffer an unfortunate lack of screen time. I'm guessing a few scenes were cut in order to focus more on the action. Next time they decide to remake an older zombie film and still have running zombies and a fast pace, might I recommend the Itallian flick 'Nightmare City' instead of Romero's masterpiece, 'Day of the Dead'? The change will be far less drastic. The end of the film (intermixed within the end credits) is also really entertaining. James Gunn apparently saw Fulci's 'Zombie' as well. Not a bad film, all-in-all, and I'm glad that if any movie could finally knock 'Passion of the Christ' to the number 2 spot, it was this one."

","ok i seriously love this movie ive seen it 4 times and i am going to see it again.  I am a huge fan of the horror genre and my type of horror movies are wait for it wait for it   THE ZOMBIE SUBGENRE.  Now im going to compare this dawn of the dead to the other dawn of the dead.  Yes I did mean other dawn of the dead bc lets be honest thats all it really is now.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD AND SPOILERS FOR THE OTHER DAWN OF THE DEAD.<br/><br/>Yes the other dawn of the dead did have the satiric aspect that addressed abortion, racism, consumers, and politics/science; it just failed to put them in a context that made sense.  The whole fran is havin a baby ok so why dont we abort it lasted 2 mins and didnt have any effect on the rest of the original.  The new dawn of the dead does have a political/social aspect to it but it doesnt throw it out like a bat out of hell as the other DOTD did.<br/><br/>
In this movie it is obvious the apocalypse is here and the human race just dropped a few notches on the food chain.  The zombies are vicious, quick, and just want to eat humans, and the zombies have only been around a day since it all started,unlike the original where the zombies have been around for three weeks and society is screwed up but no destroyed.<br/><br/>
The original dawn of the dead zombies  couldnt believably or possibly have taken over the world or at least we arent shown anything that would make them seem capable or extremely dangerous. Please note the original zombies walked slow,  they didnt run like savage beasts for their prey.  Remember (in the original dawn of the dead) how the rednecks and the military are just have a fun-fest drinkin coffee, shootin zombies, laughin and tellin jokes.  Lets not also forget the biker scene where the bikers are just throwin pies right in the zombies faces just messin around with the zombies and the only time a few bikers get eatin is when they are caught in moments of serious stupidity.<br/><br/>This next part is not as much comparison as it is showing a difference between the two dawn of the dead movies<br/><br/>In the 1978 dawn the movie was focused on a group of 4 friends who decide to land their helicopter at a mall for the time being.  The new dawn focuses on a group of 5 people who are forced to run and find refugee in a nearby mall to get away from the hordes of zombies.  The characters who enter the mall meet up with 3 security guards and later take in about 6 other survivors. Ok the new dawn didnt want to focus on a small group of friends instead it wants to show a small amount of people strive to make a new society in a mall bc the only other place for refuge is a small island.  Both dawns involve an island but the new movie actually involves the island a little more.  Back to the characters.  The new dawn has characters that fill parts of an every day society just compacted into a few people.<br/><br/>I could go into a lot more but i have said enough so in short the new dawn of the dead not only surpasses the 1978 dawn of the dead, it is possibly the best movie ever and is the favorite in my book<br/><br/>10/10"

","Okay, if you can go into this movie with an open mind, and a dark sense of humor, you will not only love this movie, but you will laugh your a** off. I thought it was great, the humor was so clever, the music was wonderfully chosen, and every line that Ving Rahmes said was terribly bad ass. The script seemed to be poking fun at itself at times, as this was very well written. Not that the dialog will win an Oscar, but it certainly made me laugh.  The entire theater I was in was in hysterics several times. There was also some interesting social commentary, but I believe thats all up to the viewer to decide weather or not they want to look for that. The music in this movie was sweet, as it opens with Johny Cashs' ""The Man Comes Around."" Also through out this film we are treated to Lounge Against the Machine versions of several great songs, which just add to the humor.<br/><br/>
I think this film is all about having a good time in a theater, while watching very cool special effects, and getting ""blown away"" (sorry) by all the onscreen confrontation. Very fun, and great for the entire Adams Family.<br/><br/>

","Although I believe there were definitely enough laughs in this one to justify the price of admission, it is quite obvious that it won't ever become the classic the original is. The original featured a great plot, great characters and actors who played them, portrayed social commentary on humans and humanity in desperate situations and a zombie whose head gets sliced up by a helicopter blade. This version has absolutely none of that and that's a disappointment right off the bat. It seems Universal just wanted a more politically correct cast and characters with less shock value than the original. The cinematography was a bit irritating too. Fast camera swings, vague images of zombies really detracted from it. On the other hand this version, unlike the original, had one character providing comic relief which was quite good and provided much needed laughs we all came to expect from these ""Dead"" movies originally done by George Romero. All in all, the original version was a very well made movie that was not in best taste for most audiences so it developed a hardcore cult following. This version seems to be geared at selling tickets to the 18 - 22 crowd and, therefore, lacks depth.  The ending was a bit strange too. Worth seeing once if you're a fan of the original trilogy.  It will be interesting to see how it resonates with the new audience it was designed for."

For 2004's 'Dawn', I decided to sit in a theater full of noisy teens again on a Saturday night, just for the nostalgia. The original was funnier, and easier to make fun of the zombies and the situation.  The new 'Dawn' is darker, scarier, and only has a few scenes of intentional comedy. I really liked the film, and kudos to the director, who pays homage to the original while creating his own style. The young folks reading this won't realize how many people from the original appear in this version.  I had to double-check the credits, and thanks to imdb for letting me cross-reference! This feels weird to write this, but I expected more on-screen flesh-eating!  The 1978 film was MORE graphic in this regard, much to my surprise. Because the tension was so high, the directing so stylistic and fast, and because the zombies move at proper human speed, I had nightmares last night, so I had to write this! I was shocked to see Entertainment Weekly give this an 'A'.

","I'll keep it short since I haven't seen the original and most people seem to have made up their minds about whether or not to see it. This is a vicious movie. It's not necessarily the most violent ever, but it's certainly vicious. It has an intensity lacking from many modern horror films, especially from the zombie ones. The idea of swift zombies rather than the lurching ones is not new, 28 Days Later had it and as a result many comparisons have been drawn between the two movies, but I don't think it's fair. 28 Days Later was more about the human condition(I personally forgot about the zombie menace in the second half in light of the human nature aspect) while this one focuses on the zombies and their effect on people. This generates some truly genuinely moving scenes, mostly revolving around Mekhi Pfeifer's(I have no clue if that was spelled right) character and the character of a gun salesman trapped on his shop's roof. This movie is truly powerful in some parts. I thoroughly enjoyed it overall."

","Dawn of the Dead (2004) Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Ty Burrell, Michael Kelly, Kim Poirier, Kevin Zegers, D: Zack Snyder. Not-bad remake of the 1978 horror film, under the same name, wastes no time putting a young nurse (Polley) in danger after her boyfriend is bitten by one of the undead. Then she comes across a police officer (Rhames) and other survivors, and together they blockade their Milwaukee town's shopping mall from the zombies-who this time move a lot more quickly rather than staggering along. One bite and it's only a matter of seconds until they resurrect as a ghoul. Not much plot here as you would expect, but it's slick, fast-paced, superior acted, and efficiently packaged with wisecracks, gruesome blood and gore, and effective scares. Running Time: 100 minutes and rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language, and sexuality. ***"

","Just been to see a preview showing of the Dawn of the Dead 2004. First I should state that I love Romero's original trilogy although Day was my favourite. If nothing else I hope that as many people will go and see this so that George can get the funding for Dead Reckoning / Twilight / Land of the Dead (whatever it's going to be called).<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>So onto the film, nice to see cameos by Tom ""shoot them in the head"" Savini and Ken ""when hell is full"" Foree. At the start a good future portent, Ana, a nurse is discussing a patient who was bitten in a bar brawl but is now in intensive care ""from a bite!"" We see Middle American Suburban perfection but in the morning of the next day things change. To cut a long story short Ana's neighbourhood has become infected and people have become super charged zombies. The little girl next door bites Ana's husband and he try's to bite her, it's all done in the goriest possible taste. Ana escapes and meets up with others who are alive (including Andre and his pregnant wife Luda we'll come to them later). They all go to a mall and have a run in with a couple of zombies who are quickly dispatched. Then they meet the mall security guards and an uneasy alliance develops. Several more survivors join however a couple of them have been infected, become zombies and are killed. Some novel ideas, a dog appears and is used to get food to another survivor, Andy, in a building near by, seems zombies don't frequent Korean restaurants. Luda, the pregnant woman was infected after a bite and hidden from the rest of the group by Andre, becomes zombified, but the coolest part is the baby, she gives birth to a zombie! The group decide to leave the mall and head to a marina get a boat and sail off to somewhere less inhabited. In best A-Team style they beef up a couple mini buses and head out. Lots of zombies (I mean lots) get squashed, shot, chainsawed and blown up. One bus crashes and only a handful make it to the boat. Happy ending, well if you stay for the credits NO!<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the film, quick zombies work for me, could have done with more gore but the deaths were good especially Andy's, nice to see an unhappy ending as well. Definitely a re-viewing on the cards.<br/><br/>Someone please give George some money instead of making zombie films based on video games they suck!!!"

","Let's face it - the whole ""undead"" plotline has been done and then done again, from movies like Army of Darkness to Resident Evil and all the ones in between, there have been the good, the bad, and the ugly.<br/><br/>The 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead definitely qualifies as one of the good ones. The basic storyline is one that is done in all horror movies: survival. Incorrectly labeled as a ""plague"" by some of the previous comments, this zombie hysteria is one that spreads from bite to bite. A small band of survivors manage to make it to a shopping mall where they hide out and figure out what to do and how to survive. Right from the beginning, the movie doesnt waste time setting up character roles as it does this during the different situations that they must face.<br/><br/>With unwaivering amounts of zombies, tension filled scenes and comedic relief, this film definitely was something that is worth your time. If you're a survival horror fan, don't miss out on this above-average film."

","An interesting adaptation of a classic horror film.  Although with a cast like Sarah Polley, Ving Rhaimes, Mehki Phifer, and a few very well known character actors, there could have been a lot more done with the scripting. The ending left a little to be desired.  But there is lots of gore and violence here, and if that's what you like you won't be disappointed.  Not as engaging as 28 Days, but with similar surprises.  What if you woke up tomorrow and found all your neighbors and family running around the neighborhood like brain-hungry ghouls?  Well, ok, if you live in ny like I do that might not be uncommon, but if you live in middle America you might find it a little unsettling.  6 stars out of 10."

","Like many, I found myself anxious about the news that Dawn was being remade. I wasn't particularly worried about the choice of director or screenwriter (like some outspoken folks).  I was more concerned with the ""uber-stupid-teenification"" that seems to haunt most of the decent ideas that surface in cinema nowadays - particularly in horror films.<br/><br/>That said, there were a couple instances in the new Dawn that I could've lived without.  But they were easily forgotten amidst the ruthless spectacle of these very determined survivors in a shopping mall.<br/><br/>Romero fans and newcomers alike should be pleased.  The violence is huge, but the gore wasn't over the top as I had expected it would be.  It was simply very well done.<br/><br/>And for all of you people who are upset over the running zombies, just get over it already.  I'm a big fan of the original movies.  But the bottom line is this:  lumbering, staggering, slow-moving zombies just aren't scary anymore folks.  They scare your grandma, but not us anymore.  It's been almost 30 years.  We have to be ... ""re-shocked"" into believing in the bleak, almost unbearable truth that anyone alive during the Dawn of the Dead apocalypse...is in deep doodoo.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the genre, I give it 10 outta 10.  Hopefully we'll see more of it soon."

","I just got back, and I'd like to share one bit of information before I elaborate.<br/><br/>Horror movies don't scare me. I nearly peed myself.<br/><br/>Now, as I was saying, this is nothing like the original version. More or less, this movie feels like it's done by the people who made 28 Days Later, and the artists for Resident Evil. I've seen the same type of zombies in Resident Evil, hell, in the instruction booklet.<br/><br/>What this movie adds to the table that 28 Days Later didn't is fairly obvious; It shows you an undead creature that can run like William Perry with a rocket on his back; This means fast, and hard hitting.<br/><br/>It's a growing trend that we see fast zombies, and I can understand this, as the creatures need to evolve; to become scarier. But while it will be hard for some of us, who still remember the slow zombie, newer audiences will eat it up. Isn't it odd, knowing that one day zombies will be thought of as fast?<br/><br/>BACK TO THE MOVIE...<br/><br/>This movie really had to do something special to rise above 28 Days Later, so as to not be a clone, and it succeeded here. It's not Dawn of the Dead (78) and it's not Resident Evil. It's its own movie, and it shows as a hard working, scare a minute thrill.<br/><br/>Action and Horror: Two genres, always so close, yet never meshing perfectly. What DOTD has here is the end of conventional horror; The Age of Slashers is at its end. Now, Horror movies will be faster, scarier (hopefully), and maybe even less gory. DOTD took a huge step back from the original, not a head twisted off in sight.<br/><br/>So, while this was definantly the best horror movie made since Nightmare on Elm Street, it also kills off the slasher genre. Unless, of course, they evolve too, which Freddy vs. Jason showed signs of.<br/><br/>Time's running out. The Slasher genre has to save itself.<br/><br/>By the way...<br/><br/>10/10 Horror. Perfectly made, but uncomparable to the original. Watch for future movies to copy this flick."
"doodah367","5","0","0","19 March 2004"," Hit and miss affair really
","The first ten minutes of this film promise so much more than it actually delivers.  Barely bothering to set up a static normal life premise, the film kicks right in with a loud and larger than life action opening - underlined by the late use of credits.  If the film had followed through on this premise, it would have delivered a ninety minute, unpretentious horror shlock, one that would have done Romero much more justice than what is actually produced.<br/><br/>However, it is overly ambitious for a film that has to overcome so many initial obstacles (i.e. 1) its a horror film - often looked down on by serious cinemagoers and 2) its a remake of a horror film - surely representative of a lack of new ideas?).  Sometimes it appears to be encroaching a critique of contemporary society, and at other times it seems to be commenting on the last thirty years of horror films (without paying too close attention to detail, I picked up on nods to The Exorcist, It's Alive! and the Blair Witch Project).  All of these potentially subversive topics are all undermined by a seemingly ridiculous bit of pointless nationalism as the remaining protagonists sail off into the sunset, framed with the stars and stripes.<br/><br/>However, the film isn't without its interesting experiments - self-reflexively juxtaposing different film making styles by switching between a standard Hollywood feel and digital video (in the same vein as Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later).  This pioneering is interesting, yet mildly shoddy - a more skilled director would have pulled it off seamlessly, whilst Dawn of the Dead wears its scars on its arm.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt that a straight forward horror flick would have been better in these circumstances - and let any other motives be expressed unconsciously, a technique that Romero mastered in.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I just got back from watching this remake of the George Romero zombie classic and I am happy to report that it does justice to its predecessor. I was little wary that the zombies run in this version, but it really works because you can't simply walk past these bad boys and shove cream pies in their rotting faces. This version probably owes as much to 28 Days Later as it does to Romero's film. The movie kicks into gear in a matter of a few minutes and scarcely takes it foot off the throttle. The acting, by and large, is very good and the effects are terrific. I hope it makes mucho bucks and inspires a rebirth in the zombie genre, perhaps even Romero can get back into the action."

Of course liberties were taken but nothing that took away from the story or turned it into a mind numbing experience.<br/><br/>   Pace : This version moved much more smoothly and in my opinion had no moments of dullness. The beginning sequence of the movie made me feel that if something like this happened, this would be how the world would react.<br/><br/>   F/X : I was very impressed with the gore in this film. Yes, they had the token shots of zombies getting shot in the head and blood spewing in all directions. I also enjoyed that the zombies were the fast paced, rage looking zombies like in 28 DAYS LATER. I am sure this will end up being one of the largest arguments with this film. Fast moving zombies to me seem more scary and not easy to deal with. If it ever happens I can pray for the slow moving ones!<br/><br/>   Cast/Characters : I liked the set up with the cast, a nice variety - the nice folks, the annoying ones, the ones you wish would get eaten by a zombie. Thumbs up for the casting crew on this one.<br/><br/>   Jekyll's Final Thoughts : I had fun, I enjoyed the movie....I even sat through the very end of the credits!

","POSSIBLE SPOILER<br/><br/>This film will undoubtedly be judged against the classic 1979 George Romero original.  This is a bit unfair as they are both quite distinctive films. The basic plot is the same with human survivors of a world plagued by flesh eating, walking dead, holing themselves up inside a shopping mall.<br/><br/>The special effects have certainly improved in this one, and the all-important gore is present and plentiful.  This film is very stylishly made and quite impressive to look at.  The battle scenes with the zombies are well-done with an interesting gritty, jerky look.<br/><br/>The main problems are the character development is pretty weak, and sometimes feels just thrust in for the sake of it, rather than to flesh out the story.  There are many characters which do really stupid things here for inexplicable reasons.  Also it lacks the social subtext that Romero included in the original.<br/><br/>By the way, do not leave when the end credits start rolling, or you will miss some pretty good scenes."

","I haven't been transgressive in a while, so today I took an extra long lunch and went to see Dawn of the Dead. And now, rather than return to work, I'm going to write a review of it. It's Friday, don'cha know.<br/><br/>This movie is good. Is it as good as the original? Not by a long shot. The original is one of those horror movies that was seminal in opening up the genre and making people take it seriously, because it took time to create atmosphere, create characters and a character dynamic, and create a situation that raised all three to something more than the sum of their parts. This new film is just about getting you the thrills and getting them NOW. Nothing wrong with that, it's just a different movie. This one is a good thriller, but it won't stay in your mind like the first one does.<br/><br/>To me the opening scene of the original is VERY unsettling¬Ö there's something that just says 'the world is coming apart' about a newscast, normally so controlled and scripted, devolving into chaos. The opening of this film is cool, but from the start the focus is on one woman, not starting with a wider society, THEN focusing on individuals. They get to the mall a LOT sooner than in the original, and there are almost no zombies in the mall. Once they get to the mall, this film follows its own course, with only minor ideas transposed from the original. The consumerist critique the first film had is alluded to here¬Ö but over the intervening years the public HAS become so consumerist and genuinely excited by gadgets that I don't think the threat of that carries much weight with anyone. The irony here--not exploited as it could have been--is that many people WILL walk out of this movie into a shopping mall. But there are many missed opportunities.<br/><br/>The original had a great dynamic between the few survivors¬Ö I especially admired the genius of including a nerdy guy who wanted to be cool and shoot guns like the others, and the hotshot who wants to take flashy risks, seemingly unable to comprehend the seriousness of the situation. Come to think of it, THAT'S the difference between these versions¬Ö in Romero's, the characters have psychology (and psychosis) that matches what you think would happen in the case of a worldwide disaster like this (and also in the sequel 'Day of the Dead'). Here, Sarah Polley's character watches her husband be killed by a neighborhood girl she was friends with the day before, and she just has ONE 15-second crying jag thrown in like a cheap bone. The rest of the characters all seem to adjust fairly well, or have their one defining character trait happening in the background¬Ö but this movie is ABOUT exploding heads, so¬Ö. The difference here is between movie conventions now vs. then, but also between Romero's MIND and Zack whoever's mind.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer my zombies slow. Slow zombies bring a sense of mounting dread and horror, heightened by the sense that they're so slow and dumb that they aren't really a problem¬Ö until they gradually surround you. Here they're fast, which means all that dread is gone in exchange for them being able to jump out at you¬Ö like--yawn--any other movie threat. This movie does suffer badly for following so closely on the giant boring turd that was '28 Days Later,' as the running zombie scenes are already pretty generic. But I guess modern audiences don't have the patience for any kind of effect that can't be communicated in under 3 seconds. In the original, I remember the way my stomach dropped when one of the zombies grabs the shotgun from a living character, and again when the zombies, safely on the first floor because they can't figure out stairs, get shuttled upstairs when the heroes turn the escalator on. No moments like that here, but the zombies do jump out a lot, and a lot more, and a lot more.<br/><br/>Let me take time out to say that Ving Rhames is HOT STUFF. But Ving Rhames in a cop uniform and aviator glasses with a cigar hanging out of his mouth is just off the chart. He could just BURN through the zombies. Then CJ, the redneck security guard is nice to look at too¬Ö all in all, a surprising amount of eye candy for those 3-7 individuals left who prefer their men to still somewhat resemble MEN. This movie goes out of it's way to make the character most audience members will consider gay to be a spineless, selfish, snotty piece of garbage, but a short piece of video added during the credits identifies him as straight. He's--oh yes--a METROSEXUAL! This feels like a cop-out to me, but I guess we've come a long way that at least the filmmakers feel guilty for making the gay one the evil one.<br/><br/>I know I've done a lot of complaining, but this movie is a good basic thriller that'll give you a rollicking time at the movies. But once you leave, it's over. They just re-released the original on DVD, and I'm going to buy that and watch it for the fourth time, then watch it again with the commentary. This one I don't ever need to see again, and I don't care what the filmmaker has to say. So I guess that's my final assessment.<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

Even though I saw the original several times in the theater when it first came out, I was able to enjoy this one a lot also. No, this is not a remake as in ""true to the original"". It is an update of that concept, with some welcome homages to the original thrown in (Gaylen Ross Fashions? Cool!). I've already heard a lot of criticism out here, but really, I think people need to refresh their perspective, put their pre-conceived notions to the side and enjoy it for what it is: a truly original concept that was created in 1978, updated here to tell the story of another group of people fighting their way through this incredibly impossible situation. Didn't you wonder, watching the original over the years, about other people and their stories of trying to survive the situation? I know I did. And after all, if Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger (not to mention the great one, Tom Savini) lent their endorsement to this project by being in it, why knock it? Relax and enjoy!

The CGI is a bit ropey and the story moves far too rapidly, the controversial decision to make the zombies fast and athletic works better than in '28 Days Later' but there was not enough gore for me, the cannibalistic element was not played up like in the original.  A great effort though, I hope the same director makes a sequel to the film. Zombie's rule and with intelligent scripts and cool action sequences, they could have a whole new era of zombie movies."

","I love George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. <br/><br/>Let's just get that straight right off the bat. And - I saw it in a real live movie theatre way back in 1981 (at a midnight double bill with ""Assault on Precinct 13!). <br/><br/>When I first heard about this remake (or ""re-imagining""), I (like many of you reading this) was SO incredibly offended that someone would attempt to mess with perfection. After all - Dawn of the Dead IS one of the greatest horror films ever made (hell - even the critics loved it!).<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, the screenwriter of ""Scooby Doo"" was hired to write the screenplay (sure he got his start with Troma, but is that REALLY anything to brag about??), and a first-time ""music-video"" director was in charge (oh, goody).<br/><br/>Well, I just got home from the premiere, and let me tell you - just like Marcus Nispel's incredible 're-imagining' of TCM last year, the group behind this Dawn redux has crafted an absolutely terrifying, nail-biting gorefest that re-imagines the original, while respecting the source material.<br/><br/>Check your worries at the door and just enjoy it. While it retains the basic premise (people are dying, coming back to life as flesh-eaters, while a few survivors hide out in a mall), this is a completely different animal - similar in name only.<br/><br/>If this film is as big a hit as last year's TCM and Freddy vs Jason, expect a glut of remakes of 70s/80s remakes. If they're all made with as much affection and respect for the genre, then I say bring it on.<br/><br/>This ""remake"" is as much a product of 21st-Century filmmaking trends as the original is a prime example of 1970's filmmaking. In other words - if mtv-style editing and CGI turn you off, you may be unpleasantly shocked by this film. If, however, you go in with an open, horror-fan mind - you'll be giddy with excitement.<br/><br/>After suffering through a few years of studio-sanctioned garbage like 'Valentine' and 'Urban Legends..."", it's nice to see some really brilliant stuff sneak through the cracks...."

","DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) Sarah Polley Ving Rhames Mekhi Phifer Jake Weber Rated R Running Time 100 mins Universal Studios<br/><br/>
I recently watched Dawn of the Dead at the world premiere in Los Angeles California. If you don't already know, Dawn of the Dead is a remake of the 1978 George A. Romero Classic of the same name. Well this dawn is more of a Re-Envisioning, than a remake.<br/><br/>This new Dawn of the Dead is more supercharged than the film that inspired it. Award winning Commercial Director Zach Snyder, making his feature Debut here, brings back the Dead in this update of the Romero Classic. The story is not a shot for shot remake, but rather a totally new story using elements from the Original film. James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Tromeo & Juliet) scripted the new Dawn and has endure some harsh criticism from fans of the original film. This update brings a more fierce zombie to the fold....a Relentless killer if you will. Like Romero's Zombies...the new dawn zombies need to feed on Human Flesh. However the difference between Zombies of the original and the new are the zombies characteristics. Romero's were Slow...Zack's are Fast.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>The New Dawn uses the same elements of the original while telling a different story. We have zombies, Survivor's, & a Mall. The story picks up the day before a large Wisconsin Town gets blasted by the zombie plauge which is sweeping the nation. Our main character is Ana (Sarah Polley) a nurse and loving wife whom we see finishing up her day at work so she can get home to her husband for ""DATE"" night, During Date Night They miss the special news Bulletin on TV explaining how dire the situation is becoming. After a Night of passion with her hubby we find them in bed the next morning. Soon Ana will witness the carnage about to overtake the earth. A neighorhood girl has gotten into the home and attacked Ana's husband as Ana tries to help him she finds out the world is falling apart and when her Husband returns from the dead Ana has to escape. During Ana's Escape we see her neighborhood in ruins, the city she lives in, in total Chaos.<br/><br/>The Film has different characters from diferent social Situations. We have millionaire playboy Steve Markus (TY BURRELL), Stoic police officer Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Street wise Husband and soon to be father Andre (Mekhi Phifer) his wife Luda (Inna Korobkina) Tough as Nails Security guard Cj (Michael Kelley) and Newly Hired Security Guard Terry (Kevin Zegers). Some of the best performances in the film don't come from the Top Billed stars but yet the supporting cast. TY BURRELL's Character Steve markus is a real treat in this film. TY really stole the show. his character is the typical don't lift a finger , but make a comment on everything decision the group makes. You are supposed to hate this guy, but you end up liking him just because of how cynical he is, TY is great addition to the cast.<br/><br/>Michael Kelley who plays CJ, also another great member of the cast, Here is someone your supposed to hate and you do, you really really do. However unlike TY's character Michael comes around towards the end of the film and begins to work with group when it comes time to leave the safe confines of the mall.<br/><br/>Mekhi Phifer, Usually type cast as a street tough thug turns in a great performance as a streetwise husband who is now thinking about Heaven and Hell, and wonders where his place will be at the end of the situation the survivor's are faced with. Mekhi could have really shined...but some poor editing choices more or less neutralized his performance, it didn't hurt it, but it did take way from it.<br/><br/>one of the Performances I was looking forward too was that of VING RHAMES. Ving's character, Kenneth, A police officer who is trying his best to get to the local military base to find his brother was not what I expected. I really enjoy Ving Rhames's work in film...however the feel of someone longing to get to his brother didn't hit me, I didn't feel his pain. It really wasn't a believable performance. Now, Ving's character really shines when introduced to another survivor whom is across the mall parking lot, ANDY, the owner of Andy's gun shop and great marksman finds himself communication back and forth with the mall citizens Via Binoculars and dry erase boards. The exchanges between Andy and Kenneth are some of the best moments in the film. Those scenes really highlight Ving's character.<br/><br/>The Zombies.....Well what can ya say about zombies. One quote would be ""yeah they're dead...they're.... all messed up"". taken from the screenplay of the original Night of the living Dead. These Zombies are not your normal Slow moving dead things. The New Zombies are Supercharged and come off more like the infected from 28 days later. This new breed of zombie is scary, but they don't have their own characteristics...they are just Zombies whom move really fast. I wish the production would have done the zombies more like Dan O'Bannon's Zombies from the original Return of the living Dead, but they chose the 28 days later style and that is ok...The supercharged zombie is the new zombie monster of the new millenium. In this case...i like the original George A. Romero Zombies...Slow movers.<br/><br/>The camera work and story move fast...some of the story gets lost in the process but hey, this isn't Oscar worthy material anyway. This is supposed to be a Fun Horror/Popcorn Movie and it is, lets just see how it holds up against time.<br/><br/>Although Flawed by Poor Editing...The new Dawn of the Dead is Enjoyable on many levels. This Dawn will have a place in Horror film history.<br/><br/>my Grade  B-"
"thanewsource","9","0","0","9 March 2004"," great horror movie that should please die-hard Romero fans and inspire new ones
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS, I DONT THINK THEY ARE BUT SOME OF YOU MIGHT, THEY ARE VERY VAGUE THO........<br/><br/>i saw the movie last night at an advanced screening in manhattan, and all of my expectations were definitely met. i loved it, and every1 in the audience started clapping and cheering when it ended, something i havent seen happen in a long time. (do not leave right when the movie ends, zack snyder and company give us a little bonus footage during the end credits, a pretty creative and cool feature of the movie.) this was easily the most fun i've had watching a movie in a long time (besides Kill Bill). i have been a die-hard fan of the Romero Dead trilogy since i was like 10 years old, and i'm now 22 so thats 12 years of zombie support. like many others, i was a little nervous when i heard about this remake, but rest assured they nailed it and have made a great update that brings the story into 2004, embraces the fast-paced nature of modern horror, but also delivers a mood of nostalgia and uniqueness courtesy to zack snyder's creative directing skills. the only similarities between this and the original is the basic plot: survivors of the zombie plague take refuge in a mall and must learn to adapt within themselves and stay alive. other than that, this version takes the plot in many new directions, all effective and commendable. while there isnt the underlying consumerism theme or as much in-depth character studies as the original, the makers of this version wisely decided to focus more on the survival aspects, leaving the magic of the original alone. there are many likeable characters, especially those played by jake weber, ving rhames and mekhi phifer, all three give great performances and really bring you into their respective worlds of pain. ty burrell and michael kelly are also effective, adding enjoyable moments of comic relief that sparked big laughs from the audience i was with. sarah polley has a nice ""girl-next door"" appeal that makes her character very real. the rest of the characters are a bit thin, and you don't really get to know them much, but i expected this being that there are 15 people hiding in the mall and the film is an hour and 35 minutes. some of the best moments in character study included Kenneth's relationship with Andy in the gun shop across the way, Andre's desire to start a family and give his future child everything he didnt, and the zombie/ celebrity look-a-like shootings. please believe, there are plenty of zombie head gun shots, and the level of blood and gore is rather high for a hollywood movie. not as much flesh-eating as the original, but there are a few key money shots that cannibal hounds will enjoy (including a nice open stomach shot with a zombie feasting on insides). those looking for a lot of zombie action will be extremely happy, and the amount of zombies is crazy. very little CGI effects are used, and when they are, (like an aerial car crash shot and several zombies being ran over by a truck) they are done very well and do not look too fake. this was the most fun i've had at the movies in a long time, and i will definitely support and pay for this movie numerous times when it opens.(another cool thing was that when tom savini, ken foree and scott reiniger made their cool cameos, several people in the audience clapped and applauded, showing that many true Dead fans were in the building.) Zack Snyder has done an exceptional job for his first film, and he shoots each zombie attack very clearly, without the dizzying camera shots or quick editing found in 28 Days Later. he should definitely be commended, and the film makers should too for several small tributes to the original (like Gaylen Ross store and when the character Bart replies to Tom Savini's sheriffs comments by saying ""see, that is a cool guy, he knows what we need to do"" or something along those lines). this is the best horror movie to come out in many years, as it embraces its horror and doesnt insult the audiences intelligence at all. this film has many memorable moments and should stand alone nex to the original proudly, as long as original Dawn fans realize that this is a completely different approach to the story. the zombies found here are pretty scary, armed with great make-up and intense as hell, making for edge-of-your seat action sequences (such as the rescue of Nicole in the gun shop, the the sewer chase and the Arks drive thru the zombie-infested parking lot.) (how CJ makes their commute thru the lot easier is a really cool scene and received applause from the audience.) bottom line is this: zack snyder and universal pictures should be highly applauded for what they have done here, making an amazing zombie movie for 2004 that should go down as a zombie classic. old-school zombie fans should be very pleased, and new-school moviegoers should gain a nice liking for true zombie horror. make sure every1 runs to the theatre on march 19 and sees this movie, i promise you wont be disappointed at all. job very well done."

It was so awful that people were getting out of the cinema in the middle of the movie!!! 1 - First of all, what's with putting stupid characters on the movie? Why did the stupid blond girl go after the dog if it was proved that the zombies had no interest in it?... Ridiculous!! 2 - Second, yeah everyone is dying, it's complete chaos, there are zombies everywhere, oh that is making me horny, let's have sex...??! 3 - Where did the zombies come from?! At least in the Resident Evil movie they had an explanation... And yes I did have a laugh on the celebrities look a likes shooting, but it wasn't worth the money and time spent on watching this piece of s***!! This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I can't believe it has such a high rating!!! :S Not worth seeing! Terrible! My rating would be 0/10 (or even a negative rating) but since such thing is not possible I'll have to give it a 1/10."
"edgarticker","1","3","8","30 March 2004"," not a good review
","I'm begging for a refund and to be paid for the 2 hours of my life wasted watching this movie. NO real story line, no surprises, nothing other than zombies who kill people, but only when the people are dumb enough to get close to them. Lots of potential in the beginning, but once they hit the mall, there is no story, just a random series of events leading to an ending. I think they threw in a little bit of nudity in the middle to get people who were drifting away to focus for a few seconds... Good Lord, Waterworld was better than this piece of crap. I know 5 year old kids who could have written a less predictable script. How did they get out of the situation when the gassed the zombies and burned them? Did that eliminate ALL of the zombies down there? How in the world did every person in that movie learn how to shoot like that? I thought they were going somewhere with water when they showed the dramatic shot of the nurse washing the blood off her hands in the fountain and then the 'twitcher' splashing around in there...Where did these people come up with the ability to trick out those shuttles? All of the sudden they're welders and metal fabricators? Come on..."
"preppy-3","9","3","8","26 March 2004"," Surprisingly very good
","Reimaging of the 1979 horror classic.  The dead rise and begin to attack and eat the living who, in turn, also rise and join them.  A group of people are holed up in a huge shopping mall...but how will they get out with it surrounded by hundreds of flesh-eating dead people?<br/><br/>It's not as good as the original but damn close (I'm giving it a 9).  Then again, it couldn't be as good.  The original was a ground-breaker--it was the first unrated horror film to play in first-run theatres.  Also, for 1979, the amount of gore was just staggering.  Nobody had ever seen anything like this!  Also it wasn't just a horror film--it was also a satire on American consumerism.<br/><br/>This one totally drops the satire (not a bad idea) and just goes full speed ahead with action, adventure and gore.  It's not as gory as the original, but it definetely pushes the level for an R-rated film.  DO NOT see this if you're squeamish.<br/><br/>The acting is just so-so--even the great Sarah Polley seems muted!  But really--who sees this for the acting?  It's scary, fast and violent and also the dead, this time around, move MUCH quicker (and are often filmed running in fast motion which is truly scary).  It does have its slow moments but those are few.  And I REALLY hated the ending.<br/><br/>Still, well worth seeing for horror fans."

","When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I had so wrong. This movie was exactly as every other horror movies. It's a virus, zombies etc. Exactly as Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. It's bad actors and boring music. The photo is OK but the rest is total crap. Don't see this ""horror"" movie, go and see the Ring 2 or any other movie who's much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies. We have seen enough of that. The only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous, infected celebrities."

","Dawn of the Dead is a different approach to the style of the original. Now the zombies are faster and perhaps even wiser.

As creepy as the slow undead were there was always the chance to outmaneuver them, but things are not so simple this time around. The usual zombie trope of a bunch of characters clustered together and hiding away is how the film goes about it but it manages to characterize the survivors instead of just using them as zombie fodder.

","The 1978 original Dawn of the Dead is one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>This remake is honestly pathetic. CGI, bad modern soundtrack, terrible acting and an unoriginal plot make it one of the worst zombie films I've ever seen. Romero's zombie movies are always with an underlying message about society and they always capture the nostalgic music, fashion and phrases from the era they were made in. This lousy remake just piggybacked off the original and was impossible to take seriously. It wasn't scary, nor was it funny, just boring. The Pennsylvania shopping center in the original was located in the northeast United States, where as this remake takes place in the Midwest. Tons of horror films take place in the Midwest, and the scenery... well, this film had none at all.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this waste of space unless you're an avid zombie film fan and have already seen the classic originals."

","DOTD 2004 is brilliant. We haven't had a noticeable zombie film in some time now, and this more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>Its exciting, emotional, its tense. Its also dark but has a sense of humour that surprisingly works well with the rest of the film. I love watching horror/sci-fi, and thought I could stand any level of violence. But this film is particularly violent, and all the better for it. Unlike the original, the zombies can't easily be outrun; they have super strength and pose far more of a threat than the ones in the tame original ever did. Whilst it does share some common elements to the original, it is not an exact remake. This one is far superior. The people act how you would EXPECT them to act (such as the people in the mall) This one also leaves a lot of questions unanswered (just check the message board below to see), and a sequel has been announced.<br/><br/>Let's just hope its better than LOTD, which I hear is disappointing."

","The last year was a year of remakes - exorcist, phantom of the opera, dawn of the dead etc. and they have one thing in common they failed. Of course it's always very hard to recreate the atmosphere of the original and balance between making the whole movie scary because of the feeling of hopelessness and loneliness the main characters feel or by showing zombies that look like a bad parody on clowns (terrible makeup etc).<br/><br/>The original movie was quite nice for a zombie movie it had the atmosphere that was scary by itself and even the synthetic looking zombies couldn't spoil the fun. The remake lacks this atmosphere, the zombies look and act more like drunkards after a bar brawl rather than scary undead monsters that are hungry for human flesh.<br/><br/>My suggestion - watch the original movie."
"slayrrr666","9","2","5","23 April 2004"," Better than expected, but not the original
","`Dawn of the Dead' remake is a great horror film, but it is not all that great as a zombie film.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>During a grueling hospital shift, Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) returns home to her husband. In the morning, she awakes to discover her neighbor has a horrible rash on her face. The neighbor immediately attacks her husband, forcing Ana to restrain her. In the confrontation, her husband dies. As Ana tries to contact medical authorities, her husband comes back to life and attackers Ana as well, fleeing her neighborhood, Ana realizes her whole city is being ravaged by an unknown source. On the run, she meets up with cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames) who tries to get her to safety. While searching for safety, they meet another cop, Andre (Mekhi Phifer) who is transporting his wife to safety. They find another man, Michael (Jake Weber) and together they find shelter in Monroeville Mall. Knowing of the sanctuary it provides, and the three guards trusted to maintain its security, Bart (Michael Barry), CJ (Michael Kelley) and Terry (Kevin Zegers), they reluctantly accept the group inside. After a few nights together, they earn each other's trust and begin to formulate escape plans. All are shot down by the unknown enemy that lurks outside the mall. Finally realizing it is a zombie threat, they begin to realize they are all that is left of society. Then comes a strange delivery truck which drops off several people at the mall. At first, Bart and CJ don't trust them and order them away. Terry disagrees, and switches sides to help the wounded. They realize too late that those bitten become zombies, as several of the people were bitten. After ridding, the problems, they try a last chance to escape. Steve (Ty Burrell) one of the people from the delivery truck, has a boat that could get them out of the mall. Figuring it's worth a shot, they rig buses from the storage lot from downstairs into almost impenetrable masses of destruction, and set out to the dock where it's kept. Along the way, several more meet grisly ends at the hands of the zombies. Ana reveals she too is infected and will become a zombie, so she stays behind as Kenneth, Michael, Terry, and his girlfriend escape from civilization.<br/><br/>The Good News: This film has an unbelievable opening and closing. The opening is perhaps one of the best scenes filmed in years. It is pretty close to the original, with its intense atmosphere, unreal images, and heart-stopping pace. It grabs you and never lets go, giving you almost no chance to rest in between. The ending is also a great scene, with complete irony toward the entire movie, while leaving a sequel in the works. The rest of the movie does have its fair share of good scenes. The zombie attack on the garage is tense and gripping, leaving the mall and entering a teeming zombie mass and still escaping is a breath-taking highlight, and the part with the sharpshooter picking off zombies is pretty funny. All in all, there are plenty of parts to give it a wonderful tone. The number of scares is small compared to, say, `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' but those it provides are especially powerful. The opening is very nerve-wracking, but it still plays perfectly with the rest of the film. The performances are quite good, with the three leads Rhames, Polley, and Weber turning in solid outings. As expected, a ton of gore is found, but only in the beginning and end of the movie. The end is pretty gruesome, with its escape from the mall, not the escape from society/ closing credit sequence. The middle of the film does have some good gore scenes, but it seems awfully watered down. A pack of zombies drag a man down and swarm over him, but then nothing is seen. A gripe I'll mention in the next part. <br/><br/>The Bad News: I don't know if it was played for comedy or what, but the stupidity of several characters was irritating. After knowing that zombies can't talk, Bart refuses to let Kenneth and gang stay because he suspects they may be zombies. A small part where from one side, Kenneth and group peer out into the zombie mass and pick out zombies that look like celebrities. The sharpshooter across the street picks them off, and they mention one that looks like Rosie O'Donnell. After knowing that zombies won't attack a dog, they release it into the mass to go across the street to deliver food to the starving person. When he gets bitten, one of them rushes across the street, teeming with zombies, to rescue the dog. Also, why was there a scene where the characters have a long, civilized dinner? This happens in the middle of the movie, and I was confused why it was shown. Stupidity than rationality was common in this movie. Again, no explanation is offered for the zombies appearance, which is particularly annoying know. I don't care if they give an illogical reason for them to be there, as the Italians do. Any reason is better than no reason. Also, despite the high gore opening and ending, almost nothing in the middle of the film. I don't know if it was censored or what, but I expected a movie about flesh-eating zombies to be teeming with gore. Speaking of flesh-eating zombies, they were given little screen time. A few scattered scenes in the middle are all we see of them after the opening and ending. I expected more zombies, despite the fact that they were now the fast-moving kind. Since it was in a mall, the mall didn't seem that big or expansive, and it lacked an all-out zombie-vs.-Man encounter. <br/><br/>The Final Verdict: See this only if you love zombie movies or modern horror movies. It will not disappoint anyone.<br/><br/>Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a short sex scene, and animals in peril."
"jickweez","4","2","5","23 March 2004"," More rip-off than remake
","Being a huge fan of Romero's original, I couldn't wait to see an updated version of the movie that haunted my teen years. I even was all ready to get advanced tix for the opening day. But after seeing the film's first 10 minutes on the USA network, I became less than enthused. And after seeing the rest of the movie, I feel more than cheated. This version is more like a rip-off of 28 Days Later than a remake of the original Dawn. The sluggish, dreamlike movements of the zombies are replaced with the jerky, rabid sprint that rendered 28 Days refreshing and original. This lame ""remake"" even stole the staccato camera style of 28 Days. Of course, the plot is laughable (not in an ironic way either) and the characters half dimensional - but what really ruined this flick is its utter disregard to its original material. The CGI peppered throughout also prove that nothing can beat the low-budget creepiness created by good old Karo syrup, red food color and overcooked pasta (see brains and intestines). At best, this is an above-ground Resident Evil. 4 out of 10."

","No. No. No no no no no no no no no.<br/><br/>Seriously - I sat there with my jaw slack, wondering if this was actually supposed to be scarier than a bunny in a field of flowers or better than a fetid pile of compost. Apparently, neither.<br/><br/>It's true - there are some great special effects in this movie, what with the obvious green screens, as well as the explosions that just so happen to be exactly the same all throughout the movie. Ooh, pretty.<br/><br/>And the gore factor is certainly there - because, of course, blood makes a good movie, the directors decided that it would be fun if they just randomly killed some people off by decapitation, dismemberment, and generally blowing brains out. No, literally. More than once you see blood splatter behind a zombie. But naturally, that's what I'm looking for in a good scary movie. Oh. Oh wait. No I'm not.<br/><br/>The storyline? Wait. Whoa. A STORYLINE? You'll have to forgive me, because I didn't notice. Well, that's not true. I did notice the endless clich√É¬©s, and the fact that the storyline was only exactly the same as in Resident Evil, except now Hell has run out of room. (An unfair comparison, considering the original came well before RE, but this is the one time that even under the law, this does not necessarily deserve a fair trial.) In all seriousness, the storyline (as well as the rather odd side plots) was actually more offensive than intriguing. Killing newborns (even zombified ones) and randomly picking off zombified celebrities, while supposed to be shocking or humorous, are poorly executed, and I can't find a single example of a person who finds killing newborns humorous that isn't psychologically impaired. Give me a break.<br/><br/>""But skibbleyboo66, the point of that plot is that the family went insane! It's supposed to make you sympathetic to their plight!"" Right. And I'm supposed to believe that having some stereotypical old lady duel a stereotypical African-American with a stereotypical family involved in a completely stereotypical zombie movie will make me sympathetic. I was sympathetic in the Exorcist, a similar movie in some regards (possessed children, scares not necessarily in the jump out kind, but the psychological kind), but with much, much, much less flawed execution.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, the soundtrack is really not too shabby. I enjoyed the jazz version of Disturbed (much more than the original), and, though completely unoriginal (like the rest of the movie), the music actually did strike me as better than the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, that's not saying much.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is really not the behind-the-scenes concept. It's really not. The execution that takes precedent over the concept is beyond flawed. Upon reflection, the movie really does remind me of the Exorcist, except I enjoyed the Exorcist. It boggles my mind, that America actually buys tickets and DVDs for this movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy, and after this review, I expect I'll have a few of them."

Not because it meant the movie was over, although that was a good thing, but the zombies you get to see by this point actually looked half decent. As for the rest of the zombies in the movie they look pathetic. Most of them look like they were out of some 'straight to video' piece of crap from the early 80s. And what was with their eyes going metallic looking?!? The biggest problem with this movie, aside from boring stereotypical characters who you can easily predict when they will die, is that the zombies seemed based on the ones in ""28 days later"". Which really aren't zombies after all. Dawn of the Dead, like the rest of the series, should be about ZOMBIES. So they shouldn't all look like they just woke up from an all night drink fest and be able to run like marathon athletes.

","Escaping from an epidemic of zombies, the nurse Ana (Sarah Polley), the police officer Kenneth (Ving Rhames), the Best Buy seller Mike (Jake Weber), the small time crook Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his Russian pregnant girlfriend Luda (Inna Korobkina) seek refuge in an isolated mall. There, they find the three security guards leaded by CJ (Michael Kelly), and after an initial problem between the groups, they join forces trying to survive. From their secluded place, they find another survivor, Andy (Bruce Bohne), living on the roof of his gun store. The group organizes an escape plan to a vessel moored in the marina, trying to find a safer nearby island to live. I hate remakes, but I have to admit that this version of 'Dawn of the Dead' is excellent. Indeed, the writer James Gunn used only George Romero's classic storyline in a totally different screenplay. The zombies in this 2004 version do not move slowly like in the original version and there are lots of characters, instead of only four like in the original version. Both 'Dawn of the Dead' are worthwhile horror movies and highly recommended to any fan of this genre. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): 'Madrugada dos Mortos' ('Dawn of the Dead')"

","I love this movie. Watch it over and over again every year. Wish they would make a sequel to this one using the same surviving characters. It was just so exhilarating and exhausting to think the zombies could move so fast :) ... I really liked the new approach as opposed to all the others that the zombies just lumbered around.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this one you definitely should. I just saw another movie recently that reminded me of this one. It is a foreign film but it was just as good... ""Train to Busan"" ... Add them both to your watch list. :)"

","Well not as good as the original this remake was well made taking key elements from the original movie and modernising them whilst adding new ideas and characters into the zombie movie formula.<br/><br/>The movie follows a small group of survivors of a zombie outbreak who decide to bunker down in a shopping mall where they have endless supplys until they are rescued but time passes by and no one comes to there aid and with the hundreds of zombies waiting at there front door they all have one question on there mind what now?.<br/><br/>This movie came at a time when there was a lot of remakes being made and 90% of them were bad while there are some good remakes like this movie were overlooked due to oversaturation of movies attempting to cash in on peoples nostalgia.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen this movie I recommend giving it a watch while it's not the best zombie movie out there it still gives us what we expect blood guts guns and action."

","DAWN OF THE DEAD; a remake of George A. Romero's same titled apocalyptic, epic, zombie-horror-action-thriller-drama 1978 masterpiece; this 2004 version sometimes seems good, especially the first 20 or 30 minutes leading up to/getting to the shopping mall (putting aside the cliche of the pretty female nurse working in a major hospital). And when they get inside the mall there's this promising bit where they're running and music from the 1978 film composed by the Italian band Goblin kicks in...but it's over in a few seconds and things go downhill when they meet the security guards hiding in the mall (which was meant to add complexity/depth to the situation but doesn't - it's just security guards hiding in a mall/protecting their turf - wow). Nancy Allen said in an interview on the Robocop remake (2014); words to the effect of: 'You only remake films that had a good idea but were executed badly'. I reckon it'd be cool to remake films for younger audiences who weren't around when the original came out; SPFX have improved so now it's possible to make a better looking/more polished versions but they should leave 'em to the original director/creative team (if they're still around which George A. Romero certainly was) e.g. 'Hey George this is so and so calling from Universal Studios and we want you to remake Dawn of the Dead; you can have as much $ as you like/we'll give you whatever you need/you'll have full creative control' and if they agree or at least have a role in overseeing the production then remake it otherwise leave it alone. Part of the reason why the original Dawn of the Dead was so much better was because George A. Romero worked largely outside of the studio system; he was independent, didn't use a lot of big stars and yet his movies kicked arse; the original Dawn of the Dead had a insight into human nature and materialism and captured a sense of dread and uneasiness as we watch a breakdown of the fabric of society - this remake just isn't as good, isn't as insightful; it seems trite in comparison. This remake is uneven in tone, never really gets going/the gore doesn't take off/there's crappy slow-motion like when the zombies are being blasted off the caged wire fences in the underground car-park and the action doesn't let rip like in the original; after the first act, it's pretty boring /there were missed opportunities; the original film let rip; this one doesn't. Giving it 5 out of 10 for trying and hey; it's easy to criticise; try making a film."

","I cannot understand the hate of fake gore. People say it is unnecessary but it is really necessary. All the movies without it are unnecessary, because it is part of horror but not all of horror for a movie. Cutting it out is just basically turning it into a thriller.<br/><br/>Irritating to hear someone claim they are a horror fan but can't stand the fake gore. WTH? Do not ever call yourself a horror fan, if you have to only watch movies without gore. Argument never stands with saying there is no need for the fake gore.<br/><br/>From start to finish, this is an awesome gory zombie movie. Anyone that keeps talking smack about gore, just is not all there in the head. You could say the for me, that likes it. Well, I do not consider a horror movie without it a horror movie.<br/><br/>This movie starts in a hospital and a nurse working, then after work goes home to her husband, but while at work a patient is taken with a bite. Turns out we don't know what is going on until she gets home and hangs out with her husband and has sex, she takes a shower and sleeps at night.<br/><br/>In the morning is when hell breaks loose with zombies getting more and more coming. All of a sudden her husband is attack by a kid next door biting him and turning him into one, and then she leaves with her husband trying to attack her.<br/><br/>The rest just gets more interesting. You can watch it for yourselves. It is awesome, and for the fake gore haters. Just keep in your PG-13 club, and all the real horror fans will enjoy the real actual horror movies."

","Zack Snyder's directorial debut is a decently entertaining & delightfully violent re-envisioning of George A. Romero's 1978 classic and while it keeps its premise similar to its source material, the film does take inspiration from Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later for its depiction of zombies. However, despite the 21st century upgrade, it's more or less forgettable.<br/><br/>The story of Dawn of the Dead follows a nurse who, following a zombie apocalypse, takes refuge inside a shopping mall along with a few human survivors. Surrounded by a swarm of flesh-eating zombies and running out of supplies, the group soon realises that they cannot stay there forever and devise a plan to escape the horde that's waiting for them outside the mall.<br/><br/>Written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder's, the film simply lifts the plot of the original and places it in a contemporary setting, without the subtleties, themes or social commentary that made Romero's film a classic. This remake is a straightforward action horror that revels in violence & gore, and opts for a more visceral ride than a thought-provoking one, at which it succeeds.<br/><br/>Populated with a tad excess characters, which inhibit character development, the film still retains its sense of fun and packs a good dose of action. The vibrant colour palette, slow-mo technique & swift manoeuvring of camera add to its kinetic flair, but turning those reanimated corpses into fast & agile creatures doesn't make much of a difference. Performances are fine for the most part but there are no standouts.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Dawn of the Dead doesn't bring anything new to the table yet qualifies as an acceptable remake that achieves what it set out to do. It may strike a better chord with those who haven't seen Romero's version but unlike that revered classic, there's nothing memorable about it. Opening on a thrilling note, falling flat in the middle & regaining some interest in the epilogue, this remake is good zombie fun. Nothing more, nothing less."

"talisencrw","9","1","2","16 January 2016"," One of the best contemporary genre-classic remakes!
","Though I love both 'Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' and 'Watchmen', I actually think Snyder's remake of George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' may be his finest and most personal work of the three. Usually I stay away from contemporary remakes of the classics like the plague, because to me, atmosphere is everything, and today's directors tend to significantly miss that point, but sometimes I just can't stop myself, and it helped that two recent character actors I really respect (fellow Canadian Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames) played significant roles. Though I still prefer the satirical angle on consumerism Romero utilized in his 70's original (and for that reason alone it would make a great double bill with 'Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom', at least from Pier Paolo Pasolini's philosophical context), this is head and shoulders (shot, of course, so it doesn't come back as a zombie) above other remakes of this era. I wish Snyder still had the sense of hunger that permeates this first film of his (pardon the pun ;) )..."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","1","2","21 October 2015"," Come on, man. You must've heard the priest say something about life and death.
","George Romero fans feared the worst, another one of his sacred original zombie trilogy films was being remade, this even though the remake of Night of the Living Dead didn't disgrace itself. As it happened, the fears were unfounded, for Zack Snyder and his team crafted one of the best horror remakes going.<br/><br/>The premise follows Romero's wonderful version, a mysterious epidemic is causing the populace to turn into undead zombies, the bite of which transfers the illness to another. A small group of survivors make it to the Crossroads Mall and hole up there whilst trying to keep at bay the zombie hordes, but inner fighting threatens the group whilst they know they can't stay there for ever.<br/><br/>Right from the off the film grabs you around the throat, it's a blistering and terrifying opening which brings heartbreak and terror in equal measure. It also announces to us that these zombies are different to Romero's, these suckers can run, and run fast. After some chaos and blood, the introductions to our survivors is set up and the pic settles into a superb group dynamic situation, where machismo and brains meet dumb and dumber, all while little devilish moments trickle away in the background.<br/><br/>It's the focus on the survivors that really lifts it to greater heights, how they variously react to their plight, there's good thought gone into the screenplay (James Gunn). The natural progression of this type of film calls for horror moments, and Snyder deftly slots them in when the pic needs them, which again brings about scenes of terror and genuine heartbreaking moments. Some neat cameos will be cheered by fans of Romero's work, while the cast are superb here, with Sarah Polley the standout fulfilling the believable promise of the character as written.<br/><br/>A remake that is its own beast yet still pays homage to what inspired it, and good at both! Now that's a rare thing in horror! 8/10"

","I have been watching a lot of Zombie stuff lately, so that I will be prepared for the coming Zombie Apocalypse, so I finally got around to seeing Zack Snyders version of the George Romero's classic, and I have to say, good job Zack. It is not a perfect movie and some of the things don't make much sense to me, like if the guy with the sniper rifle was sitting on a gun shop with lots of ammo, why was he not killing more zombies, heck, he could have taken out pretty much everyone that was there and they could have took a nice gingerly drive to the marina, but overall it is a pretty good depiction of what would happen if there was a zombie outbreak, and I am now that much more prepared for what is coming around the bend, so that makes it worth seeing all by itself, although it could have done without the nudity. 3.5 Beards Out Of 5"

","At first you'd think ""Wow, what a horrible idea"". One of the most beloved horror-satire movies of all time really needs to be remade? <br/><br/>Surprisingly, if you give it a chance you see that the movie had decided to do the smart thing. With a script handled by James Gunn, the satire of the original is removed and the film-makers go in there own direction with a totally different approach altogether. Still, the movie has its flaws and I don't think it holds up well to the original, making me wish it was just called something else. It'll definitely appeal to the younger generation of people who don't want to think, but would rather just see large amount of bullets and half a cast of dumb-ass, uninteresting characters just waiting to be eaten.<br/><br/>Still, Zack Snyder did a solid job for his first feature. He definitely knows how to give visual flair to even the smallest things, and the camera catches everything well. Notable actors from the first movie make an appearance, and Sarah Polley as well as Ving Rhames are the most likable characters in a group that arguably may have too many people in it. It's definitely not a zombie movie for the Romero crowd that's for sure.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Enjoyable and not all bad for a Romero remake. Leave your brain at the door and have some fun. 6/10."

","I decided to review this movie because of my love for zombie movies, from the slow-paced walkers of ""Walking Dead"" to the fast-paced runners of ""28 days later"". Well, speaking of fast-paced zombies, this movie definitely took me to a one thrill experience. <br/><br/>I have not watched the work of George A. Romero back in 1978 but the name Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) as the director of this remake gives me all the reason to watch this movie. Remake or not I think it is a solid movie for zombie fans like me. I love the storyline, actors, and the pace. All the factors that you are finding for a zombie movie is in here.<br/><br/>Maybe, you are wondering why my approach towards this movie is overly- biased but for me what's not to like? Perhaps, it cannot be compared to the greatness from the classic 1984 Dawn of the Dead but this move from the production companies to remake this movie definitely reached out a of lot people in this generation to give rise yet again to the true horror of zombies especially it was written by George Romero himself.

"LeeRob7","8","1","2","17 November 2013"," Awesome zombie remake that out-shines the original!
","Just watched this movie again 9 years on and was equally as impressed as the first time I watched it. One of the best zombie movies I've ever seen with the added impact of zombies relentlessly chasing down their victims at full speed quite unlike other flicks in this sub-genre! One of the few remakes that out-shines the original in my opinion. The Negatives: Some acting flaws including Ving Rhames portrayal of police man Kenneth being a tad too heartless to begin with and the lead 2 characters, the nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) and TV salesman Michael (Jake Weber), are somewhat annoying at times but each character grows on you as the movie progresses. The Positives: So many to list but the use of a mall and nearby gun shop provides an excellent setting. You have to be impressed by the insane 'birth of a zombie baby', 'celebrity look-alike gun play', 'getting down with the dead' and action packed 'escape' scenes. I love this movie but hey, I love zombies! 8/10"
"cousinoleg","5","1","2","18 September 2013"," Ignore the gore and violence, the meaning is easier to understand by the words of Lord Jesus Christ
","In the past i liked movies like this one, where a group of characters try to escape some threat, but slowly die one by one, with only a few more righteous/better characters remain alive by the end.<br/><br/>But i didn't understand the rules of reward and punishment, because of being brought up in an unbelieving family, and my sense of truth and goodness was subjective.<br/><br/>This zombie movie was repeated so much on TV, with some interesting Christian allusions, so i decided to analyze it according to Christian faith.<br/><br/>Thankfully to God, later in life i was lead to believe in His Son Jesus Christ, to become a Christian. It's the words of Jesus Christ, that shed light on what actions are good and true, and what are evil and false.<br/><br/>Jesus Chris concentrated the whole Bible (law and prophets) in two greatest commandments: love God with your whole being, and love our neighbors, by treating them the way you want to be treated.<br/><br/>Zombies, are a metaphor, easy to to uncover by Jesus' words, for the spiritually dead (Luke 9:60)(John 8:24) by sin.<br/><br/>The movie's Christian influence is observed by its showing of a Christian TV program condemning the country for immorality, abortions and other sins.<br/><br/>A couple of survivors lock themselves in a mall for food and protection, away from zombies. They are treated with hostility and are quarantined by former guards, led by CJ. <br/><br/>God will do a similar thing on the Judgement Day, the saints and true Christians will enter Heaven, but the rest, wicked unrepentant sinners will be thrown into the burning lake to keep the Kingdom of Heaven, unpolluted by sin and free from pain and sorrow. Many people hate God for this judgment as being loveless, but what are they going to do in the place of these zombie movie characters; are you going to love zombies, but put the rest of people under danger of infection? or are you going to destroy them and throw them out to keep the rest of people alive and uninfected?<br/><br/>After more wounded survivors come into the mall, the problem becomes more serious, when parents and loved ones are the ones who are infected. Jesus Christ told that if you love your parents and close ones more than Him, then you are not worthy of Him, and that you must hate your close ones and your own life to be His disciple (Matthew 10:37) (Luke 14:26). <br/><br/>These verses anger many ""atheists"" too. But here's a spiritual illustration of these verses in the movie - a pregnant woman was infected, and also the father of a newcomer girl is bitten too. Are you gonna love them even when they turn into zombies? Or are you going to destroy them once they are undead and dangerous? Otherwise it leads to more deaths, as a criminal character Andre and an old woman, murder each other, after she shoots his now-undead wife. <br/><br/>There was some strange accent by slow motion on this woman's smoking habit; for hints read (1 Corinthians 3:16) - does smoking glorify God or does it harm our bodies?<br/><br/>It's better to follow Jesus Christ into eternal life and salvation, than to keep hanging with the close ones who refuse to believe and repent and follow them into destruction of souls in hellfire.<br/><br/>From then on, by using Jesus' words it's easy to predict who's going to die and/or turn into zombie. By Jesus' and God's words, and the actions of some of the movie's characters, we find the following sins: homosexuality, arrogance, lack of love and care, sexual immorality, cruelty. <br/><br/>God tells that sin leads to death. Indeed these characters did die next. The others that have some faith in God, and who take care of others (christian love), do survive.<br/><br/>It's basically a demonstration of usefulness and good practice of Jesus' words in a zombie movie. So let's thank Jesus Christ and God for His good example, wisdom and teaching.<br/><br/>Later CJ, sacrifices himself by blowing up a gas bomb after being cornered and bit by a zombie crowd. According to the Bible Jesus Christ has died on the cross, as a permanent sacrifice for our sins, to save us from spiritual death by sin. His reverse initials are CJ(Christ Jesus). Was CJ's initials and self-sacrifice to save the rest of the group a nod to Jesus' sacrifice? Might be.<br/><br/>Also there's some attempt at drama, to reveal that a character, who was romantically linked to a caring female character, was bitten. Did he sin in some way? I don't remember. Of course, they need to separate.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: The violent action and gore can heavily distract from the meaning of the story, and is unsuitable for children and nervous people.<br/><br/>For others, the Christian influences of the story make it somewhat interesting in demonstrating the meaning, necessity and practical usefulness of some of Jesus Christ's teachings, though it should not be treated literally, but spiritually. After all there are no literal zombies in this world, so there's no literal fight - but there's a spiritual one against lies of Satan and unbelievers, by the use of the Word of God, in the Bible.<br/><br/>So throw away your guns and weapons and leave your dreams of being a hero in a zombie apocalypse, but better read the Bible, starting with New Testament for beginners, so that your soul will be saved by Jesus Christ, and you won't share the burning lake punishment with unrepentant wicked sinners."
"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","6","1","2","28 August 2013"," Less enjoyable than the original
","Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the original DOTD which I saw for the first time yesterday, giving me a really solid base to review this title on.<br/><br/>The pace is a lot faster in this film, zombies included, as well as having obvious updates in action, gore and realistic effects. They still got the colour of blood wrong at the beginning though.<br/><br/>One of the problems with the first movie is the incompetent nature of the zombies which only really pose a threat because of their sheer number, whereas in this film they're a real individual THREAT, behaving like incensed, rabid animals. This however removes the comedy element of the first film, but does make this a more accurate horror survival film instead of a tongue-in-cheek horror comedy.<br/><br/>The genius of the original film is captured to an extent and then, unfortunately, tossed away. Imagine being stuck in a shopping mall (albeit surrounded by zombies) and discovering you have free access to everything under the sun, day after day, for as long as you want it. After the shock of being surrounded by rabid zombies wears off, the cast start to live it up, enjoying the fruits and fun of all the trappings of life, right? No, they don't! And that's the main problem with this version of DOTD. Although much more realistic and frightening, they eventually decide to make a crazy run for it, away from the shopping mall. Why, instead of using common sense and choosing to stay in a secure environment with everything necessary to survive, including food, drink and welding equipment!, would they suddenly decide to head for the marina in a couple of Mad Max style souped up buses? It made no sense during the film, nor after it ended.<br/><br/>All sorts of other questions popped into my mind such as the part with the girl stealing a van and driving, unopposed by zombie masses to rescue the dog. It's a nice, sentimental touch, but when they make their escape at the end they can't drive out of the parking lot because of the dense mass of zombies blocking the route.<br/><br/>For all it's flaws, I did enjoy this film, but I just wasn't as entertained as in the first film, which I initially thought was going to be a load of sh*t, but turned out to be really, really good fun.<br/><br/>The cameo appearance by one of the lead actors in the original film, as a TV evangelist, was a nice little touch in this decent, pretty entertaining action-horror film, which is a lot better than a LOT of other horror flicks released over the last decade, but which misses out on the humour element which the original film grasped, realized was very important, and thrived on until the end credits."
"gigan-92","9","1","2","20 March 2012"," One of the Few Well-Made Horror Re-Makes
","Zack Synder is one of the finest contemporary directors of our time. Here he's taken a 1978 masterpiece and has managed to create a version that pays tribute to the original but is also different enough not to feel unnecessary (kinda vice versa how ""Predators"" felt unnecessary even though it WASN'T a re-make, it sure felt like one with the countless homages). I felt the Tom Savini directed re-make of ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a great movie, while the Nick Cannon-starring re-make of ""Day of the Dead"" was just plain sh*tty. This film stands on its own remarkably well.<br/><br/>It has awesome cameos of Tom Savini, Ken Foree and yes Scott Reiniger fans of the original will enjoy. I'm surprised they didn't sneak in George Romero in there somewhere (maybe he's one of the zombies if you look hard enough...). Any who, the characters do have less screen time individually due to a larger cast, but they're still pretty memorable. Most noteworthy of them all is Ving Rhames obviously. He's the new zombie-killing bad ass. Sarah Polley, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer and Michael Kelly all do really well. The director's cut is definitely the way to go, you get to further immerse yourself into the world set up by the camera. As for for the zombies, I whole heartedly prefer the original designs. The slow movement allows you to analyze the disgusting details as it were. The zombies in this film are agile and fast movers, probably somewhat inspired from the 'zombies' of ""28 Days Later"". It works because the film is aiming more for action than grueling horror which is easy to tell thru a lot of its comedic moments. And yes, credit to Tyler Bates for creating a very effective score.<br/><br/>While not up to par with the original, this one is definitely worth a look due to a different, fast-paced direction. The director's cut is the preferred edition to see it."
"DanLives1980","Null","1","2","16 October 2011"," 28 Dawns Later???
","I've not been fair with Zack Snyder's remake of George A. Romero's epic horror film over the years, simply because even though I initially loved it enough at the cinema to see it twice, the original was ""the original"" and best.<br/><br/>I cannot deny that the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake was, and still is, possibly the best zombie film since the original (actually I'm a huge fan of Day), even though it made some daft mistakes.<br/><br/>'Dawn of the Dead' (2004) did for the ailing American horror movie what '28 Days Later' did for the then recently revived British horror movie and Snyder may have been late but he was right on the coat-tails of Alex Garland and Danny Boyle's reinventing of the classic zombie apocalypse. Running zombies are just silly outside of the Left 4 Dead game series, in my opinion.<br/><br/>As hot new property cutting his teeth on the movie industry, Snyder's approach was to provide entertainment that both airheads and connoisseurs could agree on and the standard was simply to be innovative. In this movie, the times have changed, as have the rules and the people that abide by them. And so has most of Romero's original script, for that matter, re-written by none other than James Gunn, who at least has a wicked sense of humour.<br/><br/>As opposed to the original, this zombie apocalypse is more explosive in its delivery and yet there is no fighting to liberate the mall our characters stumble across. In fact, unlike the original, this version hardly fancies the idea of fighting a bunch of runner zombies until they absolutely have to and when they do, it's fleeting.<br/><br/>Saying that, Snyder's use of realism is the first element to set itself apart from the original, as is his favouritism of pace over suspense. Whereas in the original there were four characters finding their own way to overcome the threats of a world suddenly invaded by the flesh-eating dead, this version sees a collective of irritating modern day American civilians forced to cope with each other as their greatest threat behind locked doors becomes the stereotypes they must overcome.<br/><br/>My personal favourites are Ving Rhames, Michael Kelly and Jake Weber. The rest are pretty redundant most of the time, which makes me wonder why they needed more than the original four. But then Tucker, the truck driver, is great because he's useless.<br/><br/>The choice in actors does make for a pretty good drama with some good comedy moments, though, and also some pretty good action scenes. The characters range from genuine hard-cases and big talkers to scared or stupid air-polluters. <br/><br/>I was left cold by some of the effects and zombie prosthetic make-up and gore. The brain exploding gun shots, though sparing, were amazing. But the looks of the zombies was a little too picture perfect to come across as grisly or frightening and in this film, they don't eat people, they just bite and scramble and clamber around like monkeys. <br/><br/>That's my only problem. 28 Days Later is not a zombie film, so why can zombies run and climb and why do they just bite you and that's it? It takes away the visceral horror of the zombie hordes if they're not even going to eat you. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder's 'Dawn of the Dead' is the complete opposite of George Romero's original, but still manages to entertain greatly as a standalone film. And in a way, I suppose I'm glad that Snyder didn't out-do the original because he was capable even then!"

So poor Louis leans in just far enough to leave his neck exposed and...<br/><br/>Louis predictably enough (for a zombie movie) sparks up a little after death, and immediately takes a different interest in Ana, deciding that some shower action might be appropriate, only this time rip your living flesh from your body action.<br/><br/>Ana decides that enough of this relationship and kicks Louis to the kerb by jumping out the window and driving off, once outside she realizes that she isn't in Kansas anymore. At least I don't think this was filmed in Kansas, what do I know I'm not American.<br/><br/>Outside everything is in chaos, there are some awesome visuals in these first moments of realization, including a massive fuel station crash that still has impact even when you've seen the film half a dozen times like me.<br/><br/>Ana eventually reverses her car off an embankment and her lights go out...<br/><br/>And that's when the opening credits roll! Fast forward a little, Ana is now back on her feet, and she meets with other survivors, each with their own grim tales to tell. They all decide to head to the relative safety of the local mall. The initial crew are Ana, cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), and a pregnant couple.<br/><br/>Once in the mall their initial impediment comes in the form of some dipsh*t security guards who have decided that allowing others in will somehow compromise their own safety, this all changes when a new batch of survivors shows up and joins the party.<br/><br/>The new group of about 8 (from memory) include 2 wounded, obviously the gang haven't seen a zombie movie before so they don't see what's coming until it gets there.<br/><br/>Another new development is the sighting of another survivor across the road from the mall in a gunshop, after conversing by hand held whiteboard and binoculars they discover that the man's name is Andy, and that he is alone. Even though he is almost within shouting distance however, the sea of zombies in between makes it nigh impossible to simply catch up for a beer.<br/><br/>It is obvious that even though some are better equipped to handle the situation than others, there is no Arnie style hero among them that will single-handedly ward off the zombie hordes, nor a super-genius character who can devise an amazing cure (Pontypool?) or amazing escape. It is simply a bunch of random people thrust together through amazingly unfortunate events.<br/><br/>Most notable among the group though are two guys who couldn't be more dissimilar, Michael is loyal, quiet and sensible and extremely determined despite his background not suggesting any heroism,""I sell TVs at Best Buy"". His antithesis is Steve, a smarmy, self-absorbed prick of a man who wants no part in anything even vaguely dangerous and is more than content sitting at the back of the room and throwing jibes around without ever being the least bit helpful.<br/><br/>Steve is a total w*nker but provides most of the funny in the film, so much so that I didn't actually want him to get what he really deserved, and Michael was so resourceful and selfless that you want him to make it out too, but for the opposite reasons. It's rare that a horror film takes the time to actually highlight the various personalities of the characters to an extent greater than ""the hero"", ""the nerd"", ""the hot chick"" and ""the evil guy who will die horribly"".<br/><br/>The ongoing discussions invariably return to the outside world; are there unaffected ""safe"" areas?; are there even other survivors?; and the overriding question remains should they stay in relative security or leave and see for themselves what is ""out there""? Without spoilers, eventually the decision is sort of made for them, and the final 15 or so minutes is nothing short of awesome. The film has some amazing action sequences, some great gore effects and things move at a frantic pace. Say what you want about running zombies but in my view it is scarier to be chased by a foaming and spitting zombie that can do the 40 yard dash in a few seconds than a shuffling mummy-style thing. Obviously the zombies had the good sense to keep up their cardio, even in death.<br/><br/>For those who say that the dead can't run. They can't shuffle or walk either f*ckers! The film has a couple of amusing bits, but even in the face of zombie apocalypse it is fair to expect someone to crack a joke every now and then. In the main though it holds true to the tone set in the early going, escaping a flesh-hungry menace can bring you down just a little.<br/><br/>There is never a reason given for the outbreak in zombie-it is, and I maintain that if the movie is good then there doesn't ever need to be.<br/><br/>And this movie is verrrrry good.<br/><br/>When I originally watched it 6 or so years ago I remember thinking ""that couldn't have been that good could it?"" and I watched it again the next night. I was amazed to find that even after the second viewing I was just as blown away.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 9 / 10. Proof that remakes don't have to be simply lazy cash-cows. This is ferocious, adrenaline fuelled and original in its own way. Even though this is not particularly scary it is still a modern horror classic, and should form part of any discerning horror fan's DVD collection.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
"Cosmoeticadotcom","5","1","2","10 September 2008"," Mediocre
","OK, so the 2004 Zack Snyder remake of George Romero's Dawn Of The Dead is better than his own fourth Dead movie, Land Of The Dead, but it's still not nearly as good as the original 1978 Dawn Of The Dead. The basic problem is that the film violates its own universe's rules so many times that the film falls apart narratively. One can get away with things that are illogical in real life, but not according to the film's own precepts. In contrast to the Romero canon, zombies in this film can run like Olympic sprinters. Why? No reason except the financial success of the British zombie film 28 Days. Also, in the Romero canon, anyone who dies becomes a zombie, whereas in this film you are zombified only by a bite. Yet, if so, how did the first zombie, Zombie Zero, come to be?<br/><br/>That said, this film is not bad, merely a solid action/horror flick that follows the same general pattern as the original Dawn Of The Dead, except that instead of four survivors in a mall there are a dozen or so. Illogic rules, as in all horror and sci fi films, and the plot is propelled by the characters doing the dumbest things possible, such as the climactic scene where they make a dash from the mall to a marina to head for an island they think will be safe haven¬Ö. For fans of the Romero canons there are a few cool cameos by Tom Savini (Romero's original makeup man), and Scott Reiniger and Ken Foree, from the original Dawn Of The Dead, with Reiniger as a military man interviewed on television, and Foree as a televangelist repeating his famed declamation from the original, 'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' This, and a bevy of other little 'moments', is enough for me to recommend the film as a solid reinterpretation of the superior original, despite its reliance on the 'humans are their own worst enemies' mantra, although the DVD features make this a much stronger recommendation for those zombiephiles out there."
"Ithorianjedimaster2","8","1","2","24 February 2008"," A Masterpiece looked upon as a cheap remake
","Just the name ""Dawn of the Dead"" sends shivers down my spine. As a zombie fanatic, I absolutely love George Romero's movies, especially ""Dawn of the Dead"". Then, a few years ago, I saw a trailer for this movie and when the title appears on screen, I was immediately excited. After a long wait, I have to say that despite the fact that I've seen it numerous times now, it is still a frighteningly realistic look at a world that may surpass that of George Romero himself.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Ana, an employee at a local hospital, who comes home, spends some 'quality time' with her husband, and as they drift off the sleep, that's when it all begins *chuckles*. When Ana wakes up, she finds herself in a whole different world. A neighbor girl walks into her room, bites and tears a few veins from her husband's neck, and if that wasn't bad enough, after Ana closes the door, locking the little girl out, her own husband gets up and attacks her. Following is the first look at the horrifying image of a zombie SPRINTING after Ana's car. Soon, Ana crashes her car, wakes up with a shotgun aimed at her head by my favorite character, big bad no-holds-barred Kenneth, then they meet up with more survivors and the plot from the classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" kicks in.<br/><br/>First off, I don't care how many people whine and b**** about the sprinting zombies. Zack Snyder's idea of ""If they see you, you're f***ed"" when it comes to encounters with zombies makes a lot of tension in the movie. In the classic George Romero film, the survivors harmlessly ran around the shuffling, moaning zombies, which kind of eliminated some of the fear that revolved around them. In the remake, with the sprinting undead, it becomes clear that the threat is extreme and makes for a more tense film.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, with delightful performances by Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames. The zombie make-up? Watching the dead slowly decay over the movie's timespand makes for a realistic feel. There's plenty of jump-out-of-nowhere moments and lots of suspense that will make a zombie fan turn off the DVD feeling extremely satisfied. The clich√©s that have plagued many horror movies are ABSENT here. The characters are all original, like the redeeming gangster, the TV salesman, the trucker, etc.<br/><br/>Of course, this movie is only getting 9 out of 10 because there isn't a sequel in sight, but then again, maybe I should change that since masterpieces like ""300"" and soon-to-be ""The Watchmen"" is bound to be all that is on Zack Snyder's mind. Why this movie isn't on the Top 250, I don't know. Maybe there are just too many uptight zombie fans who can't accept the fact that Zack Snyder did what no other director could do, take George Romero's golden film and perfect it in nearly every aspect. Bravo, Mr. Snyder, bravo!"
"adudewhoiscool","8","1","2","23 December 2006"," A true zombie flick
","The 2004 ""re-imagining"" of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is an impressive zombie movie. There will be zero comparing to the original George A. Romero movie because this reviewer had only see bits and pieces (lame pun) of that one. There will be no comparisons between the unrated edition and the theatrical cut because this reviewer never saw the theatrical version. If you decide to watch this version of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" expect lots of gore, and action, mixed in with plenty of suspense. If you expect those, you should be very pleased.<br/><br/>A young female nurse, named Anna, is caught in the middle of a worldwide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin taking over the world by attacking the living. She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a police officer named Kenneth. Together they find shelter in a mall, along with a group of other survivors. For a while everything is OK, but then they start running out of food, the power goes out, and the dead keep finding ways to break through their defenses. Realizing this, they must make a plan for escape. Will they find a way to survive or is the human race doomed? <br/><br/>The first 15 minutes of this movie was one of the best introductions this reviewer had seen, not only for a horror movie but also for any type. The idea of putting a Johnny Cash song, ""The Man Comes Around,"" in the opening credits, may seem strange in a horror movie, but because of the songs post-apocalyptic feel, it fits well. It was a bold move, but it worked well. After watching the movie, you discover that putting that the addition of that Johnny Cash song was pure genius.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets you go. It starts with a creepy introduction and continues that pace throughout. This is a zombie movie, so you should expect gore and plenty of it. While this movie is advertised as a pure horror movie, it should be considered more of an action movie with elements of suspense and horror. Another great factor was that they never took this movie too seriously by adding some dark comedy to it. You also need to watch the end credits to see what happens to the remaining survivors.<br/><br/>Throughout this movie, the main stars are the zombies. These zombies are different then the normal zombies seen in video games, movies, books, and television shows. These zombies are more realistic looking, which made them scarier. The make up was amazing and a huge improvement over the zombies in the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" Zombies could not get very much more realistic then what is shown in the 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead."" Another difference is the speed of the zombies. These zombies can run and will be able to catch you if you do not run fast enough. That made it scarier simply because you do not think the human race has a chance of survival.<br/><br/>The actors do a decent job in making you care for their survival, even though majority of the movie was focused on the action and suspense. None of the actors did an award winning performance, but it did their jobs. Sarah Polley played Anna, the main woman who was given the most time and development. Ving Rhames plays Kenneth, a cop fighting for his survival. Mekhi Phifer plays Andre, a man having a tough time realizing that his wife, Luda (played by Inna Korobkina), may be turning into a zombie. Jake Webber plays Michael, a person you do not like at first but by the end you end up liking him.<br/><br/>The only real defect to this version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the writing. This is not very surprising since this is not only an action/horror movie, but also a zombie movie. There were plot holes and some things were not explained well. Some of the characters could have been expanded a little bit. Some people may complain about that, but this reviewer did not seem to mind it at all. After all, the unrated cut is 110 minutes long, which is almost two hours; no zombie movie needs to be over two hours long.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an entertaining movie. With a $28 million budget, you should expect lots of blood and gore, realistic zombie make up, explosions with great action scenes involving: guns, saws, and other weapons. The results make this an entertaining popcorn movie you can turn your brain off to. With action, horror, and some comedy mixed in, there was everything you should expect in a zombie movie. The 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is very recommend!"
"janemason100","7","1","2","22 October 2006"," decent remake
","When I think of ""Dawn of the dead"" I think of the original featuring Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger. However this version is more of a film that has a doomsday feeling to it because the initial tone of the film is a lot more fast paced and the zombies seem to have speeder up and are a lot more dangerous and psychotic than their lumbering counterparts in the original.<br/><br/>Sarah Polley is great as the main character while Ving Rhames is great as the disgruntled police officer and Jake Weber,Mekhi Phifer, and Lindy Booth are great counterparts who add their own credentials to the production in their Zombie infested hellhole where they are situated. This version of the film has been trimmed considerably from the original in which that focused on the isolation and how would you fill the time if you had an abandoned mall while on the flip side this one focuses more on the action and not the mental side of it all just like the first one did. However, a new addition to the film were the Zombies who instead of lumbering aimlessly around they attack with a ferocity like no other. However, one thing I like about this film is the use of different ideas within the film. and toys with different scenarios on how to escape and does not resort to a scene by scene remake of a film done oh so poorly by Gus van Sant in the 1998 version of ""Psycho"" that film made me laugh. However, when watching I do feel that the narrative is a little weak and is not as well made as the original and the other characterised are just there to be Zombie chow therefore, allowing the main characters escape.<br/><br/>In conclusion it is a well made film that is worth buying on D.V.D but if you want a memorable zombie film I recommend the original"
"charliecheswick","7","1","2","14 October 2006"," Loved it
","First of all , don't watch this if you are looking for the next Citizen Kane. However , if you like a movie in which you can switch off your brain and sit back and enjoy a nonsensical movie then this one is for you. I like the original , and to be honest was expecting a poor interpretation , but I thought this was pretty good. Remake is probably not really the right word because other than the shopping mall and zombies, it doesn't really have the slow build up of tension that the original has. Instead it is a zombie movie for the teenagers of today - faster, more guts and blood, more pointless characters to kill off and more action. And overall it does work pretty well. There is only one poor part of the film , in which there is a bit of a lull in the action , and the attempt to spruce it up by introducing a teenage girl and a dog , doesn't really work.However the end sequence involving chainsaws and explosions more than makes up for this. If your looking for cheap thrills in a movie then this one will do the trick. There is also a pretty good soundtrack to accompany the action."
"alex_t4444","5","1","2","20 August 2006"," Not a patch on the original
","I rented this film after having seen a preview of the first ten minutes when it came out in 2004 (something Channel 4 were doing at the time). Having seen this preview I was expecting an atmospheric and chilling film, I should have stopped it after ten minutes. There are many things wrong with this film without even comparing it to the original, firstly is the 'slick' new metal/ Jonny Cash soundtrack which merely cheapens any of the atmosphere promised by the prologue - 28 Days Later wins hands down on this front. Secondly the characters are too many in number and too transparent to care about, in the original one had a sense of empathy for the characters. Thirdly the film was not scary in the slightest or indeed tense, the zombies in the original were within touching distance of the characters not 'safely' contained outside only to become a problem when one of the idiot characters goes on a suicide mission to rescue a dog. Finally this film has nothing of the sub-textual relevance of Romero's original which made a satirical swipe at consumer culture and made one question who was worse, the zombies or the humans. Overall a big, big disappointment except for the zombie baby which actually made me laugh - so bonus points for comic entertainment I guess."
"Chicky5150","5","1","2","14 August 2006"," A dumbed-down remake
","On its own, this is a very capable and professional movie. But I have to rate it badly because it is a remake of a brilliant film...and most of the things that made the original excellent were omitted from the remake. This is yet another film that banks on recognition of its elder, and does not really respect the source.<br/><br/>The omissions are substantial. Romero's film starts out with media confusion and a look at what the authorities are doing to combat the living dead. Even as hell is breaking out, media talking heads argue with each other. This is left out in the remake, missing the opportunity for satire, and narrowing the scope of the film. The group's presence in the mall is a brilliant testimony to the emptiness of material things, but this was omitted in the remake. This is the whole point of them being in the mall in the first place! The bikers overwhelm the mall at point in the original, showing man to be as savage as the enemy (and perhaps even deserving the plague of the living dead?) this was omitted as well.<br/><br/>Everything that makes Romero's movies more than a bit of splatter was left out. (Oh, and zombie babies are not horrifying, they are comic. Ask Peter Jackson.)So why remake a film classic, if you aren't going to introduce the elements that make it great? This is another attempt to cash in on a name by a studio."
"Evil_Magus","5","1","2","1 July 2006"," One of the Better Remakes I've Seen.
","This movie is easily one of the better remakes I've seen. I've watched it several times, and every time I like it all the more. However, this movie is an example where my personal preference for a movie outshines the movie's actual artistic merit. Despite being an excellent remake, and highly entertaining, it's only a decent film. Being such, my ranking reflects that, and not my personal enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>All the actors that they chose did a decent job on this movie. There were no extraordinary performances, or even great ones; only non-obtrusive good ones. Each part was well cast and it can be said that nobody fell short in this regard.<br/><br/>The opening credit sequence, after Sarah Polley (Who played Anna) fled her home, was alright, except for the choice in music. While the lyrics might have been somewhat fitting, the overall tone it set was entirely counter-productive for what they've already established and what they continue to establish afterwords. Even the clips that they choose to show for that sequence are mediocre at best. But it still gets it's point across extremely well: This is not an isolated instance, but an epidemic (of a sort) sweeping the world at large.<br/><br/>One part of the movie that I found extremely annoying at first, but which eventually turns into something of an acquired taste, is the coloring and lighting. They're all unnaturally bright. Upon first viewing, this can be detracting. Even on second viewing it can be very annoying. But after that, you get used to it and can tolerate it. It actually is somewhat unnerving, which compliments the movie, to see everything in a matter that's far to bright and colorful for the pervading mood and situation all around them. The makeup for the zombies was done extremely well, I felt, and far surpassed the original.<br/><br/>If the original 1978 Dawn of the Dead was something of a Horror/Drama movie, then the remake is more of a Horror/Action one. It still touches upon human drama amidst the swarms of flesh-eating zombies, but that takes second stage to all of the physical activity. Especially at the end, this movie digresses into an almost all-out action movie, although swings back somewhat at the end more to horror.<br/><br/>This is not a slavishly devoted remake. Except for the concept of people hiding out in a shopping mall amidst a zombie attack, and a few other details (A black man being a cop who's brother died, a pregnant woman, a woman who lost her husband, etc...) there's very little in common with it and its predecessor. The vast majority of the action and actions taken throughout the course of the film are different from the the original. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The movie has a life and an action all of its own, and can be considered on its own merit, and not just that of the 1978 film. It is rare that remake can do this, and it should always be commended.<br/><br/>One criticism that I have for the film is the over-abundance of characters. The original only had four protagonists. This one has around 12 or 13 throughout the whole film, although some only have a brief time on screen. This makes each life, subsequently, less valuable. Granted, they are able to pull off a large-bodied cast better than most other films, and are able to keep the audience from perpetually waiting for them all to die off.<br/><br/>One thing that I like, which seems to be a trend in many zombie movies as of late, is for these, as one person called them, ""Super Zombies"". By this, I mean zombies that are not slowly lumbering sacks of meat, but fast, strong and deadly undead; such as in the movie 28 Days later or the book Cell. They add incalculably to the danger perpetuated by the zombies, and makes the threat all that more... well... threatening.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an extremely entertaining film, and one of the best remakes I've ever seen. It might not be, from a more critical standpoint, a good film, however. It's not nearly so good as the original overall, lacking the sharp satirical wit of it's 1978 predecessor, although it does a far better job in making the zombies a threat than before. This is a definite must-see for horror, Zombie and Romero fans. It should also appeal to a much younger audience than the original."
"Irelander","Null","1","2","8 June 2006"," When The Man Comes Around
","What a great zombie, this was. This movie is proof that a REMAKE is not always a bad thing after all.<br/><br/>The new fast zombie add to the already freaky nature of a corpse coming at you intent on taking a chunk out of you.<br/><br/>The new mall is smaller than the one in the classic... this with great lighting make the film more claustrophobic.<br/><br/>The actors are great in this film too... with more people, and less running time they actors did well to carve out a good part for the film.<br/><br/>The Johnny Cash song ""When the Man Comes Around"" at opening credits of just how fast the world can fall apart was great.<br/><br/>Enjoy the show."
"bensonmum2","6","1","2","13 May 2006"," ""OK, I have an idea. We draw straws and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich.""
","I actually enjoyed Dawn of the Dead more than I thought I would. Not being the biggest fan in the world of the original, I found very little appealing about the thought of watching a remake. While my rating certainly doesn't indicate I thought it was a masterpiece, as a mindless action film, there's plenty to enjoy. Mindless? Shooting zombie after zombie in the head isn't what I would call thought provoking. But the scenes like the one in the sewers where our heroes are being chased by zombies sure is a lot of fun. However, as a horror movie, Dawn of the Dead is a failure. There appears to have been no attempt to create any atmosphere. Other than the scene in the parking garage, I never go that uneasy feeling horror usually produces. The horror that is there is too obvious and lacks subtlety that I find necessary for it to be really effective. Also, as there isn't really much of an attempt to flesh out the characters, it's difficult to care about the predicament they find themselves in.<br/><br/>I've read any number of internet posts on what seems to be an endless debate about fast zombies vs. slow zombies. I actually see advantages and disadvantages to both. I find a slow moving zombie lurking in the shadows to be a far more frightening visage than the Carl Lewis style zombie. On the other hand, the fast moving zombies seem to present more of threat and work better in action sequences. Push come to shove, I suppose I would come down on the side of the slow zombies. The undead in Romero's Night of the Living Dead or Fulci's Zombi 2 work better for me because of their inherent creepiness."
"amicsenyi","8","1","2","27 January 2006"," I was freaked
","Decided to watch this at night, alone. Not a good decision. Needless to say, by the end of the movie I was pretty freaked out, so much so that I had to do a quick sweep on my tiny 3 room apartment before being able to sleep. So, as far as I'm concerned, mission accomplished.<br/><br/>I started watching it not knowing if I really wanted to devote 2 hours to it, but after the first zombie attack the action was so quick and intense my heart was racing and I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to. The plot is so-so. Acting is good, being a horror flick, I understood that you couldn't really get attached to anyone, since they could die at any time, so I'm thinking that was why character development was minimal. The movie excelled at making the viewer tense and as uncomfortable as possible. Something about being stuck in one place while the world around you deteriorates gives me the creeps. And this movie conveys that feeling perfectly. It was gruesome, fast paced, dark, and scary. Everything a horror film should have.<br/><br/>A good horror flick overall. For maximum effect watch alone in dark."
"jouiskc","5","1","2","15 December 2005"," It was OK....but
","First I want to point out that I have never seen the original Dawn of the Dead. The main reason for this is that zombie movies just are not my thing. I don't have anything against them, I just think that if you seen one you seen them all. Now I will give kudos to this movie for having one of the best opening acts that I can remember. The first ten minutes of the movie are excellent. Fast paced and shocking, it really gets you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>However, we get past that and start introducing characters. I like Ving Rhames and you knew what you were going to get out of his character. Sarah Polley does a good job and Jake Weber is OK. But the other characters are annoying. In fact this is one of the main weaknesses of the movie. Not only are there too many characters, there are too many that you really could care less about. They are not only unbelievable(the character of CJ the most glaring) but they actually seem to drag the rest down with them.<br/><br/>The second weakness is the middle of the movie. After a frantic first ten minutes, the movie grinds to a halt. Instead of using this down time to provide us with some exposition that actually would advance the movie's plot, we get a sequence of scenes of the cast frolicking in the mall. What happened to everyone? What was the government or military response? And frankly this leads to some unintentional plot holes. Am I to believe that a handful of common people can hole up in a mall seemingly indefinitely, while the highly skilled and trained military gets wiped out in a matter of days? And the much maligned baby scene/scenario is just pointless. What did the father think they were going to do? Keep a zombie and zombie baby around for them to munch on them? Speaking of that, aren't zombie supposed to be flesh eaters? If this is the case why are there so many. Surely some zombies were eating one another.<br/><br/>Finally, the end of the movie is kind of a let down. Suddenly, though somewhat understandably they decide they need to escape to an island via a boat. And they decide to convert a couple of buses into tanks. OK so far. But then we decide we need to get the character across the street some food? Why not just wait until you make a run for it in the armored buses. And why does that dumb girl go and get the dog? And then why in the world do they feel compelled to rescue her? And how does CJ suddenly become one of the gang? I could go on and on. But the single most annoying part of the ending is what happens afterward embedded in the closing credits. After spending two hours mildly rooting for annoying people, I am rewarded for my time investment to discover that they get zombified anyway? What was the point then?<br/><br/>In summary, a really good opening sequence is followed by a lot of yakking and pointless plot threads. The closing chase scene is OK, but by this time who cared. And the ""ending"" of the movie was just plain over the top. I was left with the feeling of why I bothered. If I ever see it on again I will make certain I catch the opening act, but will do something else with the next 90 minutes of my life."
"jarod34","Null","1","2","12 November 2005"," Not depressing enough
","I've just watched Dawn of the dead 2. Wonderful effects, fantastic action sequences, great soundtrack, but for some reason it seems so bloody cheerful. When you see the original DOTD, the effects are poor the make-up is amateurish and the soundtrack is crap. But the great thing about the original Dawn of the dead and other 1970s horror films is that they are so wonderfully depressing. There's no edge of your seat, fantastic, wham-bam action. But a morbid, nightmarish horror that leaves you with a sense of apocalyptic doom. I've not yet seen ""land of the dead"", but I hope George Romero hasn't resorted to special effects horror and stuck to his tried and trusted ""end of the world"" misery. I honestly believe that horror has lost the plot since the 1970s. It tries too much to entertain, I want to be miserable!"
"marmotta74","5","1","2","11 September 2005"," The original one still is the best
","Not a particularly bad movie, no. There are good things about it. One example: the fast zombies. Special effects are newer than in George Romero's original, but not THAT newer, after all. And: gory sequences are not as scary as in the original movie. I believe the feelings of fear, claustrophobia, pain and horror are not as vivid as in the original movie. This movie is occasionally scary, but it just does not manage to reproduce fully the ""magic"" that Romero was so good at. One more thing: I did not like the pseudo-philosophical junk that ""explained"" the zombie plague: we are corrupt, we are evil, there are prostitution, homosexuality, drugs, abortion, blah blah blah... I can do without such ""lectures"", thanks."
"In_Name_And_Blood","6","1","2","8 August 2005"," Great fun but no classic
","Let's face it. I didn't want this movie to be made. I felt like kicking someone's dog when it was announced. How could the studios give first-timer Zack Snyder money to remake George Romero's classic, yet not give Georgie a couple of bucks to finish off his own series? I didn't watch this at the movies, even though I love James Gunn. It finally came out in its 'uncut' form on DVD and.... it was pretty cool. Some of the ideas were well executed (if unoriginal), Ving Rhames turned in a spirited performance and no, my copy of the original didn't mysteriously disappear after seeing this newer version.<br/><br/>The pace of the film was tight, the makeup was brilliant and I had a helluva time sitting through it. But afterwards...nothing. What I had seen was much like the popcorn I munched throughout, tasty but not exactly nutritious. Romero's original trilogy was like sitting down to a kilo steak, potatoes, chips and a fine glass of wine. You felt satisfied. Dawn of the Dead 2004 was so full of quick cuts, bloodless killings, CGI and paper thin characters that a week later, I could remember little about the movie other than a few key plot points and ""hey...that's cool"" moments.<br/><br/>These feelings were only heightened when I watched DotD '04 a couple of days after Romero's Land of the Dead, a film that managed to pack in as many hip, exciting scenarios whilst offering deep characters and and a thoughtful storyline. And you actually got to see the zombies. Snyder did great, but he couldn't get close to Romero.<br/><br/>But enough about Romero. Snyder's created an above-average horror flick that's a great way to pass a couple of hours. There's enough action in there to please even the fussiest of fans, some truly eerie imagery and is a fantastic addition to the genre. You just might have to grab a burger on the way home."
"edwjoolee","8","1","2","14 July 2005"," A worthy remake...
","I loved the original Dawn of the Dead. I remember seeing it as a young kid and being fascinated, shocked, repulsed and excited by the imageries shown in that film. The movie represented for me at the time everything that was adult and taboo.<br/><br/>The new remake is a complete makeover of the original: it is made for the MTV generation, with fast editing, quick pacing and unrelenting action. In other words, the new DOD is intended for mass consumption. And that is not a bad thing if it is done right, and, in my opinion, the new DOD gets it right.<br/><br/>There are more characters than in the original. And the new film clocks in at way below the two hour mark, whereas, if my memory serves me right, the original ran much longer than 2 hrs. The new version, therefore, lacks clearly defined characters, and the pacing of the film seems somewhat rushed under the limited time constraint.<br/><br/>However, the film is a hoot. It is briskly paced and the action sequences are furious at times. Also, it is a scary film. What the film lacks in characterization, it wholly makes up for it by turning the action meter on up high.<br/><br/>Undeniably, there will be die-hard fans of the original who will dismiss the new version as a needless remake. That is their right, and I support their right to their opinions. However, the new DOD is entertaining in its own right, i.e., as a divergent, action-oriented horror film."

","Romero has the zombie flick sewn up. Nobody to-date has ever done it better. This DOTD remake is a good horror movie, but it fails to convince me that it has any purpose other than to provide a piece of disposable entertainment. You watch it. You comment on how it ""lacks the subtext or intelligence of the original"". You forget about it. The classic DOTD can't be forgotten, it is so pointedly brilliant in its ideas, its editing, its directing, its entire execution. Okay okay, so the makeup effects have been vastly improved these days but once you dig down past the eye candy the 2004 remake has very little on offer. Give it another 20 years, people will still be talking about Romero's vision. The 2004 version will be lost somewhere in remake hell."

","Screenwriter James Gunn tries to add some new twists to George A. Romero's creepy 1978 script. But it's a hard act to follow. Our story follows registered nurse Ana ( Sarah Polly ) Who takes to the hills<br/><br/>with the rest of the Milwaukee area after her husband is murdered along with half the town by packs of rampaging zombies. It isn't long before she crashes her car off the panicked highway and runs into still human police officer Ken, played by the always excellent Ving Rhames. Banding together while dodging and executing the zombies alike, they meet up with a few more straggling survivors led by Mikhi Pfifer who has a pregnant girlfriend in desperate tow. In dire need of a safe house, and learning that many potential havens have been overrun by the bloodthirsty dead. They finally have to settle for breaking in to a large shopping mall. The problem with this, compared to Romero's genius original idea is that all the surprise element is gone for fans of the 1978 film. And the shocking quaintness of the inhabitants taking advantage of the mall's finer points seems lost in the shuffle of some pointless twists. In other words, during Romero's story, you could feel enough horror as to where you could picture yourself locked inside the mall. And you could relate to the extreme relief the raiders would be feeling in that situation. I didn't feel the same sense of urgency and therefore terror here. We don't even see that much of the mall. Instead, we have a revolving door of new characters most soon to be zombie food. And none all that interesting. In the original the cast was narrowed. Making it much easier to cozy up to the characters. Here a hard rock soundtrack keeps kicking in, not much of a substitute for Romero's eerie elevator music. There are some pluses, both Phifer and Rhames give credible performances as men in an impossible situation. Seeing how naturally these fine African American actors blend seamlessly with the rest of the cast, is a credit to Romero's vision. When 'Night of the Living Dead' debuted in 1969, Romero was ostracized for going with a black or 'Negro' leading man. He was told at the time that it was an outrage which would not wash with white audiences. Well here we are thirty six years later, and because of pioneers like Romero, black actors get the opportunities they deserve, while we scarcely notice the difference. All in all, I'd say 'Dawn of the Dead is not a total loss, it just doesn't approach the queasy horror of the original. And even though these zombies run much faster. Were still not quite as frightened that they might catch up. actually, this film is much more like an American version of '28 Days later' the British zombie takeoff, than it is to respecting Romero's Satanic vision. Good entertainment, but not permanently scarring horror. 6 out of a possible 10 T.H."
"leorican","10","1","2","24 June 2005"," The Dawn is here...And Zack Snyder has brought it!!!!!!
","One of the best remakes in memory. Zack Snyder's directorial debut is a fast, high tension, full speed ahead action Zombie Flick that holds no apologies. He has made this film, originally done by George Romero, his own. I remember sitting in the theater not knowing what to expect but from the minute I saw the first frames I knew I was in for a ride. Slick and perfect, zooming in from an X-Ray of a skull, the story opens and builds up creepily as the character of Anna, ( played by the perfectly cast Sarah Polley)who is a nurse, is getting off her shift at the hospital. We are given clues that something is not right with the world today and the scenes that occur as Anna leaves the hospital and then arrives home are foreshadows of what's to come and gave me the chills. The following scenes depicting Anna and her boyfriend's next day ""morning visitor"" is one of the most eerie and frightening moments in the eye popping opening as all hell is about to break loose. After watching the opening credits and music, which set the mood for the rest of the film, I know I was going to have a blast. What follows is a survival test for a group of people who now find themselves thrown together in a shopping mall as they fight off the crazed zombies outside and try and figure out how to stay alive. This is in my opinion, way better than the original although that was a classic in its day. Snyder has raised the bar for Zombie flicks that all directors of this genre should adhere to. These fast moving undead are far more scarier than slow moving stiffs we usually see in this types of films. Great adaption of the original script and scenery you can chew on like the undead eating up some fresh meat. The ending credit scenes....make sure you stay in your seat till the lights come on.....are an added devilish treat...Did I say I love this movie? Filmmakers take note....This is how a remake is done!"

","When I first heard ""they"" were redoing ""Dawn of the Dead,"" my heart sank. How could anyone recreate the magic and thrill of the 1978 classic? Well, they didn't ... but the movie was entertaining enough that I have now watched it thrice.<br/><br/>The opener really sucks you in. It's creepy, visceral, and glues you to your seat. It's so good, in fact, that those first 5 minutes provide enough juice to carry you through the rest of the movie, no matter how bad the rest might be. Fortunately, the next hour and a half is pretty interesting, too.<br/><br/>The directing and photography really help the film; it creates a cold, wet, slippery atmosphere well-suited to the zombie sub-genre. Normally the shaky, documentary-style camera work would be inappropriate for a zombie flick (I find it irritating in almost any movie), but this one is different from other zombie movies in ways that make the technique tolerable.<br/><br/>As scary and fun as ""Dawn of the Dead"" is, it lacks something. Maybe there was too much heavy metal in the soundtrack, or maybe the characters did one too many unbelievable things. But I've never just sat back and said ""whoa,"" or had much to say to my friends about the movie. Like cotton candy, it's tasty and you'll probably want it again, but it leaves a funny, unpleasant aftertaste.<br/><br/>The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" stands head and shoulders above most Horror films that come out these days. But it hardly clears the original's waistline."
"morfeus","7","1","2","9 June 2005"," Excellent B-grade movie
","""Dawn of the dead"" quite a good movie. it has a good budget for FX (there is not much to watch in zombie movies except for FX, is there?, however it keeps the unique atmosphere of the 1978 original. The plot is naturally bad, but it's unlikely that a zombie flick will ever produce a decent drama or room for character development. There are fixed standard characters, like a cop, a black guy with a gun, redneck security guard and so on. Most of them die in quite entertaining way, so the audience is never bored. Casting is good, however, it doesn't really matter, since most characters are quite flat. IMHO, they should have replaced Sarah Polly with more...ehm...typical nurse:) So, to sum up - a good piece of commercial entertainment. Not a Lynch movie, but it's never been positioned as such."

After a barrage of killing zombies, our ""humans"" are stuck in an elevator playing, you guessed it, ""elevator music."" The character of CJ breaks us up by saying ""I like this song."" Funny stuff. Sarah Polley was OK, at best. Ving Rhames was great, as was CJ, whoever he is. The ending credits sort of ruined some of it, but not completely. I think it would have been best left out.

","Firstly, this is a remake, so I was expecting Hollywood to have taken the idea of the original, and tinkered with it.......My correction, they just took the NAME of the original film, the location, and a couple of the plot hooks, and then packaged it as a ""remake"".<br/><br/>To appreciate this film, take it as a separate entity from George A. Romero's film of the same name. This is yet another trashy movie, which under any normal circumstances I would have ignored. However, I saw it for free, and thought it was one of the greatest comedies I have ever seen. The acting is poor, scripting worse, and there is very little directing bar the stunts, yet, somehow, through this storm of ham-acting and bile, we find some amazing scenes which are just so over the top, that it's actually side-splittingly funny! Blood pours like rain, and a comedy soundtrack of Richard Cheese helps to fuel the humour even more.<br/><br/>Basically, just go and see it, laugh, and then forget about it. This is not serious, not memorable, just a trashy, throw-away, cheap, entertaining movie, something to throw on when you get bored. If you were expecting great things from this, look elsewhere."
"juliankennedy23","9","1","2","8 May 2005"," Isn't a good remake an oxymoron
","Dawn of the Dead (2004): 10/10: I sympathize with the fan boys that feel any remake of Dawn of the Dead is religious sacrilegious. You get an emotional attachment to films that scared you in your youth. (One on mine is Assault on Precinct 13 that was remade recently and I just know I will be disappointed with the remake. I am still scared of ice cream trucks as a result of seeing that film when I was 9) <br/><br/>Remakes themselves have a well deserved bad reputation. (Easiest movie trivia question: What is the best film remake? The Maltese Falcon of course. That Humphrey Bogart perennial was a remake of a 1931 film of the same name. I'm sure back in 1941 that there were a couple of people complaining that Bogart was no Ricardo Cortez and the ruined the story by taking out the affair and homosexual subplots. The first film after all was a pre-code affair.) <br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is in reality a different movie than the original. This is no shot for shot Psycho remake nor is it the same movie with a glossier CGI coat of paint. It is a faster more intense zombie film. It is one of the best action horror films of the last ten years. The opening twenty minutes in simply one of the scariest action packed sequences I have ever seen. By the time our band of protagonists gets to the mall they are not the only one's catching their breath. <br/><br/>It becomes a pretty good sized group at the mall and you end up slogging through some slow bits as the zombies eat it down to a more manageable size.The acting is across the board good and the effects are suitably gory and plentiful. Director Zack Snyder wisely dumps much of Romero's sociological subplots and replaces them with a more timely commentary. (Instead of zombies as consumer motif we have shooting undead celebrities. And instead of an outwardly hostile motorcycle gang, we have a more subtle power struggle between the otherwise powerless.) <br/><br/>The updates honestly work, as a more literal remake would have simply fallen flat. Is Dawn of the Dead better than the original? I won't say. Is it one of the best films of 2004? Yes. Is it better than Romero's own sequel Day of the Dead? Good Lord yes."
"hu675","8","1","2","20 April 2005"," Finally One of the Few Horror Remakes is Done Right.
","Gruesome... But this surprisingly entertaining remake of the original 1979 classic from George A. Romero (Which Romero will have his fourth Zombie film ""Land of the Dead"" will be released this summer). Which it has the same basic idea from the original but different in tone and a new set of characters for this updated remake. When a group of survivors (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Ty Burrell, Micheal Kelly, Kevin Zegers, Micheal Berry, Inna Korobkina, Lindy Booth, Kim Poirier, Boyd Banks, R.D. Reid, Jayne Eastwood and Matt Frewer) decide to take refuge on an abandon Shopping Mall hiding from mindless, flesh-eating zombies. Trying to Survive, while the human race is becoming erased and only becoming a bed-time story for campfire tales. Those handful of survivors are trying fight a desperate battle between the survivors and these zombies but only to stay alive.<br/><br/>This remake is directed by first time filmmaker-Zack Snyder (Snyder's next film is Rainbow Six and 300). Snyder brings a lot of energy and style to this now-familiar story but equally impressive film. This remake is exciting, violent, funny and even touching. The film also has as well of some disturbing scenes. Original Dawn-Romero's message on commercialism is lost (Since the shopping malls is outmoded anyway). Synder brings some terrific action sequences towards the third act of the film. Synder is certainly new talented director with good movies for him to come. He's one of the few movie directors that Hollywood should watch for. <br/><br/>One of the producers of this remake is Richard P. Rubinstein (Who produced the original Romero's classic). Rubinstein is one of few people, who stayed to be involved with the remake. Tom Savini (Who was the make-up effects artist and also had a bit part as Blades), Scott H. Reiniger (Who played one of the heroes:Roger) and Ken Foree (Who played the lead hero:Peter) do excellent cameos for this remake. The Unrated Director's Cut of the Remake is certainly much better than the original theatrical release not because of the extra gore or a bit more of characters development. The Unrated Director's Cut actually corrected some of the continuity story errors from the R-Rated Version and it also make a bit more sense. Sure, the remake has a few plot holes and maybe a bit too much characters are not enough focus in this remake (Since Jake Weber is the most focus character in the remake). But this new Dawn is well cast with good performances.<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an engaging Commentary track by Director:Zack Synder and Producer:Eric Newman. DVD also has Deleted Scenes with/without commentary by Synder and Newman. DVD has two amusing mini-movies that inspired for this Remake but the best of all is three featurettes on the make-up effects artist by Two-Time Oscar Winner:David LeRoy Anderson. Anderson won Two Oscars on Make-Up Effects for The Nutty Professor (1996) and Men in Black (1997). DVD Features could have used more like the Original Theatrical Trailer, Interview with the Actors and why Rubinstein wanted to do a Remake of Dawn. Which Rubinstein did a commentary track for the Extended Cut of the Original-Dawn on the Dead in the Ultimate 4-Disc Edition. The Remake of Dawn is almost perfect as the Original but the only real shortcoming of this remake is the surprise end-credits, which it does push things a little too far and it seems to come from a different movie. Was it really worth the trouble ? Since the surprise end-credits wasn't part of Screenwriter:James Gunn (Best Known for writing-Scooby Doo films) original screenplay. Top Screenwriters:Micheal Tolkin (The Player) and Scott Frank (Minority Report) did some re-writes for this remake, which they are uncredited. Super 35.

","My husband rented this and I was, annoyed- to say the least.He'd seen it before and I loathe slasher movies. I hide behind my hands during violent scenes in regular movies. (Although I must brag that I waited for hours to see ""The Blair Witch Project."") How could I be expected to watch a high budget zombie movie?<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes were difficult. I kept asking if I should hide my eyes. The music and weird vibe of the opening scenes made me uncomfortable. I kept wondering how they were going to introduce the inevitable. I was edgy and creeped out by the, well- by the ""dawn of the dead."" I couldn't tell if Anna was the main character or one of those people they kill off at the beginning just to mess with you, like Drew Barrymore in ""Scream.""<br/><br/>After the main characters were all introduced, my grip on the hide-my-face-pillow was loosened. I was thankful for the comic relief and the minimal gore within the confines of the shopping mall sanctuary. The special effects/make up were more than expected. Usually everyone looks like they're covered in beefaroni, but (as the special features on the DVD point out)these dead guys were modeled from forensic photographs. Sometimes the zombies are amusing, like the bloated woman who's so fat she's dragged in by wheelbarrow or the bumbling Burt Reynolds look alike killed off in a twisted version of Hollywood Squares. Other times the images are haunting, like the first zombie, a small girl with her lips ripped off or the woman accidentally killed in the get-away bus.<br/><br/>""Dawn of the Dead"" was believable as what would happen if, dare I say it...zombies took over the earth. But what's with this?: The mall refugees' rooftop friend across the street is starving so they send a dog over with food. As expected, this plan goes awry. For crying out loud! They live in a mall. Why not go to the toy store and get an r.c. airplane and send IT over with a sandwich? ""Duh"" moments aside, my only complaint is the ending.The constant flipping between camcorder and credits was nauseating. All in all, I'd suggest this to a guy friend."
"aimless-46","6","1","2","21 March 2005"," Lions and Tigers and Emmitt Smiths-Oh My!!!
","Unlike my reaction to most remakes, I was happy when I first heard that they were remaking ""Dawn of the Dead"", the story is so irresistible that it could be remade ten times and each would still be entertaining. And I was sure they could do a whole lot better than George Romaro's third installment, the awful ""Day of the Dead"". Seeing the remake did not change my opinion, I found it fun entertainment and better than ""Day"". But I am hoping for still another remake because while better than ""Day"", it was not even remotely in the class of ""Night"" or the first ""Dawn"". It was about on a par with ""Return of the Living Dead"". Hopefully Romaro's new ""Land of the Living Dead"" will be a worthy companion to ""Night"" and to the original ""Dawn""..<br/><br/>The remake started out well and it worked fine as long as Sarah Polley was the central character, but once they got into the mall the wheels fell off and the whole thing became very ordinary. And I was stunned by how bad the editing was with jump cuts and puzzling gaps in the storyline. While these may have been due to production issues, the lazy hack job done on titles and credits makes the post-production folks the most likely suspects.<br/><br/>The biggest controversy is a shuffling zombie vs a running zombie. A single shuffling Romero zombie was not particularly dangerous and it was only a crowd of zombies that posed much of a threat. So having a running zombie helped to close the main plot hole in Romero's films-it never made sense that something that slow and stupid could have taken over. But a shuffler is a far more frightening image because zombies are about entropy, a symbol of individual humans and eventually the entire human order breaking down. Slow rot that eats away everything human in everyone else until it devours you alive. Barely ambulatory supports this fear far better than zombies that run like Emmitt Smith.<br/><br/>I did generally enjoy this movie. But the comments on IMDb are far too often of the ""best ever"" ""worst ever"" type; useless to the prospective viewer. So for the benefit of those viewers I will again say that while the remake doesn't suck, it is extremely flawed and is only a pale shadow of the original. It is silly for us to accept that something this imperfect is anywhere near the best that can be expected from modern horror-especially since the illogic of such a belief is exposed by many classic horror movies, which create better horror and more suspense in subtle ways that does not need to overwhelm us to throughly scare us. So if someone calls this effort a classic, you can safely assume that they have not seen much else that the genre has to offer, or that they are as brain-dead as a zombie (but maybe not as brain-dead as those, and there are some out there, who thought ""Day of the Dead"" was the best of Romaro's trilogy)."

I don't even remember the last time I was so scared from watching a movie before going to see this in the theater. The original 1978 version was great as well. Both George Romero and Zack Snyder are phenomenal directors. Another thing I really enjoyed about this film was that the zombies were fast-moving, as opposed to the traditional slow-moving zombies. I really believe Zack Snyder really did the original justice with this remake."

","I loved DOTD, the original and the remake. The problem I have with the remake is that the action flowed well and logically up until the point at which the characters decided that they had to leave the mall. The writers should have added a valid reason why the mall was not a viable option for the characters. It really ruins the subsequent story that they left the very secure mall for a dangerous run to the unknown. It seems that they just threw that in to get the action moving again. Once they left the mall, they had no food, no water, no security. <br/><br/>One device I do like is the use of the dog and the character Nicole as tools to destroy the heroes. The fact that they adopted the dog and it caused Andy's death and then barked when they reached the island which alerted the zombies to the survivor's presence is ironic. Nicole functioned as a destructive device as well when she insisted on rescuing the dog (who was in no danger) and getting more characters killed to save her."

After watching a while, i really couldn't be afraid of the zombies, it seemed the only reason they managed to kill anybody at all, was because the survivors made one suicidal plan after another.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie was somewhat entertaining when viewed as a black comedy instead of a horror movie."
"poe426","10","1","2","8 February 2005"," What Richard Matheson by way of George Romero has wrought...
","Filmmaker George Romero has often cited Richard Matheson's classic SF shocker I AM LEGEND as the inspiration for his chiller NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. In Matheson's short story, DANCE OF THE DEAD, a ""loopy"" comes twitching to life before a crowd of onlookers (""loopy"" being a play on ""Lifeless Undead Phenomenon""). Unlike the vampires in I AM LEGEND, the zombie in DANCE OF THE DEAD is slow-moving and uncoordinated. Like the walking dead in Romero's classic(s). (Or perhaps Romero found inspiration in the first feature based on Matheson's I AM LEGEND, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH; certainly the living dead in Romero's movie mimic the ponderous, slow-moving vampires therein- not to mention the undead in INVISIBLE INVADERS.) <br/><br/>In the ""remake"" of DAWN OF THE DEAD (a remake in name only), the zombies are even closer to the vampires that originally inspired them. They are no longer the lumbering, slow-moving creatures that we've all come to know and love. Like the zombies in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, the reflexes haven't slowed since death. This makes for an even bleaker scenario than in the Romero films (in which there often seems to be, somewhere in the gloom, a faint ray of hope, however dim): not only do you need to be faster than the guy next to you, you need to be able to outrun creatures impervious to pain; creatures dying, if you will, to taste your very flesh... <br/><br/>The film starts off well, but begins to lose focus as characters crowd in on one another, with ""throwaway"" victims introduced just minutes, in some cases, prior to their deaths. (It's hard- if not impossible- to feel for these ""throwaways,"" as we learn very little about them.) The interplay between the principals, however, more than makes up for the shortcomings of the diversionary deaths. (In all frankness, the gratuitous gore is a given in these movies- it's part of their allure-, but makeup fx alone do not a worthwhile feature make.) All in all, a topnotch entry in the (sub-)genre."

","For a horror flick, someone definitely had to be having a bit of fun with this one. We all pretty much know this story from the original and it's sequels, in which a bunch of people are turned into zombies and begin eating other people. What made this version unique was its gore (way up there) and some of the comedic scenes. In this film we (SPOILER) even get a zombie baby! Our ""heroes"" are shacked up in a mall most of the film with Ving Rhames as Mr. Macho, playing a weird game of ""Shoot the Celebrity Look-Alike Zombie"" from the mall's rooftop. They stay there so long that people start making their own homes out of each store and begin forming relationships (the scene with the couple and the store video camera is ridiculously funny). In fact, that would describe much of this movie, except for the fact we have to take it somewhat seriously just due to the amount of blood and gore (much like Cabin Fever). Don't expect a happy ending in this one (remember ""Return of the Living Dead""?). If you watch the ending credits, you'll get a bit of Blair-Witch-type footage which is pretty good. 6/10"

If you can get past the idea of Undead Olympic Sprinting Super Humans instead of our shambling old friends in the original, it's actually pretty enjoyable. I liked how the film worked dialogue and images from the original into the remake and even into some of the key scenes. The Tom Savini scene was also golden.<br/><br/>On the down side, I didn't buy some of the character actions here and there and the dog plan was down right stupid. The rule that made it work wasn't established until a character said so. It reeked of a convenient plot device. I also liked the ending before the credits rolled and would have preferred that instead of the bit during the credits, just because they would have captured the same feel of the original's ending. It also seems that the zombies would have smashed the glass front of the mall in order to get in faster than it could be boarded up. The remake was also missing a pie fight. >:( Over all, this was an enjoyable horror/action flick."

","The original ranks as one of my all-time favorite horror movies. I did enjoy many of the new characters and plot twists. The acting was far superior to the original. Here's my beef: Every now and then, the characters would engage in some utterly absurd action that was clearly contrived to throw suspense into the story. For example, when Michael investigates the noise in the sporting goods store ALONE, without telling anyone else where he's going (and Michael's the smart one!) For me, this just shatters the suspension of disbelief and reminds me that I'm watching a movie -- a movie that isn't even crafted well enough to hide the seams in its plot.<br/><br/>I found the entire subplot with Mekhi Phifer's character incredulous. His completely irrational choices are explained away when he suddenly appears to have gone insane. Unfortunately, nothing in the story sets up the mental collapse of this otherwise cool and collected character. His brief conversation with Ving Rhames does nothing to foreshadow a descent into madness. His desire to bring his child into the world and give it a better life than his own hardly sound like the ravings of a lunatic.<br/><br/>Oh, and the girl who goes chasing after the dog!!! Oh, puh-leeze!!! <br/><br/>I also disliked the epilogue. Why, oh why, would you dock your boat in a potentially hostile shore? Nobody thought to scout the shoreline first? Or drop anchor in the harbor, then take a dinghy to check out the coast? The bleakness of the ending felt fashionably, smugly pessimistic and hateful toward characters I had grown to care for. I do prefer the ending of the original, which is ambiguous but does at least leave room for hope."

I had just as much fun (maybe I'm sick!) watching out of the corner of my eye, my wife and son ""yip"", jump and cringe behind their couch pillows during the shocking scenes; as much as I did re-watching the flick itself. Or maybe cuz it was late Saturday night; the night before Halloween! Dying (no pun intended) for something to watch that would be kinda scary (at least for them). Something scary on a global crisis level! And guess what? For them...the scares delivered; Yep-per-ree!!...them scares delivered Big Time!<br/><br/>The 'Unrated...' clears up a few more plot holes (like ahh! how they got into the mall by breaking a store window without being followed??) and establishes a little more character opportunities. It did seem better acted the 2nd time around. Fact is, it was just some 'actor spottiness' by a couple of the supporting players that colored my original perceptions. And if Jake Weber doesn't get more acting jobs after this, he needs to fire his agent. The guy's got great voice inflection!<br/><br/>On a hunch, I bought the 'Unrated'...dvd during it's 1st week, while still on sale discount. Because I very much wanted to like this movie, in spite of how disappointing it seemed the 1st time seeing it. Besides, it was Halloween weekend. You know everyone enjoys a good, scary Halloween fright flick during Halloween time...Right?? Hey; doesn't most everybody??? Well...good decision!<br/><br/>Is it as good or better than the original? Not quite!...but that's an opinion. A few too many scenes where thrills take precedent over logic (try exploding a propane tank so close to a fueled powered bus). There's no denying that many vintages surpass the original. And some nice departures on its own. A 1st time director??...there's worse out there from seasoned veterans.<br/><br/>(Secret for uping the scare scale!: Ya just gotta know when to discreetly crank up the volume during the shocking, graphic moments...it helps.)"

","I feel it missed up on one issue. They messed up on the Rigamortis issue of the people when they die. It is understandable that the Zombies can be quick and have some animal like minds at first, but they should not be able to keep up that stride. As each hour passes by since becoming a Zombie they should begin to slow down and begin to lack co'ordination from rigamortis setting in. They need no food for nourishment as it was stated in Day of the Dead by the good Doctor Frankenstein. So even if they do eat it wouldn't give them further re-animation or reverse the rigamortis. But I guess that's an issue for the makers of the movie to decide.<br/><br/>Eitherway, I loved the Movie and I hope they can get a little bit of reality of rigamortis in the next installment which I believe is called, ""Land of the Dead"". JFYI, in ""The Night of the Living Dead"" they did eat other animals(rodents), bugs, worms, so I guess they changed it for the dog to not be considered edible as to get to Andy in ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"".<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Lou"

","There are not words enough to control my fury right now. First, Gus Van Zant destroys 'Psycho' with his pathetic shot by shot remake, then Michael Bay and his troop of incompetent failures tred upon 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. Now, now we have the writer of 'Scooby Doo', a commercial director who should have stayed in commercials, and a mostly forgettable cast raping the memory of yet another classic, perfect film, 'Dawn of the Dead'.<br/><br/>I am probably the biggest Romero fan boy there is, yet I tried desperately to like this movie, I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to know that it's new concept and thoughts were closer to Tom Savini's 1990 remake of 'Night of the Living Dead' than to the pathetic, non-sensical mess this thing was. It took Romero's classic, stripped it of all its merits and concepts, and reduced it to nothing more than a moronic gore fest geared towards a moronic audience, loaded it up with mindless (and in some cases, nameless) characters, threw in music to rip your eardrums out by, and then ripped off one of the few horror gems in the past 5 years ('The Blair Witch Project') for it's ignorant conclusion.<br/><br/>Plot line is that something unknown is causing the dead to return to life and attack the living. In the midst of this carnage, a small group of survivors gather and seek shelter in the closest local, the shopping mall. They include Michael (Jake Weber), Anna (Sarah Polley), Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and Luda (Inna Korobkina). After a run-in with mall security, they begin to settle in for what could be a long wait for help. After realizing it won't be coming, they begin to formulate a plan to get to safety.<br/><br/>Acting? Well¬Öpathetic would be entirely too kind a word, but I'm not sure I need to plant that blame at the feet of the actors. The leads all do well with what they have, but the problem is that the story is so vapid that it would be hard to recite with a straight face. Most of the characters were throw away, and we didn't even learn their names. For example, the very attractive wavy-haired blonde was apparently named Monica, and she was literally nothing more than filler. It took more than too much time to give us Lindy Booth's character name (Nicole), and up till that point, she was nothing more than pretty redhead background filler. Not that she's all that great anyway, as anyone who's seen 'Wrong Turn' realizes she's nothing more to a film than a pretty face.<br/><br/>Characters were wooden and dull; there were only 3 worth caring about. Michael, Kenneth and Andy (Bruce Bohne), who owned the gun store across the street. Mall security guard CJ (Michael Kelly) redeems himself, and you eventually grow to like him, but the rest of the cast you don't care about, you wouldn't want to care about, and worst of all, you don't get time to care about.<br/><br/>The only good thing out of this movie was the fact that its success (and rapid understandable drop-off) enabled George A. Romero to make his upcoming 'Land of the Dead'.<br/><br/>Pathetic, brainless junk geared for a pathetic, brainless audience. Quit eating it up people, and Hollywood, get some original ideas. They're out there, I promise.<br/><br/>0 out of 5, and I wish I could give it less than that."

","I'll be the first to admit that the horror genre is not high on my list of favorites, so I'll freely admit I'm not as qualified to comment on 'Dawn of the Dead' as some. But I have to say the remake is just better than the original. I like the 1978 version of 'Dawn of the Dead,' and I was skeptical when I first heard about the remake to the point of being dismissive about it. But the effects were better, the sequences tighter, and the sense that the characters were really fighting for their lives much more immediate. The first ten minutes alone are more intense than anything that happens in the original (I know, I know, but, by comparison, the opening moment of the 1978 film are a disorienting, absurdly gory, muddled mess). I also know that the movie breaks a cardinal rule of the zombie film by allowing the zombies the ability to move quickly, but it really only helps the movie. Frankly, I think it's a lot scarier to have a raving thing come at you at top speed rather than just kind of lumber.

","The 1996 Video Game of ""Resident Evil"" 1 for PS 1 was the game that saved CAPCOM and put the Zombie theme back into fashion again. Unfortunately, this game was too difficult to survive and a few follow uppers were created as result. <br/><br/>Inspired also by the films from the late sixties to early nineties this game was solid and scary. The game plot was simple. A police officer in trouble, short of ammo, chased by zombies, inside a mansion and outside in the city. It was perfect.<br/><br/>One of the main inspirations was George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead (1978)""<br/><br/>2002, Paul W.S. Anderson directed an American film named after the game: Resident Evil (2002) This film had a great commercial budget and created anticipation in every individual that had survived the game.<br/><br/>This film was a disaster in every and each way. incomparable with the original even though many didn't think a film based on a game could get much better. (Short skirts, lousy actors and a completely confused director with a corrupt cause.) Not even the untalented Milla Jovovich's ""sexual"" outfit and the computerized film effects could save the day. <br/><br/>Only an experienced player and devoted fan to the classics could understand this exploitation.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) was a later film starring the same Milla Jovovich working/flirting with another director (Alexander Witt) But the script was still written by Paul W.S. Anderson. This film was better that the first but still lacked substance.<br/><br/>One of the reactions of this incompetence became a masterwork and probably the best horror film of this decade. <br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead (2004) (Zack Snyder) is the modern remake/screenplay of the Dawn of the Dead (1978). And it does not go back to Resident evil but to the source of resident evil's inspiration (Dawn of the dead). Through this, middle hands were reduced and with the help of their creativity and knowledge in psychology this team succeeded in creating a film that make Paul W.S. Anderson Resident evils loose face. And after that, I think Milla Jovovich can stick to something else.<br/><br/>If you like resident evil, this is the movie to watch.

This movie got everything wrong that I could possibly imagine except camera work and special effects, including plenty of gore like you should expect.<br/><br/>LOADS OF SPOILERS ARE FOLLOWING... BEWARE!<br/><br/>The characters are a bunch of every type in the book. You got the black cop leading the pack with matching lines. You got a jerk who introduces himself as one and stays one till he dies as a zombie (with a smile on the heroine's face, of course) and a more ruthless jerk (being an armed security guy) who does a complete character flip-flop for no obvious reason - if you don't count the fascination about the sudden topic of the hour: TRUST You got a romance without a chance (another twist you can see coming from a mile away) between a nurse-turned-heroine and a TV-salesman keeping the cool head among them and a baby being born from a zombie in a situation that's both stupid and a rip-off from several movies at once.<br/><br/>Most of the scares - or non-scares - are obvious. This could vary if you didn't watch many horror movies. The movie takes away the scare-factor by mocking various other flicks and itself. But this is not supposed to be a parody, is it? You can even guess quite a few dialog lines, mostly involving CJ who is nice as soon as he notices that there's another one who can play the I'm-a-dick part, therefore he creates comic relief instead. This movie is more action than horror, after all. The last part turns into a shoot-out and barbecue. By now nothing could scare you, anyway. The chainsaw reduces the survivors to our chosen few. The ending is surprising, as usual.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's a bad movie that just looks good. It started well and got worse from there.

Then, to add insult to injury, there's a BLAIR WITCH rip off over the end credits. Despite that, the movie does have its merits, albeit few.<br/><br/>The opening scenes are great, then it's a sketchy ride the rest of the way.

This one doesn't. It takes the most threadbare elements of the original movie's story and stretches them out to ninety minutes. The rich characterizations and witty screenplay are absent here. The script is clich√©d and one-note and the characters are the most one-dimensional I can recall seeing in a movie in years.<br/><br/>James Gunn is obviously a talented writer. He wrote Troma's best movie (TROMEO AND JULIET) and obviously is capable of writing that is far more interesting and challenging than this.

"Weava","10","1","2","14 April 2004"," School report about this wonderful film
","Dawn of the Dead was recreated just a few short weeks ago. The original screenplay, written by George A. Romero, was combined with the one written more recently by James Gunn. I think Gunn did a wonderful job keeping the original story intact while adding a bit of humor and his own style to the movie. The movie was directed by Zack Snyder and produced by Eric Newman, Marc Abraham, and Richard Rubinstein. It was done by Universal studios and was released in March 2004. The movie is rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality. The leading actors were well chosen in my opinion, and include Sarah Polley as the lead actress and Ving Rhames and Jake weber as leading actors. I think this movie fits in well with Romero's former films. Although it has a bit more humor to it, it still retains the original gore and horror. This movie will shock you at some points, and have you giggling at others. It's a wonderful remake of a wonderful movie. The plot can simply be summarized as `zombies are killing EVERYONE,' which is to be expected when seeing a Romero film. It starts out in a small town, showing the havoc that this new virus is reeking. No one is sure exactly what is going on, but the only sure thing is to watch your back at all times. People are on a rampage, killing and eating everyone in site. One woman runs into a cop, who lets her tag along with him. They soon find 3 more folks who are heading to the mall. As anyone who has seen the original will know, this is where the bulk of the movie will take place. The long series of scenes at the mall are very different. Some are humorous, while others are violent and gory. The movie rolls onward as the plan their escape from the mall, and they venture outward. The acting was very well done. I very much enjoyed how Ana, or Sarah Polley, didn't act like most women in zombie movies. She took situations head on, and didn't scream and whine about what was occurring. Kenneth, or Ving Rhames, was a very good team `badass.' He made sure stuff was done right. Michael, or Jake Weber, added a sense of romance, while still adding to the comedic value of some scenes. As in the original `Night of the Living Dead,' we are given someone to hate. We hated `Cooper' in that one and we definitely hate, or love, Steve in this movie. He did a great job of p***ing everyone off and saving his own ass in all situations. All things considered, I think the cast did a great job of recreating this masterpiece. Several camera angles were used throughout the movie to show that a surprise was coming. You see someone go to a door and slowly open it, showing a close-up of the person of the door handle, only to find a zombie jump out at them. The slowed down movement lets you know something is going to happen, but it always scares you when it does. I don't understand why, but this technique seems to always do its job. One technique which has been widely used lately, was the combining of comedy with horror. This movie however, I believe utilizes this technique to the fullest. `Scary Movie' for example, completely got rid of the horror while adding a large amount of comedy. This was somewhat of a letdown as it turned from horror spoof, into `stupid teen comedy.' `Dawn of the Dead' added comedy amidst the horror, but only at appropriate times. At times where there was a break in the action, or times when you would least expect it, the writers through in a joke, or ironic situation to keep the viewers laughing and scared at the same time. The production techniques used and many of the camera angles added to the already wonderful story in the film. I've read before that there was symbolism behind the mall itself. The original was put out at a time when malls were beginning to gain popularity. People were flocking to malls to get `whatever they wanted' in one place. So these people, in a time of terror, go to the mall. Some believe Romero was mocking the population in some respects, since these people did not spend all their time trying to better their situation, but used much of it just getting `whatever they wanted. This time however it was free, and it showed the greed of humans. Greed, or in this case selfishness, can lead to stupid situations. One man ties his dead, now `zombified,' wife to a bed in an attempt to bring his unborn child into the world. He knows the pain and suffering he is putting his wife through, but continues to do it. His situation does not, however, end up exactly as planned. This is another way Romero and Gunn could be mocking the population. I think the underlying theme behind much of this movie is that humans are stupid, greedy, and self centered. I would give this movie a 10/10, had it been filmed in Monroeville Mall. (Since I am from Pittsburgh) However, I will still give it a 9/10. I highly suggest seeing it, but not until you see the original. I would also suggest seeing the original Dawn of the dead, Day of the dead, Night of the Living dead, and Return of the dead, although Return is not a Romero film. I would also urge you to go see this movie now. Don't wait for it to come out on video, as it is one of my favorite movies of late. The humor adds so much to this wonderful classic, which can appeal to any audience, young or old."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Ok, I admit right now to not being an enourmous horror fan. I haven't seen the original ""Dawn Of The Dead"" and to be honest, unless it's placed infront of me, odds are I won't ever go out and make an effort either. Never the less, I went to see this movie, and I quite enjoyed it, even if I couldn't take it all too seriously.<br/><br/>In ""Dawn Of The Dead"", the dead literally rise. We could discuss why and how until our faces turned blue and we died ourselves, but why bother? Ultimately the point is that we follow the story of a couple of key characters who attempt to survive this zombie invasion and move somewhere safe. There's blood, there's gore, there's some hilarious moments, there's some lame moments. Basically, this is just another modern horror movie.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that it's hard to see how it was meant to be made. If the creators meant to create a serious movie with terrifying moments, then they have failed. If however they've just tried to create a regular style of horror movie with a sort of tongue in cheek moment, then they've acted spot on. This movie is there to be enjoyed, and it's there to be taken seriously. It does have an element of nerve to it, but only in that it makes you wary and looking over your shoulder occasionally for the rest of the day. In itself however, there is very little of horror and most jumps come in brief shock moments.<br/><br/>I never know what to say about horror movies really. I either like them or hate them, but it's rare for them to make me scared (simply because it's often easier to laugh something off and discard it as fictional). ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is no exception really. It's not a really terrifying horror movie, but that doesn't stop it from being very entertaining. It starts well, it features the occasional moment of cheese (the American flag at one point, the romance element, etc), and it's conclusion is fun (if slightly predictable). All in all, it's hard to fault really. The key is to go into the cinema, put your feet up, and try not to take it seriously."

"skingfan","10","1","2","28 March 2004"," Finally a truly enjoyable horror movie!!
","In 1968, a young director by the name of George Romero filmed an inexpensive horror movie that would later be hailed by movie critics the world round as a cult classic (and for good reason!) That movie was, of course, the black-and-white zombie flick, Night of the Living Dead.  I have seen the remake and it was truly enjoyable.  Now, as a rule, I tend to find re-makes unneccessary for the most part; the original films are usually classics and a re-make often lacks the same texture and feeling that the original had. There are very few exceptions, of course, and Dawn of the Dead is one of them.  First of all, let's face the facts about horror movies: most of the ones that have come out in the last year or two have, quite frankly, been nothing short of horrible, i.e. They, 13 Ghosts, The House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Wrong Turn, Cabin Fever and let's not forget the god-awful, pathetic excuse for a horror movie, Darkness Falls (if you haven't seen it yet, PLEASE spare yourself the misery and skip it...trust me, you're NOT missing anything...and if you have seen it, my deepest condolences for the time wasted watching it). There have also been some really good ones, most notably The Ring and Freddy Vs Jason (admittedly, it's really more of just a guilty pleasure for us NOES and FT13th fans)...I haven't seen the remake of Texas Chainsaw Masacre, but I've heard it's good so I'll rent it this Tuesday.  But I'm straying from the point here. Dawn of the Dead starts off right away with a sense that things are about to go wrong, or already have. The pace is very even, very fluid and certainly doesn't leave you waiting for the movie to get to the point.  It's effectively creepy, gory and scary as hell in all the right places and ways: what if you literally woke up one morning and discovered that the world you knew so well was changed forever? That the people you know and love are not only dead, but also part of the teeming thousands of walking, flesh-eating zombies on the hunt for blood? You actually care about the characters in here and fear that one of them will get left behind only to become lunch for the hungry dead.  **Possible Spoiler** Another thing I liked was the ending: unlike the low-key 28 Days Later, this movie's ending is much creepier, and without the happy-go-lucky ""everything turned out okay and they lived happily ever after"" kind of ending that 28 Days Later tried to offer us.  Plus, the zombies in here are really creepy, thanks to George Romero's famous touch.  Trust me, this one's worth seeing!!"

","I am a huge fan of the original Dawn Of The Dead to the point where i am obsessed with it, i probably watch the film at least once or twice a month and upon hearing about this ""remake""(which i thought it was going to be), i was screaming bloody murder and then even more rage was poured into me by the realisation that the person responsible for scripting the Scooby Doo film had written it.<br/><br/>But then i read a script review on Ain't It Cool News and was surprised to learn that Moriarty(i am sure it was him if my memory serves me correctly) of all people loved the script and it was only then that it dawned on me that this wasn't to be a remake but a totally different film.<br/><br/>Then the next thing was the teaser trailer and from what i saw, the zombies were running after people and the film looked like a bit of an event picture, where the events outside the houses and malls were being reported and the world was literally falling apart in front of our very eyes...and so i became very very very excited about this new film indeed.<br/><br/>And so i waited in anticipation and finally got to see it yesterday....<br/><br/>And what can i say?, i want to see it again immediately!<br/><br/>I didn't see much things to compare with the original, the only similarities are the shopping mall and the title of the film.<br/><br/>There are, however, many other films that i could reference better than the original Dawn Of The Dead - 28 Days Later(infected people sprinting after people and murdering them), Assault On Precinct 13(survivors barricading themselves inside a building while being threatened by whats outside), Aliens(that sewer scene with the zombies reminded a lot of the air duct scene in Aliens), Brain Dead(erm, the zombie baby?) and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers to name but a few but i loved the fact that this wasn't a direct homage to what George Romero did with his original film, James Gunn has put his very own spin on it and come up with something more modern and something more highly-charged and thrilling.<br/><br/>Romero's film is a lot more grim and grimy in both style and content whereas this one is a lot more flashy and thrilling, Gunn's script really delves more into the zombie threat being a global catastrophe and it was great to see more of that in this film with the budget Zack Synder had at his disposal. Literally we see the world falling apart within minutes and people going into a state of panic, chaos and destruction is everywhere and we are just as dazed and confused as the people in the film because it is never explained as to why people have become infected with a disease that makes people become bloodthirsty maniacs that want to bite a chunk out of your windpipe.<br/><br/>There are some strong noteworthy performances in this film. Ving Rhames, Michael Kelly, Sarah Polley and Jake Weber are all superb in this film although i felt Mekhi Phifer wasn't in it enough and i felt his character didn't develop enough. It was predictable who was going to die and who was going to escape the mall but at no point did i feel that the acting was poor or the storyline was slipping away, i felt that Gunn has given us a film that is pure visceral adrenaline-pumping horror from the word go.<br/><br/>From the opening moments, Gunn's script captures that Romero spirit of a creeping fear or dread that something bad has happened and that its going to change our world forever and bring such an immense amount irrepairable damage along with it, and the minute Sarah Polley steps out of her house after her life has been torn apart, we see the world outside has changed to such a crushing apocalyptic effect. The world has gone insane, neighbours are brandishing guns and threatening other neighbours, family members are killing one another and cars are speeding desperately down the roads fleeing the horror thats just hit the world.<br/><br/>And it never lets up for a second, we know these characters aren't safe from the threat outside, every situation they're in has a sense of dangerous desperation about it and we're shocked and scared at what they have to do just to stay alive.<br/><br/>A few noteworthy things for me was the emotional storylines within Gunn's script, i felt saddened for Matt Frewer's character and his daughter where a bite on his arm calls for his immediate execution and his acceptance of his fate to save his daughter's life and the people who can help save her's lives is quite a heartbreaking moment.<br/><br/>I also thought Mekhi Phifer's character trying to come to terms with keeping his baby alive and trying to save his infected girlfriend from a similar execution was perhaps the most disturbing thing about the movie but his obsession with keeping life going for himself and for the love of his girlfriend was also a moment where i felt could've come straight out of one of Romero's films...if he had thought of it.<br/><br/>As for the zombies themselves...well, they're not really zombies per se, these are more like the Infected in 28 Days Later. They sprint after people like Ben Johnson on an elephant's sized dosage of steroids and are far more lethal than the sluggish zombies depicted in Romero's movie and this is what makes Snyder's movie more fast-moving and makes the characters more nerve-struck and edgy and probably more unpredictable and dangerous.<br/><br/>Whereas in Romero's original, the fact that the zombies in it were so slow and sluggish in movement, the situation in that mall and outside could be somewhat controlled, the situation in this movie seems uncontrollable and far more potentially desperate and dangerous because of the crazedness and speed of the infected zombies and i felt this was something that made the film far more interesting, the need to stay alive involved more desperately insane life-or-death situations.<br/><br/>However, there wasn't much room for humour or gore as it was so fast-moving, two attributes that are something very much evident in Romero's work, there were no custard pie in zombies faces scenes or zombies' heads being lopped off by the whirring rotor blades of a helicopter, there wasn't any zombies dressed as nurses or Hare Krishnas either but one of the funniest scenes in this one involved the characters inside the mall standing on top of the roof holding cards up to Andy, a character who had barricaded himself on top of the roof above his gun store, to tell him to shoot zombies who look liked celebrities i.e Jay Leno, Burt Reynolds etc<br/><br/>Andy is another character we feel some emotion for, Ving Rhames' character begins to develop a friendship for him as they hold up cards to one another to communicate with each other from building to building, and then when Andy tells him he is hungry we realise that the friendship between the two of them isn't going to last much longer and that the situation in the world is going to become hopeless, bleak and desperate again.<br/><br/>I'm trying to be as ambivalent with this review of the film as possible so not to spoil anything at all for anyone wanting to see this film, its a movie i'd rather leave people to judge by themselves and the only thing i can say to anyone going to see this movie is to not compare it in any way to the original George A. Romero masterpiece.<br/><br/>I could never understand why purists are comparing it anyway or making disparaging remarks about this movie existing, the original film hasn't been erased from memory, it is still readily available on VHS and DVD so the existence of this movie isn't going to cancel out the original nor is it going to replace it in the history books, basically all this version of Dawn Of The Dead is pure adrenalised horror with plenty of shocks and plenty of action and plenty of blood and great setpieces.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of things talked about the ending to this film, which i actually liked but what i felt was somewhat missing from some of Romero's films. I remember the original Dawn Of The Dead script had a different ending where Ken Foree did commit suicide and where Gaylen Ross' character also committed suicide by thrusting her body into the rotor blades of the helicopter and the last thing we would've saw had that ending been left in and filmed would've been the zombies feasting on her body and Ken Foree's, thus leaving a sense of shock and dread to us all...which is something i think James Gunn and Zack Snyder have tried to do here and its one of those moments where you've gone on this huge emotional rollercoaster with these people and suddenly the bloodsoaked carpet has been pulled from under your feet...lets just say that there won't be a sequel or a Dawn Of The Dead 2 - Mid-Morning Brunch Of The Living Dead or whatever.<br/><br/>If i have to mark this movie out of 10, i will give it a 9, it ups the ante where 28 Days Later is concerned and broadens the spectrum of the original Dawn Of The Dead to looking more like the globalised catastrophe some of the emergency channel news reports alluded to in that film and shows it all in living(and living dead) colour through news reports and various setpieces through the film and i think Gunn and Synder have managed to pull off that apocalyptic feel to the movie perfectly. Very impressive indeed.<br/><br/>What can i add other than all i have said?...just don't view it as a remake because it isn't a shot-by-shot remake nor is it a homage to Romero's film, its a different film with a different story by a totally different director. If you watch the film with that in mind, you will like it as much as i did.<br/><br/>Hope this review has been helpful and i would be welcome to read any of your comments in future, thanks for your time and patience if you've read my words and hope you enjoy the film as much as i did."
"AndyVanScoyoc","4","1","2","22 March 2004"," What a vast disappointment ****Spoilers!!!****
","I hardly know where to begin with this movie. I will start off by saying that I *did* go in to see this film with a completely open mind and will in no way compare this ""Dawn"" to the original ""Dawn."" I will simply state what I felt was a real letdown about this movie.<br/><br/>While the direction and the characters were very well done, the plot and the logic for some of the scenes left much to be desired. <br/><br/>I will start with the flashes of world outbreaks of violence and other such scenes at the beginning. If this was supposed to signify the spread of the virus, (a stretch) then they needed to obtain other film that was either a little more vague or produce their own as inexpensively as possible. As it was, what they showed looked like a typical night on CNN.<br/><br/>Now, about the movie itself...the first thing that I found vastly disturbing about this movie is the ""I don't know factor."" While in the first ""Dawn of the Dead"" (which in my opinion was one of the best horror movies ever made) didn't give you a clear reason as to *why* the dead were getting up and walking, this ""Dawn"" did a much larger injustice to the viewer by touching on what could have been construed as a reason for the virus, but not elaborating. The movie begins in a hospital with a doctor and nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) talking about a patient with a virus. When the nurse goes to find the patient later, he is in ICU, with no clear reason as to why, when he wasn't in serious condition when he was brought in. Then she simply leaves the hospital and that is that. Nothing more. Did this patient start the virus? <br/><br/>The next thing that I found totally disappointing was the in-continuity of the dying. As with all zombie movies, if you are bit, you die, it is just a matter of time.<br/><br/>Now, the first woman who is brought to the mall after the people show up in the panel truck, she had been bitten (no clear time is given, could have been days, could have been hours, I am *assuming* hours) and she was dying. She died, came back, etc. Now, later on in the movie, Andy (the character that Ving Rhames befriends who is on top of his gun shop a ways away from the mall, and they ""talk"" via binoculars, and reading boards that they write messages on) gets bitten while trying to get something to eat and in mere minutes he is dead! Is this supposed to reflect the virus becoming more serious and stronger than it was originally? Maybe, but once again, that is a *big* stretch to ask the movie viewer to make when the writers gave no indication of such a progression. Now, the pregnant lady with the bite that looked more like a scratch and it took days and possibly a week(once again, no time line is readily established) for her to die, that made sense, as she didn't have a ""bite"" mark, it was more like a deep gash made by a tooth. <br/><br/>Now, as for the rest of the movie and either the editors', the writers' or the director's short sightedness, I will touch upon that here. <br/><br/>Now, to start...when the movie begins, the neighbor girl, Vivian comes into the house owned by Ana and her husband, as she and Ana are obviously friends...but *how* did she get into their house? It was the next morning, and Ana and her husband were asleep in their beds! When you see the door later, there is no obvious sign of trauma to it, meaning that Vivian walked right in. I don't think so.<br/><br/>Now, on to the next scene. Vivian kills Ana's husband and he dies, then comes back and goes after Ana. She gets out of the house and goes to her car, where her dead husband proceeds to jump on the hood and nearly put his hand through the windshield of the car. OK, if *he* by himself was able to nearly break through Ana's windshield, then why couldn't an entire host of the undead break through people's doors, yet it seemed like none were. People *seemed* to be safe in their houses. That was never made clear either. <br/><br/>Next is Andy, the poor gun shop owner, who while is one hell of a shot, he takes no provisions to his rooftop with him. Now, growing up around guns, hunting and being quite a shot myself, I can tell you that owning a gun shop in times of the undead walking would be quite handy but...there are things in gun shops, that not all, but *most* gun shops carry, that are not just guns. Most gun shops cater to hunters in one form or another, carrying *some* camping supplies and MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat)or protein bars at the very least. I have grown up around enough hunters to know, that when you are watching for that perfect buck, while sitting 20 feet up in a tree, you are not going to jump down and take time to hit McDonalds for a burger and fries. Now, why Andy didn't have *some* foodstuffs is beyond me. He nearly starves to death on top of a roof and then dies anyway while trying to get food.<br/><br/>Now as for the end of the movie...does everyone die or not? I watched and watched and absolutely could not figure out if everyone dies or if they are still trying to get the zombies away from them so they can get back to the boat and get away. Top that off with the unnecessary tit shots (not just guys watch horror movies you know?) and I just think that this movie could have been so much more than it was."
"TheAverageAtBestHulk","6","1","2","21 March 2004"," Dawn of the average film...
","I had insanely high hopes for this movie when I first saw the trailer a month and a half ago.  I don't know exactly what I expected, but I think I expected to much.<br/><br/>In one of the first scenes, we see a girl skating away into the sunset, we know trouble lurks ahead.  That's fine and dandy, foresight, it's all good, but this movie ends up being so predictable in every scene to the point where it is boring.  Granted, we do get a few good surprises, but every time someone goes off alone, you know a zombie will be somewhere waiting. Every time you see a fail safe plan put in by the actors, you can almost forsee it verbatim, and that's what horror is not about.  At least not to me.  Maybe I was expecting an Evil Dead quality film.<br/><br/>But i'm not all dissatisfied, you see.  The movie has style, humor and an overall feeling of hopelessness.  The zombies look great and the special effects aren't bad.  The actors, while convieniently labeled personality wise (or not developed at all) do a good, convincing job.  I would recommend this to a horror fan in a second.  But if your looking for the feeling that famous trailer gave you, you might want to go elsewhere.<br/><br/>Also, Johnny Cash, and Richard Cheese, the people who put this movie together have good taste in music."
"DarkDavis","9","1","2","20 March 2004"," A great film, regardless of it's predecessor
","Many people are giving this film low scores based simply on the fact that it's based off one of the best zombie films of all time.  I say they're morons.  Drop the Romero-elitist attitudes and recognize this film as a separate entity that deserves an unbiased and objective review, just like any other film.<br/><br/>Now that I've said that, I'd like to say that this movie was simply awesome. This was one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, and also a fantastic horror/action film in general.  I loved ""28 Days Later"" moreso than most, but this film blows it out of the water.  The movie sucks you right in from the very beginning.  The directing, costume/makeup and camera work is downright phenomenal for this genre.  All too often with past zombie flicks I've found myself less than pleased with the way shots were done, the way action was communicated and even the appearance of the zombies.  Not so in Dawn of the Dead.<br/><br/>Character development is good and not overdone.  By that, I mean you learn enough about the characters to really relate to them, but you're left with enough room to imagine yourself in the same situation and develop your own view of each of the characters, instead of sitting there watching long close-ups and inner-thought dialogs wondering what the hell is going on in the character's head while the writer futilely tries to communicate some deep emotion.  This is a zombie movie, we're not here to ponder sentiment, we're here to be flung head-first into the dark, frightening, hopeless experience of Hell on Earth, and that's exactly what has been delivered with ""Dawn of the Dead"".<br/><br/>I gave this film a 9/10.  It's my new favorite horror movie of all time (the former being Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"").  You will get the crap scared out of you, and if you like horror movies at all, you will love every second of this one. :)"
"delicate_divinity","10","1","2","19 March 2004"," One of the best zombie movies I have seen yet..
","Wow!  This movie was really great!  After hearing that Dawn of the Dead was going to be remade, I thought that it was a great idea because the original was also good, but it needed some revamping here and there.<br/><br/>I checked out the official site for the remake a few weeks ago and the trailers intrigued me, including the ones I watched on television.  And after finally seeing the movie this afternoon, I have no regrets.  This movie will surely make you crap your pants, especially if you watch it in the theatres.  I have to admit half of the time I was holding my hands over my ears, but it didn't keep the movie from scaring the living hell out of me.<br/><br/>The introduction was awesome, it starts out just showing the life of an average Mom and then it ends with her waking up to a nightmare.  Even the opening credits will frighten you in a sense, since it is packed with disturbing images and clips.<br/><br/>This movie just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and there were countless times where everyone else in the theatres along with me screamed and gasped from some of the zombie moments. The bad sides were there were a few unnecessary sex scenes which I don't mind, but I found them to be totally out of subject with the plot.  Eh, that's the kind of stuff that's in most good horror movies anyway. Nothing like a good ol' slash of sex and gore to disturb your audience even more.<br/><br/>A 9/10!  I'm definitely planning to get the dvd when it comes out...  But for those who haven't seen it yet, you MUST watch this in the movie theatres when you can; the experience just won't be the same if the first time you watch it is on a dvd!"
"bchrisv","5","1","2","19 March 2004"," terribly mediocre zombie movie
","Since i havent seen the original I have no comparative basis for which to base this review on.  I can say what Dawn of the Dead was an OK zombie movie.  If you are looking for a plot line, go somewhere else, because this movie offers none whatsoever. If you are bitten, you die, then become undead, simple as that.  The opening scene was probably the best part of the movie, offering a very chilling experience.  Unfortunately after the opening scene, the movie goes downhill and feels very drawn out with almost no action between the beggining and the end.  The movie just feels overall like old material and cliche.  If you have seen 28 days later, this movie doesnt seem very different. Overall I would give this movie a 5, maybe better because they shoot Burt Reynolds."
"scubadawg91","8","1","2","20 March 2004"," Not as thoughtful as the original
","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>First off, I really liked this movie.  It lacked the expected 10 or so minutes of extreme gore (""feastings"") that is in evidence in all the Romero films, and I think it was better for it.<br/><br/>I did see a couple of inconsistencies and they always gnaw at me (no pun intended!).  At the end, as they leave the marina on the sailboat, you can see an island off in the distance.  Anyone with a sense of geography for Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee area should know there are NO islands there (you'd have to travel some distance up the coast to find some, and they're certainly not visible from anywhere near there).<br/><br/>Lastly, as the owner of a 28' sailboat myself, there were a couple things I thought weren't particularly realistic.  First, the size of sailboat (I'm estimating 35'-40') should have a fuel tank of 30-35 gallons.  Half a tank of diesel (sailboats burn fuel VERY slowly) would give a range of 100+ miles.  Secondly, it is a SAILBOAT.  Being out of fuel isn't the end of the line....  Also, boats that size have dingies.<br/><br/>Finally, I believe they were looking for an ""unihabited"" island.  There are a few small population islands further north (Mackinaw Island comes to mind) that would be a better destination and would require some ""work"" (killing of zombies) to clear but would be a good long-term home....<br/><br/>Just my thoughts, but I welcome your thoughts/comments!"

"w00f","8","1","2","20 March 2004"," Happy Fun Zombie Movie (complete with HAPPY FUN SPOILERS)
","I held off seeing this movie until several hours after it opened.  That's an accomplishment for me, because I LOVE zombie movies.  Given a choice, I'd rather watch flesh-eating walking dead menace the populace than just about anything else.<br/><br/>And this loose remake of the 1978 classic is, indeed, a typical zombie movie... which shouldn't be too surprising, since Romero's ""Living Dead"" films set the standard for zombie horror for two generations now.<br/><br/>But this is not George Romero.  Zack Snyder does a good job retooling and directing this fine piece of gore cinema, but anyone expecting to see a Romero movie isn't going to be happy.  Snyder hasn't set out to duplicate the original; he grabs lots of of elements from it, but he twists them around to suit the purposes of an audience that's far more jaded than those who saw Romero's sequel.<br/><br/>The zombies in Snyder's vision of the apocalypse as experience from the inside of a shopping mall aren't slow, lumbering creatures.  They move just as fast as the living, in fact... and they don't get tired.  They're quick and relentless, and there's no sense of the kind of vulnerability that was inherent in Romero's stiff, ready-to-fall-down anyhow undead.  These things can take you by surprise and hit you before you know what's happening.<br/><br/>Unlike the 1978 film, wherein the characters were determined to hole up in the mall for as long as possible, the consensus among most of those in the new version is that they don't want to die in a place filled with muzak and timed lighting.  In fact, the only character who wants to stay put also turns out to be the most self-centered of the bunch, and perhaps that's Snyder's message in this film (if there is one); it's better to die than be a slave to the artificial consumer world.  In Romero's movie, the dead were drawn to the mall out of habituation; in Snyder's, it's the living that go there for no particularly good reason and soon realize that they can't stay. The dead only come when they figure out that there are living people already there.<br/><br/>There are some excellent scenes and effects in this film.  Paramount is a scene of an exploding propane tank among a huge crowd of zombies.  The scene is shot from above and is at once both immaculately beautiful and horrible. We're also treated to the birth of an undead baby in this one, a bit of zombie possibility that has been utterly ignored by film makers outside of the much underrated ""Dead Alive"" (aka ""Braindead"").<br/><br/>This is NOT the most gory zombie film ever - not by a long shot.  It may have been before it was cut to get an R rating, but there have definitely been more blood-soaked zombie flicks.  On the other hand, this movie does manage to be suspenseful at times, especially during the initial set-up. The make-up effects are excellent, and there are certainly scenes in this one where even a jaded flesh-muncher watcher will find his/herself sliding down on their seat and bracing for impact.  That's not to say it takes a lot of cheap shots; it doesn't engage in a lot of hand-on-the-shoulder kind of behavior.  Nor is there much subtlety here.  You know what the zombies want.<br/><br/>This is not Academy Award material.  The acting is good but not great. Zombie fans will enjoy this; non-zombie fans (and I dare say most movie critics) will discard it out of hand.  No big surprise there.  ""Dawn of the Dead, the Remake"" delivers what it promises, and what it promises is a good time for people who think that the walking dead make for a good time.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is... unusual.  There is, of course, the Muzak in the mall, and hearing the bland, banal tones of ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" and ""You Light Up My Life"" playing over the end of the world is a nice touch.  There's also a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek, lounge lizard version of ""Get Down With the Sickness"" that's bound to crack a few smiles in the audience.  As if to highlight the films post-punk, anti-consumer culture mentality, it closes with Jim Carroll's ""People Who Died,"" one of my personal 1980's punk anthems.<br/><br/>A quick hint to fellow zombie lovers: DO NOT LEAVE THE THEATER WHEN THE CREDITS START ROLLING.  This movie has a false ending; you don't see the real ending unless you sit through the credits.  Plus, if you leave too soon, you'll miss lots of gratuitous close-up zombie shots!<br/><br/>This is a Happy Fun Zombie Movie for Happy Fun Zombie People.  If you want to see things coming back from the dead but aren't the kind of person who wants to sit through ""The Passion of the Christ"" (to which this film makes a timely and happily-received counterpoint for some of us!), this is THE flick for you!"

","And now, a clinical dissection of many critic's most common beefs with this film.<br/><br/>These Zombies are fast ¬ñ That also makes them scary; a Romeroesque zombie poses little threat to anybody with a sledgehammer, and actually might be fun to deal with if you've got a twelve gauge, .o6, etc and a good back-up man. Don't believe me? ¬ñ Watch `Night' or `Dawn', the characters themselves are laughing it up in multiple sequences. That slow zombies could overwhelm the combined might of America's hunters, police, military, and tool sheds never made any real sense. I dare you to tell me different.<br/><br/>I miss the `subtle attack on American consumerism!' ¬ñ well rub the sleep out of your eyes and put away your Movie Guide books; first and foremost it wasn't that subtle, it wasn't really even that clever given that 75% of the original dawn took place in a mall. What were they suppose to allude to, the vast wasted space that are America's parking lots? Besides its been replaced successfully with a reinforcement of iron class structure ¬ñ but I won't bore you with a neo-Marxist rant, you can connect those dots.<br/><br/>This wasn't anywhere near as scary as the original ¬ñDid you even see the original? Sure it was gory, but scary? What part of the pie fight was the scariest for you?<br/><br/>Too many characters and no development ¬ñ Well again, just tell me the top three things that pop into your mind about the original fab four. Not to knock the original script, but characterization was not its strong suit, the characters were nearly interchangeable. Here we get to see a true spectrum of human reaction to overwhelming tragedy. I felt for these characters, I could write a mini bio for each of them ¬ñ compared to the original, I could say Roger was the white cop, what else could you add? <br/><br/>In short, I found this a brilliant and captivating re-visioning and hope it leads to additional films for the series. It was creepy and technically well executed. I only wish it was longer, several non-action scenes I suspect ended up on the cutting room floor. e.g. CJ gets let out of holding cell, Frank's degeneration<br/><br/>Well done<br/><br/>8/10 overall, 10/10 for Zombie horror"

Needless to say, if you have to pop out for more popcorn, you won't miss much you couldn't guess.<br/><br/>Standard horror fare, but fills the midnight movie gap well enough.<br/><br/>Takes itself a bit too seriously considering it has little new to offer other than reviving some snappy editing . . ."

In certain ways, it is an even deeper film than the original (especially with the relationship between a solitary survivor and the main group). As would be expected from a Juliard graduate, Ving Rhames is the stand out, but the supporting cast is equally as strong.<br/><br/>The effects are simple and yet effective, the zombies behave very much like other zombies (there is more of a debt to 28 Days Later than to Night of the Living Dead in terms of zombie agility), and the film is quickly plotted out.<br/><br/>I'd see the film if I were you. 7/10"

","This film was made in 2004, I'm reviewing it today six years later and you know what? It's still the best. The only film that comes close rivaling this masterpiece is Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. But when you watch the two in marathon viewing, clearly Dawn of the Dead 2004 will have the upper hand and stays in you for hours, maybe days, weeks, months and years. And to think this is Zack Snyder's directorial debut? Incredible.<br/><br/>Now what sets Dawn of the Dead 2004 apart from the past and present zombie flicks and in between, is that bold, brave and beautiful. It astonishingly mixed realism, horror, suspense, comedy, action and drama that's rarely seen for its genre, if not until its arrival. The story's straight to the point, it's pretty basic in terms of zombie apocalypse but it all comes down on how well everything else besides the story is executed. And this is where Snyder shines; you can relate to any of the characters and each are so well done so kudos too to the actors, the special effects are insanely realistic, and most of all chaos is really felt in the film, and Snyder showed amazingly how hell breaks loose when the dead walks in your neighborhood.<br/><br/>It's fast-paced, hence the comparison to 28 Days Later and a far cry to the originals. But that's what everybody likes. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a very re-watchable film (did I mention the Unrated DVD is a must- have?), you won't get tired of it easily, you'll notice subtle stuff on each viewing and even more appreciate the vastly superior cinematography seen in zombie movies genre. That too, why this is the best zombie apocalypse movie ever made."

","I just watched this movie with some friends yesterday, well, we tried to watch the movie... We got bored out of our minds by its stupidity, and turned it off after an hour... I mean, who has ever heard of a zombie that sprints, and has superhuman strength capabilities?!?! Ever since the whole ""Zombie"" idea came about, they have always been slow, with arms flailing. But no, in ""Dawn of the Dead,"" these zombies come charging, running at the same speed of a car, and can bash their heads through doors. So, after watching a little girl DOMINATE this big dude, their was about an hour, of nothing... The people, inside a mall, just chilling there. An occasional zombie will just pop out of nowhere. Then the big tough police dude wants to leave, and go find his brother, (which, my guess is saying that his brother is dead,) finally comes to his senses, and decides to stay. Then he has this conversation with big chalk board, with a dude, five roofs away. Not long after this is when we turned it off, and decided to watch something else. Overall, this movie was terrible. And to my knowledge, their is a ""Day of the Dead"" which comes right after this one, with only two survivors, then after that, ""Land of the Dead,"" which, basically, Zombies learn to use guns, and just kill off everybody... This movie was not that good at all, overall, I disliked it a lot. And, I won't even try to watch it again... So, take my advice... don't watch this, unless you are a fan of Fast Zombies, (Which is fine, just abnormal.) Yeah... hope this message portrayed my thoughts to people, because this movie is WAY OVERRATED!!!! Alright, good enough. Bye"

You watch to see who is going to live and who was going to die, but when it's over you realize you didn't care. It's difficult to make a remake, but in this case I wouldn't had said anything if the director cheated a little and took some ideas from Romero. ""28 days later"" took the thunder out of these zombies and that movie, even though the director denied it, was somewhat of a combination of Romeros' dead movies (watch ""28"" for comparison; it's not 10 times better, just better). The producers threw the equipment and experienced people to surround the new director, but it was a Freshmans' attempt.

","Dawn of the Dead is a different approach to the style of the original. Now the zombies are faster and perhaps even wiser. The major change here is that Snyder has decided to make the zombies have the capacity to run, which is a scary thought indeed. As creepy as the slow undead were there was always the chance to outmaneuver them, but things are not so simple this time around. The usual zombie trope of a bunch of characters clustered together and hiding away is how the film goes about it but it manages to characterize the survivors instead of just using them as zombie fodder. Some scenes are terrifying and there is a palpable sense of tension. This is a great horror movie and a great zombie one also. Go watch it."

We have seen this all before many times, and we are not impressed. One good thing did come out of that, though - Shaun Of The Dead, that hilarious parody film with great Simon Pegg as a lead. They parodied all the key moments of Dawn, with all those inevitable and highly predictable moments. Any redeeming feature in This flick? Maybe, the very beginning, with the family breakdown and initial panic spread out. All the rest is a yawning fest with all the hugely exaggerated scenes of cartoonish violence and long, slow talks. Watch it once, for curiosity's sake, and quickly dismiss."
"jimbo-53-186511","2","1","3","26 February 2014"," The most idiotic film I've ever seen
","I'll cut straight to the chase and openly admit that I did not like Romero's original 1978 version of this film. However, one thing I will admit is that compared to this mess Romero's original film was a 'masterpiece' (which is saying something considering I rated that film 4 out of 10). I'll attempt to explain the problems with this film one by one; <br/><br/>1) The basics; right from the start there were no scares, no tension, and no character development. Therefore, I wasn't impressed with Snyder's remake from the start, but then things went from bad to worse <br/><br/>2) Zombie infestation; once our protagonists enter the mall as a 'safe haven' (as they did in the original), we see 1 or 2 zombies attack our protagonists as presumably they've gained entry into the mall the same way that our protagonists did. Naturally, our protagonists overcome these zombies and manage to find their way upstairs where they bump into 3 security guards who reluctantly agree that they can seek refuge with them (I still wasn't overly impressed by this point, but still thought 'Well it's OK'). However, later in the film we see very little zombie attacks or infestations in the mall, what I couldn't understand is why a few zombies managed to gain entry at the start, but couldn't gain entry later? It just removed any modicum of tension that the film had originally built up. Why couldn't they get in afterwards? Had they turned the mall into Fort Knox? Completely illogical<br/><br/>3) There is another scene where our protagonists venture out into the car park and they are set upon by zombies. I thought at this point; OK, fair enough they may have been able to find their way into the car park, but then our protagonists spend considerable time modifying 2 RV's in the underground car park without any problems from the zombies. How did they manage this? Were the Zombies having 40 winks? <br/><br/>4) The signs; OMG What the hell was that all about? Initially Kenneth (Rhames) and Andy (Bruce Bohne) write notes on large boards in order to communicate with each other. What made me laugh is that over an hour into the film they send a dog across the zombie infested area between the mall and Andy's gun shop with a bag strapped around its waist with a walkie talkie in it to Andy (who owns a gun shop and is one of the only other survivors - his reason for survival is self evident). This is so that Andy and Kenneth can communicate more easily. Why did they need walkie talkies and hand written boards to communicate? Had the scriptwriters forgot that it was 2004 when this film was made? The age of the 'mobile phone' - this whole situation could have been resolved by one of them saying 'Hey Buddy, this is stupid, write your number down on the next card and I'll text you'. <br/><br/>5) Mobile phones; nobody seemed to have one. I could understand if this was meant to be set in an age before mobile phones existed, but it clearly isn't so the fact that no-one has a mobile phone makes no sense. They see a helicopter fly past which doesn't rescue them even though they have a big SOS labelled on the roof; why it never picks them up and why another helicopter wasn't sent is never explained. Surely if someone had a mobile, all they would have needed to do would be to make a 911 call and ask for a helicopter to be sent to a specified location point in order to rescue them. This is what makes this film so flawed as in 1978 when they were isolated in the mall, they really were 'isolated' as the original film was made before mobile phones were invented so this made the premise in the original film slightly more plausible. In 2004, in the age of the mobile phone it doesn't work so well.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are other problems but I feel I've made my point plus I'm in danger of exceeding the 1000 word limit if I continue much longer. I hate this film (as you'll have gathered) and the only reason I've given the film 2 stars is because of Ving Rhames' performance). Rhames managed to give some credibility to proceedings and was definitely a 'diamond in the rough' <br/><br/>In summary, this was a horrible film that makes the 'lacklustre' original look like a masterpiece. In hindsight, I now wished that I'd avoided it, but the optimist in me said 'Give it a chance'. I really wish I hadn't have bothered."

","Zack Snyder's directorial debut tackles the remake of George A. Romero's 1978 zombie classic, Dawn of the Dead. While Romero's original was a slow moving suspense filled gore fest, Snyder's version is just a gore fest. In this remake the zombies no longer shuffle about aimlessly. Now, they are feral creatures that will run at you as fast as they can, snarling horrendously the whole time. The film follows a group of people, including a nurse and a cop, as they make their way to a mall where they plan to hold up until this apocalypse blows over, or something like that. Of course, the calm and peace is short lived before hordes of the undead start making their way to the mall, forcing the survivors to find a way to escape this hellish nightmare.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder is honestly the only thing that makes this film watchable. If not for his wicked visual stylization we would be left with an utterly silly film full of characters we can't wait to watch die. This is a plot hole ridden film where the characters actions don't seem to be backed by any logic or reasoning. These moments of total stupidity range from laughably bad to frustratingly moronic that you just want to punch something. Needless to say, we would all be screwed if we wound up with these people during the zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>That being said, if you like zombies and you like copious and almost over-the-top amounts of gore then it's hard not to enjoy Dawn of the Dead. It's so intense, so brutal, and so non stop that you really sort of become enthralled in the graphic events unfolding before your eyes. If you watched Dawn of the Dead when it first came out in 2004, chances are you suspected this Zack Snyder guy to be someone worth keeping up with. And of course, he was worth keeping up with because everything he has done since this debut has been an improvement of his style and eye for sick visuals.<br/><br/>With a story that actually made sense all the way through and characters that we could actually sympathize with, Dawn of the Dead actually could have been really good. But its plot really drags it down tirelessly, and all we are left with is cool zombie action, and that isn't quite enough to save this film from being pretty bad."

The characters are easy to follow and they aren't that annoying (sometimes they are incredibly stupid like in every movie)<br/><br/>However, as you might expect it's full of different clich√©s such as the ""shaky camera"" during action where the camera shakes like the cameraman got an epileptic seizure, or the ""extremly fast fading camera"" where YOU might get an epileptic seizure.<br/><br/>And in some instances the music has to do all the dramatic acting, and on top of that the music usually spoils some surprises, in that it always gets dramatic when something dramatic is going to happen.<br/><br/>But overall it's a pretty good movie, however the original still tops it."
"primo-st","6","1","3","11 April 2011"," Does it's job, but lacks the attributes of the greats.
","For a fair review I will disregard the original completely, and focus only on the 2004 production.<br/><br/>I watched this because I felt like a zombie apocalypse movie.<br/><br/>And that is exactly what I got. The same ageless zombie formula is used in Dawn of the Dead. A group of survivors have holed up in a mall, and desperately try to survive a onslaught of mindless undead cannibals.<br/><br/>My main issue with the movie was that it doesn't really offer anything new. The survivors as in all zombie movies are a politically correct group, including African Americans,a Latino, and ample spread of women. That I have no issue with, producers don't really have a choice than to provide to a broad audience. What I had an issue with was the fact that 30 seconds after meeting each character you can literally predict their chances of survival and time of death. If your watching a horror movie, the most fun thing to do is to go 'shes gonna die next', 'hes got no hope' etc but in Dawn of the Dead, the shallow formula based characters offer 0% chance of a plot twist.<br/><br/>The acting, its okay. I didn't think any particular performance was outstanding, many being particularly weak such as Lindy Booth, whose character loses her whole family, but within days has found herself a love interest (Kevin Zegers, also a fairly poor performance) and an incomprehensible, irrational attachment to a dog.<br/><br/>What brings this movie to a 6 rather than lower was the fantastic and creative friendship through whiteboard diagrams on top of the roof of the mall with Kenneth, the heroic religious policeman (who unfortunately has an unexplained background) and'Andy' the gunstore owner stranded a mile a away. I enjoyed the comedic relief, its a nice break from movies like '28 days later', where you actually need to take a minute for recovery after every scene.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie is completely forgettable, but your attention span will be kept, and it should sate your bloodlust for a fun (and not particularly scary) zombie apocalypse movie."

","Dawn of the Dead (2004) 8/7/2010<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of the classic George A. Romero zombie movie ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a milestone in many ways. It helped launch Snyder's career and has since directed ""300"" and ""Watchmen"". ""Dawn"" is a spectacular remake, some say better that the original. It introduced us to the fast, sprinting zombies. It did however also help set in motion the trend of remaking every old horror they could dig up no matter how bad it is.<br/><br/>""Dawn"" follows in the original films foot steps, but it also blazes its own trails too. When the zombie apocalypse is upon us, a group of survivors led by a nurse (Sarah Polley) and a cop (Ving Rhames) they find solace in The Crossroads Mall. This was a big statement in the original film, about the countries growing consumerism. Barricaded in the mall and surrounded by hordes of the undead, they must figure out a way to survive and come to terms with the fact that everybody they know and love is gone. <br/><br/>""When there is no more room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth"" This is a great line spoken by a preacher, just before the station goes off the air. As with most survival horror films, this group of diverse people must learn to work together if they want to survive. The acting and character development is quite good for a horror movie. You know these people and want them to survive. As I mentioned earlier, the classic images of slow moving zombies has been given a serious makeover. These flesh eating freaks are like Olympic sprinters, making them a frightening real threat. The make up effects and CG and very well done for most part, and the gore makes it well worth the price of the unrated DVD. This movie is literally unstoppable as it continues in snippets right though the end credits.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's vision and filmmaking sense is just what this generations needs. With ""300"" being another monumental hit, he seems to have a bright, limitless career. Please, please don't be another M. Night Shyamalan."
"BA_Harrison","10","1","3","18 November 2007"," This is how remakes SHOULD be made!
","One of the few remakes of recent years that is actually worth watching, Zack Snyder's Dawn Of The Dead takes the basic plot from George Romero's 1978 original, in which survivors of a zombie outbreak barricade themselves in an abandoned mall, and strips away the social commentary whilst cranking up the action, delivering a white-knuckle ride of flesh-eating terror.<br/><br/>A nerve-shredding pre-titles sequence see Ana (Sarah Polly), a pretty nurse, narrowly escaping with her life after her neighbourhood is rapidly over-run by the living dead: nasty, snarling, nightmarish creatures that, unlike in Romero's movie, can run like the clappers. All around her, chaos is erupting as the zombies rapidly increase in numbers, and Sarah eventually loses control of her car and crashes into a tree. Cut to black. Cue titles...<br/><br/>I haven't seen such a great opening to a film since Raiders of the Lost Ark!<br/><br/>And what follows is just as intense. The remainder of the film sees Sarah team up with a tough cop (Ving Rhames), a TV salesman (Jake Weber), and a young couple expecting their first child (Mekhi Phifer and Inna Korobkina), who are travelling to the relative safety of a nearby mall. But once in the sprawling shopping centre, the group realises that zombies are not the only threat to their safety: the white trash security guards that patrol the building are not too keen on sharing their sanctuary with outsiders.<br/><br/>Very gory, and damn scary (a scene in a pitch black underground car-park being my favourite creepy moment), with characters that are developed enough for us to care about, Dawn Of The Dead is a triumph. Its narrative contains enough differences from the original to make it constantly surprising, the special effects are top notch, with truly unsettling zombies and some disgustingly realistic gore, and the cast are utterly convincing as the terrified survivors of a nightmarish apocalypse.<br/><br/>I first saw this film at a late-night screening in my local multiplex. Afterwards, nerves extremely jangled, I had to walk through a nearby shopping centre in order to get to my car, which was parked in a large and quite poorly lit car-park.<br/><br/>I'm not ashamed to say that I've never moved so fast in my life!"

She finishes her shift and goes home to her loving boyfriend who then takes a shower with her, they go to bed and are awakened by the neighbor's daughter who has been zombified.

Our woman escapes through the bathroom window and then manages to meet up with a rogue cop, and a gangsta with his pregnant (not to mention European) wife. They proceed to find shelter in a shopping mall and are apprehended by three security guards who are complete dicks and lock them up for no apparent reason. More characters proceed to flood into the mall and they're all stupid and worthless. They include an old woman, a teenager, a snobby bitch, a rich man, a priest, and a few others. I don't even remember all of them because they were so dumb. Anyway, they go through days and days of wasting supplies and arguing with each other. A few found their s at the hands of zombies (though there was one awesome scene with the gangsta and his wife, but i won't spoil it for you :)). After all the supplies seem to be used up, out heroes decide they have to find a place to go. They formulate a stupid plan and then proceed to carry it out. Oodles of gore and dismembermment later, the movie ends abruptly with an incredibly dull and obvious ending that just left you going... ""why did i waste my time?"" and ""I thought zombies were supposed to be slow."" there were some cool moments and a ONE (notice i say ONE) cool character (i won't spoil them for you), but that isn't nearly enough to redeem this movie of it's sheer pointlessness and stupidity.

The zombies are real killing machines this time and can actually run this time. This provides more than enough tense moments. For the fans of gore there is more than enough to enjoy here, also make sure to pick up the unrated director's cut for even more gore and explicit scenes.<br/><br/>Only problem is that the movie features a bit too many characters. The movie would had been better of if it had just focused on the first small group of character, formed in the beginning of the movie. Because of the many characters we lose track at times and don't ever get emotionally involved with any of the characters.

No, instead there were running zombies, who didn't even look all that dead and a stillborn zombie baby. Now that's just wrong. If I wanted to see Mekhi Pfifer deliver a stillborn baby, I would watch ER. And the fat zombie woman that was clearly a guy in a dress. There were none of the characters from the original film. Ken Foree was a preacher who said his old characters tag line, but that was it. And it looked like somebody left a light filter off of the camera. I have seen home movies with better lighting This movie should have been named ""Dawn Of 28 Days Later"". It was pure garbage."
"droopfozz","3","1","3","10 June 2005"," If you liked the original at all-stay away from this one
","One sure sign that your remake of a cult-classic and near campy 1970's horror film is bad, is that you make the film you're trying to improve upon look more like a masterpiece, and your film like unintentional spoofing. That is the case with this film, that starts out wanting to be taken seriously, and lost me quickly with a strange choice of music with The Man Comes Around by Johnny Cash during a title montage of apocalyptic footage borrowed from your local Fox affiliate.<br/><br/>This film really only has the same idea as the original, everything else is newer. This time there are more people who stay alive (and die) in a shopping mall (though much of the film is outside, taking away the claustrophobic fear of the original) while zombies, that are fast and with a virus (ala 28 Days later) eat people (not the mysterious reason in the Dead series). For those who always thought fast zombies were scarier this movie proves otherwise. Seeing a zombie run is actually funnier than scary. Perhaps that worked in 28 Days Later because it was mostly in the dark, but in daylight it doesn't work. And this film misses all of the important points of the original classic.<br/><br/>Gone is the hellishly creepy and dirge like atmosphere, and the social commentary on decadence and racial issues. Another aspect this film loses with fast zombies is that they are now killing machines, not almost sympathetic near humans that aren't all too different from us. The dialogue is just dumb, and the plot is as well. The only part I did like was the addition of a gun-store owner who is trapped on a near by roof, but they manage to mess that plot line off also. Gone also is the character development, bumped up from 4 people to about 20 or so, most of whom we never get to meet before they get eaten.<br/><br/>Unlike the original this film stays away from philosophy, and is much shorter, about half as long, as Romero's version. The action is almost boring, it's not scary, and in many ways this film is more vulgar than the original in handling death scenes. The violence and gore was extreme and unnecessary in the first, but here it's just profane. You'll see what I mean. I doubt that you can say Romero's direction was sympathetic, but it was more thoughtful than in this one. And a happy ending? Come on, it's a zombie movie! Quick List: Best Zombie Movies"

","Where's the sense of inescapable doom that made the original DAWN OF THE DEAD so compelling and disturbing? Aren't all these people trapped in this mall just a little TOO chipper and chirpy considering the fact that the world is coming to an end around them--not to mention the little matter of the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ZOMBIES MILLING AROUND IN THE STREETS OUTSIDE WAITING TO EAT THEM???<br/><br/>And just how does a dead body, on instantaneous resurrection, start running around with the perfect physical coordination of an Olympic sprinter anyway? Maybe, just MAYBE, being dead meat and all, they MIGHT, y'know, stumble and shake and shuffle and twitch a little?<br/><br/>Weakly plotted, full of poorly written, unconvincing characters, and never a tenth as scary or as memorable as the original. Seen it once, don't need to see it again."
"SmokeManmuscle","7","1","3","16 May 2005"," A bit of a disappointment
","I got this movie yesterday on a blind buy because I heard good things about it online. And while I will admit that it is better than the recent Resident Evil films, it is still lacking in some areas.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first 10-15 minutes of this film because the pacing was fast and everyone is clearly panicking. Unfortunately, the film seems to hit a wall after this.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are random and meaningless. There are however, two memorable characters. CJ, the head mall security guard, is a great character until his magical change of attitude halfway through the film. Also, the man on top of the gunshop, Andy, is the best character in the film. I felt much more empathy with him than I did with anyone in the mall, and he doesn't even have any lines except through a walkie-talkie. Furthermore, I agree that his character should be killed off, but they didn't do it as effectively as I would have liked.<br/><br/>The whole appeal from this film is clearly the gore, with even nudity making several appearances. Most of it is over the top and unnecessary. Maybe if I was 10 years younger, it would appeal to me more. As it stands, the cheesy violence is forced and gets old quickly.<br/><br/>The editing at the beginning and end of the film is tiring and annoying. Sometimes attempts at being artsy fail miserably, and this is one of them. When will directors learn that camera tricks and clich√©s don't make for a great film? <br/><br/>The best zombie film I have viewed recently is still 28 Days Later. And by no means do I think that is the best the film industry could do. Just look at the Resident Evil games. If something of that quality could be transfered to the film medium, maybe a zombie movie would exist that is infinitely watchable. Luckily, I still haven't watched the original Dawn of the Dead, and I am very much looking forward to viewing it."
"rufio_vega","3","1","3","12 May 2005"," More Flaws Than You Can Shake a Dead Limb At
","I'll make it simple. Both Snyder and Gunn managed to put together an action film with gore and flash. However, they didn't make a ZOMBIE film. They made a horror film that settles for the lowest common denominator. Sadly, this is the modern trend for nearly any horror film created by a Hollywood company (remake or original).<br/><br/>To avoid looking like a simple basher, I would like to start out by saying that the tandem did do a few interesting things. The special effects and the montage sequence at the beginning added much to the original story. I wouldn't be surprised if Romero would have loved to have added a similar montage to his original piece if he had the budget at the time to do so.<br/><br/>Sadly, that's about all they did right. Snyder quickly took away the core emotion of the original, gutted it, and filled it with stuffing. This remake is something that had much potential with such a large budget and advancement in filming techniques. However, Gunn managed to write some of the worst pieces for a ZOMBIE film. This film was written in the manner of a body-count film. The characters are introduced on screen, we don't care much for any of them, and they are quickly exterminated in the flashiest manner possible. Gunn couldn't have given a damn about his characters, and Snyder did little to help by making the Zombies doped up on meth.<br/><br/>Thus, instead of making a very character oriented film like Romero did back in the 70s, Snyder and Gunn created a plot-driven film. With such a take on a genre with more depth than any other in the horror branch of film, there's little interest left for the audience. Romero had 4 characters in his mall, and only these 4 characters had any real screen time. They bonded. They grew. The audience grows attached to the characters. These characters pushed forward the events of the film. However, Snyder managed to avoid this and go straight for the jugular. There was no character development. There was no attachment. All you had was a group of over TEN CHARACTERS on screen getting butchered one after the other. There was so much potential with the ORIGINAL group that Gunn had written into the mall at the beginning of the film, however, he opted to add more and more so he could kill them off. Character development and meaning were sacrificed, leaving a very hallow film with nothing but running corpses and explosions, and none of the creative flair Romero had written and directed.<br/><br/>Take away the ""Dawn of the Dead"" name and all you have similar to the original is the mall and Tom Savini making a cameo. You won't care for the characters or the hell they are put through, as they aren't on the screen long enough for you to attach to them. Gunn shows his amateurish writing ability (which, oddly enough, gets you far in Hollywood) with this screenplay--then again, he wrote the second Scoobydoo film, so there is little shock there. Snyder did a decent job with the weak material he was given on paper. He could have done a much better job by directing focus to a small portion of the core group so we'd grow to care for these people. However, he too fell into the pathetic Hollywood style of bang over substance and gave us a flashy action (and body-count) film with corpses on meth.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched this film, don't rush to see it. Watch the original, and await Romero's Land of the Dead this June. This is a forgettable film with an unforgettable heritage."

It is discovered that the zombies can be killed with a direct gunshot to the head. So take your shot to make 'em drop. Bloodshed and gore galore. You may rethink Hell.

","When I came across this title I said to myself OK, Romero's Dawn Of The Dead is one of the best horror movies ever, why did someone felt the need to film a remake of it? Then I saw the preview and understood one thing, it was a different movie. The only things the two have in common is that people are hiding in a mall and there are flesh eating undead creatures.<br/><br/>Notice I don't, and can't, use the word zombie because it's a known fact that zombies are slow creatures. Zombies who can run DON'T EXIST.<br/><br/>This being clarified, and the initial deception being left aside. DOTD2K4 is a good horror movie, in the sense that there is no comforting mood. At no point, past the helicopter scene, one can think of of an happy ending. And that's just perfect.<br/><br/>The good surprises come from the Director's cut DVD extras, On the news bulletin, we get to see a cleaning team in Monroeville PA, for those who didn't know, the original Dawn of the dead was shot in the Monroeville mall. There is also Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger from the original movie playing small roles. Ken as a televangelist repeats the same tag-line he gave us in the first movie : ""When there's no more room in hell..."" I give this movie a 4 not because it's that bad, but zombies don't run and I won't allow a director to play god with Satan's creatures."

","I didn't see the original 'Dawn of the Dead', so I cannot compare the two. Taken for what it is, a horror movie that defies belief, it is pretty enjoyable. Not really a good movie by most standards, it was fun to see, knowing full well that something like this couldn't really happen. The DVD has a few nice extras, including a video made by the man trapped in his gun store without food for the month that elapses during the movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. Milwaukee, normal neighborhood, Ana (Sarah Polley) and her husband wake to find the little girl in the hallway. As she charges towards them, we see a disfigured and bloody mouth, she jumps and bites Ana's husband, severing an artery in his neck, and although she, a nurse, tries to save him, he dies. But then he gets up, and attacks her. She manages to get out a bathroom window, bloody, and drives away. In the overhead camera shot we can see much turmoil, buildings burning, cars wrecking. And a televangelist explaining this is what happens with too much decadence on Earth, Hell fills up and now the dead invade us. In another telecast a government official says they have no idea what is happening or how it is being spread. It appears to be a virus, as people who are bitten by an 'undead' then die shortly and become one of them.<br/><br/>A small band of good guys including Ana, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), and Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant wife make it over to an almost vacant mall and barricade themselves inside. Security force already there don't want to share their space, but eventually are overcome and ""jailed."" The crowd finds sleeping quarters in the department stores, and plenty of food. They see the 'undead' crowd getting larger each day, and spot a man on the roof of his gun shop a block away. By binoculars and signs they communicate, they play chess, they play a game where they describe a famous person (e.g. Burt Reynolds) and the gun store owner, an expert shot, shoots that undead person through the head. That they figure out, only by putting a bullet or other object through the head of these 'undead' could they be stopped. <br/><br/>They eventually hatch a plan to make a run for it, try to get to the lake and take a boat to an island where they hope to be safe, not knowing what would happen or how long this ""phenomenon"" would go on. They fortified two mall buses, they made propane cylinder bombs, they fought their way through, some of them died, but in the end a small few of them were motoring towards the island. A DVD extra showed a telecast which showed the problem spreading all over the USA, starting in the largest cities first, so it was not confined to Milwaukee."
"MisterCellophane","10","1","3","11 January 2005"," Devastating
","This film is one of the most remarkable horror films I have even seen. Despite its origins, Dawn of the Dead 2004 never feels like ""merely"" a remake of a sequel: it feels like a totally new movie: it deserves a fresh approach, and comparisons with Romero's version are unnecessary.<br/><br/>From harrowing, uneasy beginning to the devastatingly dark ending, the film is alive with plot and pace, with dialogue that really crackles and sounds like it's coming from characters rather than a clunky expositive screenplay. This last is particularly surprising in a zombie flick: it's a genre in which the best dialogue usually comes from the zombies themselves.<br/><br/>Character development is taut but it is at least present. I especially liked Ana, the nurse who's given a split-second to realise what's going on, and she grabs the keys, and gets the hell out. CJ's transition from convincing, frustrating hard-case to team player is 100% genre, but he plays both so well that it's hard to fault. The isolated Andy cultivates a real warmth and I was just heartbroken when he meets his bitterly ironic end. Even the passive characters, the ones we just know are going to die, give us the impression that these are people we've only just met, rather than people who are waiting to die when they reach their allotted page in the screenplay. I certainly didn't want the trucker lady to die. In any case, up-against-it survival horror doesn't give much opportunity for long, complex character arcs: there isn't enough time, but the acting is so refined that the character moments always feel substantial, and we have the casting director to thank for that.<br/><br/>The gore is visceral and convincing - though a few of the scares are a little over baked, particularly the zombie childbirth, torture to watch, for sure, but not as scary as it should be because we see it coming from miles off. However, these suspense less mis-steps pale when compared to the verve of the faster scares - The parking garage chase, the little girl at the beginning, the chainsaw through Nicole's arm in the bus, and so forth. The zombies themselves are horrific: fast, crazy, determined, and with incredibly creative and individual make-up effects.<br/><br/>And the ending just destroyed me."
"JoeKarlosi","7","1","3","9 January 2005"," A good zombie movie ***
","I've always been known to trash needless ""remakes"" of films, and especially the more recent re-do's. I think it's become a celluloid disease that's really infested cinema these days and there aren't a whole lot of fresh ideas remaining, specifically in the Horror genre. Having gotten this out of the way, there are exceptions to every rule and all you die-hard Romero fans might as well get your stones ready for hurling at me right now, because I may actually like the 2004 version more than the 1978 film.<br/><br/>In all honesty, other than spending some of its time in a shopping mall there really isn't all that much direct similarity between this new DAWN and the original; hell, this movie could have been called something else entirely (NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES, 28 DAYS LATER or anything) and then it wouldn't have mattered to hardcore purists as much, because this film is very much its own animal. We all know that the real business reasoning behind using the title DAWN OF THE DEAD was to lure in the hardcore fan base. So it's best to approach this experience as just another ""end of the world""/""zombie takeover"" situation on its own terms.<br/><br/>Still, comparisons (thanks to the title) are bound to crop up. I found these ghouls to be a refreshing change from the traditional slow-moving ones; I'd be much more terrified at having a carnivorous flesh-eating cannibal hot on my ass running after me than I would one of those old fashioned crawlers who could easily get knocked to the ground by a good sneeze from my nostrils. This doesn't mean I don't retain my fondness for the more limping, arthritic type of zombie of yesteryear; it just means I thought this change was welcome and posed a greater threat. Since whatever is ailing these creatures is never explained, I also had no problems believing it could make them speedy and even roar like wildcats. Hey, at least it makes them fearsome.<br/><br/>It's been claimed that the characters in this new version are not sympathetic nor well developed, and I take serious issue with that... On the contrary -- it's the characters of the ""original"" DAWN OF THE DEAD whom I've never felt anything for. But in the 2004 film - and this is especially true regarding the favored Director's Cut - these people are exceptionally well defined and distinct from each other. There are heroes (Ving Rhames) and there are villains in this predicament (the security creep). Sweet guys and jerky guys (the dope with the boat is a perfect example of the latter). Guys you can feel sorry for (like Andy on the roof or that poor soul who has to face a crucial decision late in the fight). And no matter which version you prefer, Sarah Polley runs circles around Gaylen Ross in the Leading Lady Department.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder is no genius (after all, he still allowed inappropriate hard rock music into the soundtrack for one thing), but he's directed a pretty good thriller with an end-of-the-world feel. This is especially felt in the knockout pre-credits sequence. There are plenty of exploding heads and gore to please fans of the original yet not go into overkill mode as happened the first time. It's not perfect and it's not as horrifying as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, nor is it as uncomfortably apocalyptic as DAY OF THE DEAD ... but for all intents and purposes that are forever open for debate, it IS more fun for me than that other Romero zombie film that fits between those two."

This Dawn has its scares but I really hate cheap shots, and I get very tired of scripts in which people in new, possibly dangerous surroundings, split up (!?) to investigate individually. (say... that's been a terrific idea for decades!) Sadly, it's the whole cast is filled with dumb characters. A girl who traverses a crowd of thousands of zombies to save a dog. Sarah Polly witnesses how fast her husband transforms but can't figure out the bite is the problem? What's up with depicting the playboy as a snide gay guy? They're two different things! I never believed he liked chicks for minute. Just kill them all, NOW!<br/><br/>People who are offended by the changes in the remake should 1) explain why a remake should be remade if nothing is rethought? If there's not new riffs to play with, why remake a movie? Did the shot by shot remake of Psycho earn your praise? 2) They should also view the 1978 flick again. I had such strong memories of that film that I thought a remake was a dumb idea. After renting it again, it's comically dated, with bad acting and effects. Remakes will occur - Accept reality."
"AgreeWithFrank","9","1","3","29 December 2004"," A genuinely scary movie, and a lot of fun. Run, zombies, run!
","Having missed this film in theaters, I have only the Director's Cut DVD to go by, but I must say ""WOW!"" Snyder and Gunn's adaptation of George Romero's 1978 zombie thriller is a nonstop roller coaster of suspense, despair and horrific thrills. This film gives the audience a scant five minutes or so to get comfortable in their seats, and then sends them rocketing through a story in which you must ask yourself, ""What would I do if the end of the human race seemed to be upon me?"" You will see so many basic human emotions in the face of such an unimaginable tragedy: shock, denial, acceptance, sorrow and anger. You will constantly put yourself in the characters' places and ask what you would have done differently. You will marvel at their instinct for survival, applaud them when they succeed and feel the frustration when they fail. One of the more controversial topics of discussion in regards to this movie is the swift physical capabilities of the zombies. This is a stroke of genius in the making of this film, however. When you've seen zombie movies in the past, you've often watched as the zombies s-l-o-w-l-y stagger towards their prey, often dragging a leg behind and reaching them only because the character ran away screaming, yet continuously turns to look back, and finally trips on...nothing? I for one was never impressed. That was never scary, it was disappointing. When the zombies are constantly running towards everyone they see with only the maniacal urge to kill, however, it becomes a seriously frightening concept. How do you defend yourself against groups of dead people who feel no pain, have no fear, experience no fatigue and move as fast as you can? I highly recommend this film for it's action, it's shock value and it's ability to portray the basic instinct of human preservation. It may not win an Academy Award, but this is one fantastic thriller for the 21st Century."

The chick that looks like Britney Spears should have died in the house, her acting is about enough to turn ANYONE into a zombie. The worst parts of this film is that they lost the funny element of the original, in fact, the only elements of the original in this one is zombies and a mall, everything else is changed and RUINED.

"kemeticpoet","4","1","3","23 May 2004"," What's wrong with the critics?
","I don't get it. Why is it that the critics, who often dislike otherwise good movies over petty details, actually LIKED this thing? I hated this movie.<br/><br/>Warning: contains spoilers.<br/><br/>""Dawn of the Dead,"" or more precisely, ""Yawn of the Dead"" is another cookie-cutter horror movie for the masses. As the movie progressed I picked out so many things I hated that I couldn't fit it all into one review.<br/><br/>A note first: I am judging this based on its own merits as a stand-alone film. I believe movies should be judged on their own, and I have attempted, as much as possible, to enjoy it as its own entity, without comparing to the original. However, since it does bear a resemblance at some points, I have had to compare just a little to illustrate a point. <br/><br/>The movie begins pretty well. I knew the little kid was going to die, because otherwise she had no reason to be on-camera so early and for so short a time. Predictable. Willing to ignore that, it started pretty well. The city in flames, everyone getting killed... I had no problem with this early part and found it did quite well to bring about a feeling of apocalypse.<br/><br/>The movie went downhill quickly. The woman in the beginning forgot about her dead husband within 5 minutes. Why? Because they didn't want to concentrate on character development. This is the major problem I had throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Another example of this: the conversation between the police officer and the young man in the bathroom was interesting. I would have liked to see more of this, see their opinions and conversations grow or shift as the movie went on. The problem is, again, the director wanted to throw a reference to religion in so he could say he did so, but didn't want to bring it up again, like he did with so many other concepts in the film. Religion is brought up, briefly, with a televangelist talking about ""When there's no more room in hell..."" but this is obviously thrown in only to use the tagline from the original. It makes no sense here, where the zombies are a result of a virus, and I can't see a Christian preacher saying this in any event(in the original it was quoted from a Voudon priest). <br/><br/>Note I'm not calling the characters by name. Why? They were too 2-dimensional for me to remember, to be honest. I couldn't remember half the characters in the film most of the time.<br/><br/>Another example. In the original, we learn that the woman is pregnant only after hints, secrets, foreshadowing, etc. In this one, two characters meet three characters, and BAM one is 8 months pregnant. Why? Because the director wanted the sudden shock of pregnancy, but didn't want to do as Romero did, byt actually using character development to lead up to the revelation. That would take actual work with a plot and with dialogue, and this movie is just about blowing people up.<br/><br/>The way the characters get to the mall is similarly contrived. When the two characters meet the other three, they ask them ""Where are you headed?"" One of the three responds ""We're going to the mall."" Which, of course, just happens to be right behind them, so that no time has to be taken up traveling to the mall or talking or anything. That scene was about when I realized the film was going to suck.<br/><br/>The whole movie is contrived, just like that scene, with weak(or no) dialogue and zero character development, except for the security guard wil suddenly becomes a good guy. The ""surprise ending"" was lame, also. I have no problem with characters dying en masse, but seriously, think about it. Did it really make any sense?<br/><br/>The major problem with the film is one I've been mentioning. The movie had too much crammed in, and not enough attention given to any one part. We have all the themes of the originals, really: religion; people fighting themselves while they should be fighting the undead; a fear of what is causing this menace; a pregnancy in the midst of this terror; innocent victims rescued and taken in; waiting on the military; and so on. The problem is, instead of concentrating on a couple strong themes and working them, the film has all of these things thrown in and then doesn't really pay attention to any of them, opting for zombie massacre footage instead.<br/><br/>Similarly, instead of having three or four characters developed and continued strongly, we have a dozen or so characters, most of which appear nameless and pointless, and which the audience doesn't care about.<br/><br/>I might have liked the movie more if I hadn't been in an audience full of idiots. Some people behind me started laughing when the one guy on the other building said he was starving. Yeah, that's real funny, morons.<br/><br/>On that note, I would like to say that the one part of the movie that I did like were the scenes where they were playing games with the guy across the street, or having fun in the mall in general. Those were decent scenes, and I think, aside from the graphic sex in one part, would have fit into the original movie really well.<br/><br/>One last thing: I saw a bunch of little kids in the audience. What's wrong with you people? Why the hell are you taking children to see this kind of movie? I mean if the graphic violence and profanity doesn't offend you, what about the nudity and sex? Is this appropriate for your children?<br/><br/>Overall, on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 1 being useless and 5 being perfect, I give it ** stars. Not quite horrible, but below average, certainly."
"bytorloveslerxst","3","1","3","8 May 2004"," OK remake of 28 Days
","Let's start out by stating the obvious.  This is a remake in name only of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Everything good about the original has been removed: the atmosphere, characters you actually root for, the social commentary, the innovative special effects, etc.  Instead they pretty much re-made 28 days with the exception of people coming back to life and biting people (we never see them really eating anyone).  This is pretty much an MTV generation horror film. We get no character development (aside from a security guard who is an incredible prick at the beginning turning into a saint by the end), no suspense beyond the standard horror movie shocks, and DV camera quality action sequences.  I realize this style freaks some people out but it does nothing for me.  I didn't like it in 28 days either.  So, if you liked 28 days then you'll really enjoy this because this is entertaining at times as long as you don't compare it to any Romero film.  If you're a Romero fan I would only recommend this as a curiosity film.  It is not a remake and it's not in the same league as the original."

","Yep. It's true. This review may contain a ""spoiler"", or 2.<br/><br/>You know, after watching this less than frightening ""Dawn Of The Dead"" remake - I seriously think that Director Zack Snyder should return, like, pronto, to directing TV commercials for BMW and Gaterade. He really should. 'Cause if Dawn Of The Dead (DOTD) is really supposed to be a sample of Snyder's work as a feature-film Director, then I think it stinks.<br/><br/>I mean, let's face it, Snyder doesn't have the knack for sustaining horror in his picture, nor does he have the ability for developing interesting characters, or even creating an involving storyline. This is all so clearly evident in this little debut feature film of his.<br/><br/>Believe me, the spine-tingling, rapid-fire images that one sees during the opening credits of DOTD are 10x more terrifying than anything we are shown in the actual picture. In my opinion DOTD only came to life in its final 15 minutes and by that point I was so bored out of my mind by it all. I mean, this movie offered absolutely nothing new to the viewer. And, if that wasn't bad enough, DOTD lapsed, far too often, into a regular, little soap opera of bickering, betrayal, and back-biting amongst the non-zombies.<br/><br/>In my opinion, all the in-fighting amongst the folks at Crossroads Mall got so tedious at times that I seriously began to wonder who the real monsters were here - The dysfunctional humans? - Or - The flesh-devouring zombies? I mean, if there actually was a choice to be made in the matter, all I can say is - At least the zombies knew exactly what they wanted.<br/><br/>And speaking about the zombies here in DOTD, like, what was this breed, anyways? They seemed to be just ""biters"" not ""eaters"". Whatever happened to zombies who took the time to actually devour a person alive? 'Cause unless I blinked when it happened, DOTD certainly lacked this very integral part of any zombie's relevant existence.<br/><br/>And, so, in conclusion - I can't begin to tell you how truly disappointed I was with DOTD. Here I was all prepared to have the socks scared right off of me (in the same fashion as 28 Months Later freaked, me out, big time), but it just didn't happen.<br/><br/>This remake certainly made the original 1978 version seem positively sensational by comparison. This film was so bloody dreary at times that even the birth of the zombie baby, as cute as he/she was, seemed somehow trite and altogether anti-climatic in the long run.<br/><br/>Yep. Before it's too late - Let's send Zack Snyder back to directing TV commercials. Pronto!"

","Now, THIS is a remake worth watching! Director Zack Snyder proves here that nowadays remakes don't necessarily have to be uninspired, overbudgetted productions meant only to make money at the expense of the original films. George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead was awfully close to being perfect¬ÖAnd Snyder seems to realize this too! He didn't try to add (or change) anything to the substance of the film, but merely focuses on disgusting and amusing the audience. Respectively with filthy prosthetic make-up effects and some of the blackest humor you'll ever see. Without any explanation or logical cause, the dead are raised overnight. The reanimated corpses attack the living and once you're infected¬Öyou become a zombie as well (notice that this word isn't used once in the movie, though). A group of survivors gather in the local mall and watch the place getting surrounded by an endless army of the bloodthirsty undead. At first, the remaining hillbillies keep themselves entertained by playing wicked games (shoot that Jay Leno look-alike!!) but soon the situation becomes more and more cul-de-sac and the growing internal intrigues result in dramatic, needless bloodshed.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in Dawn of the Dead is light-headed, but Zack Snyder never really loses that brilliant apocalyptic touch. The feeling of hopelessness is upheld constantly and even wonderfully stressed by Johnny Cash' great song 'When the man comes around'. The film is filled with great references towards Romero's original, with the appearances of the original cast members as an absolute highlight. Initial zombie warriors Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini all star briefly in this new version of Dawn. The main actors are worth praising as well. Ving Rhames was a great casting choice and the beautiful Sarah Polley impresses as the female lead. Snyder's style of film-making is loud and volatile, but it never becomes too irritant or boisterous. You can see his roots lie in shooting ads and commercials but he's obviously talented and capable of doing more. A comment I've heard a few times already is that this remake outshines the original¬Ö. Of course it does NOT! Frankly, if you share this opinion you haven't got the slightest idea what the original stands for as a horror film. But it is terrific entertainment, for sure. I saw Dawn twice in the cinema already and I can't wait to buy it on DVD. Highly recommended horror fun!"

","I have to admit that the old Dawn of the dead is for me the best zombie film ever, good and simple script, unknown actors, total chaos... but here i review the 2004 film. First i'd say i don't like fast moving zombies at all, zombie's charm is in the slowness, it makes them so scary. The mayor flaw of the remake (besides the zombie baby!?! which was so unfortunate) is in the script of course, the characters never admit that they could end up living inside the mall, like they did in the 70's film where they made at home inside, and in the end were the humans who f4ck them up. Here script writers came up with a stupid salvation convoy and a more senseless boat scape, a ""made in Hollywood"" ending. Zombie movies are doomed because is the way they should end up. This genre admits no innovation, we don't need explanation for the undead awakening, no zombie character development (did i said that?), and only a small hope for humans like in our real world. So please respect zombie movies standards."

","I was looking forward to seeing this film. Missed it at the theaters and then I didn't get around to renting it until recently. Caught the first ten minutes of the movie when they showed it on TV- great promotional idea for this movie (bad promotional idea for Elektra though, but that's another film altogether ...)<br/><br/>I personally didn't get the sense that this phenomenon was global, just that this was a small town gone bad. I do like the opening credit sequence with Cash's vocals and all- very cool! Loved the chaos that ensued at the beginning, loved CJ and the security mall a$$holes once they got inside. After that it become a bit muddled and boring. CJ's character becomes a likable guy for some reason which really sucked because he played such a great bad guy! THe film went from being ... well .. semi-serious to comedic from moment to moment. The Mikhi Pfier sequence didn't really have a good payoff for me. And the single worst part of the movie is when the red head girl risk her life and their rescue mission to save a damn dog!!! WTF? Just like when Rippley saved the cat in Alien, this is a terrible clich√© that should not be brought back! Horrible, horrible. <br/><br/>Of course, things pick up towards the end and it becomes fun to watch once again. But you know ... the stuff in the middle was just plain terrible. <br/><br/>Sarah Polley was really great! So was Ving Rhames. I liked him but i'm not sure why, I guess I just like Ving and that's good enough for me. I enjoyed the zombies as well. Especially Polley's bf that guy just wouldn't stop! I won't compare to the source material, even though I am a Romero and zombie fan but all in all it just wasn't that great of a film. It's all pretty disappointing in the end."
"ejc15","10","1","4","28 January 2005"," A more than worthy remake of the best movie of all time
","Some are bothered that there would be an attempt at a remake of such a classic as the original Dawn of the Dead. This is not a typical remake but as the director said it is a re-imagining. I loved the first movie and loved this movie. I absolutely refuse to compare the two as each has its own qualities and inspirations. I can only say I left the theater with an ache in my neck from the tension.<br/><br/>The opening of the movie, as many have said, is as scary as any movie ever made. Although I would have liked to have seen more of societies break down, the opening credits did a wonderful job of a quick summary of the fall of civilization.<br/><br/>The pure terror and shock that Ana must have felt was superbly displayed in the opening scene. Watching the DVD over and over, I can find different attacks and reaction by several neighbors. The whole scene does a fabulous job of showing absolute kaos descending upon suburbia.<br/><br/>There may have been some disposable characters, and sometimes the characters did not behave in ways in which we think we would have acted. But how many times do large groups of people, under great stress always do the right thing. Overall, absent the unreality of the movie, I thought it portrayed the people in a very real way. Excellent acting, story, camera work and worthy of being a re-imagining of the best movie of all time.<br/><br/>The DVD also explains many plot holes that may have been found in an initial theatrical viewing, either via Andy's tape, the news reports or deleted scenes.<br/><br/>Finally do not turn the movie off before the closing credits end.

","""I was trying to come up with a concept about a new society, revolutionary...in political terms, that's taking over and devouring the old society."" ‚Äì George A. Romero <br/><br/>In the lead up to and wake of the September 11th attacks, Hollywood saw a resurgence in films featuring anti-Arabic and anti-Persian sentiments. Most of these films unconsciously pandered to nationalist fears, and featured aliens, monsters or creatures shooting down buildings or zapping screaming Americans.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"", a remake of a 1978 George Romero's horror classic by the same name, finds a group of Americans holed up in a shopping mall whilst bloodthirsty zombies roam outside. Beginning with unconscionable, near subliminal shots of Muslims praying in unison, the film quickly becomes one big anti-Islamic blood orgy, the film ascribing to the zombies the ""evil madness"" of jihadists.<br/><br/>These new, post 9/11 zombies are not the placid, stumbling fools of Romero's ""living dead"" series, but an angry, enraged, wrathful mob, who exist not to consume, but to transform, pollute and convert others. Significantly, the mob starts by infecting children, converting the family unit before spreading further outwards. This modern zombie doesn't only expresses Western fears of violent ""Islamic"" (and soon, ""Confucian"") oppositions to modernity and secularism, but Western understandings of the ""Islamic agenda"", namely the Muslim exists only to breed, emigrate, infect and submit the world to some wild, archaic version of Sharia Law.<br/><br/>This reverses Romero's attitude to zombies. Throughout Romero's films ‚Äì and this is why thrill seeking audiences increasingly abandoned him ‚Äì the zombie is not a relentless bogeyman, but a symbol for cultural or revolutionary shifts which usurp and devour previously entrenched, old societies. Think the tall, black Zombie leader whose proletariat uprising overthrows a George Bush styled warmonger in ""Land of the Dead"", toppling his unjust empire. ""Night of The Living Dead"" likewise saw ""the zombie"" as being symbolic of various mid-60s uprisings against tyrannical paternal and political despots. In later Romero films, the zombies innocuously represent a culture of tech savvy, media proficient whizkids; a digital mob which clumsily replaces an outmoded analogue generation and its assorted cultural and familial values. From here on, Romero's zombies become resolutely postmodern. Neutered, without purpose and ineffectual, they are like so much digital noise, born to proliferate with record buttons, youtube accounts and cell phone cameras.<br/><br/>So unlike other horror directors, Romero doesn't see the ""zombie"" as a monster. Instead he treats them with a much more objective tone, dispassionately watching as they change from radicals, to consumerists to angry abolishers of bourgeois property. In his last two films, the concept of the ""zombie"" changes further. In a stagnated society in which progress seems impossible, the zombie becomes a fantasy concocted by backward looking survivalists; a pipe-dream in which those remaining few outside the network society dream up half thought out zombie uprisings and apocalyptic purges. In this way, Romero's ""Survival of the Dead"" anticipates (and critiques) the new generation of zombie rip offs artists like Zack Snyder, and the countless kill-a-zombie video games flooding the shelves. The idea of the zombie has been killed, and so now we repeatedly resurrect (and slaughter) zombies only to preserve the illusion that the revolution is not dead.<br/><br/>What Romero recognises is the inherent deadendedness of the postmodern condition. The present age is the age of advertisement, the age of miscellaneous announcements: nothing happens, but what does happen is instant notification. A (zombie) uprising in the present age, an age of worldly renunciation, is the most unthinkable of all; such a show of energy would strike the calculating sensibleness of the age as ludicrous. And so while Romero's films go into increasingly dour territory, material like Snyder's ""Dawn"", ""Zombieland"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""28 Days Later"", ""The Walking Dead"", ""Carriers"" etc engage in cosy, survivalist fantasies.<br/><br/>If Snyder's film is inferior to Romero's in every way ‚Äì Romero's was consistently snappy, shocking, funny, nauseating, pacey, imaginative, tense ‚Äì it nevertheless contains a very good first act sequence rife with cool vehicle camera mounts and smooth, helicopter shots. The rest of the film hinges on trite twists on Romero's classic: instead of the mall being a place of refuge, our heroes are for a long while barred from the mall. Instead of our heroes being cool survivalists, they're criminals, tired hospital workers and morose security guards. Instead of a truck load of military men assaulting the mall, we have a bus load of gay priests, selfish men, obese women and whores. The implication here is that America is already messed up, overworked, degenerate, immoral, poor, marginalised, disenfranchised and has long been financially exploited, her citizens barred from the pleasures of the shopping mall. In this world, the fanatical zombie purge is almost deserved.<br/><br/>6/10 ‚Äì Aside from the first 20 minutes, this is a dull, unimaginative, predictable, and poorly shot film. Snyder's cast is mostly terrible, except for Sarah Polley, an actress who consistently turns in good performances and who has made a career out of elevating independent films. See Romero's original film instead. Worth one viewing."

","The remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is far from a remake. The film was actually influenced by 28 Days Later directed by Danny Boyle. This fact explains the running zombies and the news broadcast of human figures beaten down by policemen.<br/><br/>The original version had the subtext of criticizing consumerism, and the racial subtext was optimistic. The characters seemed to go along well despite the difference in skin color or profession.<br/><br/>I found Zack Snyder's version offending. At the beginning of the film, the news broadcast of a zombie outbreak is shown, but also the audience see a clip of a Muslim mosque full of Muslims performing an obligatory prayer, together with the news of the dead coming back to life. The subtext of the new version of Dawn of the Dead is that Christianity is normality, and if one does not follow Christianity, then an apocalypse will come, with the dead coming back to life.<br/><br/>With all the racial and religious tension today in the US, we don't need another reason to make minority groups offended. It is sad that although explicit racism and religionism is prohibited, films like these carryout racism and religionism in its subtext, and gets away with it."

In my opinion, I think the film could've live up more to it's potential.
Each character's personalities was expected by their traits and stereotypes of what the writers believe them to be. This kind of trick throws away the meaning of the film and sets off a number of unwanted scenes. The finale ending of the film took my eyes since it brought life. Maybe if it was more of a found-footage zombie flick, it could've brought more screening time to show the world as of what it really is. I did mind when the characters were being killed in the way in what seemed as if they deserved. Mostly all of these characters were running away from a life that they regret and hated. There was no potential growth in any of them during the disaster and inside the mall. There was times when putting the zombies inside the mall didn't really boost pace of the film. They looked better far away from the mall and the characters going through places. I guess, they didn't want it to look too much like The Walking Dead."

But for now I need to take my hat off in honor of great writing and captivating work of the director in this particular case.<br/><br/>In the beginning I had the worst feeling that you can get while anticipating a horror movie - the fear that there will be no atmosphere whatsoever. I thought that I am watching a comedy with scary spooks as the music was overtense like in parody, and the colors were too bright. But when the story actually kicked in, it got to me. It is serious. I am in the middle of a zombie apocalypse!<br/><br/>The sole island of our survivors in the huge mall is presumably the only place around with living people in the sea of the dead. Probably this plays the major factor in bonding the characters together and also forms a strong connection with the viewer. The other factor is that they human nature is presented at its best: everyone has fears, trust issues or simple needs to do something just not to get bored. The development of each hero is beautifully done and no one is useless. Everyone counts in this game of survival.<br/><br/>The decisions taken by the team are surprisingly reasonable, with a few remarks, of course (no, in some cases I cannot blame stress). The finishing part is a raging mix of adrenaline, stress and unbelievable bond of strangers that have become the closest people on the face of Earth.<br/><br/>I cannot say that you will be scared to death while watching the movie, but this is the beauty: no cheap jump scares and constant feeling of danger behind every corner.

The major change here is that Snyder has decided to make the zombies have the capacity to run, which is a scary thought indeed. As creepy as the slow undead were there was always the chance to outmaneuver them, but things are not so simple this time around. The usual zombie trope of a bunch of characters clustered together and hiding away is how the film goes about it but it manages to characterize the survivors instead of just using them as zombie fodder.

","When I heard that this loose remake of the Romero classic was scripted by the guy who also did SCOOBY DOO, I cried. Then I went to the cinema to see for myself (no matter what reviews might say, it's always worth checking out movies for yourself; sometimes you might be pleasantly surprised). As it stands, DAWN OF THE DEAD is an acceptable remake-cum-horror-thriller which uses the original film as a basis for the story and then moves on from there. Luckily, it's not too similar to the '70s classic; half the film is set in the mall and the rest is an extended chase between humans and zombies. The zombies here are quite good although, I have to say, I prefer the slow-moving variety to the animalistic killers in this and 28 DAYS LATER. Special effects have progressed to a grimly realistic level and the film is packed with enough grue and gore and spraying blood to please any avid horror fan.<br/><br/>As a plus, the film retains a grip on characterisation and deals with some fleshed-out people. The acting of the leads is great. Sarah Polley (looking uncannily like Gaylen Ross) is a strong-willed heroine, Ving Rhames is the tough, silent, kick-ass cop. Kudos to Jake Weber for his excellent turn as the group's leader, and especially Michael Kelly, who starts off as an idiot security guard and ends up being the most heroic of them all. Fans of the original will enjoy seeing Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini in brief cameos on the televisions.<br/><br/>I had mixed feelings about the direction, but for the most part it's good. The last half an hour employs camera-shaking, jumpy music-style shots to depict a bus chase. I enjoyed it, but I couldn't have put up with it for that long. There are many enjoyable and surprising moments, like the games played with Andy from the gun store, and the use of a chainsaw which ends in calamity. There's an ambiguous ending, but if you stay and watch the credits you'll see that things become a lot more downbeat. Special effects of the decaying, mutilated zombies are disturbingly real and there are some automobile accidents that'll have you watching with your mouth open. Watch out for the zombies being crushed and mown down by trucks, some of my favourite moments. Particularly good is the first ten minutes, which puts across the hopelessness of the sudden destruction of society in a way I found to be particularly frightening. Strong horror entertainment, hopefully we'll see more like this."

","This one is really hard to judge due to the fact that it's a melting pot. It takes the deeper meaning of the original and throw it out of the window in favor of more action packed stuff. It's like Dawn of the dead from 1978 and 28 days later had a baby. They wanted to have the best of both worlds but sadly i just think that i rather watch either the original or 28 days later.<br/><br/>That being said, it's not a bad movie. If i had to describe it, i would say its a mixed bag. The good moments are great and the bad moments are horrible. I think that we could have done well without the montage scene in the middle of the movie, it felt out of place for me. The dark humor is good, i especially like when they are up on the roof and play a game with their rooftop neighbor shooting famous zombies (or Look-alikes).<br/><br/>The movie start out good, but as it progresses i lost interest. Mainly because i did not care for our main cast except for CJ played by Michael Kelly. I can understand if people like this movie more than i did, i have friends who think that it surpasses the original because the original is a very slow movie with tons of buildup.<br/><br/>For me personally it comes down to the running zombies. Some people like them more, some people like them less (Me included). While i did enjoy 28 days later, fast zombies remove the feel of dread from the lurking zombies. It just seems easier to create a real threat with running zombies. If the zombies are slow like in the original, you can take it out without a problem. Here however even a single zombie can be a real threat. Once again, this is a personal taste and i can see why people like the running zombies."

","Normally I'm stand-offish towards remakes. Usually it seems when filmmakers decide to remake a classic, what they're really saying is ""The original sucks in some way. So now I'll do it better."" And 9 times out of 10, the remake is worse. Filmmakers of a good remake however say ""The original is excellent and we're not going to mess with it. Let's set it to one side. Now here's our version!"" In many ways, a good remake is an alternate story. DAWN OF THE DEAD is an example of a remake that is done very well. Taking the same basic concept as Romero's 1978 classic, director Zack Snyder and his team create their own frightening zombie film.The story: For nurse Ana (played wonderfully by Sarah Polley) her rough day at the hospital is finally winding down. All she wants to do is go home and fall into the arms of her husband. On her ride home, kids are playing, birds are chirping, music is blaring out of her radio. Just another normal day comes to an end... Next morning, in one of the best scary scenes in recent cinema history, she's attacked and must flee her home. Shortly afterward, she meets up with Kenneth (Ving Rhames) along with several other survivors. With nowhere else to go, they head to the enormous Crossroads Mall. And the rest of the story involves their struggle to survive in a zombie-infested world. There are so many individual scenes and gory special effects that I wouldn't think of revealing them all. Everything from the witty, sarcastic dialogue to the fleshed-out characters work together. Does it improve on the original? No, the original is still the best. However, it does make a wonderful companion piece. So if you want to have a double feature, go ahead and watch them both. Also, if you're not satisfied with the ""happy ending"", stay through the end credits!"

"AMar_rom","Null","0","1","30 June 2012"," An excellent zombie film with a strong end-of-the-world feel
","This film revisits the zombie-horror genre by making zombies far more menacing, dangerous and agile. The movie takes place most of the time inside a shopping Mall where a number of survivors find refuge. Contrary to the original 'Dawn of the Dead, 1978' the survivors are more numerous since after a while new people arrive to take shelter. Communication with a lone survivor across the street through signals also makes the film less claustrophobic and the monotony of fear is occasionally interrupted by a number of funny moments.<br/><br/>The film has a strong post-apocalyptic feel in it since we get the impression that the zombie condition is not supernatural (or at least not totally unexplained) but may have to do with an epidemic spread from some unknown to us virus agent. It is no coincidence that the main protagonist (Sarah Polley) works as a nurse in a hospital and witnesses first-hand some curious symptoms. In some respects the film has some similarities with the beginning of Stephen King's 'The Stand' where survivors also have to avoid the initial epidemic onslaught and the 'Omega Man' based on the excellent novel 'I am Legend' of Richard Matheson. In contrast to these two latter books made-into films the present film depicts events occurring in a far shorter time frame: a few days.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was quite good and added a number of new elements to the zombie filmography, paying homage to the original Romero's films but covering also new ground. It is clearly superior to most of the zombie films of the past 30 years. There was a lot of tension and realism, and the survivors were not just there to provide cheap scares; they were three-dimensional characters discussing the situation, contemplating their plans and trying to grasp the severity of what was happening. A good effort from Zack Snyder who later went on to direct '300' and the 'Watchmen'."
"jackstarr777","9","0","2","17 June 2012"," Seriously fun, seat-edge, pure entertainment
","I should start by saying, anyone looking for quality shouldn't watch this film. The effects are cheap, the dialogue is nothing special and the performances aren't top-notch. But for anybody looking to be entertained, this film is great. It starts off a little slow, but as the film progresses it gets quicker and edgier, and it soon evolves into one of the best horror films I've seen for a while.<br/><br/>A reason for complaint from many fans of the original is the fast-running zombies, rather that the original's slow, shuffling zombies. I have yet to see the original, and though slow-paced zombies are generally more effective in other zombie movies I've seen, I was impressed by the zombies in this film. The cinematography was good at keeping you on the edge even without suspense. The zombies were startling and panicking, got your heart racing a bit more.<br/><br/>Though the dialogue was nothing special, it doesn't at all drag on the film; it's nothing enlightening but it's bearable, especially for a zombie movie. Characterisation comes across fairly well, it has to be said, as most of the movie is not simple repetitive zombie splattering but interesting interactions between the survivors. A couple of the performances were a little cheesy - but really, you'll be too entertained to be bothered by it.<br/><br/>The effects were quite bad - but the beauty of it is, for a film of this type, bad effects are better than good effects. It's like, we want it to be cheesy - and that's why it works. The CGI looked very unrealistic and unconvincing - but still, it does not drag down on the film.<br/><br/>Most zombie film remakes have been denounced as some of the worst films ever made. But this one certainly stands out. In fact, for a remake on any kind it's impressing - I enjoyed it, and that's all I can say.<br/><br/>8.6/10"
"screenman","7","0","1","9 April 2012"," Yet More Zombies!
","By now (2012) I've grown pretty weary of flesh-eating zombie types. They've become a whole genre to themselves. From the endless 'Resident Evil' to Big-Ears' 'I am Legend' on to the no less eternal 'Walking Dead' TV serial-thon. Why do they have to eat flesh all the time anyway? It's clear that they don't actually need it because they can go for weeks without so much as a nibble. Why can't they have a positive fixation like painting & decorating or flower arrangement?<br/><br/>Well, this 2004 remake takes Romero's original and gives the cadaverous ones an Olympian turn of speed. The result is much more dramatic. Chases are truly hectic and confrontations are more in keeping with werewolves or Aliens. <br/><br/>The movie takes a pretty dystopian view about the consequences of social breakdown. There's very little heroic stiff-upper-lip stuff and a lot more looking out for number one. Against such dire consequences, it's probably much nearer the mark. It's one thing to go to the guillotine for someone, but quite another to be eaten alive or changed into one of them yourself. Methinks Sidney Carton would take a raincheck here.<br/><br/>Most of the takes are pretty solidly put together. Looks like the directors hired a genuine shopping-mall for the weekend. There's lots of believable conflict between the survivors and plenty of extremely tense action sequences when zombies turn up, fast, furious and very ravenous. Editing is sharp and well observed. Lighting & sound do the business. There's no happy ending.<br/><br/>Character development is more detailed than the usual slash & gnash offerings. Most of the dumb things people do are plausible, even though I often found myself saying 'oh-no; you don't want to do that' or 'why don't you try this?' At least I was drawn into their dilemma. But having said as much; I wasn't particularly inclined to empathise with any of them either, which left the story with a shallow texture.<br/><br/>Altogether it's a decent watch. Certainly I would recommend a viewing. It's at the top end of the zombie market, for what that's worth."

","I watched this movie back to back with Original Dawn of the dead. I never watched either of them before & watched them based on IMDb reviews. After watching both of them together, Original sort of disappointed me whereas Remake was complete kick a**.<br/><br/>Sure, new one has its faults & goofs but in totality it is much better cinematic experience. Fast zombies are genuinely scary & movie is chilling. Many fans of old have issues with the fact that new movies totally crapped on old one's concept by making living dead run because dead will be made of stiff muscles so fast running is out of question. George Romero showed his disdain as well. I think George Romero is just jealous because his concept has been improved & made genuinely scary & not only that we actually get to have a brief idea that it might be some kind of virus (as per opening sequence) which might have mutated humans into some kind of undead nightmare & that virus passes through bites. This is unlike George Romero's vision where no explanation was given just a BS line that when there is no place in hell dead will walk the earth. WTF! Not giving explanation works in some movies like in Ringu but not in this genre. At least, we deserve a partial explanation which was given in this movie.<br/><br/>IMO, acting was also vastly superior & so was pretty much everything from cinematography to music to overall story to chilling thrill, horror & suspense. I also do not agree with George Romero's take that movie didn't have any soul or in depth characterization. It had much more story & characterization than George Romero's movies. Since, I am not an American, I never understood so called social commentary in his movies. What exactly is his social commentary that American people are so dumb that they can't counter a threat of slow moving zombie because they are too greedy & have petty self interests. Note to Mr. Romero, next time when you make movies, consider this .. military in any country is more than a match for any slow moving zombie/zombies & most likely threat will be neutralized before it spreads so far & add to the fact that an average American carries weapon this threat would be neutralized even faster. However, when we factor fast moving zombies with more sentient behaviour, it is altogether a different ball game. There is a chance that humanity may lose war as infection may spread overnight. And this why I like this movie. The concept is scary & ending is too as after all this trial & error, more than likely the cast would have been devoured in the end as they came to an island full of zombies.<br/><br/>I know there will be a lot of people who will probably disagree with me but watch it with open mind with the points I just made & I am sure you will love this movie especially if you like your horror movie to be really scary.<br/><br/>Totally recommended."

","Back in 1968, ""Night of the Living Dead"" did a really good job with the whole concept of zombies, and of those who weren't zombies being trapped in a hopeless situation as they struggled to find a way to survive. Somehow after that, though, the whole ""zombie"" craze seemed to lose its footing. Any such movies I've happened upon have really been rather silly with nothing much to be taken seriously and nothing much to commend them. Then I happened upon ""Dawn of the Dead."" This movie manages to get the whole zombie thing right, and the end result is a movie that works really well from start to finish.<br/><br/>There's no science in this; nobody spends much time trying to explain what's happening. The closest might be Ana (played by Sarah Polley) finally figuring out that the zombie ""infection"" is caused by a bite - although that was a bit anti-climactic. I mean, wasn't it rather obvious? But there's no time wasted offering much in the way of explanation. This is just happening. There are living dead everywhere seeking to bite and kill others, who will then turn into zombies themselves. In keeping with the simplicity, the movie jumps right into the mystery. After a brief opening scene in which Ana (a nurse) puzzles as her shift ends about why a man who was hurt in a fight would end up in the ICU, we go right into the action, and the opening zombie attacks (without giving too much away) are both shocking and terrifying. Ana ends up bound together with a group of survivors who hole up in a local shopping mall while they try to figure out how they're going to get out of this mess.<br/><br/>This is very frightening at times, and - be warned if this bothers you - it's very, very bloody. The sense of hopelessness is real, and although the ultimate fate of the survivors we've been following isn't really made clear, there's no sense left by the end of the movie that theirs will be a happy ending. Give credit to those who put this together. It's an excellent movie, although I confess that I personally didn't really see the humour in using background music like ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" and ""You Light Up My Life."" It was meant to have a degree of irony, I guess, given the situation. I just found it out of place. Still, a very good movie with a lot of chills and a pretty decent cast. (8/10)"

","As for zombie movies go, dawn of the dead 2004 is really on top of its game. MOst disaster movies will have a tremendous amount of action to keep you entertained, but dawn of the dead explores where other movies stop. In this movie, we clearly see people fighting to survive against a never ending army, becoming stranded in a shopping mall and society collapses. They hear no news, they are surrounded by death and this entire outbreak and they have to deal with each other.<br/><br/>One good aspect out of this movie was the fact when they arrived at the mall and got in, the head security guard quickly was NOT going to allow them to stay and then insisted on locking them up. He seemed like a bully and was quick to pull out his gun and threaten people, and was definitely not your favorite character, but he quickly improved as the movie went on, and he was out there to survive. On the other hand there were ""passive"" and nonviolent people in this movie who were less adept at handling these situations. At the same time, there were lowlifes they had to deal with (a snotty worthless survivor who always talked trash to everyone and then became NO help when everyone counted on him). Then there was a nurse, and a few normal people who were just trying to survive and they were the real survivors. One survivor had an infected wife and became irrational and tried to keep her at the mall depsite the danger.<br/><br/>The general message was that the people who are quick to action and stay strong survive and those who wimp out die. However, the deeper message was that the people eventually decided to leave the mall (freaking out about being trapped there), and they go through the town only to find that they are the ONLY survivors and that the roads are virtually unpasassible and ultimately resulting in their demise.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie it seems to be NO clear answer and ALL of the place is infected and its basically the end of the world as there seem to be NO survivors and the entire population and all armies have succombed."

Now as far as Dawn Of The Dead goes, this just shows how good Zack is with interpreting an idea that has been done and transferring it to modern cinema. Now I am very respectful to the old Dawn Of The Dead, however cheesy it may be to most movie goers now, it still made a huge dent in the horror movie crowd introducing a group of people under siege by zombies in a new surrounding. This movie does a great job enforcing that idea into a modern time. The cast could not have been more well chosen. The old film's image is still upheld in a new environment with great prestige.

However, the movie becomes exciting when they build the buses and at the rescue-scene at the gun shop. This is spectacular made! :) It's also nice when they drive off to the docks, but here the movie takes a turn down into total flop...Sorry to say that. As the survivors are just ready to take off with the boat, two of the main characters have to be abandoned (maybe they felt like it, I don't know, especially CJ) and Michael coincidentally has been infected. The last thing you hear is a gun shot by Michael shooting himself and in the credits (as a torture against the audience) we have to follow the end titles because you can see short clips from a handhold camera showing how they discover an island...WITH ZOMBIES ON IT! Camera drops down. WHAT?! Did they die? We don't know. Too confusing ending. I think they could have moved the action a bit forward so they would have used like 15 % of the screen time in the mall, then build the buses and then the movie could have been about how they drive around to find a safe place. That would have worked a lot better in my opinion. So ... Ending is bad. Action takes too much place in the mall. But the start and set up is actually quite good. 4 stars."

"GiGAHEART","10","0","2","23 October 2010"," Hands down the BEST zombie apocalypse MOVIE EVER MADE.
","This film was made in 2004, I'm reviewing it today six years later and you know what? It's still the best. The only film that comes close rivaling this masterpiece is Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. But when you watch the two in marathon viewing, clearly Dawn of the Dead 2004 will have the upper hand and stays in you for hours, maybe days, weeks, months and years. And to think this is Zack Snyder's directorial debut? Incredible.<br/><br/>Now what sets Dawn of the Dead 2004 apart from the past and present zombie flicks and in between, is that bold, brave and beautiful. It astonishingly mixed realism, horror, suspense, comedy, action and drama that's rarely seen for its genre, if not until its arrival. The story's straight to the point, it's pretty basic in terms of zombie apocalypse but it all comes down on how well everything else besides the story is executed. And this is where Snyder shines; you can relate to any of the characters and each are so well done so kudos too to the actors, the special effects are insanely realistic, and most of all chaos is really felt in the film, and Snyder showed amazingly how hell breaks loose when the dead walks in your neighborhood.<br/><br/>It's fast-paced, hence the comparison to 28 Days Later and a far cry to the originals. But that's what everybody likes. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is a very re-watchable film (did I mention the Unrated DVD is a must-have?), you won't get tired of it easily, you'll notice subtle stuff on each viewing and even more appreciate the vastly superior cinematography seen in zombie movies genre. That too, why this is the best zombie apocalypse movie ever made."

","That's how this movie and everything in it felt for me. All the characters were too underdeveloped for me to care about any of them, main protagonist was extremely annoying and not really that well established, too many subplots which have gone nowhere or ended too soon before establishing any kind of emotional attachment. This movie lacks precision and attention to details, you can not just throw random stuff at the viewer without any consistency, anyone can do that, you need to thigh it together, then you'll be creating a MOVIE, not a random mess that we have here. Of course mainstream will be satisfied with any kind of pretty pictures and sadly, for most of the directors that's enough, but that doesn't mean you need to be one of the sheep. Don't believe the hype, see this movie for what it is - another mediocre zombie flick, nothing more, nothing less."
"Squonkamatic","7","0","1","24 April 2010"," Decent Pop Culture Nihilism
","If nothing else, the phenomenal popularity of Zack Snyder's 2004 re-visioning of DAWN OF THE DEAD is proof positive that deep down inside our contemporary youth culture is still as morose and titillated by carnage & destruction as mine was. I missed the frenzy of excitement + hype over this film at the time of release, too fully absorbed in my own fascination with European made horror from the 60s and 70s to be bothered with a modern day remake of anything by George A. Romero. A remake of his 1978 DAWN OF THE DEAD seemed especially futile since part of the reason why that movie worked is as a reaction against the tacky polyester disco suit pop culture of the Carter years. People whine about Bush but I had to live through Carter and trust me, it was worse, though after seeing it Snyder's remake I can say it is exactly the movie that the post 9/11 War On Terror era had coming. In spite of its grim source material the film manages to upbeat, exciting, engaging, and most of all fun. Go figure.<br/><br/>Was Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD fun? Kind of, or rather its satire angle gave the mayhem a kick in the pants that was absent from so much of the similar material from the era. Much of it was genuinely hilarious within the context of the film like the priceless epic fail gag where the zombie rises up to attack only to have the top of its head lopped off by a helicopter blade. We had been waiting nearly 20 years to see something like that and at the time it brought down the house. But one of the reasons why Romero's DAWN worked so well is the plodding, relentless course of doom that focuses the film's central themes of the world having come to an end. Even an idyllic life in a fully stocked shopping mall won't cut it, with the primary underlying conflict in the film being providing the survivors with a reason to get the hell out of there.<br/><br/>Snyder's remake does an admirable job of imparting that need before its survivors even get settled in for the long haul. I never felt at home in this mall, which was so impersonal and unaccommodating that even the toilets were fakes in the home decor shop the primaries are forced to bed down in. Then again the film never pauses to really let them get used to being there -- something the 1978 version went to great lengths to depict -- with the zombies existing almost as a Greek chorus to keep the plot moving along. Random new characters are inserted to up the body counts and provide emotional draws for the audience to identify with, including a cute dog put to work in the crux scene where the film starts to spiral out of control and they are finally forced to abandon the mall to the zombies.<br/><br/>Who are more interested in chasing down the surviving humans en masse like they were storming a free Michael Jackson concert. Similar to the creatures in Umberto Lenzi's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD the zombies are fast, deadly, and instinctively trained in hand to hand combat, a fringe benefit of being bitten & transformed. To hell with bombing Iran, we should set a horde of zombies loose on them and flood the airwaves with Johnny Cash songs. They'd go belly up inside of a week. The one complaint I had about the zombies was that fighting them off became a video game, complete with a sewer level where they lost the blue key while getting fresh ammo packs + quad damage. When the movie finally sputtered to an end all I could think was, What no Boss Monster? Which might come across as a criticism but then again this is the visual language that the target audience (10 to 40 year old tech savvy consumers) knows & speaks best. I was grateful Snyder spared us having to use cheat codes on a Thrall map.<br/><br/>A subtle zombie movie wouldn't have been appropriate either, with the mold for the film's approach lying somewhere between the Italian horror epics and Dan O'Bannon's punk rock RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. But unlike that film Snyder's remake retains an air of sobriety and grim seriousness that was strangely refreshing, and quite fitting for some of the 9/11 era images of urban destruction it depicted. There was one shot of a street littered with office paper that was right out of the WTC photo memorials, and Snyder's makeup crew did a marvelous job of creating their zombies by basing the imagery on autopsy photos. All of it felt quite real even if the primary focus of the cinematographers was to find white surfaces for brains to splatter on when a zombie got shot in the head. But hey, that comes with the territory.<br/><br/>The film had two great contributions to zombie lore as well, first with Michael Kelly's superb character of C.J. the cynical security guard, and a zombie baby birth that like the head in the helicopter blade gag was exactly what we had been waiting another 20 years to see. Ving Rhames also created an excellent character with his gruff Officer Ken, and the film manages to maintain a level of mayhem throughout its length that is quite worthy of the traditions on which the movie drew (including a first rate quickie scene of a Presidential Guard detail gunning down a group of journalists who get to close: my kind of stuff!). All of it works pretty well though it is definitely more of a ""re-visioning"" of Romero's scenario rather than a remake. I guess they felt compelled to re-use the title as an homage because its a very different film, very well made and very worthy of being seen. Even if nobody actually gets eaten.<br/><br/>7/10"
"freemantle_uk","8","0","1","18 February 2010"," Surprisingly good remake
","This film had all the hallmarks of being a disaster: it was was based on a very popular and critically acclaimed horror, it was directed by a first-time director and was going to take a glossy approach compared to the original. But luckily the first-time director was Zack Snyder, a man who was known for doing adverts, and a man who picks his projects carefully. He ends up doing the important and making a good re-make of a horror classic.<br/><br/>In the American state of Wisconsin the zombie virus suddenly spreads, causing death and destruction around the world. In the middle of this is Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who has to go on the run after her husband and friends are turned. She joins up with a group of survivors, including a cop/former marine Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), petty criminal Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina). They decide to hold themselves up in local shopping mall with a team of security guards. More survivors join them, but soon becomes clear that they could only stay in the mall for a limited amount of time, especially with the survivors turning on themselves.<br/><br/>As stated, Snyder is a director who picks his projects carefully. He rejected the chance to direct SWAT because it wouldn't be R-rated, and later on rejected doing X-Men 3 because he wanted to do 300, and rejected doing Wolverine because it wouldn't be R-rated and so he could direct Watchmen. Some first-time directors are so desperate to direct a Hollywood, that they don't think about the consequences for their career. But this didn't happen to Snyder. Horror remakes often repeat the same plot of the origin, but have more glossy violence, and making the film a boring experience. What Snyder and the writers avoid this: they follow the same basic plot, survivors are under siege in a mall, but they make a different film to George A. Romero, following a different storyline.<br/><br/>Snyder shows his skill as a director, films some fine action scenes, showing he can deliver a few good scares and makes a exciting gore action (it is acceptable for zombie films to be gory). The opening is particularly good moment, with good scares, a shot scene involving Ana driving her car away from her house, and with a zombie following her. The opening credits were also well used to show the impact the rise of the zombies with news footage around the world. Snyder also casts some actors more famous for smaller roles. Ving Rhames is a talented actor and he role was very similar to Ken Foree in the original. Mekhi Phifer too is a good actor, and a decent bit of casting. Sarah Polley was a compelling led and with Ving Rhames made a good team. However some of the acting does slip a little at times.<br/><br/>The remake never has George A. Romero's political message about American consumerism. They is a little nod to American militarism but that was really an after thought then any real political insight. This film just sets out to be fun, popcorn version of this story. Snyder was also influenced by Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, allowing the zombies to run. This must have been because of that film's success and try and make Dawn of the Dead more action packed.<br/><br/>A good remake and a good debut for Snyder."

","Horror goes in cycles, and as all circles, you always end up where you started. At times, they bombard us with Zombies, then Psychos, then demons, then haunted houses/spirits, etc and back. A few years ago, they did rejuvenate the zombie lore, and none pleased/scared me as much as the 2004 remake 'Dawn of the Dead.' Yes, I loved 'Shaun of the Dead' as well, but that was more dark-humor. 'Dawn' follows very closely the Romero original: All hell breaks loose, literally, one ""dawn"" and a group of survivors hold up in a shopping mall to figure out what to do, how to escape, survive and/or get rescued. Gone is the social commentary that had a lot of fans disappointed. Though I am a fan of the original, I wasn't one that was let down. I liked this one for the acting and realistic fear-factor. (In reality, I'd rather be up against Romero's zombies; you could all-but walk past them whereas here, if they see you, it's probably too late.) Polley: I love her! ('Go' is one of my favorites.) She is an excellent actress. Rhames was powerful. But probably the key element was Weber, whose very screen presence was astonishing. The rest of the group wasn't bad, but I think they did try their own social commentary by coincidentally putting all walks of life together, no two alike. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it's one I've seen at least a half-dozen times. Gore, soundtrack (this one introduced me to one of my now all-time-favorite songs: 'The Man Comes Around'), realism and tension all worked for me. Word to the wise: I didn't like to see the epilogue, so if you don't want to know what happens in the aftermath, stop the film when the credits roll."
"svmpsguy","9","0","1","15 October 2009"," Superior to Romero
","Note: my opinions will cause a furor to die hard fans of the original.<br/><br/>I am old enough to remember watching Romero's original. Even as a teen, it struck me that the acting was bad, the zombies looked blue and some of the pacing was poor. The scope of this movie feels much bigger.<br/><br/>Synders remake is superior in every way. Starting with the cast. the acting is just fine for the horror genre. The characters are less cardboard and cartoony than in Romeros. The effects are consistent and more realistic. The zombies are far higher quality and in more advanced states of decay, not just ""blue"". In this version, the zombies run. This didn't sit will with fans of the original. Given that the undead are a relentless menace that can be anywhere, this story amps them up. They have primitive hunting skills, strength like a human on meth, and they don't hesitate. They can climb and perform simple tasks. They are far more believable as a menace than slow, dumb, ambling zombies. you can't just pie these zombies in the face like a black comedy, they will run you down. They will stalk you like a rabid wolf, so you can't just cross an fence or climb a ladder and be safe.<br/><br/>This films pace is far better, it does not lag like the original. The sub plot of Andy in his gun shop is masterful addition to play off in the story. You feel genuine sympathy for the character. You also feel a sense of hope when the cast develops a solution to escaping the mall situation. When they are escaping, there is a iconic scene of throngs of zombies you won't forget. It's an awesome spectacle that really sells the idea that they are outnumbered 400,000 to 1 by the undead.<br/><br/>This movie does not resort to camp like the original, and there is a lot of action, and a lot of gore. It has a much glossier feel to it than the original and holds up to repeated viewings much better. I suggest you watch it in black and white for a different experience. This is the best (serious) zombie movie since night of the living dead. it is underrated by the rabid fans of the original. Young people who see this version first will not enjoy the original. They will look at the original as a cheap movie with slow, stupid zombies. If you like zombie movies, this is top shelf."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","2","13 October 2009"," Largely a popcorn flick, but one of the better ones
","I base this upon the Director's Cut. However, I saw this at the theater, as well. There are new story sequences(among other things, making CJ likable), and the movie also gets bloodier. This remake of the 1978 classic that it shares a title with has the zombies running(I think which appears more comical is a matter of taste), and takes a stylized approach(note that it is not as indulgent as what Zach did on 300 and Watchmen, I believe he reserves that for graphic novel adaptations), without the form overshadowing the content. Apart from a marvelous look and awesome action(there are those that would say that it overshadows the horror; just don't forget, this has plenty of creepiness, jump scares that pay off, unforgettable disturbing content and bone-chilling atmosphere, also it adds stuff that, if it has been seen before in the sub-genre, it's certainly been a long time since it was), this actually does engage the viewer, and at least for the 100 minute running time, you care about these people, though you'll definitely find some to hate(and this does use a couple of clich√©s). Snyder is no Romero, but to be fair, he really isn't trying to be. He's got his own voice, and it's nicely distinctive without attracting too much attention to itself. This goes for comedy to a greater extent than the 'real' ""Dead"" films, and typically succeeds. There is a little satire, and it's spot-on, perfectly delivered. The acting is mixed. There are a couple of impeccable performances. The pace is even, and mostly quite fast. This never loses your interest, and, for the right audience, it is a satisfying viewing experience. There is graphic and brutal gore, brief nudity, a moderate amount of strong language, and of course what I've already mentioned. The DVD comes with an introduction to the version, five deleted scenes, three featurettes(one of them, along with Andy's Lost Tape, have separate pages here on the site, and I will comment on them there), and a cringe-inducingly corny and overlong production called Special Report.

","Well I apologize to all those fans out there that loved this movie but I hated it. I was expecting it to be really cool, which it was pretty cool for the first half hour but then it collapsed into a meaningless heap of zombie heads being blown off and confusion. I must admit that i was extremely tired when i watched this movie, and so i even fell asleep a few times. Maybe because of this it made less sense to me, but my friend, who did not fall asleep said it made no sense to him either. One of the major points of oddity is that i fell asleep for like a minute, while there were zombies been blown up on screen, and when I awoke, there was a naked lady running on a treadmill and happy music and cheery people. It was most confusing. This film also practices the art of repetition a lot. Such as: 'Oh look! A zombie! Shoot it's head off! Oh no! another zombie! shoot out it's brains! What's that heading towards us? oh! It's another zombie! shoot off it's head!' Yes, the blood effects and head shots look quite effective and realistic, but alas, this is not enough to make a good movie. In terms of storyline, this film had none, and although it provides you with a couple of possibilities as to why there are zombies running around, it never explains which is the correct one, and how the undead came to be. May i also add that if this movie was intended to be scary, it had quite the opposite effect, and may i suggest that Zack Snyder enrols in a career of comedy?"

","and it is significantly better than the Romero version. That will hurt a lot of people to hear, but this movie is, quite simply put, the best zombie movie ever made. It is so for 4 main reasons.<br/><br/>1. Characters. The characters are fantastic and well thought out. You learn more about them going through the movie, but you don't learn too much as to waste time finding out about insignificant details. Rather than be a commentary on society like Romero's, you see more of the personal conflicts of each character and see how they grow.<br/><br/>2. Plot. You don't learn too much about what is actually causing the zombies, which is nice in this genre. It means that no one had to spend a whole bunch of time coming up with a scientifically plausible reason for the zombies being around, all that your given is the basics. You find out what causes people to become a zombie, what a zombie looks and acts like and how to kill a zombie. Nothing overly complicated or to be puzzled about. They are the zombies, either shoot them or run away. That's it.<br/><br/>So what's it about if it's not about a cure? Escape. Where to go to be safe? Are the doors locked? How can we get away? The plot focuses on demonstrating the circumstances are becoming more and more dire and the characters should be (and do) becoming increasingly desperate. As there is no time spent on explaining why, time is spent focusing on the surroundings, survival and what to do next. The immediacy and imminence of everything that occurs in the movie also serves to make sure the audience aren't bored or spend too much time thinking ""that's what I'd do in that situation"", they just hold their breath and hope their favourite character makes it.<br/><br/>3. Special effects. On the DVD there is a great section on each of the main zombie ""splatters"" which really makes you appreciate even more the special effects in the movie. They are brilliantly and seamlessly filmed and only add to the fear and panic being experienced by the viewer on behalf of the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>4. (and my favourite part) the soundtrack. Amazing and satirical, this soundtrack probably requires a bit of a musical knowledge to appreciate. But from the man in black to lounge against the machine, the music just suits what is going on in the movie. Unlike other Snyder movies, such as Watchmen, the soundtrack doesn't detract from the happening in the movie or overwhelm the viewers when watching a fight scene by distracting them with a popular song they no doubt will recognise. The subtle satire and use of a normally loud song played softly is nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>Truly, the main thing Snyder did that really makes this movie worth watching is not try to copy Romero in any way in his movie. This is simply a namesake, that has zombies and that's it.<br/><br/>A sensational, awe inspiring flick. And to top it off, there isn't your classic good guys get away ending. Its great that it just gets left hanging."

","A worldwide plague, of which there seems to be no cure and questionable origins, brings humanity to it's knees. Symptoms include death, depravity,bloodshed, insanity. Amidst the chaos, a group of survivors take shelter in a local mall, and it is here they search for the hope of a 'normal' life once again. However, the dead never cease to knock on their doors...<br/><br/>Call it blasphemy, but I am not the biggest fan of George A. Romero's original Dawn of the Dead. It ran too long, the zombies where to blue, and the tone was to tipsy. Now it is a great zombie film, however, needless to say I did not protested the announcement of this film, an updated, action packed, character orientated zombie film which, pardon the pun, breathes life into a dying genre.<br/><br/>The original Dawn of the Dead began in the midst of the outbreak, with characters aware that something wrong was happening and their world was falling apart around them. This new dawn begins much more innocently: Our heroine, a young nurse by the name of Ana, played by the very pretty Sarah Polley, is completely unaware anything is amiss until the problem shows up on her front door- and then through the door and tearing into her bedroom. The first 20 minutes of this film are pure chaos, as this young women sees her world crashing, burning, and screaming all around her.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead is a thrill ride, a real roller coaster of a movie. It is at times genuinely suspenseful, at times gory, at times oddly humorous, and at other times, quite tragic and touching. Sarah Polley does a great job as the lead, she handles herself well and is a blast to watch, while Ving Rhymes macho, no nonsense attitude and his dominating presence absolutely bleeds through the screen onto the audience's lap. The cast does a good job of working with various emotions, and the actors (and characters) in this show are as convincing to the audience when they bond and struggle to maintain a sense of hope, as when they struggle and war against the masses of the undead.<br/><br/>And speaking of the undead, Dawn of the Dead has plenty of them, and these ain't your daddy's zombies. The slow, lurching zombies of Romero's film are no where in sight; instead we are treated to an onslaught of faster, deadlier, but just as hungry, undead. Now the debate of 'fast zombies vs slow zombies' rages to this day, and though I do prefer the 'classic' zombie, mostly for their rustic charm, these running zombies fit the action orientated tone of the film to an undead T. And though this film is not the first to feature these quick moving killers (1985's Return of the Living Dead comes immediately to mind, and even the original Dawn of the Dead featured one scene with running zombies), it defiantly employs them unlike any other.<br/><br/>Now I do have some faults with this horror show: The middle of the film had quite a safe feel, and though this was probably intentional to up the climax, it didn't quite groove with me. The very end of the film was some what of a let down; it almost seemed like a lot of build up to nothing.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead serves not only as an improvement over the original, but also as one of the greatest undead films of the 21st century.

","In short: yes. Dawn (as I will refer to it) is not only one of the best zombie films ever made, it is one of the best films ever made. I realise that may sound like an exaggeration, considering it's not even in IMDb's top 250, but please, bear with me. Dawn has the most efficient and effective introduction of any film I have seen. For a start, it has extreme clarity. It doesn't treat you like an idiot, but doesn't force you to think about what's going on, which lets you concentrate on the unfolding horror/drama. It's also very short, yet doesn't leave out any unnecessary facts, and allows you to immediately bond with the characters. When you think about it, most other films either spend a great deal of time on characterisation, or go straight into the action, sacrificing emotional attachment. This doesn't. Then there are the zombies. A HUGE number of people complained about the fact that they run. Why? As a non-supernatural horror movie (it's implied that the zombification is caused by a virus), speed equals scares. The original Dawn, as much as I loved it, was a bit too light-hearted (yes, I know it was a satire, but a satire can be deep, too) with the main characters pushing over zombies and literally walking right past them. Fast zombies also make the film more believable; you can't imagine slow zombies actually causing the end of civilisation, can you? Finally, there's the characters. Sarah Polley is brilliant in the female lead, showing wit, ingenuity and emotion, and Ty Burrell (the guy who plays Steve) is genuinely funny. The script is also brilliant: believable, funny and, at times, heart-rendering, it easily stands up to the original."

","Anyone who has seen any zombie flicks will agree with me when I say that this is the best zombie movie period. And only for one specific reason. The zombies are VIOLENT!!! They run and scream at you with a bloody horrific quality. If you are looking for the zombies that walk at you and moan like they are having intercourse, this is not the movie for you! This movie also starts off with action right out of the gate.

Like many of the already seen zombieflicks, This movie has almost none of an explanation background. But The young director shows how you can turn something already seen lots of times, into something new and original.

","DotD is not nearly as scary as it is haunting. It masterfully paints a small world from the start, so it shrinks at an alarming rate once the excrement hits the oscillator. The zombies become an overwhelming antagonist, closing in on the survivors fast enough to make you realize they simply postponed their deaths.<br/><br/>The acting is what you would expect. Nothing horrendous, but nothing great. There are some lines here and there that will make you roll your eyes, but nothing that makes you grind your teeth. I like the absence of recognizable actors (with the exception of Ving Rhames and Mehki Phifer, of course) because it adds to the illusion that this kind of nightmare could come true.<br/><br/>My one real gripe with the film is that it is unabashedly violent. It takes any and every opportunity to splatter some gore, and it gets tiresome toward the end. I'm not complaining that it desensitizes the audience (even though it does), just that it looses its coolness after a while.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead isn't perfect. It suffers from a lot of nasty Hollywoodisms and abuses just about every horror movie tactic in the book. Spooky sound effects, inhuman screeches, close-ups of bullet casings hitting the floor... (And, of course, everybody become expert marksmen when it comes to head shots.) Still, it succeeds in what it sets out to do: scare the hell out of the audience."

","I am a big, big, big zombie fanatic. I have a lot of and have seen a lot of zombie movies. I have not been a fan of the remakes though. I watched the remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and was greatly disappointed. Reasons being that they changed to much of the story. For example, (SPOILER!!) no one made it out of the house alive in the original, but in the remake Barbra is the gun toting bada** at the end of the movie. That chick was in a coma for almost the entire movie in the original. Anyway, back to what I was saying, remakes normally suck because to much is changed around and the original idea is lost. The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" keeps the original idea of the movie and builds off of it instead of changing it. Yes, the beginning was different, but it was a quick lead up to the mall. People goto the mall, people live in the mall, people leave the mall. That was the idea. A group of people trying to survive the worst thing possible and trying not to kill each other in the process. I do have to admit, of all the zombie flicks I have seen I prefer to see the running, faster type zombies because before that I always just thought ""just run through them"". When Ana's husband started chasing the car, I will never forget the reaction of the other people in the theater when I first saw it. Some were gasping and others were laughing. We had never seen a zombie run like that before. There is a much more action in the remake that keeps things going. I know that the remake of ""Day of the Dead"" is about to be out soon, and I am hoping that lightning will strike twice with this series. I would love to see another action packed thrill ride like I did with ""Dawn"". Lets just hope they build on the idea and not destroy it."

","An exceptionally fun, zombie-slaying time. It sticks to the basic horror formula of 'Everything is fine, turmoil, everything is good again, huge problem, attempt to solve it, happy ending' but makes everything a lot more fun and gory than the average weekly gorefest. The performances are all pretty nice, notably a surprising turn from Sarah Polley into a much more mainstream environment, and no one really distracts from the story of the film. All of the gore and violent scenes are very well done and are some of the best entertainment of the decade. Attempts at a more supernatural form of horror, like the baby delivery, are poorly done and tend to take you out of the thrill of the rest of the film but they are few and far in between. It gets a bit dull at time, but as always, the final act is exhilarating and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The finale is bittersweet and a perfect end to the picture."

The remake of the original Dawn Of The Dead was done splendidly and is very scary. Scenes range from a quiet and calm morning turned chaotic to a dark and forlorn parking garage scene that chills to the bone.<br/><br/>The whole movie is an atmosphere of despair and the characters struggle to overcome the fact that life as they know it has ended. There are nay-sayers who state that the movie slows down and is boring in some instances and there may be some weight to that argument but during these times there are essential character developments that take place.<br/><br/>New technology allows the zombie scene's to take shape in a graphic and visceral form and the cinematography makes the movie move coherently and solidly. This movie is indeed very addictive and I do own it on DVD.

","The main character Ana, played by Sarah Polley was just unconvincing. She serves as the moral one of the group, a know-it-all about the Zombie plague, unless the other characters were as brain-dead as the Zombies howling for the flesh, i could not see how this group could have thought up the idea of the mall. I'd have a rough guess that she would have figured the head shot out if had not been for television. Don't think I'm sexist but i cannot believe that a woman, who is a nurse at a hospital, survived to the point that she got to the mall. *Spoiler* When her group goes into the mall and are attacked by the first Zombie, not only did she pick up the fallen shotgun and wound the zombie despite the fact that there was another guy there with a gun, but she didn't give the shotgun back to the trained professional who had a shallow cut on his wrist, not a accuracy dampening wound. This era of female hero's can be believable if played by good characters, if Jennifer Garner played this role, not only would it have worked it would have been a bigger hit. Throughout the siege Ana single-handedly figures out that the bites transfer the infection and guilts and manipulates Michael. Overall, Ana's character was just unconvincing.<br/><br/>I must add that getting a head shot is extremely hard unless you are a professional, and honestly the only looking professional there was Kenneth, and Andy (but he owns a gun shop, he has training). I noticed that most shots in the movie hit their marks making this group better then an average Army fire team, despite being a Security guard, a nurse, a thief, a truck driver, a Jackass (Steve), his girlfriend?, etc."

"ZeldaFan2929","8","0","1","22 June 2007"," Now this is how remakes are done!
","Ana (Sarah Polly) is a hard-working nurse; after countless hours of sleepless work she goes home to her normal suburban home to be with her husband. All seems well, life is great and everything is near-perfect. Randomly all of a sudden her neighbor's young daughter shows up ""not as herself"" and attacks her husband and before Ana knows it, her husband is a mindless being trying to kill her. She manages to escape and as she does, she witnesses total chaos as many people have become mindless flesh eaters as her husband has. As she tries to find someplace to go, she finds a police officer named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and the two find more survivors and take refuge in a local shopping mall in ""Dawn of the Dead"", the 2004 remake of George A. Romero's 1978 horror classic.<br/><br/>I like a few remakes, but quite a few are also complete garbage. Remakes of ""When a Stranger Calls"" and ""Black Christmas"" really suck where as others like ""Psycho"" and ""The Fog"" are at least mildly respectable. Classic '80's remakes such as ""The Thing"", ""The Fly"", and ""The Blob"" were great ones as was the recent ""King Kong"" remake, which I will say is definitely better than the original. 2004's remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a nice surprise as it seemed to have all the ingredients to make a remake good. It keeps the basic plot of the original with many little tributes to the original (such as Ken Foree of the original having a cameo restating the famous line ""When there's is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth"") while being a very different movie at the same time. Even George A. Romero, who did the original said he thought this would suck but admitted that he kinda liked it. The biggest difference from the original is the zombies themselves; in the original (as well as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Day of the Dead"", and ""Land of the Dead"") they were slow, brainless, and looked dead. The new zombies have normal complexion for the most part, run extremely fast, and are very aggressive. While the others are more or less ""classic"" zombies, these are probably scarier. Movies don't scare me but there was this one scene in a pitch-black parking garage that zombies eventually filled into was really intense. Also, there are quite a few characters in this one as opposed to the four in the first.<br/><br/>Acting in this film is very good for the most part especially from leads Sarah Polly and Ving Rhames. Ving's character Kennith I'm assuming is named after actor Ken Foree who's character in the original (I think) was a police officer as well. Characters for the most part are likable and it is hard to see a lot of them die, though of course there or a few putrid ones who you can't wait to see get eaten. The movie is quite gruesome as you may have imagined; the only way to kill zombies to to shut down brain activity so there are plenty of exploding heads. Aside from that there is no actual ""gore"" in the film but there is plenty of blood, filmmakers were very generous in that department. It's not the greatest movie in the world but aside from the fact that it's not the original film there isn't much holding it back. I was kind of disappointed with the ending though. I apologize if you may consider this a spoiler but the endings of both versions of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" had sad endings but basically said that humanity will overcome this ordeal and this version ended like ""Day of the Dead"" saying that we're all screwed. I herd that Day of the Dead was depressing long before I saw it and it didn't ruin the movie for me so that is why I mention that. Both the original ""Day of the Dead"" and this remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" are still very good movies so I suggest you check them out.<br/><br/>*Note that the only version of the film I saw was the Unrated Directors Cut, which has more gore and character development as the director says in the introduction on the DVD so I recommend that that is the version you see.<br/><br/>The Breakdown: <br/><br/>PROS: Excellent gore and special effects, plenty of bloodshed, good acting, a pretty creepy film, lots of depth in characters, cameos from a few members of the cast of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", and is one of the better remakes out there. <br/><br/>CONS: Zombies are complete opposites (fast, aggressive) from their Romero counterparts (slow, dumb) (this can be a pro or a con), a depressing conclusion, not quite as good as the 1978 original classic.<br/><br/>OVERALL: The 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is very well done as far as remakes go. It is a fairly creepy and very thrilling movie. If you can stomach the violence you should definitely check this out. It may not be the original but it has everything a good remake should have. I didn't expect to like it that much but I was very surprised.<br/><br/>Unrated: Graphic Violence/Gore, Languege, an Sexuality; Runtime: 110 minutes; Score: 8/10"
"zardoz-13","9","0","2","22 June 2007"," Snyder's 100-minute remake equals the imaginative, but bloated 126-minute original and surpasses it in several respects
","Although Zack Snyder has produced only a handful of television commercials for Chevy Blazer, Budweiser, the NFL Quarterback Club, and BMW, this first-time helmer makes a stunning directorial debut with his super-charged, high-octane, blood-drenched remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (***1/2 out of ****), zombie-master George Romero's low-budget, classic cannibal chiller sequel to his 1968 seminal undead black & white opus ""Night of the Living Dead."" Hard as it may be to imagine, Snyder's 100-minute remake equals the imaginative, but bloated 126-minute original and surpasses it in several respects. Naturally, Snyder benefits from conspicuous computer-generated special effects (not available to Romeo in 1978), a $28-million budget, and a fabulous cast featuring Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, Mekhi Phifer, and Jake Weber. The only blunder in scenarist James Gunn's screenplay is the irrational sentimentality one character attaches to a canine. Can anybody forget the scene in ""Alien"" when Sigourney Weaver put herself in peril to rescue that darn cat? Well, pretty much the same thing occurs here smack in the middle of an adrenaline-laced action scene, and you want to shout back at the screen to stop such stupidity. Such is the visceral power of this entertaining but ghoulish ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake. Compared with the shuffle-footed zombies of Romero's trilogy, Snyder's zombies rush their victims headlong like the defensive line of the Green Bay Packers on first and goal. Despite this unfortunate animal-lover's clich√©, Snyder and Gunn have churned out one of the more riveting zombie movies in years. Forget those recent, reanimated efforts in the same direction by Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil"" and Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later."" Unlike its prestigious, path-breaking predecessor, who belongs to the independent, non-Hollywood film category, Snyder's mainstream Tinseltown remake fondly cherishes many of Romero's ideas when it isn't taking a different track. A group of unglamorous but heroic characters and Matthew F. Leonetti's grainy, stark widescreen photography give this macabre but mindless melodrama a hypnotic, hair-raising presence punctuated with bouts of satire.<br/><br/>Whereas the original ""Dawn"" opened with a S.W.A.T team blowing zombies away before the heroes flew away in a helicopter to the comparative safety of a Pennsylvania shopping mall, the hyperactive remake takes place in a Wisconsin mall. As the story unfolds, an overworked nurse, Ana (Sarah Polley of ""Go""), gets off work and heads home to her hubby for sex in the shower. During her hospital shift, she saw and heard about patients with mysterious bite wounds, but she missed all the special bulletins about a developing epidemic where these people die and come back to life as zombies. No, these aren't the traditional voodoo zombies from movies like ""White Zombie"" (1932) or ""Plague of the Zombies"" (1966). Instead, these undead dudes arise from an inexplicable virus or disease. In Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead,"" newscasters speculated that a contaminated satellite probe back from space resurrected the dead. Nobody knows for sure in this ""Dawn"" remake, and when Ana and her husband awaken the following morning to find her preteen daughter standing in their doorway with blood stains on her nightie, part of her face eaten away and a powerful urge to gnaw human flesh. She attacks her dad, tears a hole in his throat, and blood flies everywhere. A terrified Ana tries to stem the fountain of blood. Suddenly, her husband's eyes take on a dull glow and he goes after her. She escapes, jumps into her car, and careens off into the dawn. Chaos rules everywhere. Explosions erupt; smoke billows in clouds, and berserk gore-smeared corpses chomp away at anybody. Eventually, Ana hooks up with a police sergeant, Kenneth (Ving Rhames of ""Pulp Fiction), a husband, Andre (Mekhi Phifer of ""Honey""), his wife Luda (Inna Korobkina of ""The Ladies Man"") and a salesman Michael (Jake Webber of ""Meet Joe Black"") and they take refuge in the Crossroads Mall. Initially, they run afoul of three trigger-happy security guards: CJ (Michael Kelly of ""Unbreakable""), Terry (Kevin Zegers of ""Wrong Turn""), and Bart (Michael Barry of ""Detroit Rock City ""). Predictably, these guys aren't happy to see them. They form an uneasy alliance and resolve their differences when thousands of zombies besiege them in the mall. No, a biker gang doesn't show up as in the original ""Dawn."" Instead, a truckload of other refugees shows up. Before the TV stations sign off, a preacher (Ken Foree of the original ""Dawn"") utters the line made famous in Romero's ""Dawn"": ""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth."" Unlike the original,too, the remake gives our heroes another, more interesting way out of their predicament that recalls the climax in the Clint Eastwood epic ""The Gauntlet.""<br/><br/>Shrewdly, Zack Snyder alternates scares with satire. Like the original, the heroes speculate that the zombies are flocking to the mall because it played a dominant role in their lives. Alas, this clever concept made the original ""Dawn"" a witty satire on the foibles of humanity. Synder's ""Dawn"" doesn't capitalize on it as much as Romeo's ""Dawn."" Instead, Snyder focuses on the alliance the occupants make before they break out and make a run for it. One scene that stands out involves the husband and wife. She gets bitten, but her husband hides her from the others. She turns into a hideous zombie and gives birth to a zombie baby. Mind you, if you like to dream sweet dreams, watching this ""Dawn"" is going to be a nightmare for you. There's blood, gore, and more, but none of these zombies feast on body parts with the oozing alacrity that Romeo's zombies did. While Romeo generated suspense in his version, Snyder gives us wall-to-wall suspense that will have you gnawing your fingers to the quick. Make-up artist Tom Savini, who handled the blood and gore in the original ""Dawn,"" has a cameo as a sheriff. Watching Zach Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is like taking a bullet in the head."
"severin72","5","0","1","18 March 2007"," Interesting cultural artifact.
","Just about every film has its good and bad points. This is the first one I can recall that lines them up in such a way that we start with the best and then decline inexorably to the worst. The opening is simply brilliant in concept and execution. The depiction of the world coming, to all intents and purposes, to an end while people go about their daily lives, the lack of explanation, and the depictions of wildly accelerating chaos to the tune of Johnny Cash's cunningly chosen ""When the man comes around"" are inspired. The characters behave sufficiently believably that the situation itself becomes real. About ten minutes in things are looking good - and then the problems set in. The choice of having the zombies be fast and rabid instead of lumbering makes them scarier and far more formidable antagonists and it taps in to the current fear of pandemics adding an edge of realism to the terror. The problem is that it makes the choice of a shopping mall as a suitable fortress even more unlikely than in the original. The idea these zombies would be unable to break right in doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It also makes it impossible to recreate the satire of consumerism that drove Romero to choose the mall as the setting for his 1978 film. No zombies wandering around the stores here. What we're left with is the ""small band of heroes battling monstrous horde"" template that fits equally well over, Aliens, Starship Troopers, Eight Legged Freaks - the list goes on, and it's not enough to sustain interest. The gore lacks the leering voyeurism of Romero's collaborations with Tom Savini (who, perhaps inevitably, has a cameo as a Sheriff) but, even if director Zack Snyder doesn't linger on it it's strong enough. The laboriously set up ""chainsaw accident"" is gratuitous and silly. The rest just becomes tiresome out of sheer repetition. If you can, skip the end credit sequence. Utterly pointless nudity and despair are tacked on for no better reason than ""because we could"". Just as ""Underworld: Evolution"" marked the sorry point at which we sank from films as two hour music videos to films as two hour video games there has to be some wretched significance in going from re-makes and sequels to re-makes OF sequels. Viewed in isolation this isn't an awful film it just constitutes further evidence that, as a culture, we're pretty much terminally out of ideas."

(Except C.J., easy name to remember!) Sarah Polley (ain't been in any good films apart from this one) who plays Ana, main female character, was not a very convincing performance, if i'm to be honest. Maybe the director (Zack Snyder, directed jack all before this) told her to show hardly any facial expression, but any way, she looks expressionless for most of the film.

It stuck to pretty much the same story as the original, where the characters go into a shopping mall and live as long as they can away from the flesh eating zombies, or living dead, and also, someone reuses the great tagline, ""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth. What really grips you besides the sight of faster, pretty much more sophisticated zombies and gory effects, is the characters. These include nurse Ana (Sarah Polley), (my favourite) cop Kenneth (Pulp Fiction's great Ving Rhames), Michael (Medium's Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), Steve (Ty Burrell), CJ (Michael Kelly), Terry (Kevin Zegers), Bart (Michael Barry), Nicole (Lindy Booth), Norma (Jayne Eastwood) and mall neighbour Tucker (Boyd Banks). Moments of this were good, including a pregnant woman who dies, becomes a zombie, and then just after she dies the baby is born, also a zombie. Good!"

","all is in my title... don't think that i don't know what is a remake... and don't think to that my great appreciation of the original Romero's movie blind me. As i saw this movie by total chance during a long December night i thought ahhh give it a try, it can't be worse than i think... but it was.. the first thing to see is a total broke of the rules of the game... (understand the code of classical horror movies... the movie count a lot of characters.. the are no suspense... no mind game... and the living deads runs as fast as hell lol... but again i thought that if that well made why not trying a new way of horror ? but it simply wasn't ! This movie is just another boredom American action movie.. no plot, just some guns and blood that's all folks even the atmosphere is boring... you can predict all that happen at every time....<br/><br/>If you haven't see the original, try it, even for young who prefers special effects than plot, this movies can make a serious impact (and don't walk in the street alone at night after lol)"
"greenflea2","10","0","1","14 January 2007"," Excellent zombie movie
","I giving ten out of ten for a zombie movie, this is a first as zombie movies are normally low budget trash, more worried about blood and gore, than a decent story line.<br/><br/>In general, a zombie plague spread via bites couldn't even take over the world, and could be easily contain by governments. So i find this hard to believe that zombies take over the world, unless it was something like bird flu. This movie does not waste time trying to explain how this plague started, none of the characters make any effort to work out, how did this all started.<br/><br/>In one scene, a group of survivors are discussing how the plague spreads, like by bites. Yet standing with them is Terry who has been watching a news board-cast that informs that the plague is spread by bites. Yet Terry says nothing and just stands there, like a zombie.<br/><br/>The movie is fast paced, full of action and never slows down, and gets boring. The story line is simple, a group of survivors hold up inside a shopping mall. I readied other people comments on why the survivors decided to leave the mall, that zombies are getting inside and food is running out. The fact is, zombies wasn't able to get inside the mall, and food wasn't in short supply. The reasons for wanting to leave, was daft, since the survivors was better off, staying were they are, not risking to leave, resulting in many of them been killed off. Of course they had to leave to bring more action to this movie, and dump off many characters in the progress.<br/><br/>Another fault is, why don't they tried early in the piece in rescuing Andy and getting his weapons, since there wasn't many zombies around at that stage. And they only want to rescue him after his own food supply has run out.<br/><br/>Another fault is, Anna has no problem in getting her truck over to the gun store, yet the two buses have many problems in escaping through the zombies.<br/><br/>Since its a mall, there would be countless radios, yet none of the survivors bother to listened to radios for any updates, or if there was any other survivors, which the reality is, there would be.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, this movie is the best zombie movie i have seem, it has a good budget, a director, cast, production, everything. Which is freakish for a zombie movie, which are always low budget trash."

","All in all this is a good movie. Enjoyable, original (well the same theme as its original but had new twists), exciting of whats going to happen next and the characters had personalities. You either liked then and wanted them to survive or hated them and couldn't wait for them to be bitten. (actually thats one slight downfall, not many did get bitten and i think its only Ana's husband at the start we see getting bitten).<br/><br/>The point about biting is one fault with the film, the other is a piece of blatant stating the bleeding obvious ever put into a movie, actually I'm nominating it for the Sybil Fawlty (see Fawlty Towers) Award For Stating the Bleeding Obvious. We are 40 minutes into a horror film about the living dead, people are being bitten (off screen) everywhere and turning quickly into zombies and Ana, the leading lady, states ""oh i think its the bites"". If id been on the cast, i would have ad-libed ""yeah well obviously"".<br/><br/>Apart from that, i love this film"
"Jakealope","9","0","1","18 October 2006"," Nothing Tops the Original, But in an Age of Lame Remakes
","This one is 1000x as good as the current spate of remakes of classics like the ""Hills Have Eyes"" or the ""Omen"" which is so derivative, why bother. Face it, Romero's original DotD was the greatest movie ever made, no debate. This movie can't reach that mark, of course. But Zach wisely recycled old zombie motifs, characters and settings but came up with something good and original.<br/><br/>Don't worry, there are tons of great zombie head shots, and I ain't referring to cameras. There is the coward, Steve, who screws the rest. There is the big black guy, Ken, who is tough, but isn't good at organizing. Mike is the main character: one of life's losers who has a good way with people and can foresee danger and new approaches, besides having a conscience. Ana, Sara Polley is cute and tough, but not like one of today's psycho woman Rambos. She is emotional and sensitive but understands that this ugly new reality requires extreme measures, which she learns to take. Besides, she brightens up the screen a bit. There is the bad-ass security guard CJ, who after his little tyranny is overthrown, becomes a tough fighter. By far, CJ has the best lines and pretty funny in his tough guy way;""You can take your ass over to the Quality Inn if it's still there, Shaq! "". Throw Andre, some black hustler, his pregnant Russian wife Luda, and a scrappy working class pair, a few girls and a Matt Frewer cameo, and you have a basic Canadian ensemble type of casting. Of course, the usual references to the original: ""tv spots"" by Scott Reninger, Ken Foree and Tom Savini(who recreates the sheriff from Night), Qualpeco truck, and Gaylen Ross boutique and you can see that Zach acknowledges his master. It is more serious than the original, without the zombie as consumer theme. The action scenes are great, but I could live without the slow motion shots of spent shell casings hitting the floor. Also, his zombies are speed freaks, not the lumbering, kinda harmless looking ones you'd expect. His one great scene of horror, the shootout with the crazy hustler and the truck driving woman which leads to the discovery of the newly born zombie baby. That was true horror with a minimum of gore. But Romero's low budget classic used a real mall and got real firemen, soldiers and cops to help out for free. His little crew worked for next to nothing. Though it is crude by today's cgi, it's semi guerrilla movie look is endearing. While this one, hardly a huge budget, has all the gloss the old one lacked, as well as having some good B level actors like Mekhi Phifer, Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley. a must for any horror buff, an absolute necessity for a zombie fan and a remake that won't hurt or upset any fans of the original."
"charchuk","9","0","1","1 September 2006"," Exhilarating, well-made, and very cool
","Quite entertaining, very well-made, and just plain cool. Though much more action than horror, and perhaps containing too much zombie killing and not enough social commentary, but this is mere nitpicking. The beginning is simply brilliant, from the opening attack scene to the driving scene, which is so well shot and just chilling in its depiction of the apocalypse. Not to mention the wicked credits, incorporating a Johnny Cash song into some memorable stock footage. The first 90 minutes or so of the film contains little action, but it serves the film well, as it would feel overdone. Case in point, the last twenty minutes are chocked full of such non-stop thrills that it's in dire need of a breath, but never gets one. The ending is just perfect, though, as it's just as uncompromising as the rest of the film. The acting is about as good as one can expect, and the direction is just awesome. All in all, a solid remake and an exhilarating film."

","They so need a sequel but this time keep it fast paced. the only problem with dawn of the dead was the scenes i wanted to last were over too quickly. They should have shown more world chaos like NY engulfed in zombies and more scenes of people being attacked in her town. For a sequel the beginning apocalypse should last a good 20 mins as we are given groups of characters we think will live but after the initial zombie breakout it is whiddled down to the movies main characters. Also more scenes of hopelessness the zombies is scary because he is relentless...exploit that.<br/><br/>Finally don't slow it down in the middle keep the escape going through the whole movie moving from safe spot to safe spot. the ending did this well but again it was only for a few minutes.

"Alex-372","8","0","1","25 August 2006"," Pretty Good Genre Movie
","DAWN OF THE DEAD starts of as Shawn Of The Dead 2, way too comical and off the cuff. However, once characters are established, the movie quickly becomes far more involving. Camera work is used very effectively to create tension. Tension is also helped by the fact that the characters aren't asked to do too many stupid things, which always undermines the credibility and tension of the movie - you start to figure they deserve whatever they get.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, from Sarah Polley (Go), to Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phiffer, the great Jake Weber (""Medium"", The Cell), Micheal Kelly and a very hot Kim Poirier (and born in the eighties too, how time flies). Sarah Polley alternatingly looks like Anna Faris and, for those of us who remember the eighties, Joanne Whalley (""Edge Of Darkness"").<br/><br/>Even though the entire Zombie theme has been done to death, there are some very real improvements made in this movie, and some incoherences too. For instance, none of the survivors have seen a zombie movie before (which is odd, as they're starring in one). Also, they are in a mall - plenty of food and water, but no gun shop? No fresh clothes? An improvement over earlier versions is the sheer number of zombies. Odds are stacked against the main characters too, because the zombies only have to wound them, while they have to shoot them in the head or decapitate them. The zombies have also gone from lumbering corpses, to being able to run at full speed. They're still telekinetic, as thousands of them seem to detect the presence of live humans and congregate on their hideouts.<br/><br/>Considering that the first zombie movie of the modern movie era, Night Of The Living Dead, was made in 1968 (when most of the actors were either in being born or unborn for years to come), the movie holds up pretty well, and is still a vehicle through which to examine modern society, as it was then. And of course it is impossible to watch this movie and not think of Hurricane Katrina, which struck a year after this movie was made."

"RainofMagic","9","0","1","20 August 2006"," One of my favorite horror films.
","I know it's very rare that a near all-around decent film comes out of this genre. Especially from it's sub genre (zombies). Almost from the start this film had a lot of decent fright sequences and especially gore. One of the beginning scenes where the little girl bites Anna (Sarah)'s husband still actually freaks me out a bit. I was actually a little surprised when I first watched this film. I've learned; after watching several horror films, to lower my standards a bit when judging them. They almost always have less drama, character development, and lower-grade acting then other movies. However, this is one movie that hits above average when it comes to horror films. It is a bit overly-gory sometimes, and the characters don't really have a whole lot of background or personality. Most of them simply get picked off after having a few scenes each. That was actually the main flaw I saw in this movie. Even the main characters have little development, other than being people that came to a city mall during the zombie crisis.<br/><br/>The ending was rather interesting however. I mean the ending that continued even into the credits. It also seems to warrant a sequel as it's unsure if the last 4 characters survived or not.. I think I can safely say that this is one remake that at least lives up to, if not surpasses; the original. Making the zombies fast moving and slightly more intelligent than previous zombie movies was a good move in my opinion. It sort of reminded me of 28 Days Later in that aspect. The zombies are more frightening when they can actually catch someone on the run (and even keep up with moving cars!). Blood runs rampant in this movie, so it's definitely not for the weak of heart. It still remains to be one of my favorite horror movies, and an overall top-tier horror movie in my opinion."

","This is a great movie. I haven't seen the original 1978 one, so I can't say whether or not this is a ""good"" remake of the '78 version.

I was on the edge of my seat for just about the entire movie, and enjoyed every minute of it. Once it was done, I just wanted to see more, and more. I had never seen a zombie movie before, and didn't know they could be so fun.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.

","when i heard that dawn of the dead was being remade, the first thing i thought was: philistines! how could anybody mess with such a classic? then i watched it. oh. my. god. this film kicks undead ass! it will never truly live up to the original, but it's so good that it doesn't have to. this stands on its own two decomposing feet as a cinematic triumph. i have been let down so often by horror films in recent years that i was expecting to feel completely underwhelmed by the new dawn. instead, i sat entranced with a grin on my face so wide that it was threatening to decapitate me. from the moment Vivienne the neighbour girl gave the heroine a very rude awakening, i knew that this wasn't going to be your average shambling zombie flick. child zombies would have been frowned upon until very recently and as for fast zombies, at last! older films have a certain Pepe le pew-like quality, with the poor victims running for their lives while the zombies move about as quickly as the average post office queue, yet still manage to catch them. i was delighted to see so many references to the original, including a couple of cast members being resurrected. the news reports on the DVD edition gave the film a much more realistic feel, plus some decent back-plot. the characters were believable and well-rounded, with the possible exception of luda (did she annoy anyone else or was that just me?). scenes such as the zombie version of celebrity squares lightened the tone of the film, balancing nicely with the harshness of the birth scenes. there is more to recommend this film than i could possibly mention here. it's an instant classic, worthy of the great George Romero himself. the director's cut is a must for true fans, Andy's tape is pure gold, a marvellous account of a solitary man's descent into despair and mild insanity. that alone is reason enough to buy this film. if you haven't already seen it, do it now, don't wait till you're undead!"
"Arc_J","8","0","1","9 August 2006"," Not a terrible film, but different.
","I've been a George A. Romero fan for years now. When I first heard Zack Snyder was remaking Dawn of the Dead back in 2004, I was skeptical but excited. His film disappointed me a bit, but only because I was holding it to the standard George Romero created with his 1978 film. The main thing to remember is: Zack Snyder and George Romero are two different people, and the 1978 and 2004 versions of Dawn of the Dead are two different films.<br/><br/>Basically the premise is the same. In fleeing from the zombie-creating plague, a group of people takes refuge in a shopping center.<br/><br/>For me, personally, the worst thing about the entire film was the character development -- or lack thereof. In Romero's version, there were four main characters: Peter, Fran, Stephen, and Roger. With a low amount of characters, it's easy for a viewer to relate to them, to learn along with them. <br/><br/>In Snyder's version, there are over a dozen: Ana, Michael, Kenneth, Andre, Luda, CJ, Terry, Bart, Norma, Tucker, Frank, Nicole, Monica, Steve, Glen, and Andy. With such a large number of characters, it becomes more difficult for the filmmaker to give any of them significant depth. No one in the movie has any sort of revealed ""past"", except for Ana's, whose past is limited to the first 20 minutes of the film, and Michael, whose past is limited to the few statements he makes in one scene about being a great father and terrible husband. <br/><br/>For all it's worth, the greatest showing of any kind of human bonding was between Kenneth and the owner of the gun store across the street, Andy. The director's cut includes a bonus feature which details Andy's last few days -- This lent a comparatively large amount of depth to his character -- But only when compared to the small amount of development the others received.<br/><br/>The film DID hold something for fans of zombie flicks -- The zombies. They look better now, owing to the differences in special effects between 1978 and 2004. None of the zombies holds any real significance, however, except for Luda when she turns. Romero's zombies were always more pitied, more sad -- Stuck in that miserable existence. They were still only ""motorized instinct"", but they seemed to have more depth. Maybe it's just me, but depth means a lot to me in a movie, and especially a remake of one of my favorites.<br/><br/>Snyder's Dawn is worth watching for fans of zombie films, but don't expect George Romero, because that's not what you get with Snyder."

But I'm so glad my zombie flick & horror fiend friend recommended this film to me, truly. I can even call it one of my favorite films.<br/><br/>It's a very character-based and focused film. This is not a bad thing, at all, it's what makes and shapes the film and it's the one thing that makes it stand out over all other zombie flicks. In my opinion it's what makes it superior. You get to know the characters, you live with them, you fear with them, you laugh with them.. It's almost as if you're one of them - that's the mood every horror film hopes to reach but often fail to.<br/><br/>The acting performances are good and even the tiny bit of romance works in the context of the film really well.

","2004's Dawn of the Dead is possibly the greatest horror movie ever. In 1968 indie filmmaker George A. Romero reinvented horror movies with the cult classic Night of the Living Dead. A few years later he brought the sequel Dawn of the Dead, still one of the highest grossing independent films ever. Director Zach Snyder keeps up the tradition with his 2004 remake of the classic. Snyder's simplistic idea of zombies running brought a whole new kind of terror to our generation. Instead of pussy-footing' around, this movie jumps straight into the action and oh is it sweet. This movie has possibly the greatest opening credits in movie history. The movie still has the same scenario of survivors trapped in a shopping mall which is surrounded by flesh-eating monsters. The actors performances allow you to get sucked into this movie all the sooner. I love everything about this movie, especially the color of this film. The makeup effects in this film are spectacular. The original theme of the film was about humans never being satisfied and the remake does keep this theme and also gives it an Alamo feel. Dawn of the Dead is non-stop horror action and truly gives justice to the original and should not be missed. I hope Zach Snyder is here to stay because he seems to be one of the few directors who knows what he is doing. If you only see one horror movie in your entire life make it this one. I give dawn of the dead 10 stars out of 10."

Some good action scenes.Some nice bits of black comedy.For the most part.But never engages as well as the gripping first 15 minutes and bogs down.The ending is so-so.And the tacked on post-credits ending smells of studio meddling.Some of the characters act without reason at times.<br/><br/>Acting is top-notch.Sarah Polley,Ving Rhames,Jake Webber being the standouts.Familiar faces populate the new Dawn also.And pretty much everyone involved does a great job.It always nice to see Lindy Booth back on the big Screen.<br/><br/>The Zombies are very well done here.These are not the stragglers we are used to.The sound and Look totally intimidating.Very scary and lean and mean.I just cannot get past why they had to have them run.It kind of takes away from the movie.<br/><br/>First time director Zack Synder hits a home-run with the bases loaded his first time out.The movie looks great.He was the best man for the job.Some Hack would have screwed it up.Michael bay anyone?

"Twisted_T","8","0","1","15 October 2005"," Very well done, but one problem............
","Zombies can't run. It took the scariness out of the whole movie. The movie, overall was excellent, but the running zombies distracted me from the real scary parts.<br/><br/>I believe that George A Romero (pretty much creator of the zombie genre) would agree with me, the running zombies were a put-down. The reason zombies can't run is because their brain reacts too slowly. Yes, they may be able to run, I mean with healthy joints and muscles, but they don't because it's just something they don't do.<br/><br/>The redeeming qualities of this movie were:(spoilers!!! be warned!!!) Great cinematic value. The zombie baby (which I predicted in the first 20 min. of the movie). The ending. The ending was very well done. I loved it. I liked how James Gunn, the writer, had the surviving characters go on a boat (which is mentioned in the original movie, the part with the cops, you know the one) and then the characters get killed. Perfect for this movie.<br/><br/>Oh, almost forgot, the whole underlying concept of the original movie was forgotten. Yeah, the story is pretty much the same, but they forgot the moral to the story. If you have ever seen the original, you know what I mean."

","When I first rented this film, I was astounded. Simply astounded. I found this film to be the best zombie film that I had seen in ages. The effects were amazing, and the story was riveting.<br/><br/>In the film, it appears as though a young woman works as a nurse who wakes up one morning and finds out that almost every single person is a flesh-eating zombie who wishes to bite the other people that they too, may be the undead. With this happening, she drives off, hoping to escape, but crashes her car, only to be rescued by a police officer, a pregnant woman and her husband, and a man who once sold televisions. The five seek refuge in a mall, and are almost refused by some security guards, who the five civilians imprison to save themselves, and save a truckload of some refugees who escaped the zombies' wrath, when they lock up the place. With this, the zombies stay tirelessly and relentlessly outside of the mall in the hopes of capturing the people inside, while the people themselves have a multitude of conflicts within the building.<br/><br/>This film is clearly for those who enjoy a horror with a plot twist in it. One such flaw with this film is that it depicts zombies in a different direction than that which most fans are acclimated to seeing. While the story itself has its weak points, it is not without its good sides."

","I have no soap-box to stand on regarding the original version and this remake, I looked at this as an entirely unrelated film and this review is without fanboy mailce.<br/><br/>First impressions.. bloody brilliant! It was high-octane and genuinely unsettling, the whole running-zombies doesn't cause me any concern either - admittedly some die-hard zombie fans were unimpressed but I think the majority will find them believable and quite acceptable. The opening shots in particular were a joy to behold. <br/><br/>This delight continued till at least half way through the film, till things started going badly wrong with the script. Having laid it on thick that these characters are in a survival setting, the film starts inducing cretinism which spreads like a disease through the desperate band of survivors.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the writer(s) ran out of ideas when it came to the grand finale, and resorted to bodging up the second half of the film in order to make something happen. It's easy to see the way the writer envisioned this, if only because the deterioration of the script is so profound.<br/><br/>An irritating antagonist figure (who was never needed in the first place), a dog and a conveniently timed empty stomach all add up to a bizarre sequence of events that occurs where something a darn sight better should have. Won't elaborate - see for yourself if the idea of the film tickles you.<br/><br/>Opportunities to darken the tone of the film, make the characters likable or at least someone you could be sympathetic towards are wasted. Character emotions are botched completely - misplaced 'romance' and cheesy lines seriously detract from the film. Again, this happens as a domino effect, no sign of this early in the film, then halfway through the stodge sets in fast.<br/><br/>The most irritating thing is that if the film had continued in the same vein as it had started, this would probably be one of my favourite films, period. As it is, I can't stand to even watch the thing again.<br/><br/>Despite having a marked dislike for the end product and scoring it as such, I would expect the majority of horror fans to enjoy this, with two exceptions:<br/><br/>A) Hardcore zombie fans who are really into the idea of zombies slowly shuffling - softly softly catchee meatbag style. B) Those who've ever thought ""what the hell are you doing!? That's just stupid"" when seeing this kind of film. <br/><br/>Some argue that this kind of dumbness is a necessity in slasher type films, but to me the film set the scene with arguing survivors in a situation and promptly made them act like complete chimps because nobody could figure a way of playing the film out properly.<br/><br/>If nothing said here puts you off then please do go ahead and enjoy yourself with this film, regardless of the factors which get right up my nose it can't be said that the film has no merits."

","First....and this is in no way disrespectful of anyone who enjoyed the original Dawn of The Dead, but the original Dawn of The Dead is horrible. It was boring, it was stoopid, it was too slow, the dead didn't make any sense (I'll comment on that in a second) - and the main characters didn't seem to know what they wanted to focus on.<br/><br/>One moment they are scared, the next happy and comical, then sad, then ...it was just all over the place and I am sooo glad they didn't try and stick to the original.<br/><br/>Now....this re-make of DOTD rocks. It's just that plain and simple. Sure it is a zombie movie - but the real story plays out in what goes on between the survivors. There are a lot of hills and dips and stuff that goes on in the movie. Sure some things don't make sense of what the people are doing - but that is exactly the point. How are you suppose to make sense when your world has turned upside down.<br/><br/>Now the zombies on the other hand - in this version, they only did one thing. They tried to get ""food"". That's it. That's all they could do. They followed instinct.<br/><br/>In the original, one of the dumbest things that could have possibly happened was to see the zombies staggering around the mall..and then all of a sudden one of the Hairy Krishner one's get's the bright idea to turn around and see what's going on down the other hall.<br/><br/>They don't think like that. Duh. Okay, maybe if the dead person was a store detective or something...but certainly not a Hairy Krishner. So, I have absolutely no problems with the zombies running. None what so ever. If they can have a Hairy Krishner get zombie smart in a boring dead movie....then zombies can run.<br/><br/>But think about it logically for a second. The zombies are ""Freshly Dead"". Not in the ground rotting for century dead. But freshly reanimated dead people. They should and would be able to move as fast as they would have when they were alive.<br/><br/>That is to say - if they were a big fat tub of lard when they were alive, they aren't gonna move like ... oh wait - nevermind that thought. But let's just say...it's a dang good movie.<br/><br/>Go rent it if you haven't seen it yet. You will enjoy."

","Being a fan of the original Dawn, I have to admit that when I saw this movie, it wasn't that bad. After seeing the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I knew remakes these days suck big time and here it was no different. Than again, what can you expect from a guy who along his major screen credits is Scooby Doo. When the movie starts, the plague is already starting, but only the next morning we get to see the bubble burst and have the zombies attack every living human being. As a fan of zombie movies, I was disappointed with the low level of gore here, although hinting at it is fine. But this is a zombie movie, and in it we need to see more gore than there we could see. After the first 15 minutes, the movie starts to weaken. What they have build up in the first 15 minutes, they lose afterwords. The characters were believable, but the zombies aren't. If you think how long it takes for rigor mortis to kick in, how come after 2 weeks, these zombies could still run like in the beginning. It made no sense. Of course zombie movies usually don't make sense, but there is still a kind of rationality to it, that we don't see here. I might add that the first 15 minutes of the movie had me shaken in my boots sorth of speak, but the rest of the movie didn't until they leave the mall. Hell, the news program we can view on the DVD of this film is scarier than the entire movie combined and it only lasts about 20 minutes. Judge it yourself as you watch the movie."
"EijnarAmadeus","7","0","1","22 June 2005"," Brutally intense and effective
","A recreation of the classic from the 70ties may seem unnecessary, though it's always great fun watching them. With the ultimate zombie-gore movie DAWN OF THE DEAD as it's proceeder, the movie does all the same things that the original do in storytelling and plot ways. Ana comes home from her job as a nurse at the hospital to fall in sleep together with her husband, waking up the next day her husband is brutally attacked by the neighbor girl and kills him. He wakes up again and attacks her, and Ana understands quickly that she is one of the few that hasn't been bitten while driving threw the city filled violence, zombies and fires. Teaming up with a group of certainly not-dead people, they make a fort in a supermarket along with the peculiar security guards to starts a war against the undead...<br/><br/>The sort of problem with these kind of movies, is that they get so intense in the length. Wherever the camera turns, it's a zombie ducking up from behind the counter or whatever and by those means; the movie is a bit irritating and bothers you more than it frights or entertains. Filled with dozens of weird and sick characters, and off course some normal, the team of people does a lot of very un-realistic moves in their way to kill and get away, were almost everything they do is about suicidal. Kenneth, the rough cop played by Ving Rhames, is probably the most trust-able of them all, except Ana that is, he loads his shotgun several times to blow a zombie's head off - and with the movie filled with violence and gore, it's also close to disgusting time after time, but hey - it's a zombie movie.<br/><br/>DAWN OF THE DEAD gives us also several close-up shots to the undead, that's practically always filled with blood in their face and has some ugly scars right across the face or in the forehead or whatever, making them look monsters every one of them. The irony and sarcasm of the original has been pulled away to be replaced by more serious means and character development, though the black humor of them sitting on the roof tops shooting at celebrity-lookalikes among the undead is pretty sick anyway. It's not a happy movie, no movie to play on whatever kind of celebrations it may be, because it's so intense and effective in it's brutal reflections that it doesn't get pleasing watching it. Truly disgusting scenes flash upon you over and over, and the movie has got this kind of news-channel mood that puts it all very close to you. The opening with Johnny Cash tumbling a song in the background doesn't make the scene that serious, but with effective sound effects and pure gore this is a movie that's very serious and tense.<br/><br/>No movie for the whole family that's for sure, but for a group of teenagers bored and wanting to see something disgusting and bloody maybe? Though only that in fact is pretty scary."

","DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the most astonishing films I've seen recently. When I heard it was being re-made, I rolled my eyes. The original was fine, thank you very much. I missed the theatrical release, and just saw the uncut version on DVD. What makes DAWN OF THE DEAD so good is that at no time does it draw comparison to the original. Although the basic story line is the same, the style and interpretation is so different, that DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) earns it's place in history independent of the original. For a remake, that is unheard of. It's one of the best remakes I have ever seen, along with THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (2005). If you are curious about the WORST remake in the history of cinema, check out PSYCHO (1998). <br/><br/>DAWN OF THE DEAD benefits from an outstanding cast, lead by Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames. The director, Zach Snyder, should be in the horror hall of fame for making such a great film. He seems to be a director more interested in action than horror, but he pulls no punches with the gore."
"enterfargo","9","0","1","9 June 2005"," transformations & reluctant zombies
","I said before something about Andy's extra-fast transformation... focused mostly on the roof scene, something else occurred to me: just look on the fresh zombie's expression and gestures... I mean, at the beginning, after throwing down the bloody sign, Andy looks around for a few seconds, and it seems that he doesn't quite know what's he looking for, or what he's doing... in other words, he's disoriented... just like a new born animal, a deer cub who tries to get up on his feet, but without success, or anything similar... So, my theory is that Andy got bitten inside the shop, he also hyped inside (dvd extra), but he wasn't quite completely morphed... in the first minutes of zombie-being, the zombie/human has to overcome the new-born like sensation, this human to zombie violent transcendence.... What would be your reaction if a ultra-deadly virus will kill you, and you'll wake up with a fresh swiss-cheesed brain? I guess ""highly confused"" is the word(s) you're looking for, even if you wouldn't be able to think that much about the state you've just got into. That explains a lot of things: in the first minutes of the film, we witness how Anna's husband dies and wakes up as a zombie, and when he does, he wanders a bit around with a ""I don't know, who am I"" expression on his face... not to mention the little girl who's simply staring at the loving couple, without even trying to jump on them an kill them instantly... Another example... that new big fat lady zombie in the mall.. when she wakes up, she first stands still and tilts her head, without instantly harming the surrounding folk... In the end, even Steve the Zombie looks a bit at Anna like he's just waiting for her to say hello to him... That's a thought to think about... Not like the transformations in Resident Evil, or any other almost-cheesy zombie flicks, where the living wake up as perfect zombies (sometimes, the transformations happen when the dude's not even really dead... a some kind of lucid feet stand transformation of the living dead, loll :)) So, after all, Dr. Logan's desperate tries to educate Bub, in Day of the Dead, weren't so futile after all... I guess Dr. Logan would have succeeded in educating Bub, returning him to a more human-side, fact witch he partially did, if it weren't for that army clich√©d, zombie sociopath freak... all in all, it's a form of racism, you know :) (reminds me of 'The Dead Next Door')... even the zombies have rights after all, huh? Why shouldn't they... it's not like they wanted to become zombies... If the remaining living want to blame someone for all the unnatural mayhem, they should blame the one who deserves it... none others than the creators (or creator) of the virus. But hey, if you put it that way, I guess the ones at NASA have to be blamed, since the true origin of this apocalyptic plague is that irradiated crashed satellite (NOTLD 68)... hell, you think they'll admit it? Noah... they don't even really admit that, even now, they're messin' up the ozone layer, with their rocket flights, fact which is 100% real, let me assure you. Another fact that bothers me is that everybody thinks that zombies are made of pure stupidity and cannibal instincts... That's not true... First of all, ask yourself these questions: why don't the zombies simply attack their kin? What drives them straight to the mall? What about their learning capacity? Is there really one? Of course it is... just watch how the zombies open Andy's door, just after the dog gets in... Or the zombie without legs, the one who mastered his climbing and hanging skills on the cellar pipes, beneath the mall, silently jumping on Bart... I say that's a trail of intelligence, after all... But I guess these guys will show their true scholar side (:)) in Land of the Dead... can't wait to see the movie! Funny I haven't sent it yet, isn't it? Well, what can I say... I'M FROM ROMANIA GODDAMIT! D'ya think that fresh made films just pop-out on our 2-star cinemas or on over-aged, almost communist TV sets? But what the heck... After all, I can consider myself lucky, you know... I'm among the few ones who manage to crop a few new good movies, once in a while... Hope that I'm not gonna wait too long to see Land of the Dead, though I heard the flick is in the can... or worse :)"

","This was pretty gory, but of course, nothing like the original. Most of the plot is the same as Romero's: a group of survivors gather in a shopping mall waiting for rescue from the walking dead. The ending was different than the original and other parts were different, such as walking underground to an adjacent building.<br/><br/>There were plenty of chainsaws and splicing through legs. One fat lady looked beyond disgusting before she turned into a zombie. I liked the way the film was shot. A good contrast of dark and light was used and parts of the film had a campy feel to it.

"Jonny_Numb","7","0","1","29 March 2005"," a remake that has no right to be good (but is anyway)...
","Not too long ago, Hollywood rode high on the crest of the teen-horror revival (begun by Wes Craven's ""Scream"") as a glut of winking slashers designed to make us nostalgic for the franchise staples of yesteryear(""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", etc.) became the main attraction at multiplexes the world over. Not surprisingly, what at first looked like a trend proved a mere fad and fizzled out in a fraction of the time it took to put Freddy and Jason down. These films were little more than self-conscious showcases for vapid pretty faces with little in the way of acting talent, and CGI-approved gore that made one nostalgic for hand-made FX.<br/><br/>Therefore, with Hollywood running low on creative ideas (what else is new?), the teen-horror infatuation was abandoned (or perhaps more accurately, 'transposed') in favor of 'remake mania.' In hopes of snaring both the curious and ignorant, those charming studio executives have shamelessly gone for the throat--especially in the horror genre--in cranking out one soulless remake after another. We're at the point now where there's a direct correlation between using horror remakes as an excuse to launch the film careers of music-video directors, and the results are accordingly shallow product. This raises the question of the necessity of remakes, especially remakes of films that, in most regards, leave no room for improvement and at best will only be perceived as failed hackwork? Why not create a good film out of one that is a piece of unredeemable garbage? Paradoxically, the films of Ray Dennis Steckler or Ed Wood, while incendiary, low-budget, and considered by many to be awful, still attract a cult following that would be just as upset as those who loved, say, George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" and were slack-jawed in horror at the notion of it being remade.<br/><br/>With every reason to be skeptical and expectant of a rotten retread in the best-case scenario, Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" takes all the money-grubbing remakes of late (hello, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""!) to task, and in turn shows what a good remake should be. (At the very least, he shows a reverence that is seriously lacking in the horror genre.) As if aware of the sheer inability to match the wit, intelligence, and horror of Romero's original, screenwriter James Gunn (who previously scripted Troma films) takes the skeletal structure of the original and infuses it into a modern telescope. As before, we are introduced to the survivors of a plague that has swept the world, seeking refuge in a shopping mall. As opposed to the blue-faced, slow-moving zombies of Romero's original, the dead of ""Dawn 2004"" are rotten-faced speed freaks who dash crazily after humans who let their guard down. The details of the plague are left appropriately vague--Snyder is less concerned with the cause than he is with knocking you out of your seat (which happens time and again); whereas Romero's film was a more relaxed meditation on consumer culture, Snyder seldom allows time for the audience to catch their breath, as he is staging one elaborate jolt after the next. Oddly enough, this method consistently holds up, and while it can easily be decried as skimping on the depth of Romero's original, it glues you to the screen all the same, and in my opinion, that is a different kind of success.<br/><br/>Granted, when the survivors start piling up, few ever get out of the first dimension, but dimension is irrelevant so long as the 1-D characters are given splatterific deaths (I was surprised the chainsaw dismemberment didn't give this an NC-17). After all, within the first few minutes we can pretty much tell who will be around at the climax and who won't. Perhaps there was more CGI used in this film than I noticed, and Snyder's gritty style (which employs a certain dank paleness) obscured it a bit; in any case, the zombie and human kills, and the way they are photographed, is presented with a rollicking intensity that few films of late have shown. ""Dawn 2004"" is what ""28 Days Later"" would have been had it jettisoned its preachy plot. Whether the decision to make the zombies fast-moving savages was an effort to create tension or appeal to our attention-deficit society, it works on both counts.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Dawn 2004"" is an example of a remake done properly, even though I still have the vaguest notion of what a remake really should be. No, it doesn't come anywhere near Romero's social statement, nor his dynamic precision in presenting believable, everyday characters, but it entertains, it frightens, and is bloody fun to watch."

","First I have to say I have noticed a lot of people bag this movie, and thats fine, but I don't think a true Horror or Zombie fan would ever do such a thing. This version of Dawn of the Dead is awesome, I love it, it is my favorite movie ever - thus 10/10.<br/><br/>Before I get to the plot I have to say I love the fact that there a ties to the original DoD movie in this one.. The preacher in this is the Cop in the first one, the truck that Norma drives is a BP truck, like the ones they use in the first movie to barricade the doors - They even have light hearted moments displayed in the music choice when they are in the mall trying on clothes and stuff. There are more as well, and it just makes it so cool<br/><br/>The plot has been tweaked from the original, there is no Biker gang and no chopper, but there is a pregnant woman. The Zombies are a hell of a lot scarier as they actually move at normal (or it could be suggested at an above normal) speed and, as in the first movie, they retain some behaviors and knowledge from when they are alive, but you will not see them trying to play hocky.<br/><br/>I can not count how many times this movie has inspired ""what if..."" conversations between me and my friends. The idea is wonderful and I love the fact there is no explanation for where the virus came from.<br/><br/>In case you haven't seen/heard of this film here is the Basic plot: Something has happened and the dead are not staying dead. As expected there is carnage every where. This throws 12 ""survivors"" together in, of all places, a mall. Soon the mall becomes surrounded by Zombies (which leads to a dark and highly amusing game of Hollywood Squares) and the inhabitants of the Mall decided they want to die somewhere else. They make an escape, but alas there are few survivors by the time they make it to their destination.<br/><br/>Amongst all this you get to learn more about the characters, you see some of them die, there is a touch of spiritualism (just a small dash) and in some cases it will leave you with many questions about the nature of man, the future and all sorts of crazy possibilities for human civilisation."

","I am a huge fan of the zombie genre and I 'craved the flesh' of a good modern day zombie flick. I watched the DVD directors cut version of this movie with high expectations as this was my most anticipated movie of the year and I just loved it so much I had to write a quick review on it. Dawn of the Dead is a modern day remake of George A Romero's 1978 Dawn Of The Dead. The story follows several survivors of an epidemic of undead, as they barricade themselves inside the local mall to survive the growing zombie plague. The movie is filled with many tense, thrilling moments where it is comically broken with humour; this is a good thing that adds a human factor into the movie. The performances were believable and realistic given the whole Armageddon scenario which was pleasing to see and a great choice to include the character known as Andy. Without doubt the true stars are the zombies. The makeup for the undead was nothing short of amazing, with by far the best visuals and makeup of any zombie movie. Some scenes are superb like the opening scene where Anna (Sarah Polley) wakes up in the decrepit, crumbling world where society is falling apart with the zombie infestation and the great shots of how huge the zombie population has grown.. The movie does get into a good rhythm with enough character building and action sequences for the audience to care about who lives and who dies. IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't turn off when the credits roll because the movie keeps going. The final scene of the movie sticks to the back of your mind after watching, leaving your imagination to do the rest.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original 1978 Dawn Of The Dead, but I loved this rendition. Dawn of the Dead is a brilliant must see movie for any horror fan."

But just a few major problems, zombies don't run, but why did they make them run? That wasn't scary at all, it seemed like a laughable Tales From The Crypt episode to me, in which the crypt keeper would call a ""hack and field"" race. BLEH!

","*Slight Spoilers*<br/><br/>I was never a huge fan of the original film. I found it to be quite overlong and because of it, it seemed rather repetitive, especially when it came to the themes of consumerism. All of the reviewers would rave about the character development and how it was a horror film where you actually cared for the fate of the characters. I didn't. We knew next to nothing about them and what we did see made them seem rather generic and one-dimensional. Some of the acting was downright atrocious and the finale was a major letdown. Suffice to say that I didn't have high hopes for the remake, especially in the age of teeny bopper horror flicks starring the latest WB sensations. Thankfully, I was dead wrong about this movie.<br/><br/>Everything about it is top-notch. The casting, the script, the special effects, the characters, everything. When I read that Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber were the stars, my anticipation grew. They are three terrific actors and I just knew that they wouldn't sign on to star in a truly bad film. This is truly one of those rare horror films where you do care about the characters. We only know them momentarily, but we know enough about them to care. We have the cop (Ving Rhames) who is searching for his missing brother and forms a bond with a stranded gun shop owner to fill that void, the nurse who just lost her husband (Sarah Polley), the loser with three failed marriages behind him and dead children (Jake Weber), and a young pregnant couple who are uncertain about the future of their unborn child. As the film progresses, we learn more and more about these people as they drop hints about their past lives and as they interact and form new relationships. This is what was desperately missing from the original: human relationships.<br/><br/>Jake Weber as Michael knocked it out of the park. He brought his character to life and the scene where he discussed what he was best at was heartbreaking. Utterly fantastic, if I do say so myself. I'd love to see him in more movies, he's quickly become one of my favorites. To anyone who liked him in this flick, check out Wendigo, he's awesome in it.<br/><br/>The action and gore will not let anyone down, they are both spectacular. And just think, none of it is CGI. Never in my wildest dreams could I ever have imagined another good, mainstream horror picture without cheesy computer effects.<br/><br/>The ending itself left a lump in my throat, which is a true testament as to how good this movie is at making you care for these characters.<br/><br/>I hate modern horror, but I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a smart and honest horror movie. Whether it does become a horror classic in the halls of public opinion is yet to be seen, but it will be one of my favorites for years to come. Absolutely stunning."

There were some new faces starring in this movie alongside some well known actors, but they all did well. They had the stereotypical ""dumb"" character, (the one that makes you yell at the screen; ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU ARE SO STUPID!"") but you can't have a scary movie without him/her.

Although it was not critically acclaimed, I thought it was a solid horror film and a damn good remake. The same could be said for this years Dawn of the Dead. <br/><br/>However, the remake of TCM could at least be called similar to the original. In the 2004 Dawn of the Dead, its like a complete reimagination. There almost different movies. Yes, the plot is basically the same but there's a lot different here too. For example, the zombies move much faster, it takes place in Wisconsin (not Pennsylvania), and the film plays out in a much different way. The setting of a shopping mall is the same but here its only used as a place to hide where in the original it was used George Romero's brilliant(if not very subtle) satire on consumerism. <br/><br/>So how does this Dawn fare against the older one? It holds up but it is inferior to the original. Romero's Dawn of the Dead was a horror film mixed with satire, this Dawn is more like action and horror. Thats not a bad thing because it works but Romero's Dawn was more challenging to a viewer. It was an intelligent horror film and while its not fair to call this film dumb, its nowhere near as intelligent as Romero's film was. <br/><br/>That being said, this Dawn does a few things better than the original. First of all the look of the zombies is far more scary, the make-up is more realistic, and in some ways, this is a scarier film. Also, the zombies move much faster here which adds more tension to the film. First-time director Zach Snyder does an excellent job of raising tension throughout the film.<br/><br/>However, you can tell this guy used to do music videos. Although this Dawn has a more polished, slicker look to it than the original did, there are times, especially in the beginning, when it looks a little too much like a music video. Is this a bad thing? Well it is a little distracting but it doesn't last too long (it looks much more like a movie in the mall).<br/><br/>The acting does not disappoint though. Everyone in the cast does a solid job portraying their character. If there's a problem here, its that I liked the characters in the original Dawn better. They seemed more accessible and likable to me. In this film some characters come across as really selfish or just plain stupid. For instance, would you risk going to save a dog in a building that is not only surrounded by zombies but has one in it? And not even have a weapon with you? I mean even though that moment was very suspenseful it fell back to the horror movie standard that a character must do something totally idiotic. <br/><br/>Also, what is the big deal with the ending of this film? All I heard was the ending is the most horrifying part of the film. Are you joking? I could see that coming so it wasn't shocking at all. The opening 10 minutes were far more effective. Another minor thing bothered me in this film and it was the use of the line ""When there is no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth"". As we all know this is from the original and once again delivered by Ken Foree. However, it didn't feel right here, it felt liked it was tacked on to make a reference to the original. It doesn't have the same impact either. Why? Because in the original Foree's character mentioned something about voodoo to go along with the line, here its just randomly said on television. How the hell is that creepy?<br/><br/>For the most part, this Dawn of the Dead delivered. It has flaws but it is tightly-paced, graphic and yes, scary. In my opinion, its much better than the overrated 28 Days Later. While it isn't on the same level as the original, it works on its own."
"BaronBl00d","Null","0","2","6 November 2004"," A Worthy Remake
","Though geared toward action far more than its predecessor, this version of Dawn of the Dead packs a wallop. It is fast-paced, has interesting characters(though far more could have been done in ""fleshing"" them out), retains the spirit of the first film, and keeps the tone very serious throughout. Ving Rhames plays a policeman guiding a small group of people into a nearby mall not far from Milwaukee after the NIGHT when the living dead rise. Once there various other people find their way there as well, and much of the film deals with characters having conflicts in the face of adversity, reinforcing the mall, finding life boring after awhile as death waits for them outside the mall, and slowly discovering through trial and error what the new ""disease"" is and how it spreads. The group is a pretty eclectic lot: a cop, a jack of all trades guy who was working at Best Buy, three security guards, a punk thief and his pregnant Russian girl, assorted other people that arrive later, and a nurse who is really the film's lead. Much of what we see is through her perspective to a degree. Though the film has a great deal of gore, I didn't find it as bad as the original, nor was the film going for sick laughs as much either as in Romero's film. What it does have that makes it VERY different from Romero's film is the zombies run like Jesse Owens and the disease spreads quickly. Only seconds are needed for a dead corpse to become animated once infected. The fast zombies are nothing new to film having first been done quite successfully in 28 days Later. This film is directed with flair, has more than competent acting(Rhames really excels as a cop coping with loss), and a pace that just doesn't stop. In many ways it is a better film than Romero's, but Romero's film explored the depths of human nature and needs in his film amidst hyperbolic splatter and undead guffaws. His film was in many ways a character study. The original is ultimately the better film, but it has some welcomed competition here. Besides, what greater homage could be bestowed to a film like Romero's Dawn of the Dead than having a remake that is as well-crafted and scary as this film. Personal Preference: I like the slow-moving zombies more. If something like that should ever happen I might see it to another day - for what purpose only God would know!"

","I was not a fan of the 1978 original beyond one viewing. Maybe there's this great sebtext people talk about, but I never found it and, if it was there, I never found it interesting enough to pay attention.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead in 2004 is slicker, faster paced and has a well told story. No, the character development won't rival some of the major epics of our time, but it's a horror movie. People don't watch it for the romance or the emotion. You're watching to be frightened and to be entertained. A little gore doesn't hurt either.<br/><br/>There is enough character development along the way that I did care about what happened to these people. I didn't care about many of them, but I did care. Ving Rhames is a great actor in his own right and Sarah Polley has the potential to be an action heroine as she plays off the ludicrous horror well and sells the action very well.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to a fan of horror, young or old. It does borrow effects ideas from 28 Days Later, but that is forgivable as I believe this is a better movie."

Thus, I think that I'll likely enjoy the original of THIS film as well. I shall try to find that somewhere. Anyways, lets get back to breastax (as Madeline Kaun would say) and talk about this version. I thought the effects were very well done, and its realism is what really makes this stand out amongst competitors. It's just so amazing that they can take a plot that's so out-of-this-world and make it believable. This isn't to state that its plot is not predictable at times, but unlike lets say... The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, it doesn't get overly trying with predictability. No, this film becomes exciting and original for its realism and also for its moments that catch you off guard. Without ruining anything I'll just say there's one such moment near the end where I was shocked by an incredible mishap.<br/><br/>For these reasons I rate this film: WOW.

"Ben_Cheshire","Null","0","1","25 June 2004"," Film School Re-hash of Zombie Clich√©s - but zombie action is eventually SUPOIB!
","(spoilers)<br/><br/>I don't think this did anything to augment the genre - that's my main problem with it. I just started to feel very familiar watching it. Maybe because i've just seen Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days Later... recently, <br/><br/>And maybe it was because I came in after the first ten minutes, by the time Sarah Polley was in the bathroom, i'd missed the shock effect of the (what i hear) exciting first scene. So everything after the first five just sort of washed over me. I was very excited before I saw it, too... maybe i'd built it up too much. Too much plot, not enough zombie action for me. Maybe I just expected a zombie-a-minute roller-coaster, but instead got a sort of traditionally photographed too-modern looking character piece. Who gives a rat's dropping about the characters - I wanna see some zombies!<br/><br/>Oh, and the other thing I felt while watching it: every new contemporary director gets their assignment, and its like ""Return of the Evil Vampire Lesbians,"" but they inject all these unnecessary camera movements and pretentious film-school devices in there - its like they think its Return of Citizen Kane. I particularly noticed this while watching the Italian Job remake. I squirmed listening to the director on the special features (not my decision, Mrs Clifford was controlling the remote) talking his movie up Tarantino-style. It just makes me feel like watching The Toxic Avenger and exorcising my rage at film-school grads who take themselves too seriously.<br/><br/>I don't mind art movies - love them, in fact, but if I go to see a self-conscious movie for artistic value, I expect it to be about something original, unique, and perhaps weighty. The last place I want to find art is in a movie called ""Dawn of the Dead"". <br/><br/>Basically, I went into Dawn of the Dead expecting a slash-and-burn zombie flick, like Night of the Living Dead - I expected to have fun! But what i got was too many traditional dialogue scenes, a director who tried to take zombies seriously (as evidence I use the bathroom scene where Ving Rhames and that other guy try desperately to relate a plague of zombies to what they learned at Sunday school: is this the end of the world, what does it all mean, what's the meaning of life... you catch the drift... pretentious fooey!).<br/><br/>The one beacon of light in all this seriousness was the scene where Ving Rhames and Andy play chess across the street from each other, and the ""pick a zombie who looks like a famous person and sniper him"" scene. But this I think was bad for a different reason: we want to have fun at the zombie movie, but we don't necessarily want to make it seem like humans might have FUN killing zombies... because these zombies look quite a lot like humans... and it comes across very badly, considering the seriousness of everything preceding it. Especially in light of the recent Washington sniper, and videogames like Carmageddon which suggest children get points for running over pedestrians - after Bowling for Columbine, I think movies like this should be careful in making shooting things, no matter in what fictional situation, seem fun. <br/><br/>Clifford's Tips:<br/><br/>If you're of suitable age (definitely no youngsters - mums and dads, the violence is pretty hardcore), remember to stay during the credits.<br/><br/>I'd still recommend you see the movie, purely for the mass-crowd zombie scenes: this is the advantage of a big Hollywood budget. When it comes, the zombie action is very good. They just didn't have the resources for this in 68'. I don't know how they did it, but they've got very convincing footage of trucks slamming into several zombies (which made my skin crawl a little for the same reasons as the sniper scene) - and scenes with a sea of zombies. You're unlikely to see such good scenes of zombies in any other zombie flick (or zombie FILM, as this director would have you believe)."

","I'm going to save everyone a lot of time and money on the 77th Annual Academy Awards by just coming out and telling you what's going to win. No point in watching the show next year because one movie alone will dominate the Oscars in every category (except drama, because A. nobody watches drama and B. it's not a category): DAWN OF THE DEAD.<br/><br/>This movie stomps so much ass that they have to import colons from other countries to meet the demand. The movie starts out with this chick (who is a 6 at the beginning, but by the end of the movie you're thinking she's an 8 because it's non-stop tit-sagging from fat zombie bitches from this point on) in a hospital, then she talks to her co-worker for what seems like hours and you think you're in the wrong movie because already there's way too much dialogue/plot building or whatever you call it. <br/><br/>That's where the genius of the director comes in: he made it like this on purpose so you'll have time to adjust your face before it's rocked off. Almost immediately after that there's a shower scene which sucks because there's a guy in it and you have to state loudly that you think it's ""gay"" or something along those lines so nobody will question your sexuality. Then it's onto the zombies. <br/><br/>The zombies in this movie are the ultimate evolution of the walking dead. Forget the wuss-burger zombies in ""28 Days Later"" that eventually die on their own, these zombies are the real deal. First of all, these zombies are fast (even the fat ones). Imagine the fastest Olympic runner you've ever seen, now double that speed and pretend the zombies aren't from Kenya. That's how fast these zombies move, which sucks if you're a zombie because you get your balls stomped on by an army of undead ball-stompers if you trip.<br/><br/>Right off the bat the chick at the beginning (who I'll call Mope Master because she looks like she's about to cry in every scene) gets the beat down by her ex-human now-zombie husband. So then she bails and gets in a car wreck because women can't drive. Then Ving Rhames threatens to blow her head off, which is cool. They meet up with some pregnant Mexican chick, a black thug, and a middle-aged white man.<br/><br/>They eventually go to a mall where some dude with a badass handlebar moustache accosts them; before he even says anything, you automatically know he listens to Pantera. His buddies, on the other hand, look like they drink Keystone Light and go shopping for purses. Anyway, the Pantera guy totally wants to bang Mope Master, so he lets them stay in the mall. Then they go around killing rogue zombies for about 45 minutes, no complaining from me.<br/><br/>All the zombie actors were awesome and deserve best supporting actor awards for their inspired acting work. These are thespians; they're pros at what they do. Just sit back and admire their art. <br/><br/>So here I am watching the movie and it's pretty badass, but then out of nowhere *WHAM*. Tits on the screen. Like finding an unexpected $20 in the wash, the director throws in some jugs for good measure. I know you're asking ""but it already sounds awesome, why go on?"" Why indeed. Stop reading this review and go see Dawn of the Dead."

","Personally, I can go either way in regard to zombie movies.  For example, I liked ""Resident Evil,"" but ""28 Days Later"" bored me to tears.  Well, not literally, but it was close.  Actually, I think I yawned so wide once that a tear DID come out of my eye.  I still don't know why ""28 Days Later"" was as hyped as it was.  The movie started off at a decent pace (for about 5 minutes), but it stopped to catch its breath and NEVER GOT STARTED AGAIN! ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the movie that ""28 Days Later"" should've been.<br/><br/>""Dawn of the Dead"" is classified as a ""remake,"" but it's not really that similar to the original.  A more accurate statement would be to say it's ""based on"" the original.  Unlike the original (and I know I'm gonna catch flak for this), this movie is actually entertaining.  And by ""entertaining"" I mean it's a movie that didn't put me to sleep and have me wondering when it'd be over.  I honestly don't know why so many people love the original so much.  I hear people praise the ""social commentary"" in it.  Whatever.  The movie was slow-paced, boring, cheesy, had bad acting, and had even worse music.  I didn't dig it at all.<br/><br/>The ""remake,"" however, is much more fast-paced.  Zombies are being run over, shot, and blown up at a pretty rapid clip.  I don't know about the average zombie movie mark, but that's what I want to see in a zombie movie!  If that kind of stuff bothers you or makes you squeamish, then this isn't for you.<br/><br/>THE GIST:<br/><br/>If you love zombie movies that will lull you to sleep and try to impress you with false pretenses of social commentary, then check out ""28 Days Later."" However, if you like your zombie movies with blood, gore, fast-moving zombies, a good amount of tension, and a little humor mixed in, then ""Dawn of the Dead"" will keep you entertained.<br/><br/>P.S.

Dawn of the Dead is one such horror flick!<br/><br/>The opening sequence gets the blood pumping before the opening credits even roll, and while Dawn of the Dead isn't a non-stop rollercoaster of blood 'n guts, it is paced nicely and will keep you entertained from start to finish. Speaking of blood 'n guts, Dawn of the Dead has some slightly graphic scenes but really this is pretty tame. There is an atmosphere of menace and dread and the moment you put yourself in the character's shoes, you have chills running up and down your spine.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty standard fare, bordering on quite good.

This fits into the story, I am surprised no one has picked up on the story's social message.  This zombie plague is brought on my humanity as a punishment, the evil that we do.  When the minister said when hell is full the dead will walk the earth.  This means the Zombies are the damned, humanity was so bad they filled up hell and had no other place to go but with the living.  They are suffering on earth, and prey on the living out of rage.  That is why they do not care about the dog in the movie.  That is why going to an island or under water or anywhere doesn't matter; the damned will just walk across the lake they can't die, just their body does.

The choice of a new species of zombie (as in 28 days later) induces cool action scenes, with characters turned into real gunslingers for the occasion (the foreheads of all those poor devils seem to be strong bullet-magnets). But we loose that horrible gut feeling we can have when we see a corpse, thinking it could be us, reinforced by the fact that this corpse is a moving parody of the living. These zombies are too much alive for my taste: if they are not as brainless as they used to be, they are less repulsive. They look more like mad people to me than creepy undead.

","After watching The TExas Chainsaw MAssacre remake last night, I did not really fancy going to watch another multiple body count movie - let aone one that was yet another remake of a 70s horror classic! But hey, i found myself down the local VUE cinema, checking in to see the 2004 version of George E Romero's 1978 original, Dawn Of The Dead. What mainly appealed about this movie was the high calibre cast. Sarah Polley is distinguishable for her somewhat eclectic choices when it comes to picking movie roles. The last film i saw her in was Doug LIman's 1999 film, Go and if both films are anything to go by, she has a good eye for good scripts. I dont want to spoil too much but the basic plot involves zombies taking over a neighbourhood and a group of locals trapped in a mall trying not to be picked off one by one! I have to admit, i have yet to see the orginal but maybe that enables me to provide an objective opinion on this remake without making unnecessary comparisons to the original. As it stands on its own, thsi film is am enjoyable, yet gory, horror film. The acting is of a standard you would expect form a high calibre cast including Polley, Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pfiffer. The storyline is simple yet effective and is reminiscent of the 70s action films where you have a group of strangers united in a building formwhich the yhave to escape. It is not as relentlessly horrific as the texas chainsaw massacre remake..Some comedic moments are entwined, the best being the jay leno /burt reynolds zombies!!<br/><br/>
Definitely watch this film if yo uare a fan of horror remakes.. Don't go in comparing this to the original, let it stand alone as a film in its own right. Post success of 28 Days Later and Dog SOldiers, it was surely only a matter of time for this zombie classic to be remade!<br/><br/>Anyway, 8/10!! That is my final word!"

","I hate remakes, especially unnecessary ones. There's no reason for them to exist, and unless it goes into a completely new direction (kind of like a ""re-imagining"", like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes), it's worthless. Yet I found myself going to see the new, ultra-violent version of George A. Romero's classic horror movie Dawn of the Dead. I haven't seen the original (the only movie of the original Dead series I've seen is the first one, Night of the Living Dead), but I can tell that the original was nowhere near as violent and gory, and probably had more social commentary than the thin layer that's in this version, but it's probably not as scary and entertaining as this version.<br/><br/>Ana (Sarah Polley) is forced to take refuge in the local mall after a zombie killed her husband. There, she meets up with other survivors, such as Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), and Andre (Mekhi Phifer). Along the way (as they have to keep the zombies out of the mall), a baby must be born, dogs have to run through hoards of zombies, and much, much more. Let the fun begin.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Dead could have gone terribly, terribly wrong, like it's half-cousin 28 Days Later. With all of this blood and maiming, freshman director Zack Snyder could have focused too much on making the blood sensible while still having shock value. However, Dawn is actually scary. It's not continuously scary, but many scenes were, and, unlike 28 Days, they didn't last for just five seconds. And even better (compared to other recent horror movies), all of the scares weren't either just ""jump"" scares, or began by that. One problem I had, though, was that so many characters became involved towards the middle that it was impossible to guess the order in which everyone would die.<br/><br/>There's lots to say about mindless people clamoring to get into a mall in terms of social statements. Is this what we've become? Yes it is, but this takes second podium to the buckets of blood and crazy zombie killing. I don't really consider myself a gorehound, but I expect that when people get killed, there's blood (re: Halloween), but, obviously, this movie is not realistic. This is what a horror movie should be: scary, bloody, funny, and filled with Ving Rhames.<br/><br/>I do have a few qualms with this movie, though. First, I found it annoying how the camera switched from film to handheld, making no connection between the two and making it hard to watch at times. Second, random characters just jump in at inconsequential times. Lastly, it loses track of where it's going towards the third act, but other than that, I would call Dawn of the Dead one of the best horror movies of this millennium so far.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality."

","I saw the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" many years ago. The only thing I could remember was that it was a George Romero movie set in a mall in the Midwest and it was the original post- apocalyptic zombie movie which inspired movies like ""28 Days Later"" and videogames like ""Resident Evil 2.""<br/><br/>Even though most remakes I've seen have been horrible, with a few exceptions (""The Birdcage"", ""Ocean's 11"") I decided to give this a try to refresh my memory. And boy, this movie is good.<br/><br/>The original ""Dawn of the Dead"" was smarter, but this one succeeds gloriously in other ways the original didn't.<br/><br/>Spoilers: The first scene of the chaos is incredible, the scene of the pregnant woman giving birth is a zillion times scarier than the original, and the diseased fat lady who looks like was taken out from a scene from the movie ""Seven"" is the scariest thing I've seen in a movie in years. The chainsaw scene -a horror movie staple- is done here flawlessly.<br/><br/>Add the tons of gore, a cool soundtrack and a great idea to begin with, and you have one of the coolest, scariest movies ever. This is how a remake should be done. Don't miss."

","Ok there's more..<br/><br/>In the thick soup of seventies remakes one stands out above the rest¬Ö. Dawn of the Dead. Not only is this movie far superior to the original but it is IMHO, The BEST zombie/post apocalyptic/horror movie I have ever seen. True, and I've seen a lot. <br/><br/>I'll warn you if spoilers are coming.<br/><br/>  The opening of Dawn of the Dead is quite intense and brutal¬Ö gouts of blood, people running and screaming, zombies (of course) doing their thing and then the credits start to run and you just know you are in for one hell of a ride. I swear, I got goose bumps in anticipation of things to come. Dawn of the Dead works on so many levels I can't cover them all but suffice to say that it manages to be brutal and terrifying while injecting splashes of poignancy and gentleness. Sarah Polly has led me down the rabbit-hole before with movies like GO and No Such Thing; she takes us (willing) on a new, nightmarish ride and delivers the goods as usual. I think she is one of the best, most beautiful actresses today. For me, being familiar with, and liking, her past work made it easy for me to like/care for her character right from the get-go. This helped tremendously with getting sucked into the atmosphere. You can tell all the actors really got into making this picture. It must have been great fun. Ving is as great as always. But the real kudos have to go to the director and cinematography¬Ö While the premise is disturbing enough and the actors veterans, I'm not sure it would have been as effective without the, up-in-your-face, shaky camera work. A lot of the film is shot in close, claustrophobic intimacy and then there are these shaky, off-focus, chaotic shots that put right in the think of the fight and violence, then wide panoramic shots that show you the full scope of this desperate situation. Some parts of this movie are nothing less than brilliant. I love true artistry in film and it delivers that as well. Great special effects, smart story elements, attention to detail (listen to the mall Muzak ¬ñ perfect) simply a great movie going experience. I will accept no arguments on this.  Perfect 10."

","It may have little in common with its classic predecessor, but this new retelling of George Romero's apocalyptic horror film still has alot to offer. Fans of the genre will not be disappointed, as there is still plenty of blood and gruesome deaths to go around. There's also plenty of claustrophobic chills and suspense that might make you jump out of your seat once or twice. What I liked most about it was that it managed to maintain the humorous spirit of the first Dawn that made it such a dead-on satire of modern society. Those who put it down because it doesn't match up to the original are selling it short. I enjoyed it and it really makes me want to watch the original again to catch things I may have missed the first few times. 8/10"

"Mulliga","8","0","1","26 March 2004"," A very good, but not classic, remake of the original (spoilers)
","Some horror movie remakes are as good or even better than the source material - the '78 version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" and Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" spring to mind.<br/><br/>The ""Dawn"" remake, though a very good movie that all involved should be proud of, doesn't quite pull it off. It's quite entertaining and even has the trademark bleak, ambiguous ending of the series, but it just doesn't have the teeth or the soul of the original.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say about the remake. It certainly wasn't scarier than the original - zombie movies are hardly ever scary anyway. It was more ""intense,"" if intensity can be measured by the volume of the sound effects in the movie and the speed of the zombies. The visual effects, set design, and score were all pretty much spot-on and, dare I say, better than the original.<br/><br/>Why didn't I walk away with the same ""Whoa!"" feeling I had when I first watched ""Dawn"" '78 on VHS?<br/><br/>Is the acting and characterization better than '78? Rhames and Polley are very good, and some of the other characters really stand out - C.J., Michael, and Andy. Everyone else seems to be window dressing, unfortunately. The original had four wonderfully drawn, complex characters - this one still has about four strong characters, but it also includes half a dozen people to be zombie chow. Too many people are introduced too fast for my taste - some of them literally only have one or two lines before getting munched by one of the new uber-zombies.<br/><br/>Ah, yes, the fast zombies. These guys can sprint as fast as when they were alive, they can punch through car windows and doors, and they can jump like spiders. They can crawl through dog doors like a snake, and they scale fences and climb buses arguably faster than living humans could. They are definitely more like ""Return"" or 28DL zombies, but with arguably less intelligence. They work pretty well IMHO, but the zombies aren't the problem.<br/><br/>The problem is the mall. Or, more specifically, the non-use of the mall. The original Dawn had that one half hour section in it (if you're a fan, you know the part) that will live on forever - the section where they live, hunkered down in the mall, for months, enjoying all its spoils, and realize that it's all meaningless, and that material things can't provide happiness. I LOVED this part - more than the gut-muching, more than the headshots, more than the rock-em-sock-em action - because it actually made me sad. I mean, how many horror movies make you sad and feel the bleakness that the characters feel? The original Dawn did this. The new one basically has people all bunched up in a coffee shop.<br/><br/>The social commentary is gone, as expected, and it has been replaced by dozens of gunshots. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I find myself wishing for classic lines like ""When there's no more room in Hell..."" There are quite a few homages and cameos for fans (I definitely cracked a smile when I saw ""Gaylen Ross"" as a store name).<br/><br/>All in all, a worthy remake that is better than I thought it would be, but I still wish Romero was involved.<br/><br/>3 out of 4 stars"
"ManufacturingStudent","9","0","1","23 March 2004"," Not a Disappointment
","Ok, I am a big Romero zombie movie fan and own copies of the trilogy including the remake of Night of the Living Dead so I was very excited (and nervous) when I found out about this remake. So on Friday I took in the second showing (didn't want to skip classes for the first). I bought my ticket in advance, went alone (my wife and friends are not so big on the genre) and hoped that this movie would not be a letdown. I was very pleasantly surprised. From start to finish, this movie had me glued to my seat pondering at one point the best time to get up and use the washroom. The plot moved briskly but without missing any important details. There were many subtle jokes made throughout the film as well as many allusions to the original, however if someone half-watched this movie they would not miss any important plot details. I'm not sure if I like fast zombie approach as I found that the original slow moving zombie added to the suspense. But all that being said it worked just fine. The direction was good, with some things seeming to jump out and hit you. The special effects were very well done, and the characters were believable. I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone and may even go see it again myself. One point...STAY FOR THE CREDITS a lot of people got up and left as the credits started to roll and they did themselves a very big disservice by leaving."

","Dawn of the Dead. I thought it was gonna be much much better than it actually was. I loved the movie from the very beginning, but towards the middle it was ridiculously gory and there were hardly any scares. It was also quite boring at times, but it did have its great parts. SPOILER ALERT In the beggining when the little girl walks into the room and a huge chunk of skin on her face is missing, exposing blood and muscles, I got scared. Then she takes a huge chunk out of Ana's husband's neck. Blood spurts everywhere, and Ana throws the girl out of the room and locks the door. As the girl, whose name is Vivian actually, tries to bust in, Ana tries to save her husband. He dies as she calls 911, but soon comes back to life and tries to kill her. When she escapes, it's chaos outside; houses are burning, helicopters are flying above, and the dead have come back attacking people. That's all I will say. If you haven't seen it, maybe you should.

"paparowe","3","0","1","22 March 2004"," Another Unsubstantial Remake
","There is no conceivable reasoning for this being a remake of the original, other  than it has zombies and a mall. Any social commentary made by the original has been lost here. Unlike the original, there is absolutely no cause for using  the mall as  setting. A coffee shop would have sufficed, as that's where they  hang out all day anyway. All focus has been placed upon the action, which is barely adequate. The camera is glued to the actors, so it becomes difficult to  locate yourself in these moments of excitement. The effect is a lot of people  running around, explosions, and gunshots. The claustrophobic camera destroys any tension. It would have been better to put the actors in long shots to create a  vulnerability to them. Needless to say, you can not be scared of what might be  around the corner when you never get to see the corner. With such focus on the  actors, one might expect some good characterization. Forget about that. These  are cardboard cutouts; each allotted about 10 seconds of personal dialogue.<br/><br/> You have the tough cop, the gangster, the medic, the innocent girl, the cynicist,  etc. It was a relief in one scene as the survivors talk over dinner. What could  have been an excellent characterization device, is interrupted a few moments later by a power failure. Strangely, one of the more interesting characters is  Andy; another survivor who hangs out on the roof of his shop across the street.  Even the mall survivors seem more interested in him than each other, watching  him through binoculars.<br/><br/>All things considered, this is not ""Dawn of the Dead"". It shares more in common  with the gore-inspired Italian Horror genre than the original. Perhaps it could  have been called  ""28 Days Later: Another City"". ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) makes for a basic gore film with a few exciting moments of action. It is good for a  mindless viewing, but don't expect a revolution. If you want zombies in a mall, I  suggest the Hong Kong film, ""Bio-Zombie."" The zombies are a little goofy, but  the great characters and inspired camera-work make this an undeniable classic."
"FooserX","Null","0","1","22 March 2004"," God Awful
","I can't for the life of me see why this is getting so many good reviews. I went into this movie with an open mind and pretty excited, and after the initial set up, this movie just went downhill.<br/><br/>The characters get no depth, and when combined with their stupidity in doing things, you just stop caring about what happens to them. I liken this to Resident Evil...just a bunch of zombie death scenes to satisfy the MTV generation, but nowhere near the plot or realism of ""28 Days Later"".<br/><br/>
Is this movie worth 6 bucks? Maybe for some...but it's definitely not a classic. If you're going to do a movie about a group of people isolated in a mall for a while...you have to focus on the dynamics and interaction of the characters. This movie skipped character development all together. You flat out don't care about any of them.<br/><br/>2 stars from me. Watchable, but not memorable."

","I like it despite the nitpicking I'm about to embark on. It's a zombie flick. Do I need to elaborate anymore than that? My issues are that the people in the mall weren't in there long enough for the the condition of many of the corpses around the building and in the parking garage. Then there's the generators for the mall that can't work as long with the load those people seemed to be using. Also, why did Luda take forever to die when everyone else died within hours? What happened to Andy's attacker(s).<br/><br/>They didn't leave the gun shop, yet they weren't present in the shop either. Just some nitpicking gaps that made it a bit hard to swallow as zombie movies go. We won't even go anywhere near the fact that they don't even attempt to provide even the slightest clue of what caused this tragedy in any way, shape, or form. While I gave this movie a 7 rating, for your money, rent ""28 days later"". While it has just as many holes in it's credibility as does Dawn of the Dead, it holds it a bit more in check."

","I'm not completely against remakes.  They can be good, like The Thing or The Fly, or they can be OK, like last year's Texas Chainsaw.  This one, Dawn of the Dead 2004, is one of the most unholy God-awful piece of s**t remakes I've ever seen.  None of the humor, social commentary, sense of dread or awe or loneliness that made the original so great is present here.  The characters are the kind of stupid idiots usually found in a Friday the 13th film, who go wandering off by themselves to investigate noises totally unarmed.  It takes them way too long to realize how zomibifaction (?) is spread, and they fail to take simple obvious precautions that anyone would take.  The mall fails to feel like a real place, partly because we never get a sense of its size like we did in the original.  This is really just an inferior version of 28 Days Later set in a mall.<br/><br/>I'm giving this 3 out of 10.  I'll give it higher than a 1 just for the scenes involving Andy (the rooftop neighbor) which are clever and give us some trace of the original's charm.  Plus, the early scenes where everything starts to go to hell are done well.  Otherwise, this stinking zombie pile smells even worse than Resident Evil, and that's pretty bad."

","I did like this movie as much as the original, though for different reasons. This one starts out showing you the outbreak as it first happens and I thought that was very nicely done.  Sure ""Night of the Living Dead"" sort of showed us the initial outbreak, but this one does it in such a fast and furious way.  This movie has a few similarities with the original, though not many.  Mainly the name and the fact the survivors find refuge in a mall are the main similarities.  This is fine by me because I do not want to watch the same movie again.  The zombies here are fast, sort of like the zombies in ""Return of the Living Dead"" or ""Nightmare City"", but they are still stupid and can be killed with a bullet to the brain.  They are also a lot better than the ones in ""28 Days Later"" though they were not really zombies.  They were just people infected with a disease that turned violent and puked blood, while the zombies here do what zombies normally do...eat people.  Some humorous moments are scattered throughout, as are a few cameos...Tom Savini and Ken Foree are the two I noticed.  Good action and lots of zombies to be seen here.
