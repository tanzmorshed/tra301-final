","Fantastic Mr. Fox is acclaimed director Wes Anderson's first animation, specifically stop-motion, and it's, well, fantastic. <br/><br/>George Clooney's voice as the head fox of an animal clan that shouts diversity is straight out of Danny Ocean-- cool and witty with an overlay of sentimentality that would convince you to open your hen house door to let him have his way. That's after his little speech that tries existentialism on for size, foxwise that is: ""Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I?""<br/><br/>As the animals pull a caper against farmer Bean (Michael Gambon) and his thugs, the animation pulls away from the gloom of another winner this year, Where the Wild Things Are, and confirms the fun of a well told beast fable with loads of anthropomorphism to reaffirm our love of humanity and confirm that animals, like us, will always be animals. The ease with which Anderson/Clooney convince that this stealing and mayhem are what animals do is a tribute to script and performance that seduce us into the stylistic den of thieves known as the fox lair and all its attitude and custom, sanctioned by mother nature herself.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox: ""The cuss am I? Are you cussing with me?"" Badger (Bill Murray): ""No, you cussing with me?"" Mr. Fox: ""Don't cussing point at me!"" <br/><br/>Such an exchange is indicative of the fun Anderson has with kids and adults by not bombarding the youngsters with profanity but winking at the adults as if to say, ""You know what I mean."" And the most violent moment comes not from scenes with guns but rather where the animals steal chickens and break their necks, done so gingerly and quietly that it seems what it is: Just what foxes do and what humans must do to eat the chickens. Darwin meets the cartoons: Mr. Fox: ""And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?""<br/><br/>That's Wes Anderson for you: Sartre and satire with a dash of dashing fox."

","In recent years, Disney's Pixar division, with their monopoly over animation, has churned out some of the biggest, funniest, most emotional material to hit theaters in the last ten years. By this point, the public knows their aggressive marketing campaign and knows it well. Adult humor and themes geared not only toward the kids, but the parent's as well. The mass appeal? Mom and dad can now take their eight year old to the local multiplex and fork over the steep price of admission without wasting it on a two hour long power nap. Last quarter's CGI constructed Pixar extravaganza ""Up"" captured audiences' hearts, imaginations and pocket books, raking in a less than modest 292 mil at the box office, making it one of the highest grossing animated films of all time. Along comes ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", helmed by auteur Wes Anderson, a crack team at Twentieth-Century Fox (Yes, I said Fox) and Indian Paintbrush, one of Wes' collaborators on his predecessor ""The Darjeeling Limited"". If there's one thing that's detrimental to the Trump-like successes of the Disney powerhouse, it's a new found competitionlet the games begin.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a pure delight. A feast for the eyes. From frame one, it takes no time at all to draw you into its beautiful visuals of vast countryside's, running streams and falling foliage, all in marvelous stop motion. That's right I said it, stop motion. From the course hair on Fox's face to the cotton ball chimney smoke of Boggis, Bunce and Beans warehouse smoke stacks, everything's been designed from scratch, much of which involves simple household items. After just a few minutes in Wes Andersons world inspired by written cues from the mind of the British children's author Roald Dahl (inspired by Dahl's own hometown) you're dragged out of the theater and immersed in a faraway land for the entirety of its modest and to the point one hour and twenty minute runtime. The real treat lies in the notion of how long it actually must have taken these top notch art designers to bring everything to life. There are forces at play here that give one a clear sense of the fact that stepping away from a computer screen and getting things done the hard way pays off when witnessing the final product. Production value is staggeringly noticeable and truly memorable. I for one am still transfixed by the universe of Mr. Fox.<br/><br/>Among one of the droves of Wes Anderson fans, I had high expectations going into the film. Anderson is one of those rare writer/directors that manage to separate themselves from the societal norm, branch out and go their own way. With Fantastic Mr. Fox, he effortlessly supersedes his reputation as one of the most unique Directors of this century. You may be asking yourself how you direct a bunch of puppets, but Andersons 'puppets' are among some of the most realistic and complex that you're likely to meet. With human emotions, expressions and actions, it is clear that Mr. Anderson took great time and preparation during the film's production and pre-production to make sure everything came off as smoothly and impactful as possible. Look out for a particularly funny scene during one of the nightly stake outs portrayed wholly through images on security camera monitors. Very, very well thought out and clever. <br/><br/>Fox, for being aimed at children, is probably one of the most adult animated films I've seen to date. Think Pixar Redux. There's smoking, 'cussing' and above all some extremely heavy handed adult humor and themes. In Wes Andersons sharp, funny, unbelievably witty script, he keeps all of that classic dry comedy that's become synonymous with his trademark, the only exception being that it's coming from the mouths of the animals he's intricately created. Parts had me gasping for air; others had me rolling in the aisles. It's clear to me that by now Wes has really honed in on his craft and gets marginally better with each new picture. <br/><br/>Wes Anderson, with his creative brain that can only be compared to an Einstein of the medium, lays all his cards on the table and ups the ante for Pixar Studios. When asked if he wanted to continue to make animated films he commented by saying, ""I would certainly love to make other animated films in the future."" Could this be his new calling? Truly focusing on the niche market of animated movies tipping the scale more in favor of adult audiences? One would love to think so (of course without turning into another Robert Zemeckis and taking a permanent vacation from live action). Fantastic Mr. Fox is something to be experienced. Children will love its adorable characters while adults will marvel in its ability to connect with them. After all, each of us was a kid at one time or another and because of that there has never been a better excuse to pretend again."
"conversequeen64","10","90","114","10 December 2009"," A Wonderful Return to Classic Animation
","I'll admit it: I love stop motion animation. From the crude Christmas classics that are always on TV this time of year to the elegant masterpieces of Tim Burton, I never miss the chance to see classic animation at work. Needless to say, when I heard about Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was excited. A wonderful Rhold Dahl book, beautifully crafted animation, and an illustrious cast all in one package – this was exciting. I'm happy to say that my excitement was justified as Fantastic Mr. Fox is perhaps one of the best new movies I have seen this year. <br/><br/>The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the lives of the Fox family – Mr (George Clooney), Mrs(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman) – and their animal neighbors and friends. Mr. Fox, once a professional chicken stealer, decides to settle down with his wife after she becomes pregnant and instead take up a career in writing. After moving to a new home in the trunk of a tree, Mr. Fox takes notice in three massive fowl and fruit farms. Risking everything. Mr. Fox decides to embark on one last big job – stealing from all three farms. What happens after that can only be described as pure confusion and debauchery.<br/><br/>As with most Rhold Dahl stories, the book Fantastic Mr. Fox works to both excite kids and humor adults. As a result, the original short story is considered a classic for many families. Though some adaptations of Rhold Dahl classics (see BOTH adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have strayed from Dahl's dry, quirky humor, the film version of one of his best loved stories have honored this side of Dahl's story, projecting a humor perhaps more suited to adults than children, but creating an overall story that will appeal to all. <br/><br/>This movie would likely have been impossible without the work of numerous wonderful voice actors. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson all provide voices in the movie, among other lesser known but still wonderfully talented actors. As a result, the voices blend beautifully into the animation. Instead of feeling like characters with a voice shoved in, the voices and the characters are one. <br/><br/>The animation is perhaps the most appealing aspect of the movie. The script and humor works with the animation in ways traditional or digital animation could not. In many instances, the animation itself provides part of the story. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. Adding to the animation is a muted, fall palette of colors, giving the entire film a homey, comforting feel. <br/><br/>Animation has become so perverted in recent years. Throwing away emotional appeal for visual appeal, the plethora of slick, computer animated, shiny films are almost unnerving. In such an atmosphere, choosing to make a use traditional animation can often spell anathema for the film. As a result, Fantastic Mr. Fox shines, choosing to pick traditional animation techniques to allow the viewer to relate to and communicate with the film in a way few films are able to do anymore. Though perhaps not for everyone, I would recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox for anyone interested in quirky humor, stop-motion animation, or simply a beautifully crafted and well written story."
"DICK STEEL","8","50","62","22 November 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Mr. Fox
","I'm pretty much the sucker for stop motion animation, so this naturally comes with that wee bit of bias, because I surely take my hats off to the filmmakers, especially the modelers and pretty much everyone who has to painstakingly move everything a little bit at a time, which for folks who are impatient (like myself), would already have driven one nuts.<br/><br/>But this crazy effort in bringing to life Roald Dahl's story of a sly fox, is pretty much worth every frame of it. The man hours and intricate designs are something of an old school technique when compared to the latest computer wizardry, but you'll be amazed at what director Wes Anderson and his team managed to come up with, complete with a solid story, likable characters, and plenty of fun.<br/><br/>George Clooney voices Mr Fox, a smug (what else, since Clooney chews these type of roles for breakfast) and wily erm, fox whose specialty is being the chicken thief that he is, providing for family. An incident cutting too close to death has Mr Fox promise Mrs Fox (Meryl Streep) that his thieving days are over, but you know how a leopard cannot change its spots. Soon he moves his family near three farmers Bean (Michael Gambon), Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) and Bunce (Hugo Guinness), and crafts his final hurrah in hitting all three neighbours, only for them to retaliate and demolish Mr Fox's lifestyle, and not to mention his relationship with wife, family and friends, resulting in a battle of wills and wits.<br/><br/>Despite the relatively short run time, the film managed to pack plenty of subplots, characterization, and comedy into one well oiled narrative. You'll surely be one without a sense of humour should you not be able to laugh at anything and everything that Anderson had put on screen, from slapstick to really smart and funny lines that make up every moment of enjoyment in this film. The A-list voice cast also includes the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Brian Cox, Adrien Brody et al, some of whom you'll know are regulars in Anderson's past works.<br/><br/>And if you had enjoyed his past quirky films, then you'd come to expect the same for Fantastic Mr. Fox, with Wes Andersen's signature touches all over the shop, where he made some departures from Dahl's book, but manage to retain the essence of the story, and through a stroke of luck, finding an alternate ending from Dahl's original manuscript which got adopted here in the film. It's comical, it's smart, it's stop motion and it won't be too long before fans will soon adopt Mr Fox's trademarked whistle-whistle-click-click."

","I love this movie. The visuals, the endearment from the characters, the ARCS oh boy the character arcs in this movie are SO SO AMAZING. Anderson makes you feel and care for the characters from square one which is a supremely difficult task to do (most directors/writers instead employ making them dislikable because it's way easier). The visuals are top notch and super original which deserves + 1 star on its own so really this movie gets a 11/10 from me.<br/><br/>The story and the overall effect of this movie to inspire artistic creations and not be afraid of telling a story from your unique perspective is what this movie should really be looked on about. It's a masterpiece."
"rosiblonde","9","116","157","16 November 2009"," A feast for the eyes and ears. No Roald Dahl in sight though
","After reading the reviews on here I wasn't put off watching this film. As a huge fan of animation, as well as Wes Anderson films this film definitely did everything and more for me. There's so much going on in every scene, I found it even funnier than other Anderson films, and as usual I loved all the characters. Anderson manages to keep all the coin facial expressions/awkward silences between characters/quirky background stories that appear in all his films. It's a true work of brilliance! This film has a 'kids film' label on it, but it's not really for children in my opinion, I urge anyone who appreciates animation and is looking to watch something quirky and intelligent to go for this film. Don't be put off due to the hordes of children. Anderson films are best watched on the big screen, so go see it now before it finishes at our cinemas.<br/><br/>The only criticism I will say about this is that I don't think Anderson should have kept the original title of Roald Dahl's story 'Fantastic Mr Fox'. Mainly because it has been adapted so much to Anderson's style (as well as being Americanised) that it isn't really in keeping with Dahl's story, and fans of the acclaimed writer who want to experience the film adaptation of his story will be disappointed I feel. I think he should have given it a different title, like 'Foxxed' or something (that's a rubbish suggestion, but you get what I mean), as I loved it, and wouldn't change anything else, but marketing it as an adaptation of Dahl's book is a little mis-leading (definitely for British people anyway).<br/><br/>-As a side point I think that as much as Dahl supplies a brilliant story and tons of material to make a very good film, I think Dahl's stories are best kept where they belong, and that is on paper. It is his literacy genius where the magic of his stories lie, and reading them (rather than looking at them) gives me the most enjoyment than I could ever get from watching a film of one of his stories.<br/><br/>I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face and felt like bouncing along the pavement as I made my way home. It definitely has been the highlight of my week, and will be without a doubt one of the best films I've seen this year."

","Giving up his life of a chicken thief because of a child on the way, Mr. Fox gets a job as a newspaper writer and lives underground. Years pass, his child is older and he wants to move to a tree and not feel poor anymore. Along the way he takes in his nephew and decides to steal again, from the three biggest farmers no less. The farmers get wise and start a battle against Mr. Fox, his family and all their creature friends. <br/><br/>At first I didn't know if I wanted to see this, the animation looked really bad. But after thinking about it for a bit, I found that it fit into Anderson's style, it was something that he would do. So I gave the film a shot and I'm glad I did. This film has Anderson's signature style all over it, right down to the obvious voice casting, which has the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Owen Wilson, and Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>A lot of people, and I'm including myself in this bunch, might think nothing of this film. After all, it doesn't have the bright, adventurous feel of the recent Disney/Pixar films that have been dominating the animation scene. I'd even throw Dreamworks into that bunch. Those films are done by people who are at ease in their field, animated director like Brad Bird and John Lasseter know their way around the animation style. Yet here comes auteur Wes Anderson, who has a unique style and sense of comedy. His transition to animation, stop motion animation no less, is smart, funny and a pleasure. Is it his best film? Of course not, but it's one of the more enjoyable ones.<br/><br/>The voice cast all work well, Clooney does a good job as the lead. He has that leadership tone in his voice, that arrogance that is needed for the character. Streep isn't given much to do, so her role as the wife is pretty basic, as is the character. Their son Ash, voice by Bored To Death star Jason Schwartzman was a stand out for me, as was Eric Chase Anderson, as Kristofferson. That name might not sound familiar, that's because his resume only consists of Anderson films. Bill Murray plays a badger and Fox's lawyer, who advises him not to buy the tree house. Fox does anyway and that's why he's in this mess. The animals are really small and live in this world where there are apparently small motorbikes for them to use. They can communicate with the human characters, no one seems to find it odd in this little world they live in. You won't find it odd either, you'll just be enjoying the fun.<br/><br/>Each chapter is subtitled, Fox's Master Plan A, Fox's Master Plan B, etc. They even tell you how time passes in human years and fox years and in a comical bit one human hour compare to one fox hour. You never know how long these hours are in comparison to each other, you don't want to know either, it just adds to the uniqueness of the film. At heart, these characters are still wild animals, as Fox even says this in the film, and the way they eat and ""fight"" each other proves this. <br/><br/>The film has that Anderson humour and might go over some kids heads. It's dark in some places, as one character dies, but I think they will enjoy it. They won't jump up and down for it like Up, or Finding Nemo. They won't want to go out and buy the latest Mr. Fox stuffed animal or toy. This feels more like a film for adults, it doesn't really cater to the kids, but they will have their bits to laugh at, like the possum who stares blankly at some people for whatever reason. <br/><br/>This film was made from scratch, this world Anderson creates is fun and I had a fun time being in it. The film flies by it's running time and I never found the film dragging. It was in and out. As stated before, the kids might enjoy this, but it's more for adults. There's smoking and there's even a unique way of swearing, which I found funny. The camera movements scream Wes Anderson and if you're a fan, then you will enjoy this very much. <br/><br/>One of my favourite films of the year."
"Quinoa1984","10","67","97","22 November 2009"," a marvelous clubhouse of a movie where we're all invited to laugh and feel happy
","I made a diorama in third grade of Fantastic Mr. Fox- a book which I loved fondly- and seeing this film brought me back to that, only better and bolder, but with the same handmade quality of someone awed by the world they read. It's also wildly funny and cheerfully light-and-heavy all at once. It brings director Wes Anderson's concerns as a filmmaker to light, as usual (dysfunctional family, idiosyncratic touches with the characters, absurd child-but-adult-like comedy), and in a setting that is a fantasy that anyone can attach to. Children will latch on to it because of its cute/creepy designs, and its raucous energy. Adults will eat it up because, like with Where the Wild Things Are, it brings us back to a time when we just want to have a fun time and do things, even if we might know or thing they're wrong, or maybe just to dance at very odd moments.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (George Clooney, who else?) is a sly guy with a quick mouth and a caring manner. He is a wild animal though, which is why he breaks the promise he made to his wife to not go out and steal chickens after their first child is born. He can't help it really- those nasty trio of farmers, Boggis Bunce and Bean- have all of those chickens and deliciously alcoholic apple cider just waiting for the taking. As it turns out, this makes the farmers angry as hell (or rather Bean mostly, who at one point does one of those manic 'destroy everything in the house' reactions Kane might appreciate), and they go and destroy the Fox home and all the outlying areas.<br/><br/>From there it becomes a battle of wills and, sometimes, real fire power and acorn-bombs and a rabid dog and other wild craziness. Oh, and the stop-motion. Thanks be to someone out there: there's filmmakers still going through the painstaking but endlessly creative process of frame-by-frame film-making where it takes dozens of hours to get just a few seconds of film. People like Anderson and Henry Selick seek out the limitations so they can break through them, or toy around with them as much as possible.<br/><br/>With the characterization of 'Mr. Fox', Anderson and his animation team gives us creatures whose hair is always slightly blowing in the wind (something that must have been hard to attain being shot frame by frame), have eyes that are motorized and look like real human eyes almost, and water (or apple cider) when it flows becomes rather dreamlike and appears like we haven't seen it before. That all of the characters have something amazing to their features, be it the way Mr. Fox gnarls his teeth and then does his trademark whistle or to how Rat clicks his fingers like a West Side Story villain, there's something happening every other second. You might figure out how this is all done, but it's not as much concern as what they do with their creations, like kids with action figures making an epic on 8mm film.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox has the childlike wonder, the modestly dazzling sets and production design (art-Anderson is basically the way to put it by now with his films, from the title cards of species identification to maps and chapter-headings), and an original sense of perspective when it comes to action scenes and simple little camera moves that comes off extraordinary in this setting. But it's also, mostly, hysterically funny. It's not a crude funny like the Hangover or too bizarre like the Men Who Stare at Goats. It's sometimes just plain awkward, or just totally unexpected, or built around an absurdity that comes up and down like the explanation of how to play Whackbat, or Mrs. Bean and her blindness. Or just a line of dialog (""He's just another rat found in the back of a Chinese restaurant"") sets off a belly laugh that's hard to contain. This is, at the least, the funniest of all the Dahl adaptations, keeping to the surrealism of animals and humans alike, while sticking to a perfectly dry, off-handed approach by its filmmaker.<br/><br/>As with everything else in the movie, the comedy feels home-grown, not in a Hollywood lab where everything's tested. This goes too for the excellent voice work that brings Anderson/Baumbach's dialog to fruition. In the theatrical trailer, when first seen, the voices of Clooney and Streep and Bill Murray almost distracted from the quality of the animation. But in full context, they all work, even Anderson himself as a real-estate agent creature. And the outdoor-not-in-studio recording of the voices does add something extra: you feel like there's something real going on, not just in fantasy, thanks to the actors and their ""on-set"" work. I'm sure some extra ideas or expressiveness came out of this, because the performances are a great part of what makes this world so tangible: we know these people and animals, sort of, at least as much as any other Wes Anderson movie.<br/><br/>And sure, they're foxes, but why not connect with the theme while we're at it? The film is lovely and insane, smart and silly, lovable and (for a few moments) a little scary, with a kick-ass soundtrack straight out of a record collection (and musical store) that connects just right right this spectacular place of someplace-England. And hey, why not some existentialism to top it off: ""Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?"" How indeed? ""I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal."""
"gilldominic","Null","94","140","26 October 2009"," Thoroughly Enjoyable
","To put it simply, Fantastic Mr. Fox is unlikely to leave you disappointed.<br/><br/>For a start, the animation, is simply wonderful. Gorgeously designed backgrounds and scenery full of simply incredible attention to detail, the film is full of such loving care and attention. Each character feels full of personality and it's refreshing to see something other than a glossy 3D rendered animation film for a change most certainly. It feels like a return to a day where a little imagination was expected in films, which is nice.<br/><br/>Comparing Pixar releases and this film is besides the point. This film wasn't made to be compared or compete with others, it was made to tell a classic children's tale by one of the greatest authors at writing them. Dahl's wife Felicity herself has described her delight at how the film portrays the universe great author created and the modification of the story for film length is smoothly and smartly done. It is a beautifully told story, heart-warming and charming, witty and full of comedic moments.<br/><br/>While Pixar films play like films made for children that can be enjoyed by adults. Wes Anderson's film feels like one made for adults, that can be enjoyed by children. Some parents may not feel too comfortable of the less than subtle replacement of curse words with ""cuss"" or ""cussing"" it has to be mentioned however.<br/><br/>The voice acting is excellently done, Anderson took the cast outside, underground and indoors for the varying parts of the film to give it a real feel of authenticity which pays off. The soundtrack, as with all Wes Anderson films, is stunningly good and really elevates the film. After watching you may find yourself searching out the soundtrack as soon as you get home.<br/><br/>The film's style and direction screams Wes Anderson at the top of its lungs and so, haters of his previous work may need to be careful, but I would certainly suggest to give the film a try and see if it can convert you, if not at least not make you feel like you've wasted your money.<br/><br/>As a self confessed Wes Anderson fan I was doomed to love this film no matter what, but am genuinely delighted with the end product and believe that more than just the blind Wes Anderson lover will find this film a charming, witty ride of enjoyment."

","This is such an exceptional piece of work, I left the theater amazed at how talented Wes Anderson is. While I like much of his other movies, I was completely blown away by this. The imagination and creativity in this film is truly impressive. I enjoyed every moment of this, and so will you.<br/><br/>The plot centers around Mr. Fox (voice by George Clooney) who decides to start stealing chickens and things from his neighbor Walter Baggis, the owner of a chicken and agricultural empire. The battle that ensues between Mr. Fox's gang, and Baggis' gang, escalates into an all out war. That is the basic theme of the plot. What counts in this movie is the execution, the humor and sheer wittiness Anderson adds to the stop motion figures. They are rendered in a way I have never seen before. Funny, unusual, cleaver, intelligent, I was delighted by every scene at the inventiveness with which it was handled. This movie is so smart and bursting with originality, you'll walk away knowing you completely got your money's worth. I absolutely recommend this film for anyone who appreciates talent, and loves movies."

It is beautifully and strangely directed by Wes Anderson and is meaningful not just for kids, but for adults too. The dynamite cast is another reason to watch this. This is relatively faithful to the book, and if you love Roald Dahl, you will love this movie. If you love Wes Anderson, you will love this movie. If you love animation, you will love this movie.

"nikki-folwell","5","41","69","10 June 2010"," VERY conflicted feelings about this one...
","What a conundrum. It's impossible for me to give this movie one star because in many ways, it's far from a bad movie. The merits which it does have, and there are some, definitely exclude it from that general category. It is, in all fairness, visually stunning, technically brilliant, flawlessly directed, and an all-around treat for the eyes. It's loaded with a great voice cast, wicked creativity, witty dialogue, and a lot of clever ideas. Yet nor can I give it ten stars either. Because in spite of all of this, its stunning visuals and innovative imagination does not mean that I enjoyed it. I didn't. One bit.<br/><br/>For starters, hello? Helllooo, Road Dahl's story? Where are you? Look I understand that when you have a fairly short children's book you often need to pump it up with extra material in order to bring it up to the two-hour mark. No protests there. What I DO have protests about is when you not only add extra ideas but remove the old ones as well. Extra material can be forgiven as long as it's still entertaining and stays faithful to its inspiration. What isn't forgivable is when it's anything BUT faithful, to the point of betraying the book's spirit with its presence. Make no mistake, only a handful of references to the book manage to make it into this rendition - and even then, it almost feels like they're only there because the producers knew that they couldn't really get away with dropping ALL of the old stuff, so they added it as filler, as if to assert that they haven't forgotten what it is taht they're adapting. So woe big fans of the original story. Fantastic Mr. Fox was one of my favourite Road Dahl books when I was little but the manner in which they've twisted it here ensures that the joy which I remember is not captured. Spoilers FYI...<br/><br/>One of the things that made the book so heartwarming was the fact that Mr. & Mrs. Fox had such a sweet and loving relationship. In the movie, perhaps in an attempt to modernise it (and God knows why, it's a kid's story people! Why the cynicism?), Mr. & Mrs. Fox have been altered into a squabbling married couple. The sweetness of the story is almost entirely absent here. It crosses over the line into being depressing. It comes complete with a fight scene in which she hits him, making him cry, and leaving a claw mark across his face which he has for the rest of the movie (domestic violence?). Cripes, there's even a scene where she says that she shouldn't have married him; a comment which she never takes back. And by God, there's another scene where he goes on a suicide mission, agreeing to turn himself in so that the other animals can be spared, and she makes no attempt to stop him. This isn't exactly what I would call uplifting. OK, so it has happy ending, but by that stage I was so disheartened by what had happened up to then that it was impossible to feel moved. This is because the falling-out scenes were painfully drawn-out, while the make-up scenes were merely glossed over. The result, I have to say, makes the ending highly unsatisfying.<br/><br/>George Clooney has a sexy voice as always, and Meryl Streep is great for this kind of role because her voice is so maternal and softly-spoken that it creates the perfect Ying to George's Yang. As I mentioned earlier, the voice cast is great; Jason Schwartzman is brilliant as the son, as is Eric Anderson as the nephew, and everybody else fits their roles like a glove. But the charm of these characters has been so diluted that the actors behind them can't make up for the total lack of engagement, connection and poignancy. Even the jokes, which admittedly can be very sharp in a number of scenes, are not able to take your mind off just how uninvolving the story is. Basically, this is a movie in which they've tried to be edgy so as to appeal to older audiences. Which is fine because this CAN be done successfully; when done right you get a film which keeps adults and children ntertained in equal measure. When done wrong, you get the likes of this, which tries so hard to be watchable for adults that it ends up losing its heart.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, certain scenes are taken in totally unnecessary directions before they have a chance to really get interesting in order to make way for the story's new trappings. The best character in the movie, by far, is Rat, who is superbly and flawlessly voiced by William Dafoe. But what's this, Rat is in it for all of two scenes, and is then killed off. Man. There was so much more room for him, and instead they got rid of him early so that they could go into the all-new (and completely pointless) suplot of Fox's nephew being kidnapped. That's the all-around approach with this movie - bumping off things which could have been entertaining in favour of focusing on things which aren't. There's a scene involving a wolf which I asbolutely failed to see the point of; conversations which don't go anywhere; scenes which ended after two minutes without serving any integral purpose to the plot; and who knows why Owen Wilson was given fifth billing, he's in it for ONE scene!<br/><br/>So those who enjoyed the novel with have trouble with this. Its energy, slickness, animation and special effects are of such an astonishing standard that they're worth the five stars that I gave it alone. But due to the way in which they warped the story with only a pedestrian payoff at the end, that's all I'm giving it. Dahl virgins approach with open mind; Dahl fans beware."
"abengs","5","33","60","5 November 2009"," Fantastic Mr. Fox -- Digging for Value
","This film piqued my interest for two reasons -- the fact it was based on something by Roald Dahl (known for quirky stories) and the fact that Meryl Streep voiced one of the characters. I realize the second reason was a bit shallow, but the film turned out to be equally so. I had to work to find bits of joy. <br/><br/>The first third or so of the film was very slow. I cannot think of when the last time was that I considered walking out of a film, but the beginning of this one had me contemplating a walk out. Finally, the actual Dahl story kicked in at about that point -- and got a little more interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, the film lacked any real reason for me to care for any of the characters or what happened to them. Mr Fox (George Clooney's voice) was, from the start, self-centered and wanting to prove himself to the world, to be famous, as he admitted several times during the movie. But, he had no real, redeeming qualities. His son, Ash, was equally shallow. Kristofferson (nephew), was created as a too-good-to-be-real child. The evil rat (Willem Dafoe) was delightful, and the single-minded fury of Farmer Bean and his wife was somewhat engaging. However, Mrs Felicity Fox (Meryl Streep's voice) was only mildly intriguing, and while her husband was a less than admirable spouse, her blunt comment to him indicating her regret in marrying him to begin with did nothing to make her endearing.<br/><br/>Finally, there was a poorly coordinated side story - that Mr Fox had a fear of wolves, and in the film's culmination, Mr Fox meets a wolf and they show each other a begrudging respect in an overly long segment. Unfortunately, since the fear of foxes had been largely glossed over during most of the film and truly underdeveloped, this scene falls flat and feels completely out of place.<br/><br/>My favorite take away from the film - besides Bill Murray's voice as Badger (and, to a certain degree, Meryl's voice as an uninteresting Mrs Fox) - was the use of the word 'cuss' by any character wishing to swear. The first couple of times it was used, I pricked my ears in curiosity. But, then there was a whole scene filled with 'cuss' this and 'cuss' that. And, for some reason, I found it quite funny. Likely, the reason I was so easily amused was that I had been waiting, hoping, praying for something, anything, to be funny. So, when this came along, I grasped it with both hands and held on tight. <br/><br/>I have no doubt the studio is well aware the film is teetering, dangerously close to being a royal flop. Which is why it comes as no surprise that they are waiting to open it back home in the States on Thanksgiving weekend -- with the hopes that millions of young children will drag their parents to the film before turkey day festivities or as a break amidst 'Black Friday' shopping sprees. They may be able to recoup some costs this way, and, if they are lucky, audiences will be too mellowed out by tryptophan-induced comas from turkey feasts to notice that this movie seriously underachieves its ability to truly be 'Fantastic.'"

","First, the good news: there's some sweetly nuanced stuff here, well-crafted little details and homages, such as Mr Fox's study being a meticulous recreation in miniature of Mr Dahl's garden hut, and the urbane Mr Fox, like the director, being quite the snappy dresser. While Mrs Fox, voiced by Meryl Streep, is indeed most foxy. ""You're as fine looking as a crème brulee"" leers Farmer Bean's sole security detail, Rat (Willem Dafoe), a finger-popping, flickknife-wielding Dennis-Hopper-with-a-tail from some 1950s B-picture. ""Am I being flirted with by a psychotic rat?"" is the wry response.<br/><br/>Suspiciously wry, some might say. If we reveal this film also features a Buddhist-chanting, yoga-practicing fox cub called Kristofferson, the least welcome new addition to a Roald Dahl story - or a canine family since Scrappy Doo; a soundtrack which includes the Beach Boys and the Ballad of Davy Crockett; assorted critters who talk like American co-ed hipsters; laconic musings on existentialism; and lines like ""You really are a kind of quote unquote fantastic fox"", then alarm bells might just start taking your eardrums apart, piece by jagged piece.<br/><br/>Watching this, we're reminded of the game in which you pair entirely unsuitable directors with other people's films: think 'Eli Roth's The Full Monty', 'Sam Peckinpah's Bambi', or 'Neil LaBute's The Wicker Man.' (Can you imagine how embarrassing that might be for everyone if the latter were actually made? Ah.) <br/><br/>This is a Wes Anderson joint first and foremost, with Dahl - and indeed Britain and Britishness - running an extremely poor second. Naturally, only those nasty old farmers have British voices, c/o Michael Gambon and Brian Cox, while even that most English of icons, Jarvis Cocker, contributes a forgettable bluegrass-style number. Turning AA Milne's creations into baffled little rednecks was bad enough. But dear old Foxy? <br/><br/>In the big scheme of things, this shouldn't really matter - but somehow it does. It jars tremendously. The counter-argument runs that story always wins out; that story crosses genre and geographical boundaries. Which would be fine if Anderson had bothered to even slightly subjugate his singular style in its service. If Dahl is all about the story, Anderson's films are all about the attitude. Again, fine. But you'd hardly turn The Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore or The Darjeeling Limited into bedtime stories for your children. Not unless you were feeling particularly sadistic.<br/><br/>It's also a stretch to imagine today's kids responding positively to the deliberately retro stop-animation, an earthier European-style familiar to elder generations, but which might seem abrasive to those weaned on Dreamworks and Pixar. By tying thousands of helium balloons to it, the latter has also raised the bar for family films to vertiginous heights. It's hard to see how Anderson's film, with its bafflingly charmless leading fox, could garner as much goodwill as Up, except among those who still think it's incredibly big and clever to smugly subvert family fare with some tiresomely idiosyncratic shtick.<br/><br/>The best children's stories find magic in the trash. They seek to elevate the everyday. In their droll, archly detached way, Anderson and his co-writer Noah Baumbach seek to reduce. When all's said and done, Mr Fox acknowledges that he's just a ""wild animal"". Felicity Fox says that, although she loves him, ""I shouldn't have married you"". Bean's cider-craving Rat may have ultimately redeemed himself, but in the end ""he's just another dead rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese restaurant."" Way to go, Wes and Noah. Hope that babysitting gig works out for you.<br/><br/>Honestly, this really isn't some kind of Transatlantic stand-off on our part. But how much longer are we expected to stand impotently by while Hollywood arrogantly Americanises our every British children's icon, from Winnie the Pooh to Peter Pan? Who's next - Paddington Bear? (Yes, we know he's technically South American, but you get the drift). Clearly, it's time to fight back, starting with an all-new adaptation of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Starring Ant and Dec."
"lieksototally","3","34","73","30 January 2010"," I tried to like it...
","After viewing the film, I was truly shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb.<br/><br/>'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an adaption of a beloved children's classic, portraying the story of the smooth, slick protagonist Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. That's right, one short, one fat, one lean, or however it goes.<br/><br/>I don't quite know where to start with my criticism.<br/><br/>Well, I'm in my late teens and was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough, having read a few of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again. This film, however, struggles for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still unsure! Many of the 'jokes' would bore a child, especially as Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor. Also, an audience of (I'm assuming) children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting down on their necks! Surely that's a bit much? And also, the plot... well, it's kind of boring. I stayed only with the hope of it getting better, but instead I just got more and more annoyed at Mr Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions.<br/><br/>The humour, meanwhile, falls flat. I laughed only once or twice, even though I specifically recognised attempts at jokes. I think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned. The voice actors have no sense of comic timing, instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and sleek, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I didn't even realise Bill Murray had a role until the end credits, and Ash, twelve-years old in fox-years, sounds like he's about 30.<br/><br/>I love animation, particularly stop motion, but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit. Characters are tall, spindly and lacking any warmth of design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange. There is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel, as 2D components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully. Characters look straight at the camera and talked; it was very awkward. There was one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera, didn't move and had swirls on his eyeballs. It actually freaked me out.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Lots of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it just wasn't for me."
"p-stepien","3","31","66","17 January 2011"," The Erractic Mr. Fox
","The base for ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the beloved children's book by British iconic author Roald Dahl. As in the original the film focuses on life ordeals of Mr. Fox and his family. The premise for the story is Mr. Fox's stealing spree of chickens, ducks, turkeys and cider, which make him top of the most wanted list of despicable farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Unlike in the original instead of a fox basically trying to cater and feed his family in this outing we have a typical dysfunctional Wes Anderson family, whose papa is addicted to stealing. Not to mention that his son is an irritating little bugger, whilst you also get a key new addition of kick-boxing super-athlete cousin Kristofferson . Oh! And did I mention that all the animals in the forest are Americans (which really makes the movie jar throughout, as the characters are cool hipster forest animals). Meanwhile the farmers remaining outstandingly British.<br/><br/>I can and will forgive the scriptwriter (Wes Anderson) for basically taking a dump on the whole sense, premise and feeling of the story. I will in this case treat ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" as something totally unrelated to the book (which remains outside of Anderson's capabilities to ever achieve as long as he resolves to sticking to his gameplan).<br/><br/>I will not however gloss over the fact, that the animation has neither the humour and wit of Nick Park, the intelligence and unforgettable charm of Hayao Miyazaki or the heart of Pixar. The only thing that Anderson has is... quirkiness. I have never seemed to be able to understand the almost unanimous critic appeal of Wes Anderson (albeit his cult adoration thankfully does not seem to extend too far outside American borders). I never found his movies profound, if anything to me they reeked of pretentious artsy drivel (including the underwhelming ""Rushmore""). Additionally Wes Anderson seems to be incapable of directing movies with likable leads - even in ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" the charmless title character played by George Clooney sounds like a George Clooney with a persistent headache on Valium impression. The only actor that manages to ring true is Meryl Streep as Ms. Fox, but her role is relatively insignificant and secondary. As usual I also found the lines nowhere as deep, meaningful and brilliant as Anderson believes them to be. Actually they mostly felt flat and written by an adolescent during Sunday school. Whats worse the add-on quirky jokes are tragically unfunny and I found myself battling to even produce a single smirk during this ordeal.<br/><br/>The worst thing is however that I have no idea who the target audience is. The plot plods along at snails pace and the characters are whiny, cajoling, boring and unlikeable with a unrelenting need to spit out inappropriate inside jokes (not to mention they are constantly 'cussing' with standout lines like: """"This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everyone"". What the cuss?). Additionally they are hard to understand due to seemingly inherent articulation flaws. Not to mention that some of the animation (one of the few brilliant things in the movie) is eerie, creepy and frightful in a very inappropriate manner. That basically means the whole base audience of kids is not suited for this visualisation of the children's book making it an obscure attempt at mainstream by Wes Anderson, which easily explains the poor sales of the movie.<br/><br/>If we are to believe that this is an animation for adults, than well... I will never jump onto the Wes Anderson band waggon, even though I'm quite sure all the negative feedback I will get for my above review. I find Anderson's films unmemorable, unimaginative and tiresome dragging on like a snail with rheumatism. Basically a animation soap-opera.<br/><br/>I would really love to catch the drift and hop on-board the Anderson love-boat, but with this dreadfully boring animation of a brilliant children's book this revelation will have to be put on hold. Until than count me out of this adoration."

","I would think the audience is limited for this kind of animated film but, thank goodness, I'm one of those people who loved it. Apparently, a lot of other reviewers here did, too. There is a lot to appreciate about this movie.<br/><br/>""Fox"" is written for other adults, let's be honest. This isn't a kids' movie because most of the dialog would go right over their heads. However, intelligent adults - people especially with a good vocabulary and a quirky sense of humor - should love ""Fantastic Mr. Fox.""<br/><br/>The hero is even voiced by a real-life elitist, George Clooney. The smug-sounding Mr. Clooney does a super job in the lead voice role of ""Mr. Fox."" The same goes for the villainous ""Mr. Bean,"" voiced by the nasty-sounding Michael Gambon. The details in the drawings also come through nicely in the Blu-Ray version, so see it in that formula if you have a BD player and HD set. Thus, this film offers great visuals along with the wonderful dialog.<br/><br/>The story is typical; a father finds out his family is more important than anything else and his young son tries to win approval from dad - but how this is executed is really ""clever"" to both see and hear. Yes, it's a cliché story but it's done so differently with such unique dialog and humor that it's fantastically entertaining.<br/><br/>If you think animated films are strictly for the young; this movie will change your mind. Best of all, it's the type of movie you should be able to enjoy multiple times because there is so much to take in."
"rhinocerosfive-1","10","12","23","27 November 2009"," Wes Anderson: A Hero's Journeyman
","In a movie year so vapid that I found myself debating the virtues of Michael Bay vs Roland Emmerich (two sickening panderers, the latter of whom is at least less a Hasbro salesman than a bad filmmaker), I just about gave up on going to the movies. Just about. Then Wes Anderson released the best filmed fairy tale since the invention of the zoetrope.<br/><br/>It may be argued that Anderson is not the most consistent director working. That attribute is better attached to Bay, who consistently insults my intelligence. But consistency, while a virtue, is not the mark an artist ought to hit. Excellence is a better target. Michael Bay thinks that excellence is measured by ticket sales, that transcendence is related to expenditure, that success is found in delivering the lowest common denominator of good time to the broadest possible spectrum of children. Every shot in a Michael Bay movie feels test-marketed. Which is why his movies tend to last exactly as long as their initial release.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I am a big Wes Anderson fan. I still don't like BOTTLE ROCKET all that much, but it is better than any movie I saw this year not directed by Wes Anderson. This guy is so defiantly not a populist that with every new release, I grow a little more afraid of his never getting funding again. His movies don't tend to make money. His audiences are necessarily educated, open-minded, analytical, patient, compassionate. Does this sound like your America? Anderson seems uninterested in selling a single ticket. He clearly has no desire to make a movie that will help him to make more movies. Any question remaining on this point after LIFE AQUATIC was answered by DARJEELING LIMITED. Here is a man who can only make art for himself. He will starve before he makes any other kind. So I worry, because he happens, tangentially, to be making it for me too.<br/><br/>And hey - this is a kids' movie. Anyway, I'm sure Fox thought so when it signed up. I mean, it's animated, it's from a kids' book, it's got talking animals. But the kids in the theater with me did not experience my ecstasy. They will not clamor for Mr Fox dolls on Black Friday. Mr Fox is in fact a scary, villainous, superficially charming ne'er-do-well. He is boorish, a dangerous egotist. A bad father. A bad husband. His excuse (""I'm a wild animal"") sounds like a wifebeater's apology. The movie does not celebrate his deeds or personality. At the end of the picture, he has reduced his community to living in a sewer, eating synthetic versions of the real food they used to enjoy, with none of their former freedoms, listening to his speeches about how THIS is the good life while the rest of the world tries to kill them. (What kind of metaphor for suburban values is this? Mr Fox as Mr Bush? Am I reaching? I am not.) So this isn't a movie for kids. It isn't a movie for imperialists. It isn't a movie for 20th Century Fox, who would surely have preferred another STAR WARS-type toy delivery system.<br/><br/>It's a movie for me.<br/><br/>There's my G.I. Joe from 1975, blowing up the Fox home. There's Roald Dahl's repeated line about ""little electric sparks"" dancing in the characters' eyes, finally brought to life. There's the opossum that keeps invading my mother's house. What? Yes. It's a movie so god damn personal that it achieves the universal through minutiae. In doing so it achieves my dream of a fairy tale so much like a pre-Disney Grimm version that 80% of the characters behave with total self-interest and abuse everyone else.<br/><br/>It's a myth that performs the essential function of mythology: it reminds me of my responsibilities to my society, which are legion. I must be all I can be; I must not bring harm to my friends; I must not make bad art to buy another Lamborghini.<br/><br/>It's a movie from Wes Anderson, for Wes Anderson and me and you. And if Michael Bay sees it, perhaps it'll do us all some good."

There was probably some of American humor that I didn't get at all. The script was nothing special, including all the Hollywood family clichés of unhappy marriage, problem child etc. I could hardly laugh at most in a couple of scenes. I'm not an expert in animation techniques and this movie might have brought something new in that aspect however, there was not a bit of creativity in story telling especially when compared to Miyazaki animations or even Toy Story and Wall-E.

My beef(s) with this film are as follows 1. This movie bore little resemblance to the book apart from the names of the characters. 2. The whole thing was americanised. 3.

Things I liked were as few and far between I enjoyed the sound of Clooney's voice and Meryl's too, but they should have been given a much better script.

I was interested in seeing it, sadly I was met with an abomination of a movie that really had little relevance to the book at all.<br/><br/>It is sad when a classic British book such as Fantastic Mr Fox is Amercanised as this has been. They could have made it classically British by using English actors to do the voices, they could have kept the story faithful by adhering more closely to the book. But, they didn't. Instead they have used American actors and gung-ho music to make it more like an over-the-top adventure movie with some poor attempts at humour. It's obvious the market they were aiming at and does not take a lot of thought to figure it out.<br/><br/>If Roald Dahl had still been alive I do not think he would ever have allowed this film to be made, let alone released as no real justice has been done to the book at all. A real shame. Do yourself a favour and read what is a really great book. Whatever you do, avoid this heap of junk of a movie at all costs.<br/><br/>I've given it 1/10 because you can't go any lower."

","On paper this story, as the movie portrayed, would be entertaining and easy to follow. Great for kids, bored adults. I hated the way the foxes were drawn, all scarecrow-ish and freakishly tall. They moved too woodingly too. The first thing that I noticed was how idiotic Foxy was and if I were his wife, he'd be seeing the flat side of a cast iron frying pan to his head. The foxes talked mechanically, especially the wife, like they were discussing medical theories in a library, instead of feeling the real emotion the scene would have caused. I can't believe that this movie got as much positive feedback as it did. I've seen much better animation in ""The Curse of the Wererabbit"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"" as examples of my personal favourites."

This film blew me out of the water.<br/><br/>The film's true value diminishes in repeat viewings, probably because the film is so fresh and so unique. Watching it 8 years after its release, it still feels new and original. As long as you don't have any expectations, over the course of the movie it will constantly up the ante on comedy, plot, and themes.<br/><br/>By far, the best parts of the film are the voice acting, dialogue, and animation. The cast may seem like throw-away star-power on paper, but upon watching, the actors are all spectacular, and their star power is no distraction at all. The dialogue is so surprising, quick, witty, and humorous. And the animation is a fresh take on stop-motion animation, which was pretty rare at the time.<br/><br/>I really don't have a lot of bad to say about the film. I hear that it isn't especially true to the source material, but I had never even heard of the Roald Dahl story. If you can shed your expectations of the film, it really is excellent.<br/><br/>I am actually kind of worried that movies like this don't get more attention, and this film may actually be forgotten one day, despite being one of the greatest animated films of all time."

","To me - and I know many, many people will disagree - Wes Anderson is another one of those directors whose movies I only like one of - I actually quite enjoyed The Life Aquatic (mostly because of Bill Murray and the quality stop-motion animation), but that's it. Everything else he does is just irritatingly boring, dull and completely unfunny. I've tried to like his movies, but I just can't. I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind. This review is applicable to all Wes Bentley films (except Aquatic), so hopefully I won't have to keep repeating myself. Oh, another thing; I absolutely can't stand Jason Schwartzman! SOMEBODY PLEASE kill his acting career!"

I woke up up at intervals, glad when I woke finally and the end titles were playing! My dear wife and 11 year old son had somehow endured the whole film without snoozing, they didn't enjoy anything about it either.<br/><br/>An absolute mystery to us how it's managed to score 8/10 on the usually spot on IMDb, it's like some people have watched a different film! Anyway, our advice is that it's utterly awful. Avoid at all costs."
"MartinHafer","7","4","6","17 October 2010"," I think my enjoyment of the film was damaged by all the hype....
","When ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" debuted, there was a lot of hubbub about it. People were abuzz about it at Cannes and people talked about it at Oscar time. So, naturally, I assumed it must have been a heck of a good film--not a slightly better than average film with some slightly creepy characters. Yes, I say slightly creepy because the stop-motion characters look quite a bit like dead stuffed animals. Plus there simply have been so many animated films that looked more technically advanced. This one seemed more like a cast-off from the old days of stop-motion--which isn't all bad, as it IS interesting if old fashioned.<br/><br/>The story is about a thrill-seeking fox who loves to take chances--though he seems to forget that he has a family back home. At the same time, there's an inspiring plot (or at least that's what the formula dictates) about the wimpy son of this fox needing to prove himself. Both these plot come together when three local entrepreneurs get sick of Mr. Fox stealing from them again and again. Much of the final half of the film involves the foxes and other animals all trying to avoid getting killed by these men--and the young fox (not unexpectedly) proving his worth.<br/><br/>Really, there's nothing too extraordinary about this film--the animation or the story. The only outstanding things are the expensive actors that were employed to provide the voices. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable film for older kids and adults alike--though I do think it's a bit too dark for younger audiences.<br/><br/>By the way, you might think I am crazy for making this comparison, but right after seeing the much-praised ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", I watched a film with no real distribution at all (Disney basically killed the film and released it straight to video) that had no critical acclaim (1996's ""The Wind in the Willows"") and found I much preferred the lower budget latter film. It was simply more fun...something I felt was missing at times from ""Fox""."

","While unfamiliar with Dahl's book of the same title, I have read other works of his and I watched this film expecting to see some evidence of his wit. I found none.<br/><br/>The dialogue is very American in style and I found it quite painful. This wasn't helped by the plot which focused more on the relationships between the unfaithful (in terms of a promise not to steal chickens again) Mr Fox and his loving wife and the one between their small weedy adolescent son and his athletic yoga doing cousin who had come over to stay. The actual exploits of Mr Fox were reduced to a poor sub plot.<br/><br/>Usually, when I watch a film with ""goodies"" and ""baddies"", I find myself wanting one side to win. It may the ""goodies"" but on occasion, I can for example find the heroes so obnoxious or perhaps that the villains have such charm that I wish the bad guys would win. Either way, there is at least some from of desire for an outcome.<br/><br/>In this case, I simply did not care. The slightly dysfunctional Fox family were bland. Their enemies, the farmers, may have been unable to let go of their determination for revenge on Mr Fox but, rather than having any real villainous qualities, they were about as uninteresting as the Foxes.<br/><br/>All in all, I found the film rather pointless."

","I can't say that when I first read the plot for this one I was all that interested in seeing it. However since it was $2 admission day for kids shows and the reviews seemed to be SO positive I decided to chance it. I should have gone with my gut feeling. <br/><br/>There were 4 kids (aged 9-14) and two adults in our group and EVERYONE hated it. It was truly dreadful. It looked like it had been pieced together by high-school students and the caption for each change in scene (I guess they must have thought the audience was too stupid to notice) didn't exactly give it the feel of a professional show or do anything for the flow of the film. <br/><br/>The Claymation looked like it was done by amateurs and was a poor choice for a feature-length film - which is thankfully it barely long-enough to qualify as - I was waiting for it to wrap up or improve after the first two minutes. It is easily the worst children's movie I've seen of any kind. Had I not had the kids and neighbour's kids with me I would have left after the first ten minutes it was that bad. When the characters were swearing they would use the word ""cuss,"" which became very confusing in the first scene in which it occurred. The rest of the dialogue was equally bad. I'm not not sure where all the positive reviews are coming from but after seeing this piece of work I have doubts as to the ratings/reviews on IMDb as a whole. <br/><br/>To quote another reviewer who actually saw the film, ""Avoid at all costs."""
"sugarmack","4","15","33","25 October 2009"," A Wes Anderson film bearing little resemblance to Dahl's beloved book
","I was so frustrated watching this film. I went in with Dahl's whimsical Mr Fox, adored by his family and beautifully and loquaciously winning over his friends and neighbours, making him truly 'Fantastic' Mr Fox. Very shortly into the film I wondered why Wes Anderson had bothered to 'adapt' Fantastic Mr Fox when every character was so far removed from Dahl's characters, with Mr Fox's pubescent son resembling Gwyneth Paltrow's Tenenbaum character. Clooney's Mr Fox is far from fantastic, Streep's Mrs Fox is nothing like Dahl's Mrs Fox. Hearing such typically UK English prose adapted to Anderson's American 'Hey, Man's is grating for those familiar with Dahl's book. Similarly, the plot and settings loosely resembled Dahl's, with over half of the plot being Anderson's creation, and the bits that come from Dahl's book being changed so greatly. In Anderson's favour, this film had his typical rhythm, style, pace, and his depressed, staccatoed, little-explained characters, but then why take a story with such a different pace, with a completely style and with such different characters? Admittedly, Quentin Blake's illustrations live vividly in the mind of many Dahl readers and seem to so perfectly illustrate Dahl's dark, twisted and curious characters. However, it is not the animation that leaves alienates me from this film. The animation is generally well done, although, again, Anderson's overtones bear strongly on the animation, with each character bearing an Anderson 'twitch'.<br/><br/>I did my best to try to understand this as an 'Anderson' film and rate it based on that, but the incongruity of this film to the story it's based on gave me little enjoyment."
"Doctor_Mongoose","4","21","50","13 November 2009"," I didn't laugh once
","There has been a lot of love that has been put into Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr Fox"", unfortunately all the love is for himself. Granted, there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with.<br/><br/>The animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. There wasn't really anything special about the acting either, with Wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog.<br/><br/>The film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in England, all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents. I cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is. I didn't laugh once."
"ScienceFictionHairdo","3","7","13","24 July 2013"," Boring
","I started watching this movie with the best intentions. I actually like many of the voice actors, and have heard good things about the director. Talk about life setting me up for a fall. It started with what I thought to be an opening sequence with some weird drawing-like images of a farm and some ugly lifeless foxes pasted on top of it, moving along with all the fluency of a powerpoint presentation. Soon enough I would find out that the entire movie would be in this style.<br/><br/>If I were to sum the entire experience up in a word it would be boring. That pretty much says it all. The animation (though probably brilliantly done, and very artsy) just doesn't deliver. The characters look lifeless and at times even scary. This is probably partially due to the facial expressions of the characters, or rather, lack thereof. They aren't nearly sophisticated enough to put the emotions of the story across. The ''action'' scenes are anything but. The slow, boring, and unrealistic stop motion animation makes it virtually impossible to feel any sort of suspense regardless of what's going on in the movie.<br/><br/>All of this could be forgiven if the story would be any good (and suited for this type of animation), but alas. The story is weird, long-winded, unengaging, but most of all; boring. I remember reading the book as a child, and loving it. I wish I could say the same for this screen adaptation. I don't really remember the entire story in the original book, but I'm sure it was more interesting than this.<br/><br/>The humor, or rather, lack thereof, is terrible. I don't remember even chuckling for the entire duration of this 87 minute nightmare. Those 87 minutes must have been in fox minutes, because it felt like an eternity. Usually these animated movies score quite well in the humor department, but this movie manages to elevate the ability to not-engage an audience to an art form. It's really quite impressive.<br/><br/>I don't even know what the purpose of this movie was. It failed to deliver on all fronts, and I can't imagine any of the people working on this genuinely feeling satisfied with the end result. At no point did I feel drawn into the movie. Honestly, I stopped watching after about an hour. I had to work really hard to even make it that far, but at a certain point I just gave up. I honestly don't care if the foxes made it out alive, or whatever happened to any of the characters. They could all be electrocuted and left to die for all I care. Steer clear."
"lumosnight","2","7","13","26 March 2013"," Stop Americanising everything!
","Yes, Americanising. With emo kids, animals who work in companies, a failing marriage, all the drama.... just please stop. <br/><br/>Roald Dahl is my favourite writer. It was thanks to his books that I became an avid reader as a child, and Fantastic Mr. Fox was his first book I read that lead me to discover the joys of reading. <br/><br/>It had witty humor and the reader would savor the idea of eating plump chickens, juicy geese and syrupy cider. The point was that simple animals could outwit man and his machines - it was about survival from a wild creature's point of view, of course with all the humour thrown in.<br/><br/>The movie completely tramples on this point and instead portrays the animal world much like our human world, with lawyers, loans and mortgages. What is going on here? What made it worse is that the movie dumbed everything down into an American soap opera - Mr. Fox has a worn out marriage with his purple-eyed wife (?) and they have only one child, who is a rebellious teenager. The weird cousin comes over, and I seriously don't comprehend what he contributes to the plot - he just stands there awkwardly and behaves like victim of abuse with all his frightened stares.<br/><br/>The story barely focuses on the delicious food but instead on the drama and making it look like the overused Ocean's Eleven shtick. Instead of rooting for the characters like in the book, in the movie I didn't bond with them and I didn't care about their fates. <br/><br/>I give this a 2 out of 10 because it takes a lot of effort to create a decent stop animated movie, but plot-wise it was a complete disregard for Dahl's work and wit. Let your child or younger sibling read the book, it is a very entertaining read, while the movie is very forgettable."

I like the abundance of funny scenes, as it works magic in the film. Visuals are nice and the characters are likable to look at. I find the plot quite straight forward, and even a little too plain in some parts. There are little ups and downs to keep the thrill going. Or maybe I am expecting too much as it is a children's story.<br/><br/>I have always had respect for stop motion animations because it takes so long to make just a scene.

","Aren't preconceptions horrible? I went to this movie convinced, on the back of having seen the trailer numerous times, that I wouldn't enjoy it. And guess what? I was right.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of mainstream stop-frame animation - I have the complete Harryhausen (excluding Earth vs The Flying Saucers, but including all the Puppetoons etc.) On my DVD shelves, and I'm a big fan of Willis O'Brien, Jim Danforth, and Phil Tippett. I don't much care for the middle European stuff from the 50s and 60s though.<br/><br/>And that's pretty similar to the style adopted here, and I have to say I don't care for it. There were times when I greatly admired the way some effects were achieved, but I really didn't like the way this film looked (from a character and set design point of view) or moved. In fact, populating an essentially rustic English setting with distinctly American animals didn't really work. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it was simply that the execution meant that there was, to me, an irreconcilable disharmony between the two.<br/><br/>The voice talent was, on the whole, very good, with Clooney, Streep, and Gambon not unexpectedly taking the honours.<br/><br/>The script was, I thought, awful. Wes Anderson joins the Coen brothers and Darren Aronofsky in that select group of writer/directors who make films which display, with utter confidence, a belief in how clever they are, a belief which a) I don't necessarily share and b) irritates me intensely with its arrogant disregard of me as an audience member.<br/><br/>Finally, this film has no idea - and doesn't care - who its audience is. In many ways it is clearly pitched at adults, but then it is tweaked downwards for tinies: the script contains a number of instances where the word ""cuss"" is substituted for the F-bomb, for instance."

","At the urging of his wife, Mr Fox renounces his life as a master thief. But when he moves into a new house adjoining the bloated farms of messrs Boggis, Bunce and Bean, the temptation to help himself proves too great <br/><br/>I think Wes Anderson is probably the wrong director to adapt Roald Dahl's classic children's book for the screen, but having said that this is a pretty good movie. Dahl's characters tend to be simple and strong - either very good or very bad - whereas Wes Anderson's are full of tics and neuroses. In the book, Mr Fox is simply a hero, whereas here he is part cuckold, part rebel narcissist, with a tendency to pontificate and an adolescent son with an inferiority complex. The problem throughout is that the movie is pitched too high - it should be designed for six-year-olds, but feels more like it's aimed at teenagers. The novel is too short to fill a movie, but the expansion into a three-act drama is quite successful, giving Mr and Mrs Fox a back-story and the three villainous farmers a dose of revenge as they flood the fox tunnels with Bean's cider and flush our heroes into the sewers. Where the movie really scores for me is in the quality of the animation, lensed by stop-motion expert Tristan Oliver. There are some amazing action scenes, great point-of-view tracks, daring close-ups of the animals' faces, and a beautiful sequence against the backdrop of a waterfall. Alexandre Desplat's rustic music is excellent, and there's a great song in the middle by Jarvis Cocker of Pulp fame. The voice cast are mostly good, with some flashy parts like Dafoe's scene-stealing turn as a beatnik jd-styled rat, but the casting is a bit odd; Wolodarsky is really a producer, Eric Anderson is the director's brother and Wes also voices a part, Hugo Guinness (Bunce) is a painter, director Garth Jennings has a part - what, weren't any real actors available ? The movie has some good scenes and enough laughs and I found myself warming to it towards the end, but it doesn't really capture the purity, wickedness and joie de vivre of Dahl's writing. For that, check out the two best film adaptations of his work - Nicolas Roeg's The Witches or Danny DeVito's Matilda."
"AlmightyB","4","5","9","1 January 2013"," A Triumph for Stopmotion, But Not Much Else
","This is a strange film. I don't know if I like it or not, it's hard to tell. Let's see:<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic. It's beautiful to watch and every time you see the film you'll notice something new going on in the background. It bravely attempts unrealistic scenes such as when the animals are digging, and these add to the quirkiness of the film. There are no complaints in this regard, the animators have done a good job.<br/><br/>Perhaps then you should watch this with the sound down. The script is mediocre at best. It did draw a few laughs but this was chiefly as a result of the animation rather than the actual joke. There is little correlation with the book, which in some films is needed, but it is overdone here. If Dahl was alive today I doubt he would have enjoyed this adaptation. To paraphrase Cosmo Landesman of The Sunday Times, it lacks the elements of child abuse, violence and the peril that the book captured. This is replaced by a yawn-inducing conflict with Mr Fox and his wife, in a strange attempt to make it ""relevant,"" instead adding another cliché to the pile. Mr Fox himself is completely cliché throughout, and I felt absolutely no doubt that somehow he would overcome the problem presented by the story-line. For a children's film this is not what we want. When the film finally limped in to finish, I greeted it with relief rather than happiness.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another so-so feature. There are few moments when it really fits in well, but it does the job and I have no problem with that.<br/><br/>The main feature of controversy is the bizarre ""americanisation"" of the story. This really sucks a lot of the film's soul out. Why give the heroes American accents and the villains British accents? Oh yeah, because that's what viewers want, apparently. Another cliché is added to the pile and led to me losing my interest even more. The addition of things American viewers would expect to find like supermarkets does this film no favours. Or should I say favor.<br/><br/>In conclusion, should you watch this film? No. Unless you are determined to encourage the sort of rubbish the American film industry is churning out nowadays, with dull adaptations of British classics, then there is little reason to. I am being more harsh than I would normally be here because I am determined to see an end to this. A poor film that is killed by its own Americanisation."

","""If what I think is happening IS happening...it better not be.""<br/><br/>I never would have guessed that Wes Anderson would venture into the world of  stop motion animation, but after seeing The Fantastic Mr. Fox, I have to admit that it's a natural fit. I think having the unlimited creative license that animation provides really let him indulge his creativity, and a absolutely great movie was the result.<br/><br/>Anderson and Noah Baumbach took the classic Roald Dahl story and greatly expanded the beginning and end, while giving it a unique look and tone that is quite different from other recent animation. It's still essentially about a fox who steals from three local farmers in order to provide from his family, and brings a lot of trouble on all the nearby animals as a result, but the story is now fleshed out beyond that. This is an Anderson movie through and through, with all the eccentric characters, wonderful music, complicated family dynamics, and understated, off-beat humor that the world has come to expect from his work.<br/><br/>It's difficult to find any part of Fantastic Mr. Fox to raise a complaint about. The animation, character designs and sets are beautiful, the cast of actors and actresses brought in to do the voice acting were all excellent, and the movie as a whole was just charming. Along with Ponyo and Coraline, I'd say that this is among the best animated films I've seen in quite a while. Even better than Pixar's excellent recent work. I really hope that Anderson makes something like this again in the future."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox (1:26, PG) — Other: Talking Animals, 2nd string, original<br/><br/>Ray Harryhausen's Jason and the Argonauts, with its platoon of sword-wielding skeletons, came out in 1963. For the math-challenged, that's almost half a century ago. You'd think that the state of the art in stop-motion animation would have shown some advances since then. And indeed it has, if you look at the never-ending feast of delights from Nick Park's Aardman Studios, home of Chicken Run and various Wallace & Gromit features. And of course there's Tim Burton's brilliant The Nightmare before Christmas, directed by Henry Selick, who went on to use the technique extensively in Coraline.<br/><br/>Return with us, then, to those halcyon days of half a century ago, this time at feature length, for really crappy stop-motion animation in Fantastic Mr. Fox. The story was based on a book by the estimable and unpredictable Roald Dahl, so you'd think it would have potential, but the screenplay by Noah Baumbach and director/producer Wes Anderson is pretty uninspiring. Mr. Fox (roguishly voiced by the perfect choice, George Clooney) has agreed to give up raiding the henhouse to placate his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep). But, like Danny Ocean, he's gotta go back for 1 more job — well, maybe 2, make that 3 — in the company of his amiable but dull opossum buddy Kylie.<br/><br/>These raids understandably tick off the farmers, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, and they retaliate against not only the foxes but all the other burrowing creatures in the vicinity, attacking with steam shovels, explosives, and a deluge of apple cider (the specialty of Farmer Bunce), apparently more readily available than plain water. Running, scrambling, some shooting, and encounters with beagles and electric fences ensue, but nobody seems to get particularly worked up over anything. Evidently Anderson was going for suave, but he just ended up with dull.<br/><br/>All the creatures stand upright and wear ill-fitting human clothes. They speak like adults, except for the cloying convention of substituting a standard kid-safe epithet where it's obvious what any normal English speaker would have said, as in ""This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everyone."". Ugh.<br/><br/>Other cast members who probably pulled in substantial paychecks for their efforts include Jason Schwartzman (fox son Ash), Bill Murray (badger), and Willem Dafoe (rat). In return for the savings the producers could have realized by hiring regular voice actors instead of big- name stars, they could have afforded better special effects. But what the pic really needed was another couple of runs thru the typer.<br/><br/>Too bad. This was an effort to try something outside the mainstream, and I normally root for those, but they've still gotta deliver. This one just wasn't anywhere near fantastic enuf."

It's a kids story which does a poor job of following Roald Dahl's great children's book. Where the book had some originality and fun, it is still for children. Making a movie out of it with an A-list of voice actors gives the impression it's not for children. And to be honest, there's not much for children to be found here. There's not a lot of good humor going around - the conversations are not at a children's level and well, the story just isn't very adventurous or appealing. For adults however, there's also nothing to be found - the humor isn't good enough to keep you entertained and the story and animation itself are ... bad. This movie just has not much going for itself, apart from the voice actors, who do a great job. Adding to insult, the script is totally different from the book and doesn't do the great author Dahl justice.<br/><br/>In the end, you're left with a movie that you expect to find at the Disney channel on a Sunday afternoon. And even then you'd better not watch it. To be avoided."

"archiecm","3","12","29","13 December 2009"," Quirky and Confusing
","I gave this film three stars because its wit broke through here and there. But the dialog was written to shock for the sake of shocking. And the highbrow language of real estate and status symbols was aimed at who? Adults with MBA's? So I was chuckling but was also uncomfortable at the same time--who was making me laugh? A fox or a ""human"" looking like a fox? He was dressed like a fox, liked to steal chickens, but settled down as a newspaper columnist. Where was the society that supported and craved daily news on the printed page? Actually, that part was put forth halfheartedly.I mean was there an animal society with culture and stuff or not? Even if there was Mr Fox didn't really suit that life. If the narrator in ""Marley and Me"" was a columnist, or the narrator in ""The Soloist,"" then this guy was a sham, a farce. He had no interest in his trade . . . none. Yet his family duties demanded that he stay legit and not ""break the law."" He dare not get sent to prison or be killed. The roles confused me here. (Maybe reading the book would clear it up.) Is he right to take up stealing again or wrong? Stealing is in his blood, you can tell that but the tightrope between getting the adrenaline rush and risking the safety of his family and neighbors is confusing. He and the story keep demonstrating inconsistencies.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that it was hard for me to know who to root for. He kept succeeding until his overconfidence got him busted. His relationship with his son was dysfunctional. It was almost painful to hear the lines from his son. They were quite realistically written complete with veiled hostility, appeals for encouragement and flat out statements of inadequacy. Was that supposed to be funny?<br/><br/>Finally, the whole issue of stealing was schizophrenic. Foxes don't steal in the human sense. They hunt for available food. Their aim is to get food but not die trying. Many a fox has made the fatal mistake of hunting Man's flocks because of diminishing natural habitat or the laziness of old age. Here the issue is more like a cartoon scenario like Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. But wouldn't the Bugs Bunny saga be more of a downer if we witnessed Fudd wipe out Bug's entire home environment and endanger his kids and cause Bugs to feel guilty for what used to be fun? And feel guilty because Fudd was coming close to ending the entire cartoon? You'd have worry creep in where there used to be only humor. Your laughter would change from a series of guffaws to intermittent giggles. For me, some of those giggles were from embarrassment . . . like when someone's bombing on stage.<br/><br/>I think the film suffered from the writers not knowing what kind of film they were going for--they seemed to opt for what cracked them up that moment as they sat around the writing table."

","There is mania currently for Hollywood movies that are different. Because everything became so mundane, Hollywood is in crises... and as a result of that, you get movie like this, overrated with bunch of rewards.<br/><br/>First do yourself a favor and go watch the trailer. You must be sure that you can bear that awful 40's like animation 'till the end. Old movies with plasticine figurines had smoother moves than characters in this movie. Animation is bad, but thats OK because they are retro. The Artist is also retro black and white, silent movie, but it had a GREAT story.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox is based by the book, but I think story is hijacked from thin picture book for children. Very shallow. Plus bad animation and no chance for good acting. Voice acting is not very demanding.<br/><br/>I thought that will give me some laughs, but not at all... maybe 2-3 for the whole movie.

","I can only say that for whatever reasons this had little appeal to me. It is not even 90 minutes and I felt the film dragging. I liked the animation style but this only held me for so long. The story is kind of repetitive – a series of chase and hunt scenes. Also it is overly wordy – hardly a few seconds go by without someone saying something that is allegedly witty, amusing or humorous. The whole thing became rather drab with characters being constantly added to make up for the lack of a substantial story-line. <br/><br/>It fact, overall, it lacked in emotion and was on the dry side. I would hardly say this is for children – I'm sure they would be as bored as I was."

","Very good animation but the story is not very compelling. It is a throw back to action cartoon movies. Tries too hard to have a moral but instead of one story line you have several - father son relation, son jealous of more talented cousin, husband wife conflict over safety vs. adventure, being true to yourself, friendship and trust, etc. The problem is you don't really care about any of these stories. The movie just moves on from one story to the next. Visually interesting but appears to be just a star role for George Clooney. Not that interesting a movie. The story has a lot of inconsistencies. The death of the rat seems rather gratuitous and out of place. No real explanation is presented on why the rat is security for the farmer or how a message is delivered from Mr. Fox to the farmers. Why would anyone keep a rabid dog? Why not just make it a vicious dog? The story just doesn't seem that well thought out. Mildly entertaining with some funny lines but not worth seeing a second time."
"gas911-1","5","6","12","10 March 2010"," Far From Fantastic, but a bit of a hoot!
","Fantastic Mr. Fox had it's British elements torn from the roots, butchered, Americanised, and in result of this we get to see the laziest stop motion displayed in cinema history. If you watch Nick Park's work on Wallace & Gromit, there is so much charm because of the attention to detail. This really does look rushed, and when ever there is a adventure or action sequences the camera cuts miles back so you can only just make out the card board cut outs. Wes Anderson could argue it's for effect, but perhaps all the budget went into it's divine A-list voice cast that there was just no money or time put in it's appearance. It doesn't look cute, in fact at times it's almost disturbing. The voice cast are fine here, the only problem is that there is just no need for these big names. Someone 10 times cheaper than George Clooney could have pulled off Fox's vocal chords with out breaking a sweat. It's just one massive marketing technique. The only voice actor here that was so vital to the film is Jason Schwartzman, his delivery is where the movie get's its greatest comedic injection.<br/><br/>Having said all this, this isn't particularly a bad movie at all. It's really well write and the dialogue is charming a very witty. Never laugh out loud hilarious, but it keeps the viewer much more interested, seeming so there's not much else to fall back on. The plot, although taken from the novel, still isn't great, but things do pick up in the last couple of acts and as annoying and frightening it may look, it is still entertaining. It's adult for kids, to kiddie for adults, Mr. Fox really can't settle a target audience and really can't hold a worthy contender for the Best Animation Film.<br/><br/>Overall: Far from fantastic, but it's quirky, cooky and a bit of a hoot. But in the end of the day it's just another ash for the animation pile."

","I could look at this film all day. I could find new things in it all the time, I imagine. That's how densely constructed and designed it is. Of course, that's par for the course with Wes Anderson, and that's one of the things I like him. He packs his films with ridiculous amounts of detail and feeling and sadness and humor and warmth and awesomeness. Fantastic Mr. Fox is pretty much the same movie he's been making all along except this time it's figurines and crap. We got the usual fathers and sons type deal and you got lateral tracking shots and you got awesomeness.

","I remember awhile ago, when i seen Mr fox in pre-production on IMDb, and thought WOW! my favourite book, being made into a film. When it came out, i thought i'd read the book again so it was fresh in my mind for seeing the film.<br/><br/>But sitting in the cinema, watching it, i was disappointed.<br/><br/>There were elements to the story in the book that wasn't in the film. Book - Mr fox has 4 cubs, who he loves. Film - one cub who he doesn't appreciate or seem to like. but he has a cousin ""Kristofferson"" - who is this? what a complete re-write!<br/><br/>then the cousin gets kidnapped, and Mr fox has to rescue him... would it make more sense if one of his 4 cubs got kidnapped instead?<br/><br/>and the other things that aren't in the story.... just feels like Wes Anderson took the book, glanced at it, and then added his own ending, not even reading it. many aspects weren't in the film.<br/><br/>Its like having Charlie and the chocolate factory, without the chocolate. Or James and the giant peach without the peach. whats the point in basing a film on a book when you change aspects of it??<br/><br/>then there is the cast.. Owen Wilson.. funny guy.. been in some good films recently.. yet for some bizarre reason he has a 1 minute part. probably 2 lines and then he's gone. (trying to explain some hot box game!? - where was that in the book???) Bill Murray - personal favourite - ghost buster legend! - but seemed under-used. <br/><br/>and for a kids film.. there is no need to use the word ""CUSS"" a few people have mentioned this in reviews.. there was no need for it. And opening scene with a bottle of jam called cock something.. why why why? Children's BOOK!! Children's FILM!!!<br/><br/>overall - its an OK film... but if you want something fantastic - read the book!"
"tiofw","7","8","18","8 November 2009"," Fantastic/Awful
","I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson's films. Fantastic Mr Fox is my favourite Roald Dahl book. But their styles aren't compatible - and that's what ultimately sours this movie for me.<br/><br/>Visually, it's brilliant. The animation is wonderful. It looks just like any other WA film. Lots of detail. Lots of camera pans and ""square"" shots. Title cards. Fantastic.<br/><br/>Music: another great selection of songs. Appropriate to FMF? No. However, with a better script, they might have made for a good eclectic counterpoint.<br/><br/>The script is the problem. It was obviously considered ""cute"" to add a a whole lot of ""fake"" swearing. And by that I mean using ""cuss"" instead of that four-letter expletive beginning with f. But these cuss-es are plain irritating to me (a Brit). Even more so when Michael Gambon says them. The Americanization of the story is akin to putting a giant yellow M on Big Ben. If you're an American, you may not care about this - YMMV.<br/><br/>If this had been an original story - not an adaptation - and without Cuss-Gate, it would be another WA masterpiece to add to the collection. As it is, unfortunately I feel generous giving it 7."
"thomas-360","4","5","10","26 July 2013"," Didn't work for me
","I finally saw this film almost four years after its original release, and have to say it did not work for me, for exactly the reasons that kept me from going to see it in the theater back in '09.<br/><br/>The animation is good for the most part, but the changes to the story are forced and unnecessary, the voice acting by the all-star cast is shockingly bland and uninspired, and the whole thing is, in a maddening way, quirky just for quirky's sake. After the tenth time, the ""laconic comment followed by five seconds of awkward silence"" gag just isn't funny any more. Same with most of the music, it was just a placeholder for the Benny Hill Theme, because playing that over all the repetitive scenes of ""Foxy"" and his gang just moving about randomly would have been a little to obvious even for this flick.<br/><br/>And yes, like many other reviewers I'm a huge fan of the book, but even when viewing this as a work of it's own - maybe especially then - it just does not hold up. It tries way to hard, its parts don't fit together nearly well enough, and it left me without any strong feelings whatsoever. It was overshadowed at the box office by ""Twilight 2"" and ""Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"", and as someone who hates both of these movies with a passion, I still have to say I understand why."

"masakiuma","8","5","10","23 June 2010"," Quite original but would be NOTHING without Mr. Fox
","A fox, formerly a bird thief, tries to keep living a straight life. He has a family, a job with the newspaper, and a fancy new house in a strong tree. Unfortunately his tree overlooks the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean (one short, one fat, one mean), three of the meanest farmers in the world. Along with his Badger friend, Mr. Fox plans one last big heist: stealing from all three men. Unfortunately, they don't just roll over and take it, and Mr. Fox is soon in quite a predicament.<br/><br/>This movie is animated....kind of. It is done in a similar stop-motion style such as that of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" only much creepier. Honestly if I saw this movie as a kid, it probably would have given me nightmares - not because the movie is scary, but the animation itself is quite terrifying, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>For those of you who know me, you are aware that I am not a big fan of what I call ""artsy films,"" and Wes Anderson is a major creator of these. Such movies as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited are all critically acclaimed films that I really didn't care for...maybe it's just me. SOME parts of Mr. Fox are quite reminiscent of these previously listed movies, but somehow it is not as annoying.<br/><br/>I had low expectations after the first few minutes. Even when the movie was over I really didn't know what to think about it. However, after letting it marinade in my brain for a few hours, I reached the conclusion that the movie was pretty good.<br/><br/>The Good: George Clooney definitely made Mr. Fox a more intriguing character than he would have been had anyone else done the voice over. I also thought Franklin Bean was an entertaining (and quite vicious) villain. Too bad Boggis and Bunce weren't as interesting. Also Willem Dafoe was awesome as The Rat. Two great scenes that stand out to me are when Mr. Fox is making the final plan and calling everyone by their Latin names, and the part at the end with the wolf (Canis Lupus!), though don't ask me why. I loved that the movie had extremely dirty language but still got a PG rating---the solution: replace every place where a swear word was used with the word ""curse."" GENIUS! Someone can just say ""What the curse are you talking about?"" Adults can fill in the blank and kids don't know what he meant. Very original. For a technical compliment, the music and scenery were also quite good.<br/><br/>The Bad: Most characters that are not Mr. Fox are not very interesting. The movie is not lying about being about Mr. Fox. Was it just me or did his wife only have about 4 lines in the entire movie, all of which were extremely dry and mono toned? Mr. Fox's son was also terribly annoying as the angsty teen fox. Also like I said before, the animation is horrifying.<br/><br/>Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox was *just* shy of being fantastic, but I'd definitely give it a recommendation, especially if you like Wes Anderson. I would probably watch it again, but not until after the nightmares stop.<br/><br/>Final Score - 7.5/10"
"Cinema_Fan","8","6","13","23 October 2009"," A fox's tale of charm, wit and non-stop motion.
","Roald Dahl (1916 - 1990) wrote some truly beautiful children's stories, for example: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach and Matilda (and who scripted films as You Only Live Twice (1967) and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)), all made into film, and this too, now includes his 1970 creation ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"".<br/><br/>It is the story of one Mr. Fox and his wild-ways of hen heckling, turkey taking and cider sipping, nocturnal, instinctive adventures. Now married and with cub, he has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. He is too rebellious, he is too wild and he is going to try ""just one more raid"" on the three nastiest, meanest and fox hating farmers that are Boggis (Brian Cox), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). <br/><br/>The direction here is suburb, extremely humorous characters and personalities that project a warm, charismatic, optimistic adventure for all ages. There are chuckle-out-loud as there are certainly laugh-out-loud moments here, the close-ups of Mr. Fox's ""grin"" and his tiny friends ""vacant staring eyes"" are worth their weight in gold. This too, is a visually interesting film that has been done with a Nikon D3 35mm digital single-lens reflex camera and stop-motion techniques that give a wonderful cinema experience. It is a far away cry from the classic and golden days of Charles -Émile Reynaud (1844 - 1918), the pioneer of animated film, and Ray Harryhausen (b. 1920) et al, and it works a treat.<br/><br/>Okay, only Mr. Dahl's story, apparently, is used during what we can call the ""middle section"" of the film and with added new parts both front and rear, this may just explain why, with the final ""toast"" by Mr. Fox, there seems to be a serious note, or message, that concerns ""survival"". This may seem too pessimistic, too out of place for this narrative, this may be the director telling his audience the contemporary message, that it really is a dog-eat-dog world and that we have to do what needs to be done to ""survive"".<br/><br/>Take away the gloss, and all Mr. Fox is, and lives by, are his basic instincts to kill and steal in order to survive. A cynical, and possibly, a pessimistic approach, but I do believe that this may be the narratives undercurrent message here. Also, there seems to be a very ""un-Englishness"" feel about this film, from the very start we are delving into a high-octane cast, and soundtrack, that is all too obvious in its origins, yes, the farmers are from the other side of the pond, but it is not they who are the selling point. On the positive, this alone cannot distract from the charming, rich and freshness feel of Fantastic Mr. Fox, it is a breath of fresh air, literally, and it is also one more credit to the writing of one Mr. Fantastic Roald Dahl."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)<br/><br/>I never would have seen this movie, I think, if it wasn't for ""Moonrise Kingdom"" which I totally adored. Directed by the same man, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a kind of animated or claymation production with famous actors doing the voices, like ""Where the Wild Things Are"" or the more animated Pixar and Disney movies.<br/><br/>It's not really quite for children, however. Director Wes Anderson has shown in both movies a sensibility unique in movies. These aren't just a kids cartoon movies with adult overtones (undertones?). But they aren't the sardonic and ironic adult fare sometimes seen in animation, keeping all through a sense of playfulness and innocence. Both movies are consistent, incredibly well designed and filmed, and warm without being sickly sweet.<br/><br/>But my own preference is for the more recent Moonrise Kingdom because that movie used real actors, and had a wilder sense of exploration of the scenery with the camera. There will be equal numbers who prefer ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" for exactly the opposite reasons--it's all invented and original, going not only across fun mid-America landscapes but going underground, too. It's endlessly fun. There are villains and heroes. There is a clear sense of right and wrong, of love and even of some kind of character development.<br/><br/>There isn't, for my taste, enough of what you just call plot. Things happen, and it progresses, of course. But it's nothing much to chew on, just further and further escapades escaping the baddies. Fun, yes, but it actually gets tiring, too. When this happens you turn to the set design and the general style, which is worth watching for its own sake. But I still wish there was more. (An example further out-- the first ""Monsters Inc."" is non-stop interesting and inventive. That's a high standard, but hey.)<br/><br/>The voices here are big names (like George Clooney) but maybe they don't matter so much. It's not like their character, as a human actor, is embedded in the character, at least not much. (This is done more clearly in ""Polar Express"" where Tom Hanks is kind of evident all along.) <br/><br/>Yeah, enjoy the heck out of this. And you really can let your kids watch it--they'll likely love it. And you might, too."

The soundtrack is crisp and the movie has some great characters. This is one of the best roles Clooney has played.

"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","1","2 March 2018"," Fantastic Mr. Fox was not what I thought it was going to be.
","Looking at the front cover of the bluray, it looked to be cute, fun and super child friendly. It's fun, definitely. Cute? Sure. Super child friendly? No no no. Yes children can watch it but the screenplay was absolutely genius, they just wouldn't appreciate it. This was hilarious. Me laughing on multiple occasions is a rare achievement for any film, trust Wes Anderson and his quirky quirkiness to win me over. This is easily one of his strongest films, both in script and technical direction. His style is so unique and inventive that it's hard not to admire it. His centralisation of characters or objects in shots are just innovative, forcing the audience to become absorbed with what's on screen. Plenty of direct address to entice the viewer which I'm sure the younger audience will appreciate. But this screenplay. Genius. Masterful. Quotable. So many nice touches like substituting curse words with the word ""cuss"". Might go over children, but damn it made me laugh. ""What a cluster-cuss"". Ha! Only Anderson could pull that off in an animation. Every character had a unique and creative personality. Mr Fox was sly and suave, his son Ash was eccentric, nephew Kristofferson was perfect in every way, heck even Mrs Fox had some personality...she's a fully independent woman *click fingers in zig zag formation*. The voice casting choices were spot on. Clooney has that suave voice that suited Mr Fox, Streep has the power behind her voice for Mrs Fox. Schwartzman was the stand out, his line execution ensured laughter from viewers...so good! The only criticism I have is the soundtrack, some of the songs just didn't work for me and I think an original score would've suited the animation better. Oh, the stop motion work was tremendous. It's a dying art, so I can fully appreciate the time spent on a project like this. Overall, this took me by surprise. Honestly. I think older viewers will actually find more enjoyment due to the adventurous script. Can't wait to watch it again."

","Animation (2/2): The animation is fantastic, at the same time it can be awkward (in a good way) and extremely full of details. At this point the movie lives up to the style of stop motion animation masterfully.<br/><br/>Soundtrack (2/2): The track is great, each song fits perfectly into their respective scene.<br/><br/>Acting/Direction (1.5 / 2): All the voice actors are OK, there isn't much to point out here, they neither hurt nor make the movie extraordinary. Wes Anderson's direction is interesting, with a peculiar filming style, with one or another scene coming out of the status quo. A good direction, of a good director.<br/><br/>History (0,5 / 2): From the beginning the film try to present us with a very basic story, this is certainly not a problem, even with other animations already showing us that it is possible to do something aimed at children but adults can also watch and perceive small hidden elements behind the story. See Toy Story 3, Inside Out and etc. But even the simple ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" seems to fail to do, some points take you out of the story (ex: If from the beginning he was good at digging, why was not his first plan already?). Perhaps a small positive point here is the sense of adventure, which is present and can entertain children.<br/><br/>Comedy (0/2): Here is probably where the movie lost me. After all, what's the point of seeing a comedy that isn't funny? And I don't say that because no scene made me cry with laughter, I say this because I didn't find any scenes if you want funny, the movie fails miserably in this matter, definitely this is not a funny movie.<br/><br/>6/10"
"cherold","6","1","1","6 January 2012"," I have mixed feelings on this one
","What exactly is the Fantastic Mr. Fox? Since it's a feature cartoon based on a Roald Dahl story one might assume it would be a movie for kids, or a movie for kids of all ages, but it's not. The dysfunctional family and the arch dialog and the low-key performances all make it clear this is something for adults, something aiming to be a quirky way to deliver Anderson's typical fare. Or perhaps it actually does aim to be a kid's film and this was simply the closes Anderson could come.<br/><br/>In either case, the movie doesn't totally work for me. Even though I never read the Roald Dahl story, I know his work well enough to know that this has little to do with it. Anderson and Dahl have very different sensibilities. But at the same time, they are both quirky. I think if Anderson wanted to take a kid's story and give it a modernist twist he would have been better off with something less quirky, a more traditional children's story like The Wizard of Oz. As it is, the two varieties of quirkiness work against each other. Anderson is small and thoughtful and acerbic, Dahl is over-the-top and ironic and somewhat savage. And while Anderson wins this debate, because he has the final word, the vestiges of Dahl make it all feel a bit off.<br/><br/>This is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie. I generally did. It's mildly amusing and the animation is kind of interesting in places. I didn't particularly mind watching it. But I was never drawn into the world, I never felt connected with the characters or concerned about their plight. The movie, like all Wes Anderson films, keeps you at a distance from the characters, but unlike his best movies, it doesn't make up for that with enough eccentricity to keep one engaged.<br/><br/>It doesn't surprise me that the critics loved this movie. Critics tend to get jaded and immediately latch onto anything different, and this movie is decidedly different. But Anderson would have been better off either making a cartoon aimed at kids or making a live action show aimed at adults. Instead, he just confuses the two."
"grasshopper-46827","4","3","6","7 July 2019"," Too adult for kids, to smug for adults, and not even close to Roald Dahl
","I wanted to like this film. I love animation, whether its the flashiest CGI or the simplest stop-motion, and I love Roald Dahl. I like witty, quirky unexpected humour and I don't get into a spin when a book adaptation does just that - adapts a story for the screen. The cast list looked terrific. What could I lose?<br/><br/>First I lost hope; then I lost interest. The trouble with this film was that it was trying to be a witty and stylish adult heist-film within a child's storybook - but there was never enough sense of threat to make that work. But they didn't stop there: a touch of spagetti-western with the showdown with a texan rat actually got me interested for the whole 3 minutes before they dropped back to the boring main threads. They squidged in a disaffected teen buddy story, with the jealous, overlooked son and his perfect cousin - unconvincing, tiresome, solved by the son suddenly becoming athletic and brilliant under fire for no reason. They made a stab at a dash or romance Mrs Fox the fiesty wife who lets him away with it anyway. Couldn't find enough clichÃ©s?<br/><br/>The Americanisation of the story wouldn't bother me at all if it was complete and wholehearted instead of half-baked. Why were the villains, in this rural American landscape, English? Why did Jarvis Cocker turn up singing bluegrass? Why did the helicopter spotter Australian? These things are so absurd they almost sound funny, but in the event they just seemed stupid and unconvincing.<br/><br/>The adult humour came over as smug and self-indulgent - very different from Dahl's odd, daring and absurd charm. ""Based on"" is overstating it - they kept the 3 villains, a rat and Mr/Mrs Fox: most other things were changed. The one element from Dahl's story, which was published 1970, that they did not change was the gender balance. Hard to imagine a wildlife community with a male/female ratio of 9:1 lasting. Oh, and the females were 1. the wife/mother and 2. the possible love interest for the cousin (so the son could be jealous). No, no hold on... a villain's wife appeared briefly twice...<br/><br/>I did like the animation - the strange layers, the funny digging scenes, the narrow and tall thing. But it didn't make up for a muddled plot, no likeable characters, a tiresomely smug script. No joy and no surprises.<br/><br/>This film was selected by my youngest kid but the kids watched it pretty well in silence and said it was... ""Mmm. Okay"" That says it all really. Disappointing."
"epiczombietakeover","8","3","6","17 July 2010"," You'll be surprised!
","When I rented ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", I was pretty much expecting another cutesy rodent flick that I could fall asleep too. I was in for a shocker. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, this movie is obviously quirky, but not in an unsettling way. It is very witty and I found its sense of humor refreshing for an animated film. It doesn't have to be vile, but has a very adult humor to it. There are many child-friendly replacements such as ""the disloyal lab partner"" and ""what the cuss"" and ""beagle ticks"". It was clever, but didn't run completely on shock value. I admire that in a script. George Clooney and Meryl Streep obviously do a great job with the voice acting, but I was surprised that Streep had a relatively secondary role. The characters are very easy to relate too. (And yes, I know they're animals). Ash is the awkward son who is trying to find his place in the world. His jealousy of his ""perfect"" cousin, Kristofferson, provides a good B-storyline. Mr. Fox is the former-thief who doesn't like the concept of settling down. His wife (who I originally thought was the tragic, stereotypical housewife) can still kick butt. This is one of those movies you have to watch twice before you can warm up to it, but it's definitely worth it. 8/10"
"zetes","8","3","6","13 December 2009"," A lot of weaknesses, but it's pleasant and kind of beautiful at times
","Wes Anderson becomes an animation director while retaining his signature visual style. The stop-motion animation itself is intentionally crude and old fashioned, almost like an episode of Gumby, and it has a charm. One wonders whether the younger generation will accept it or not. Some kids in the theater behind me certainly didn't, and were fidgeting throughout the movie. That may not have just been due to the animation style, though, as it's not really aimed for kids so much as Wes Anderson fans. Based on the book by Roald Dahl but presumably barely resembling it, George Clooney voices Mr. Fox, a former bird thief forced to give it up by his wife (Meryl Streep) after they are nearly captured. Twelve years later and saddled by a son (Jason Schwartzman) and a new mortgage, Mr. Fox decides that he's had enough of the safe life and decides to pilfer from three nearby and very dangerous farmers. In retaliation, the farmers attack the entire animal community in the forest where Mr. Fox lives. I haven't read the Dahl book, but most of Fantastic Mr. Fox's best moments are definitely Wes Anderson moments, with perfectly chosen music and semi-awkward dialogue and petty character conflict. The plot of the film is really not Anderson's interest, which does lead to problems later in the film. As a children's story, Fantastic Mr. Fox at least in part relies on action, and Anderson is just not an action director. His set-ups are confusing and often make little sense. As the film goes through its climax, it gets considerably weaker than when the characters were just standing around conversing. All in all, it's far from a great movie, and perhaps in reality it isn't even that good of one. But there is a lot of beauty in it, and I love the handcrafted feel. I'd marginally recommend it, though I'd say you have to at least in part be a fan of Wes Anderson."
"adrongardner","9","3","6","7 December 2009"," Let's cut the cuss, one cussing good movie
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of those films that just makes you smile. <br/><br/>Newspaper man Mr. Fox is out to feed his family. Not because he is hungry but simply because he is a wild animal. Wes Anderson's Roald Dahl adaptation is joyous, charming and out right hilarious. There really isn't anything out there to compete with it for your dollars right now.<br/><br/>I made it my mission in elementary school to read every one of Roald Dahl's books. Having read Fantastic Mr. Fox twenty some years ago, I still had a fuzzy idea of the story. The film follows the original quite well. Anderson has expanded the narrative in ways that not only fit his style, but the added character dimensions fit the story perfectly.<br/><br/>The stop-motion animation is a great way for a story like this to be shared with an audience. Computer animation gets better and better every year, but Fantastic Mr. Fox shows there is life left in the hand made process still.<br/><br/>George Cloony has a mischievous luster in the title role opposite Meryl Streep's quiet confidence of his wife. While Bill Murray's Badger and Willem Dafoe's Weasel turn in well honed supporting voices, it is Wallace Wolodarsky's Opossum Kylie who steals the show. I laughed at nearly every one of his lines.<br/><br/>After several half measures and missteps since Royal Tenenbaums (itself a movie that was either obnoxious or brilliant) Wes Anderson has directed something truly great. <br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox is a cuss of a good time. When the credits goes down to ""Let Her Dance"" from the Bobby Fuller Four all I can do is smile."
"C-Younkin","7","3","6","15 November 2009"," Anderson is in the hen house
","A fox has gotta stay true to being a fox. That's the point of director Wes Anderson's (The Royal Tennenbaums) simplistic, yet entertaining first foray into animation. With ""Coraline"", ""Up"", and now ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", that ""Best animated Feature"" Oscar race is heating up. Based on the children's book by Roald Dahl, Fox (voice with sly charm by George Clooney) promises his wife (Meryl Streep) that he'll quit his thieving ways and settle down with a less dangerous job in order to support his fast-growing family. 2 years later (12 in fox years), Fox is a newspaper man living with his wife and young son named Ash (Jason Schwartzman), who is eager to please his father and jealous of his taller and much more talented visiting-cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Except something just isn't right. Fox needs that thrill of catching chickens and so along with his opossum buddy Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky), he sets out to steal from three of the meanest land-owners in the area, Boggis, Bunce, and the soon to be leader of the three who sets out to kill Fox, Bean (Michael Gambon). Soon Fox realizes that he's not only put the lives of his family at risk, but all the other animals as well. The stop motion animation is amazing; the bright-orangey scenery, fluidly quick character movements, and their outstanding creation are all marvelously done. Anderson has also found a good medium for his quirky sense of humor, especially in a hilarious description of a convoluted baseball/cricket-type game and an on-going gag about Kylie's eyes. George Clooney leads the way in voice casting but the all-star cast does nice work as well, Gambon playing a perfectly gruff antagonist, Schwartzman as the attention-seeking son, and Willem Dafoe very funny as a Louisiana rat. Streep, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Brian Cox also show up but have less to do. ""Fox"" is a little less than fantastic, but it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half."

","George Clooney is pretty much the same character he played in ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"". As in that movie, by far the best thing about ""Mr. Fox"" is the music, although ""Brother"" was somewhat better in that regard. Who is this movie for? It is too dark for children--I very much regret taking my 7-year-old to see it, and some younger girls nearby seemed traumatized. And yet it is not an adult movie either; animated animals, cartoon violence, and no fully realized characters. A appearance by a wolf near the end is clearly meant to be a great peroration, but is set up and executed is so perfunctory a manner as to be almost embarrassing. Wes Anderson seems to think that the movie is quite ironic and clever; to me it lacks humanity and any real insight. The animation is beautiful and the music is quite well executed. There are a few scenes that are quite good, mostly involving the relationship between Ash and his cousin Kristofferson. These are the primary strengths of a movie that disappoints overall."

I knew nothing of it being Roald Dahl and I still haven't looked up what Wes Anderson has done before. Perhaps this was my mistake.<br/><br/>The animation was amateur, the plot either nearly non-existent or perhaps (to be fair) just far too subtle for me but if that is the case, I don't think kids will get it. The characters were annoying and mostly pretty unpleasant. The morals are also at least questionable as the lead character lies, steals, kills without expecting repercussions. When these repercussions occur, they affect not only him but all those around and he remains unrepentant.<br/><br/>In short, I am wondering how people thought this was a good film."
"john in missouri","4","4","10","24 September 2010"," You keep waiting for a stroke of brilliance that just never comes.
","I have no idea why viewers at IMDb have given this movie an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Well, that's not quite true. I do have an idea why. But it's not a good reason.<br/><br/>There's a tendency in our society to rate things really highly that are different. Well, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is certainly that. Different.<br/><br/>That's about the best I can say for it.<br/><br/>When you combine ""different"" - which in this case means: <br/><br/>* stop-motion animation <br/><br/>* deliberately dull color schemes <br/><br/>* a mostly-incoherent plot <br/><br/>* and quirky attempts at humor<br/><br/>with many of the major characters speaking in extremely familiar voices (such as those of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray and Willem Dafoe), you have a recipe for a runaway success. By ""runaway success,"" I mean that this movie somehow managed to recoup its $40 million budget.<br/><br/>Yes, the only thing more astonishing than the fact that this plodding, (in my opinion) artless film cost $40 million to make is that it grossed more than it cost.<br/><br/>I normally try not to give away the plot in my reviews, but there's not much worry about that with this movie. It's a looong 87 minutes.<br/><br/>At one point I had to go and retrieve my 7-year-old son (who LOVES movies), because he had wandered away for lack of interest. It looked like something worth watching was actually about to happen. I regret that I did not allow him to go on his own way.<br/><br/>To give them credit, they certainly tried to be ""original."" Their approach was to go a bit further than most such films in incorporating themes more relevant to adults and older teens, such as marital conflict, teenage identity crisis, flipping real estate, the sexual reputation of Mr. Fox's wife, and so forth. The result is an awkward mix of soap opera and animated action that isn't quite suitable either for children or for adults. (Interestingly, two of the three reviews immediately before mine, both from people who LOVED the film, said almost the same thing!)<br/><br/>The good points of this film include some good voice acting by familiar voices, and some decent music. <br/><br/>My 12-year-old son, by the way, concurs with my assessment of this movie. His review: ""The animation is pretty bad, and there wasn't really a plot. All they did was run around in sewer pipes and get shot at all the time. Definitely a one-time-view only."" <br/><br/>Both of us (independently) also drew comparisons to the infamous Superbabies 2: Baby Geniuses. In fact, my son stated that he would rather watch the latter, as ""it actually has a plot line.""<br/><br/>If you appreciate a movie that's different really just for the sake of being different, then you'll probably love this film. Otherwise, I'd give it a miss. Honestly, I was kind of sorry I rented it. I had in mind to rent a good family movie, and since this one was PG-rated, animated, and given a vote of 8.0 out of 10 by IMDb viewers, I thought it would be a good choice. But it really isn't a good family film, for the reasons stated above.<br/><br/>Also, even though the film substitutes ""cuss"" for all profanity, I must admit squirming a bit when Mr. Fox sighed, ""This is gonna be a total clustercuss for everybody."" I could just see one of my kids asking me, ""Dad, what's a clustercuss?"" <br/><br/>In short: This movie was highly-rated for the exact same reason Barack Obama was elected President: It's different from what we're used to. Unfortunately, in both instances, we can see that different doesn't always mean worthwhile. <br/><br/>Oh, and I see the first person to rate my review rated it as ""not useful,"" probably because he or she loves this film (or Barack Obama, or both). The review is what it is: an honest assessment of this movie by someone who has seen hundreds of films (if not thousands) and has reviewed 50 of them (!) here on IMDb. It tells you specifically why neither I nor any of my family liked ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" <br/><br/>I recognize that mine is (obviously) a minority opinion, but I don't really see how that makes for an ""unhelpful"" review. What it should tell you instead (especially when you go through additional reviews and see other 4-and-5 star ones besides mine) is that while lots of people love ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" it certainly is NOT for everyone. There are actually a fair number of us who simply don't agree."
"CubsandCulture","10","2","4","29 March 2019"," A Great Cussing Film
","Anderson's overall approach to filmmaking can be a little bit artificial. His live action stuff is often too self-conscious and twee for its own good. Yet in animation this slightly stilted quality of tone and excessive concern with details really fits. This is one of the few films of his that I have found myself swept up in. It is a crackerjack of a film that has all the components of a hit for families. It has plenty of adult humor that is sure to go over kids' heads; it has some fairly adult themes about dealing with a midlife crisis. Above all the film has a great, great sense of moment, space and visual scope. The animation is wonderful. And it is just so Anderson.<br/><br/>Fans of the Dahl book might be annoyed. The adaptation is fairly loose. The film expands both the beginning and the end of the tale. Further, the tone of the story doesn't quite have the subversive edge that Dahl's work does. I read the book as a kid and this isn't quite what I thought the film would be. Anderson's personality comes through more than Dahl's.<br/><br/>Clooney is really engaging as Mr. Fox. This was good fit between director, source material and lead actor.<br/><br/>And I love the cussing in the film!"
"Liam3011","10","2","4","19 October 2014"," ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is... well, fantastic!
","Back in 2009 when this movie was first in cinemas, I turned a blind eye to this film. I didn't really watch many kids movies then. I was an all- action person. I loved action films, and still do, mind you. But over recent years (last two years?), I've found myself getting more in touch with my younger side; the side that loves animated films.<br/><br/>I'm going to try and keep my review spoiler free, but I will mark it for having spoilers just in case something slips out. <br/><br/>The premise follows the same as the book; Mr. Fox steals food from three wealthy and dangerous farmers, and in an attempt to kill him, they dig up his home, forcing him and his family to dig deeper and deeper underground. <br/><br/>That's a rough outline of the storyline. There's more, I can assure you, but I'm only filling in the necessary plot details. <br/><br/>Right off the bat, the stop-motion animation is smooth and effectively used. The characters, despite it being stop-motion, move smoothly. Acrobats and quick movement are actually quite entertaining to watch and you don't have to wait long to see some good use of stop-motion.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is used very well, making some awesome scenes. You could have one thing happening on one end, and another thing on the other end, all in one scene. And it's not just subtle. You can clearly see two things are happening at once. When they're digging away from the farmers, it gives you a side view to show you what's happening above and below. This is used really, really well!<br/><br/>The humour in this movie can get a few chuckles out of you, even if you're the type who only laugh at adult comedies and not family comedies (note: I said family and not children's). <br/><br/>The characters we can certainly relate to. We all know an Ash. We all know a Mr. Fox. We know that one kid who picks on anyone for being different. This makes the emotional aspect of this movie carry that extra punch.<br/><br/>Speaking of the emotional side of things; despite it being more comedic, the film does have a lot of touching moments. These moments make this movie even more forgettable than it already is. <br/><br/>Am I glad I watched this in the end? You're cussing right I am! Great movie for not just children, but for any movie-lover really."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","2","4","12 June 2011"," Endearing and hugely enjoyable
","For those who are looking for a 100% faithful adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, I think they will be disappointed. Lacking the dark edge of Dahl's book and of his writing in general, Fantastic Mr Fox is not so good as an adaptation, however on its own terms it is wonderful. It is an endearing and hugely enjoyable film.<br/><br/>One thing that stood out was how the film looked. Instead of the CGI rendered effects, Wes Anderson opts for a more old-fashioned stop-motion effect. This decision worked, because the visual look is outstanding, not just in the beautifully detailed backgrounds and sets but in how the characters move as well and the small details such as the armchair in his writing hut.<br/><br/>I like Alexandre Desplat's music quite a bit. His score for Fantastic Mr Fox is no exception, it is quirky yet still has the minimalist style that makes Desplat stand out. The story is sometimes slow in the pace but because of the humour and how it looked, I never found the film boring, besides the story itself is so good. The writing is great, the humour is more adult but a vast majority of it is very funny with the odd touching moment too.<br/><br/>The characters add a lot. Mr Fox is one of my favourite titular characters in a book and the film did little to change that, and while some are slightly underused they serve their purpose well. The voice work is fantastic. I wasn't sure about George Clooney, but he does do a bravura job, and Meryl Streep is quite touching. Michael Gambon is sterling, as is Bill Murray as Badger.<br/><br/>In conclusion, hugely enjoyable and one of my personal favourites of 2009. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

This show is entertainment for the whole family. My favourite part was the pacing of the show, it didn't dilly-dally over artistic shots and complicated poetic dialogue (not that those can't be good in their own time and place) but instead went straight to the heart of every issue and jumped flipped, whirled and spun it's way to the end. It's refreshingly simple story felt fresh. George Clooney's portrayal of Mr Fox lent the role so much charisma and wit it was hard not to believe everything that came out of his mouth. At the end of the day, a lot of shows these days are heavy, weighed down with emotion ,or full of cheap humour. This movie was entertainment, pure and simple. I laughed and smiled my way through the time it took to watch this movie. Besides it's entertainment value this movie also revealed a heartwarming tale of ""wild animals"" who just want to be true to their nature, whether it's stealing poultry and cider or bing an ""athlete""."

The tone of the film is excellent mixing humor, and it is quite a funny film, with heartfelt sentiment of a much loved children's book.<br/><br/>There were influences of the directors other films, most notably The Royal Tenembuams with the dysfunctional family and Mr Fox's struggle to find common ground with his son Ash (Jason Swartzman). Watch out for former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker's cameo halfway through with a brilliant musical highlight, I also thought the use of blueberries to take out guard dogs was particularly in genius.<br/><br/>An animation of a children's book this may be but I cannot see a child taking any thing from this as it is largely an adult affair.

Many things happen, keeping your attention. It gives the impression of being a long movie, but not because it's bad. I felt like my spent time was worth it. The different things that happen are well linked, and they go according to the characters' personality. As a fable, it works great - most fables do; and the characters are amusing.<br/><br/>This movie also gets extra points from me due to its originality. It represents people, in a way that it contains different, sometimes conflicting elements found in most people.<br/><br/>There are a few unnecessary scene, but they don't make this movie less fun. And a few technical elements are poor also, but one must admit that some things must be really hard to do in stop-motion. In fact, the creators did have a good amount of creativity in some scenes. Finally, I can't leave behind any comments on the graphical quality of the movie. It has some really beautiful images, and most of the others are at least very nice."

","There really is something a bit fantastic about Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation debut ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" The quirky spirit of the Roald Dahl book could only be captured by a filmmaker with a deep and unforgiving wit. Anderson's dry and subtle sense of humor might not translate into big dollars (at least by comparison to giants such as DreamWorks and Pixar), but his affinity for diverse and amusing characters fits the world of animation better than anyone might expect.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a cocky yet certainly charming woodland creature who relocates his family to an area where three nasty and powerful farmers named Boggis, Bunce and Bean live nearby. A former chicken thief, Mr. Fox sees a chance to recapture some of his former glory, even if it means going behind the back of his loyal wife (Meryl Streep). When the farmers catch onto him, they go after his home and family.<br/><br/>Snagging your attention from the get-go is the unique quality of the stop-motion figures. Anderson explores the medium's full potential, blending elements of the modern day detail- oriented school of thought with cartoon elements and also playing with the 2-D diorama aspect which is unlike anything done before. Stop-motion masters such as Nick Park are all focuses on making the world seem as real as possible whereas Anderson isn't afraid to make his characters look and feel like moving figurines. He embraces that quality in a way most filmmakers would likely be afraid to do.<br/><br/>The details on the close-ups of Mr. Fox and friends are stunning. I can't recall any stop- motion characters that looked so good inches away from the camera. The fur and the way the eyes roll around in the sockets are two unparalleled qualities.<br/><br/>Anderson's dry humor lends itself excellently to the family film, which fans of his work probably did not expect, but probably should have. His films have always been focused on family. Tone down the family members to PG levels and the extent to which they are dysfunction and you have an excellent director for such a film. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" would not top any kid's list of family/kid movies, but there's no issues of child-appropriateness. Some physical humor accompanied with the dead-pan wit of of Anderson and his usual suspects (Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, etc) achieve the child vs. parent-geared balance most animated films strive for.<br/><br/>Then again, adults will appreciate ""Mr. Fox"" a whole lot more. Animation has proved itself a viable means of adult entertainment in 2009 with ""Mr. Fox"" capping it all off. The film will make you laugh in ways you never thought an animated film with talking animals ever could because of how ingeniously understated all the gags are.<br/><br/>But ""Mr. Fox"" is equal parts art, taking stop-motion to new places. The opening sequences of Mr. and Mrs. running through a farm and stealing chickens serves as an ideal taste of what's to come. The camera pulls back and you see the set as if you were one of the filmmakers looking at these miniature models and the two are running around and jumping to some classic-as-always soundtrack choices from Anderson. It is a unique and spirited adventure that despite a somewhat disinteresting plot breaks ground in enough special ways to warrant some serious acclaim.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"neb-strebor","7","2","4","15 May 2010"," What's wrong with the original story?
","I enjoyed this film, having read the book several times with my children I was obviously looking forward to seeing it on the big screen. I liked Clooney's voice and the style of animation but I can never work out why the film makers feel the need to change anything in a straight forward classic tale (no pun intended). For example making his home a tree house made the whole point of the farmers stakeout, waiting for him to leave his hole pointless! Why didn't the story stick to the tunnel digging and final feast for the animals? I can understand cutting things out when there is just too much to include in a film but changing bits and ignoring a perfect end to the story was a big let down. Maybe you just have to accept that books are always better than the film adaptation but this is a relatively short and concise story, probably one of the best children's stories and I just can't see why anyone would see the need to rewrite it?"

"talkymeat","10","2","4","6 May 2010"," Absolutely Amazing. Best movie in a long time, Animated or Otherwise.
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is about a fox who must give up the bird stealing business to get a regular daytime job. After he's settled down with another fox and started a family he becomes bored with his life and decides to go back to stealing birds for one last big job.<br/><br/>I don't know if I have any real complaints about Fantastic Mr. Fox.<br/><br/>The visuals are some of the best I have ever seen. Every single scene of Fantastic Mr. Fox is an absolute feast for the eyes. All the little sets are amazingly well designed and there are so many little things to notice. I watched Fantastic Mr. Fox at least 5 times and every time I'll notice one or two more things that I didn't notice before. The camera work is just a wonder to behold as well. Wes Anderson manages to get right down in the middle of these sets were most stop motion movies don't get. Also, many zooms and face shots are used for the characters which most stop motion movies steer clear of.<br/><br/>The script is amazing as well. So many clever lines and jokes are interspersed throughout the dialog. Also, there are many clever analogies and points made about society and human/animal nature. Having animals behave like humans can't help but make the viewer think about how like animals humans really are when you come right down to it.<br/><br/>Every character in Fantastic Mr. Fox is interesting and amazingly well voice acted. All the actors manage to breath so much life into these characters that they become real in your mind. George Clooney and Jason Schwartzman are particularly brilliant as is their father-son dynamic in the film.<br/><br/>I truly have nothing bad to say about this movie and I believe that everyone should see it. I also believe that it far surpasses many of the overrated animated movies of the last few years (Ratatouille, Up, etc.)Sorry Hurt Locker, this is the Best Movie of 2009."
"Samiam3","6","2","4","26 April 2010"," Weird Mr. Fox
","I'll give credit where credit is due, the animation is eccentric, wacky and nifty, not to mention all the weird camera angles applied. The screenplay is...not so eccentric. Some scenes aside, this is a very dry story, not terribly colourful in performance, and lacking in old fashioned humour. I'm interested to see what kinds of films Wes Andersson grew up on that could inspire such oddities like Fanastic Mr. Fox<br/><br/>I don't even wanna begin to describe the story. Now the last time I read Fantastic Mr. Fox was when I was Ten years ago, but I do remember it being fairly coherent, much less convoluted than this story. Well convoluted isn't the word, lets just say, The rhythm is unusual as is the dialogue for that matter. Further more, there seems to be quite a lack of it, These critters don't really have a whole lot of productive things to say to each other, sometimes it feels like dialogue for the sake of dialogue.<br/><br/>The Music ques are kind of catchy, that's what I remember best about Fantastic Mr. Fox. The banjo in particular is not a commonly used instrument, but it's the star of the orchestra in this movie Fantastic Mr. Fox has it's ups and downs, I wouldn't recommend it as a family feature, but movie goers may get a kick out of its eccentric charm."

"maxscheele","9","0","0","16 April 2020"," Wes Anderson goes to extreme measures to add unsurpassed detail!
","A childhood favorite is turned into a movie masterpiece by an loving fan, Wes Anderson. Fantastic Mr. Fox is elegantly directed, animated, and performed. After many years of imagining what the film could be Wes Anderson partnered up with Revolution Studios to make a stop start animation. An ambitious fox and his family's journey that led them from a hole to the wrong side of three farmers guns is turned to a captivating story by Wes and his team. Wes Anderson goes to extreme measures to add unsurpassed detail to make Fantastic Mr. Fox a special experience for all viewers.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr Fox is a uniquely animated film, nothing like any other movie you have ever seen. It is made similar to countless classics using stop start animation, a technique only used by directors and animators with tremendous care and preparation. The animal figurines designed and meticulously shaped by various specialist ranging from people who designed the clothes to people that engineered the many pliable metal plates that go into the face and joints of each figurine. All of the figurines were designed and constructed the same except for the bunny and mouse, who were made custom due to the bunnies' large ears and the mices' small stature. Mr. Fox has his tail shot off by a farmer out to get revenge. His son makes a noble attempt to steal back the tail, being used a a tie by the farmer. While in the farmers there is a moment where the Ash, the son, pauses giving the viewer and opportunity to study the set. The wood grain and small trinkets scattered about are a great example. The detail shown in the house shows that Henry Selick, the animation director, did not just want the job done. He wanted the job done right.<br/><br/>Even though the film is animated; nothing feels flat: texture and depth is added at all possible stops. The set designers do a wonderful job of adding tremendous character to all of the senses. By using tints, hues, and tones to shade and highlight the background, the animator helps provide a sense of realness to the film. For example, the animators add emotion throughout the sewer scene toward the end where all of the animals are crammed into a tight space. They do so by layering various blues, blacks, and greys symbolizing sadness and a loss of hope. The white flickering light in the halls adds a sense of false security. For a few seconds every thing is lit up, the second the light goes out the unone is suddenly a major threat. After suffering in the sewer Mr. Fox finds a grocery with a sewer opening in an isle. His family enters the store and the scene is immediately filled with bright colors: reds, yellows, white light, ect. These colors symbolize a new found sense of hope and happiness. Going from dark to light symbolizes beginning a new chapter in life. Revolution Studios did a great job making an intriguing set that any viewer can appreciate.<br/><br/>Unlike many other directors who use personification, Wes Anderson makes an effort to add a wild spirit to a humanized natural predator. He is portrayed as a father, a husband, and a writer: not a wild animal. After being served breakfast he mutilates his food without ever glancing towards the silverware. Foxy being savage rather than sophisticated is ironic because it shows his true nature, wild and free. Nothing like the friendly and human like facade he puts on. In the next scene Mr Fox is house shopping. He is tired of living a boring life, having to crawls out of a hole every morning. Hoping to expand,Mr. fox contemplates moving in to a real, above ground house. He is led to a captivating tree by his realtor. Some of the selling points sound oddly familiar but with a twist: original dirt floors, great neighborhood, and conveniently located near a chicken farm. This wich to move illustrates Wes Anderson's urge to create a relatable scenario while the ""original dirt floors"" reminds us that Mr. Fox is an animal, a fox, sort of just a prop.<br/><br/>Wes Anderson's attention to detail makes is clear that he cared tremendously about the viewing experience and the quality of the final product. Every aspect of the preparation and recording process was done for the same reason, to make a powerful film. With Wes Anderson and his team there is no stone left unturned."
"MGPT80","6","0","0","13 April 2020"," A visual treat but style definitely trumps substance
","This is one of those films I really wanted to love. I grew up on Roald Dahl and really liked the book, probably one of his most charming stories. However, while I really liked some aspects of the movie, it fell a bit short of being memorable.<br/><br/>I will say that the graphics are an absolute treat throughout this film. The stop motion animation is amazing and the sepia tones really work for me. I find that the majority of 21st century animated films are visually overwhelming with far too much happening on the screen. I often feel that the producers are more concerned with showing what they are capable of doing rather than what they should be doing. Fantastic Mr Fox is one of the few exceptions. It is quaint and charming and matches the feel of the book very nicely.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I felt the telling of the story just got a bit messy. It was not close enough to the original and felt unnecessarily complex at times, especially given the target audience. My other big gripe was with the American accents. I understand the draw of big Hollywood stars, but this story really demands well-spoken English actors. Sir Ian McKellen as Mr Fox with Ricky Gervais as the Rat could have been epic! Having said that, George Clooney did a pretty good job and grew on me as the movie went on.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I felt this was a beautiful production but one that lacked any real substance. I would still recommend it to anyone based on the remarkable animation but it's not something I'd rush to see again."

What I think is also remarkable about this movie is how it combines the humanization of the animals characters with their wild nature. These two natures are always in balance in this movie, so the spectator doesn't forget that while acting just like humans, they don't stop being wild creatures. This film reminds you that even if we live in a civilization with many rules, we have dreams and deep desires that we must satisfy.

","This film is very, very unique. It's a variation of a classic story, but so weird and well-written that you don't care. I should mention that I haven't read the book that inspired this movie, so I can't judge it's accuracy to the source material.<br/><br/>The plot follows a fox who regularly steals from local farmers, despite having promised his wife that he would leave stealing behind once he learned she was pregnant. He and a friend take on the biggest farmers in the area, and find themselves in over their heads when the farmers retaliate and threaten his entire community.<br/><br/>Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach craft an excellent script full of sharp dialogue that is funny to children and adults alike. The story manages to remain interesting throughout, and doesn't dumb itself down for its target audience. Anderson also directs here, and he has a visual style that is very interesting to watch. He doesn't let the animation overpower the story or his style, but in fact he allows it to work within his plot, never letting the animation carry the film. He is putting out a very different product from most animated children's films around currently, particularly Disney.<br/><br/>The animation is stellar, and it's all the more astounding that it's stop-motion. I appreciate it in that it feels more intimate and personal than computer animation, and I feel the effort behind the product, which allowed me to invest in it more. It felt more human, despite being about animals. You can see the painstaking work and precision behind each character movement, psychedelic scene, or atmospheric shot.<br/><br/>
Note: Minor spoilers may be ahead, but they're related to the film's purpose and not the actual plot.<br/><br/>My only critique of the film is its message. I think it's message was horrible. Basically, the message is that it's completely ok and acceptable to be true to your nature. The film even teases character growth for most of the runtime. Only around the third act does its true message kind of start to show, and it's finally presented at the very end in a horribly unsubtle way. I guess since it's a children's film, it doesn't want to be as open to interpretation because it thinks what it has to say is a righteous and important message that kids need to hear, but I disagree. I found the ultimate ""be true to your nature"" message to fly in the face of fundamentals of humanity. Humans are terrible, and our saving grace is that we continue to grow and evolve. Change is important to growth as a human. If you stay the same then you never learn anything. The main character acted like a child, lied to and jeopardized his family, was selfish the entire time, and faced no consequences. His behavior was validated in the end. There's even a point where his wife tells him that she loves him, but that she shouldn't have marrie him. That's a heavy moment for a children's film, and I think it's quite ambitious. But instead of following this, the film ignores it and their relationship regresses back to normal in the end. It felt so cheap and self-fulfilling, and frankly irresponsible.<br/><br/>I may be being too scathing, but aside from the message, I really, really enjoyed it. It's fun, it's weird, it's creative, and it's different."

","The film Fantastic Mr. Fox by Wes Anderson is a marvelous piece of stop animation cinema. From its Whitty lines to its elaborate plot, the movie is a great watch for kids as well as adults. The story line involves many intricate layers, including a major heist, a short-lived rivalry with a rat, and an interesting ending with a surprise hero. Although some viewers have shown their displeasure towards the differences in Anderson's version compared to Roald Dahl's book, there is still plenty of reason to enjoy the film. Many movies steer away from being exactly like their book counterparts, especially those created by different people. This simply adds to the story and allows opposite viewers to enjoy. For example, a reoccurrence in the movie is the line, ""what the cuss?"" or ""cuss this"", Etc. Dialogue like this allows the younger viewer to enjoy an animated movie while the older audience can still receive satisfaction even if the viewing of the movie wasn't really their choice. The stop animation in this movie makes it a creative masterpiece alone, even if the puppets are a little creepy to some. Despite the puppets and differences between the movie and book, Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox is a wonderful movie for the whole family with more to the story than your average fairytale."

","The film Fantastic Mr. Fox was an amazing film. It is full of action, adventure, and family values. Throughout the film, there is one running theme that sticks out to the viewer. That one theme is that sometimes you have to break the rules for those you love. After Mr. Fox steals from the farmers, the farmers begin to hunt down every animal that lives in the forest. This forces every creature that can to go underground and hide because of what Mr. Fox had done. When Mr. Fox is confronted, and everyone blames him for being starved he comes up with a plan to help save his friends by once again outsmarting the farmers. Mr. Fox once again steals from the farmers, but this time out of necessity in order to save everyone from starving to death. This teaches us that sometimes the wrong thing is actually the right thing to do. He could not just sit back and watch everyone starve, so he found a way to feed them. Sometimes, a person might have to break the law or do something they are not supposed to in order to save the people they love.
One negative comment that could be made about this movie is that it is advertised as a kid's movie when, it is more centered towards adults and older teenagers. There are several scenes throughout the movie that use very adult content that children would not understand. It could be considered adult content not because it is inappropriate or vulgar, but because it is very mature feelings and discussions. There is one particular scene from the movie after the animals are chased underground that exemplifies this very well. Mrs. Fox asks to have a word alone with Mr. Fox, and she losses her temper with him. She slaps him across the face and begins to open up about just how upset she is with him. This argument is a very good representation of why this film is actually meant for adults. She talks about how he lied to her and how by doing so he had put his entire family at risk. Another example of this would be when the rat dies towards the end of the movie. They say that he has redeemed himself, but that he is basically just another dead rat. This part of the movie is very much aimed towards older audiences, and it truly shows that Wes Anderson did not intend to capture the attention of a younger audience. Overall, this movie is dark at sometimes, but at the same time it is also wholesome. It teaches the audience not to judge a movie before they actually view it, because the content and depth may actually surprise you. It also teaches us that sometimes we have to go against our better nature or societies laws for those that we love."
"cassidymccutchen","9","0","0","7 December 2019"," Everyone is a little ""Different""
","Wes Anderson's 2009 film, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a stop motion animated film that reminds us that there is nothing wrong with being different.<br/><br/>The stop animation is nothing short of fantastic in this film because it is very fluid. Wes Anderson demonstrates how precise the stop motion picture is when Mr. Bean begins flailing his arms and knocking things from shelves, ultimately destroying his office space. However, the expressions that the Foxes are molded in to can make one feel a little unsettled, to say the least. When Mr. Fox finds out they are going to have a son he gives his wife an unconvincing grin by baring all of his sharp teeth. The stop-animation can be unsettling, but I believe that in this situation Wes Anderson is trying to emphasize that Mr. Fox is processing that he is going to have a son, so his character looks strained.<br/><br/>Wes Anderson uses his characters and witty dialog to remind adults and children alike that it's okay to be different, no matter the context behind it. Throughout the film, characters such as the Fox's son Ashe, Mrs. Fox, and Kylie are referred to or refer to themselves as being ""different."" The animals in the film do a funny hand gesture when the word ""different"" is said or implied to emphasize that many things make one ""different."" I believe that Wes Anderson intended to remind the audience that what we feel makes us different is nothing to be ashamed about because ""different"" is never defined in this film. Being different could be approached positively as embracing your own ""self,"" which happens to be the case if you pay attention to Kylie's character.<br/><br/>Kylie is an opossum who has primal instincts that symbolize anxiety and being different in Fantastic Mr. Fox. This opossum is introduced to us when Mr. Fox is looking at a new home and see's the handyman, Kylie. We get the idea that Kylie is ""different"" because his eyes spin when he feels the need to defend himself, or is put in situations where he could become anxious. Kylie is considered ""different,"" because he plays dead due to his species. Opossums play dead to protect themselves because they are a prey animal. Kylie could be considered zoning out or differentiating in a human versus animal context which relates to mental health and representation of anxiety in Fantastic Mr. Fox.<br/><br/>While the target audience was intended for children, I find that Fantastic Mr. Fox can appeal to young adults as well because many of us struggle to accept what is ""different"" about us individually."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of stop motion animation, but that medium is not universally enjoyed. This is one of the best stop motion movies I have ever seen, and it is clear that a tremendous amount of effort was put into it.<br/><br/>Stop motion is a difficult medium of filmmaking, with each frame needing to be individually posed which can cause movement to appear unnatural. However this film manages to avoid this at most points. The places where flaws are most noticeable are also scenes in which it is intentional. It's clear a great deal of care was put into this movie with each model being beautifully detailed and even somewhat informative of the characters personality.<br/><br/>The camerawork is surprisingly good for a stop motion movie and feels as fluid as a traditional movie. The great camerawork coupled with the lovely scenery work together to create a movie that is visually stunning for a stop motion film.<br/><br/>Despite the great detail to the visuals, the best aspect of this movie is possibly the writing. The plot is fairly straightforward, with the main characters having at least some form of development. In this case the simplicity works well, as it provides a means for the character motivation and development.<br/><br/>The movie is accessible to all ages, and works well as a family movie, but unlike many movies of that type is not simply a children's movie. The movie handles many concepts (which other family movies may shy away from) in a charming way. For example: the word ""cuss"" is used in place of any potential harsh language. As someone who doesn't like the sanitization of children's media, I actually felt this was a great substitution. Rather than remove the effectiveness of swearing in language, the substitution makes it acceptable for younger children but not boring for older audiences. I was actually quite impressed by the balance achieved between media for younger audiences and older audiences.<br/><br/>One of the strongest aspects of this movie, is its accessibility. Most people could find something to enjoy in this movie, but in the most genuine way possible. Many movies which try this end up lacking direction or become annoyingly predictable, yet Fantastic Mr Fox does not fall into this trap. This is achieved through the family dynamic, which is both believably complex yet easy to understand.<br/><br/>Ultimately this movie offers an enjoyable family experience, and its family status does not cheapen the experience for watching it outside of the family setting.<br/><br/>Final score: 96/100"

Each frame is a treasure in terms of artistry, revelations of human (and wild animal) nature, intriguing themes and characters, wry humor, compelling stories and more. There is more going on than appears on the surface. The conflicts are as interesting and revealing as the resolutions. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson give voice and life to Roald Dahl's characters. ""It is always more fun,"" says a wiser fox ""when we did it together."""

","It isn't the same to watch the movie as a kid than as an adult; It's even more funnier when you grow up and you understand everything.

I don't know how is to watch this movie as a kid, but my 10 years old sister enjoyed it.)<br/><br/>The animation isn't the common Pixar thing that you see everyday, but I LOVE IT. It's the perfect stop motion, every character has its own personality and they look cussing beautiful. It's a dead but freaking cool style, harder and more expensive to do than a 3D itself movie, and some people hate it because it's just... (Waving hands crazily) Different.<br/><br/>The moral of this story can make you to change by different ways.
For example,
If in the real life you're the mad and unperfect cousin of someone, after this movie, you'll regret about yourself and start to improve.
There are a lot of things more, such as accepting what do you have, marriage relationships, addictions, life dreams, and a lot of stuff more; You'll just absorb the moral that better defines you.<br/><br/>WATCH IT, if you haven't yet. What are you waiting?"

","As part of my flight to Boston in preparation for our camp, American Airlines had this movie as an option for in-flight entertainment. Given its placement on my watchlist, I figured I would be opportunistic. What do I think?<br/><br/>To start with, this film is written in a way that puts it at the middle ground between children's and adult's animation. It adapts Dahl's children's novel into something a tad more heavy-hearted. I won't talk about the story too much since it succeeded in adapting the novel, but its additions (such as the capture of Kristofferson) are written in a way that actually work out in its favor. Our characters benefit from this too, with the combination of familiarity from the novel and somewhat modern twists to their personality (such as Kristofferson's flair for meditation). It actually seems that both our protagonists and antagonists can be sympathized with; out of mere nature, the former want their food and the latter want to keep them away. While the Foxes can be summed up as the usual family of 3, I enjoyed Rat's threatening demeanor, Petey's music, and Kylie's comic stare. What really strengthens the characters, however, is the believable and spot-on voice acting. It fits both the cartoonish influence of Dahl's novel for some characters and the different aim of this movie for others. The stop motion environments feel like they are very comparable to Aardman's work, with the detail on the fields and locations, the unique character models. Like Kubo and the Two Strings, the animation possesses surprising fluidity in the movements of both characters and objects, which is wonderful for its assortment of action/peril scenes.<br/><br/>This isn't really a ""children's"" movie as much as it is a family movie. Children will enjoy the cute animals and the similarities to Dahl's work, while adults will enjoy the action, humor, and less light-hearted tone. It's worth 87 minutes of anyone's time, really, and I'll be cussed if anyone didn't end up having a good thing to say about it. OK, maybe once was enough..."

"Animated_Antic","9","0","0","20 March 2018"," A very smart and very funny movie.
","Out of the many books by children's authors that are adapted to film, the books by Roald Dahl mostly tend to be excellent. Save for Tim Burton's disastrous retelling of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", I have really enjoyed the movies made based on Dahl's books. Now we have another movie that I can happily say is yet another great adaptation. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the debut animated movie from famed director Wes Anderson and he was able to craft a movie that can successfully do some elements differently from the book while also adding touches to make the movie memorable. I'll explain why this really works out well.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) have given up the life of raiding farms after their only son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox is now a newspaper columnist and has now moved the family from a burrow to a tree nearby three farms run by three dangerous farmers named Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). Wanting to conduct one last raid, Mr. Fox, his assistant possum Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky) and his nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) steals items from all three farms much to the farmers and Felicity's anger. Wanting to kill the fox, the farmers come along and try to dig the foxes out of their tree only to discover that the foxes keep digging away from the danger. After having led to the destructions of their home and the homes of other critters, Mr. Fox decides to declare war on the farmers in order to fight for their survival.<br/><br/>The thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was the script. The script in this movie written by Anderson and director Noah Baumbach was smartly written as well as very funny. Though the movie can be viewed by kids, I think adults well enjoy the movie more mainly due to how adult the film is. The characters talk like people in other movies minus the swear words which Anderson and Schwartzman simply replace with the word ""cuss"". As an example, the character would say something like ""The cuss you would,"" or ""That was the craziest cussing thing I've ever done."" You might think it would get old fast, but it actually doesn't. I also like how the story can be both faithful and different to the book at the same time. Elements to the story are added, particularly the relationship between Mr. Fox and Felicity and I personally think it's needed to advance the story along and give the characters some depth. As for the animation, it's brilliantly crafted. It's done entirely in stop motion animation without any digital help which I found very impressive. It also included some of Anderson's style into the film as well like the camera angles being mostly centered. I also really enjoyed the characters in the movie. Where in the book they are likable though don't have a lot of personality, here they are given tons of personality and charisma to boast. Even a subplot involving a feud between Ash and Kristofferson which I thought would be the weakest part of the movie was actually really well realized and written. As far as flaws goes, the character designs of the humans did bother me at times due to how odd they were, though they were not too bad to be distracting.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a very smart movie with a well written story, some impressive animation and characters with lots of personality and charm to boast. Considering that this is the first animated film from Wes Anderson, I'm really impressed by how much detailed elements went into this film. I'm very eager to see if he continues to make stop-motion movies because I feel he can reach the heights of the people at Aardman and Henry Selick. We'll just have to wait and see."

","Mr. Foxy Fox is voiced by George Clooney, but this isn't just some publicity stunt, Clooney has always been somewhat a foxy guy, handsome, clever in a funny way with a touch of darkness, when he says ""I'm just a wild animal"", it sounds like something Clooney would say about himself. The actor is no Day-Lewis but he has always been good in that particular range of smooth-talking small-time crooks, whose looks and natural swiftness make him get away with everything except with the one who won't take it. Because, you know guys like Clooney or foxes have their weakest point, which generally coincides with the heart.<br/><br/>Felicity Fox comes only one minute later in the picture. Before, we just saw Foxy warming up a little, he's at the top of his game as number one thief, and in what other job would a fox excel if not stealing? In this movie, animals' personalities are defined by their archetypes but Anderson, faithful to Dahl's spirit, always find a little twist, a way to play with it rather than being chained to it. And the whole tonality of the film indicates that this is a rather adult-oriented movie. Indeed Mrs. Fox comes from the doctor, a few minutes later, during a fox-trap situation; she'll reveal what we didn't dare to suspect. It seems like Fox is caught in a worse trap with no getaway except the promise to go straight.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep has always possessed that homely, motherly authority and creates the perfect contrast with Clooney. Together, they form a more believable couple than any live-action movie. As a matter of fact, it's a miracle how Anderson finds the perfect tone between a ludicrous premise (style-wise) and the authenticity of his characters. His movie is set in a world where humans and animals coexist and seem to live within the same standards, except for one thing: humans have all the rights, they can raise, domesticate, kill and eat animals, this is the only Disney territory where Anderson ventures. But the paradox of anthropomorphic animals confronted to normal humans is one of the film's most creative bits. It's interesting though that the two worlds rarely share the screen.<br/><br/>The film is based on the childhood rhyme about three mean men, Boggus, Bunce and Bean, one fat, one short and one lean, they're three farmers who mind their own business (poultry, duck raising and cider) before they're victim of Fox' robberies. With the help of their new house's attendant Kylie Oppossum (Wallace Wollodarsky), Fox steals from the three farmers and make mortal enemies out of them. The three men will know no rest until they get Fox, digging him out to the point that all the furry animals are forced to live underground and risk starvation. But foxes have more than one trick under their sleeves and thankfully, the plot doesn't just rely on a simple humans vs. animals antagonisms, there are a few demons to overcome within the animalistic characters and Anderson treat them sometimes with the same three-dimensionality than the people from his live-action movies.<br/><br/>In fact, anyone familiar with Anderson's style shouldn't be surprised by the kinship with his films.Anderson is a director who cherishes static shots and linear movements, in perhaps the style that is the closest to comic-books than any other directors or maybe animation à la Hanna-Barbera. In the film, characters run like in the old Atari video games, and the digging looks exactly the same except in the vertical sense. We suspect that the 'artistic license' was also forced by a few budget restrictions and the fact that Anderson isn't an animator from the start, but he finds a way to transcend possible flaws and turn them into old-fashioned visual delights, as the lack of green and blue provided a nice autumnal sepia texture. The eloquence of the scripts makes up for the static moments, many times people talk without necessary looking at each other, which also simplifies the use of stop motions.<br/><br/>Overall, the stop-motion gives a real edge to the film and is perfect for a movie centering on furry and funny characters, each fox has a unique design and fur complexion accentuating the realism (while the human characters are more ordinary looking with the help of CGI). The real thrill of the film comes from the various personalities, and they're surprisingly believable. A masterstroke of characterization is Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the teenage son (two years in fox years) who could have been a little brat or an awkward teenager, like any of the ""Incredibles"" children, but he's a kid who lives in the shadow of his father, who's bullied because of his short height, who's everything his father is not, and who must suffer from the inevitable comparisons with his cousin Kristofferson, who's everything he's not. I never thought a movie would feature an archetype that has seldom been in movies: the perfect guy.<br/><br/>After two Hayao Miyazaki's movies, which multiply the number of viewings by two to fully get the films' brilliance, my mind needed a rest. I pulled a Monty Python and said to myself: and now for something different. Yes, I needed to see something new, imaginative enough to challenge my perceptions but in a more soothing way. I didn't know what to expect exactly from ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"", but that ignorance was perfect, the film was exactly the medication I needed, I longed for something different and maybe the best compliment I can give to this Foxy adventure is that it's like no animated film I've seen before and like no animated film you'll ever see, from beginning to end. And one thing for sure, this Mr. Fox is indeed, fantastic.<br/><br/>And as if ever needed, here's another offering that proves that Wes Anderson is as much an auteur as Miyazaki in the sense that he really invented a style, a form of storytelling that channels his own creativity, in total symbiosis."

","I am finishing up reviewing every Wes Anderson film and this is one of the easiest 10/10 ratings I ever had to give.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox is a perfect example of Wes Anderson's fun loving, darkly comedic style. This film is a beauty to look at, each character and setting is beautifully lit and presented in a perfect frame. It really goes along with the source material that Roald Dahl created years ago.<br/><br/>The comedy which is something that Wes Anderson excels at it at top notch, I laugh at every single joke, whether it be supported by the quick whip pans or smash zooms or just great delivery of dialogue, I am on the floor laughing. The acting is also a great element in this film, George Clooney and Meryl Streep shine as the Fox mother and father, you feel they are real, even though it is an animation.<br/><br/>Speaking of Animation, this films stop motion is revolutionary. It is perfect, it also is the perfect kind of medium for Wes Anderson's tightly constructed atheistic. The movements are funny and alive, and the way they create these worlds feel large but, also comfy and homey.<br/><br/>All these things are great but, what stands out is Wes Anderson's ability to bring heart and a message into the film. It talks about growing up, making your family proud, and trying to find your own way. The film will touch everyone from age 1 to 100.<br/><br/>An amazing masterpiece 10/10 and 5/5."
"jamesrupert2014","8","0","0","26 June 2017"," Fun, frenetic film
","'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' takes Wes Anderson's quirky directing style and applies it to animation. All the classic Anderson elements are there (relentless symmetry, wide shots with tiny elements of motion, laconic dialogue punctuated with pauses, etc), but in this case, all is acted out by stop-action, animal models. The result is a great animated 'action' film – a little dark at times (as befits a Roald Dahl story), but otherwise enjoyable by all ages. Marquee voice talent adds a lot to the wandering story of a fox (and father) dealing with his family and friends, and the disastrous consequences of his compulsion to steal from the local cabal of farmers. Much of the fun is in the details, so watch closely. The music (especially the children's chant motif) and the visualisation of the most 'psychotic' of the three nasty farmers adds a lot to the pleasingly grim-lite mood of the film."
"loganholley","10","0","0","13 April 2017"," A brilliant adaption and a film that is, dare I say it, fantastic
","Wes Anderson is an interesting figure. Maybe you've heard of him, maybe you haven't, but one things for certain: his works are amazingly unique. Sure, films like The Life Aquatic lack the coherence of other works such as Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox (hey!), and The Grand Budapest Hotel, but even at his worst, it's easy to find at least one thing to adore about his films. Now enter Roald Dahl. A prominent writer of books for Children (although, they do certainly still hold appeal to those older) who sadly passed around 2 decades ago, his style is a perfect blend of quirky. The way he tells his stories is so ingenious, and the same could be said about the characters that inhabit those little worlds. A Roald Dahl adaption by Wes Anderson is not something I realized was a match made in heaven until I saw Fantastic Mr.Fox, which, like the first word of it's title, is a kids film that should not be ignored.<br/><br/>Wes Anderson is a mastermind when it comes to cinematography, and surprisingly, the same could be said about his hand in Stop-Motion Animation. The environments here are amazingly done, and the tone they convey is so perfect. It may be a quirky, up-lifting piece targeted at the little ones, but each location oozes atmosphere in a charming way. The presentation is nothing short of amazing, and, as typical with Wes Anderson pieces, melds so well with what happens on screen that it doesn't become a part of the movie you don't really notice, it essentially becomes a key point to notice when viewing. The animation on display is also outstanding. Puppet movement is never chunky enough for you to laugh at it for the wrong reasons, but the puppets themselves are silly enough for you to laugh at it for reasons that display just how much fun everybody invested had.<br/><br/>Enough about the style, what about the substance? First off, the performances. There are few performances that would crumble a movie should they not be in the final product, and there are few examples that stand out to me more than George Clooney as Mr.Fox. His voice work matches up with the animation so well that I struggled at moments to envision him hunched over a microphone recording the lines given to him. Every line is said with attitude that fits deeply with the character, the enthusiasm and emotion is present to a point where it is no longer just a man pretending to be a fox puppet in some studio, but rather, a man who IS a fox puppet (as weird as that may sound). As for the rest of the performances, also amazing. I never heard a voice that I thought didn't match up with what I was seeing, and everybody in the cast seemed to enjoy what they were doing just so much. I never quite heard a voice that sounded weak, droopy, and bored.<br/><br/>And then there's the writing. In my opinion, this is one of the best Wes Anderson films, even if it wasn't technically filmed in the traditional sense. The script, which he wrote with Noah Baumbach, is filled to the brim with charm, humor, and fun. The lines never came out as cheesy to me, and anything that might come remotely close is great, regardless. The real question that remains in a potential viewers head for an adaption, however, is simple: 'how faithful is this to it's source material?'. The book itself, which I haven't read myself in many years, is amazing, and though this film does add bits and pieces to that already established narrative, none of those bits and pieces never seemed to find a way to mess with what should be amazing. Dahl's quirky charm is almost on point with Anderson's, which works wonders as anything not originally there certainly feels like it could have been.<br/><br/>Maybe a 10 is too generous, (I don't always see a fault where there are some, after all) but I really do think that Fantastic Mr.Fox is an excellent gateway to the works of Wes Anderson, one that excels greatly as a film itself. It's animation is, in layman's terms, brilliant, and it's perfect presentation fits that quite well. It oozes charm, and it's performances, especially that of Mr.Clooney, are notable as well. It's a brilliant adaption and a film that is, dare I say it, fantastic."

","I absolutely love Fantastic Mr. Fox! It's an excellent animated movie. From the clever comedic writing to the great casting for the voices of the characters to the masterful animation technique. Meryl Streep, George Clooney, and Bill Murray's voices all match up with their characters very well, it just works. The writing is a very dry humor, it's not obvious at all, which is the kind of humor I love, some very young children may not quite understand all the lines and the comedy in them since it's not obvious humor, but older kids and adults certainly will. I don't get to see this kind of animation a lot, but I'm so glad this well made film used this kind because it's very fascinating to look at. The film switches between the animals and what they're doing to the humans and what they are plotting to do about the animals. Young children will like the action related scenes, and the older kids/adults will love the dialogue exchanges and the clever script. 10/10 for Fantastic Mr. Fox! Flawless animated film."
"Aly200","7","0","0","6 February 2017"," Whimsical and Fun
","Wes Anderson brings his unique eccentricity to this Roald Dahl tale of a gentlemanly fox who decides to pull one final heist on local farmers. The director chooses to the colorful medium of stop-motion animation which was an animation trademark for director Tim Burton, but this is pure Anderson.<br/><br/>Dripped in a rich color palette of traditional fall colors like orange, yellow, brown and red, the atmosphere sets itself apart from other Wes Anderson worlds. The director is known for picking a specific color scheme to illustrate his films and here the fall colors set the time of year and fit with the characters of the Fox family and their associates. <br/><br/>As usual, Anderson assembles an all star cast of actors to bring his characters to life like frequent collaborators Bill Murray as the grouchy Badger and Jason Schwartzman as Ash Fox, son of the title Mr. Fox, while also bringing in well-established actors like George Clooney as the mischievous and suave title character, Meryl Streep as the clever and loyal wife of Clooney's Mr. Fox as well as a minor appearance from Willem Dafoe as the voice of the scheming and devious Rat (too fitting a character for the actor known for playing villains). Every player in the film brings the comradeship needed between them while also being believable as a family unit or adversaries. <br/><br/>The film takes a unique approach to language as director Wes Anderson tosses out traditional cursing and swaps in the word""cuss"" whenever a character has to swear. At times it is evident what word the actor might actually have said and other times it's purely entertaining without replacing a certain curse word. This idea keeps the material family-friendly for any younger viewers, but provides an adult joke for all the grown-ups."

","I will give this film 10 stars because it is the best film ever!!<br/><br/>The movie is about Mr. Fox who steals birds from Boggis and Bunce. He also steals cider from a farmer called Bean. They are digging a lot and they live in a hole. Bean has an idea to flood them out with cider. Then Mr. Fox and the neighborhood went to the sewer. Mr. Fox killed the bad rat and he floats away down the sewer. The animals never came out. My favorite character is Kristofferson because he is quiet and sporty. My least favorite character is farmer Bean because he is mean and he shot off Mr. Fox's tail. In the book there is a woman that works for Bean but in the film there is no woman. In the film there is a sewer but in the book the animals live in the burrow. I like the film more than the book because the book is boring and it makes me feel sleepy but the film has more pictures and good music.

"bilbobrick","7","0","0","6 December 2016"," Stop-Motion At Its Finest
","Forced to watch this movie as part of a school project after reading the book, I was not particularly looking forward to this one. I ended up liking it, however. I have a deep respect for stop-motion animators, not only because they laid the groundwork for the mind- blowing special effects of today, but also because of the countless hours they put into their work-- and it shows here. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie is undoubtedly the animation; unless you're a huge Roald Dahl fan, that's the reason you're going to watch this. The film also has a star-studded voice cast and an enjoyable, if eccentric, score. The film almost certainly would have won Best Animated Feature if the near-flawless Up hadn't come out in the same year. Kids should be reasonably entertained, and adults will be charmed as well.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the film adds to, shuffles around, and changes the source material drastically, but even the most die-hard fans of Dahl will admit that there wasn't a whole lot to turn into a feature-length film to begin with. Some of the additions work, and some definitely feel tacked-on and unnecessary. The film also markets itself as being ""hilarious,"" which it is not; it is occasionally humorous at best. There are also a few glaringly obvious CGI insertions at times, which take the viewer out of the experience a bit.<br/><br/>Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fun family film with outstanding animation and plenty to entertain audiences with for its 87-minute run-time. Get the kids and some popcorn, and enjoy this visual treat."

","Much like many people who are a fan of Roald Dahl (I just noticed how strange the spelling of his name is) and his work, I was eagerly awaiting for this movie to come out. I actually own a copy of the book (which seems somewhat uncommon these days) since I was a child.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for it, I was quite intrigued. It wasn't quite what I had imagined. There is quite a different style of animation at play and while I didn't like it straight away and it made me a little uncomfortable given how it looks somewhere between animated and life-like. However, I really enjoyed it and thought it suited the movie quite well.<br/><br/>The music was interesting, quite fitting. I don't remember any of the songs that were playing or whether or not they were in the book. The most distinctive thing I can remember is the children's chant of 'Boggis, Bunce and Bean'. I didn't really like that either when I first heard it but by the end of the movie I couldn't get it out of my head.<br/><br/>I like the typography of the film - how there was the name of each chapter of the book shown on screen when it appeared. Despite not reading the book in ten years, some of the titles brought me back to that time. I don't remember the story being the way that it was, however. But perhaps it's just me or it could be a twist on the book that was pretty straight forward.<br/><br/>My favourite part was the way the three farmers' farms were laid out and the way that the farmers were introduced which brought back memories. I'm pretty certain their descriptions were straight out of the book.<br/><br/>Rewatch value: I'd voluntarily watch it again a few more times. It's not something you put on in the background. All in all, it was a good experience. Definitely different in terms of animation but I quite enjoyed it. I would recommend it to people to watch at least once."

","Wes Anderson's cool quirks and characteristics follow him into the land of stop-motion animation with Fantastic Mr. Fox, an eye-popping, hilarious adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book.<br/><br/>It's the timeless tale of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), who has enjoyed a life of doing what foxes do best: prowling for fowl. A prologue finds the dashing rapscallion and his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) raiding a poultry farm. After they get ensnared by a trap, Felicity announces that she's pregnant, and our plucky fox finds himself trapped in a different sort of cage: parental responsibility. Mr. Fox, after promising his wife he wouldn't thieve anymore, settles into a humdrum life as a newspaper columnist. But he can't suppress his natural friskiness for long.<br/><br/>In an attempt to reclaim some thrills and escape the daily doldrums, he plans ""one last heist"" (we've heard that before). The mark: a dastardly trio of farmers - Boggis, Bunce and Bean, whose delectable deposits of chickens, ducks and cider are too delicious to deny. After Mr. Fox makes a mockery of their security by plotting daring - and quite humorous - night raids of their farms, the trio combines forces and goes on the offensive to kill their furry nemesis. The critters burrow deep into the Earth and capture the attention of local media. As the farmers amp up their machinations to bring an end to their clever rival, the animal community is dragged into this war of wits and survival, as Mr. Fox tries to find a way to save his family and friends.<br/><br/>As the voice of Mr. Fox, Clooney gives a wry nod and sly wink of a performance, while Streep slips so easily into the vocal role as his stern but loving wife, you don't notice her presence. The entire cast, that also includes Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, seems to be having so much fun you cannot help but imagine them sipping martinis during the voice recordings. While the performances make Fantastic Mr. Fox enthralling and overwhelmingly heartwarming, it's the film's splendid, old-fashioned stop-motion visuals that will win hearts. Wes Anderson's team boundlessly, buoyantly fill each frame with fine flourishes. Each intricately orchestrated frame feels like a gloriously animated page of a picture book. Landscapes resemble carpet remnants and fire extinguishers plume what looks like cotton candy. The adorable animals and the gorgeous environment displayed in the film seem like the felt patches of a children's book that are intended to be caressed against your cheek and held close to your chest. It not only looks scruffily beautiful, but it's hilariously off-balance, warm-hearted, perfectly composed and detailed and casually but meaningfully acted. This last feat is again the result of Anderson's inscrutable perfectionism.<br/><br/>The film incorporates all the quiet, improvisational style, dry humor delivery as found in Anderson's cinema, but combined with the proletarian fluidity of the animation; the result for audiences is a gleeful trance-like holiday. Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation is perhaps the purest distillation yet of his nerveless twee cinema of quirk."

","A film that's nostalgic in many terms and terrific technically.<br/><br/>This is an animated stop-motion film and one of it's kind in today's world where there is a huge amount of technical brilliance. Stop- motion animation is one of the oldest techniques as old as Alice in wonderland in 1903 and even much before that. This film adopts the same technology and adds up a lot of speediness to make the stop motion to look real animation. So technically it is great.<br/><br/>The content is fun, but there is a strong script over a not so strong story which is an inherent ingredient of Wes Anderson film. Had there been a stronger story, this would have been more wonderful. The voice over is stupendous and the dialogues are well written too. Above all, the humor is subtle and yet hilarious. <br/><br/>Music by Alexandre Desplat is worth a mention as it adds a lot of weight to this film. It's a great score and gels well with the film, <br/><br/>Wes Anderson can take a simple story and make it more than a worthwhile watch and he proves yet again with this. The art direction and the colors used are great and made the film an treat to the eye. The characterisation is one that you would find in a typical commercial film. There is a hero, a heroine, a sidekick and a villain. Together, there is a family too. So this is a perfect stop- motion family entertainer I would say.<br/><br/>I loved this for many reasons and thanks to Anderson for bringing stop-motion back. Big thanks for his wit and sense of humor that are displayed generously in the film.<br/><br/>A 4/5 to a great stop motion animation film."

","I watched Fantastic Mr. Fox years ago, and only recently watched it again. The high scores gave me high hopes, and it fulfilled most of my expectations.<br/><br/>The art and stop-motion is great. It's fantastic to look at, the the stop- motion is spot-on. The scenery itself is enough to leave you wanting more. <br/><br/>The plot is, although feeling rushed at points, well-paced in the end, as you realize how much there is to cover. It's unpredictable and interesting to see where the adventures of Mr. Fox takes him and his family. The new events that occur as the movie progresses don't drag out the movie at all, but I feel like it would have benefited from a longer run time. <br/><br/>The movie is quite quirky and has plenty of exaggerated scenes throughout. These scenes, although unrealistic, fit well into the universe of Fantastic Mr. Fox, and really add to the whole experience. <br/><br/>My only complaint is that it often blatantly gives in to movie clichés that really bothered me, and as much was I wanted to call it fantastic, these scenes distracted from it. Nevertheless, I loved everything else. <br/><br/>Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox is a heck of a lot of fun. It's well-paced, beautiful to look at, and quirky. Unfortunately it suffers from following the formula, which really distracts from the creativity of the rest of the film. Nevertheless, the movie is worth your time, and is a must-watch for any movie lover. If you did somehow dislike it, then that's really too bad. If you do enjoy it, then we're in agreement. I highly recommend you checking this one out if you haven't already."

","Wes Anderson's stop-motion puppet show, adopted from Roald Dahl's beloved children novel, has evaded from me for all these years, again, I'm not an avid animation fan and particularly into children's fare, but this winsome gem can nimbly edge into my Top 10 film of the year. <br/><br/>Mr. Fox (Clooney) used to enjoy his adventurous life as a food-stealer with Ms. Fox (Streep), but now he is a suave columnist, they have a son Ash (Schwartzman), and lead a quiet life living underground. Nevertheless, as a wild animal, Mr. Fox cannot reconciled to the quiet life which Ms. Fox urges him to hew to, he purchases a new tree house regardless of his lawyer Mr. Badger (Murray)'s persuasion because three meanest human farmers are living nearby. Later Mr. Fox's teenage nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) comes to stay with them, whose athletic bent walks away with Mr. Fox's commendation and leaves a gauche Ash pale in comparison. <br/><br/>Recruiting an opossum Kylie (Wolodarsky) as his aide, Mr. Fox plots one-last-raid to the three farmers' respective lands on the sly, which ultimately provokes the farmers' vengeance, lead by Franklin Bean (Gambon), the meanest of them all, and endangers other species as well. Together, animals need to use their instinct to fight back and Mr. Fox must retrieve his tail which he has lost in an ambush, now becomes a fur tie wearing by Bean as a victorious token and rescue Kristofferson who is captured as a hostage. <br/><br/>With all the animals sport an American accent whereas the evil humans with British accent, Anderson chirpily brings the mischievous pettiness into the film's autumnal palette, the story has its whimsical focus on retaining one's natural disposition and a correct upbringing every child should receive. Visually speaking, this animation has its quintessential Andersonian opulence, its symmetrical and miniature frame arrangement promisingly augurs his auteurist consummation in MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014). So is his characterisation of the assorted anthropomorphic critters, mostly foxes and rodents, and the only villain among them is Willem Dafoe voices the rat, Mr. Fox's nemesis. When Mr. Fox and his cohort meets a wolf on their way, he must overcome his deepest fear since his inherent phobia of wolves, and Anderson lends the story such a philosophical angle of exhortation, throws in conspicuous adulthood sophistication onto the family-friendly template.<br/><br/>For those who anticipate a more dramatic showdown, Anderson doesn't accommodate itself into a traditional story-unwinding, the film doesn't end in a thorough and edge-of-the- seat payoff, alternatively, Anderson blasé care-freeness finishes this endearing tale with a ""we want it more"" note. The cast is pretty fetching, it is Clooney's first voice performance and he is plain fitting, but a quite despondent fact is that Streep can only pair with Clooney as a couple in an animation, in the world of live-action, it will never happen, not in a billion years. All in all, it is rather dismissive to category Anderson's work as a cartoon for kids, it competently deserves the adjective in its title and is a steadfast stepping stone for Anderson's propitious standing in Hollywood's hierarchy."

"slokes","7","0","0","12 February 2015"," From Art-House To Playroom
","A pleasurable children's film sometimes over-infused with adult sensibilities, ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" gives us plenty of charm and character, as well as a sense of director Wes Anderson poking a little fun at himself as noted art-house auteur.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a retired fowl-thief who feels rather restricted by his new life as a newspaper columnist. When he moves to a new tree with his wife (Meryl Streep) and cub Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the prosperous farms of three mean humans prove too fat and juicy for him to ignore. But a life of crime has a downside, even for a fox as fleet and sly as the Fantastic Mr. F.<br/><br/>As a director of wit and sophistication, Anderson may seem an unlikely candidate for bringing Roald Dahl's children's novel of forest- animal hi-jinks to screen. But Anderson has always had one foot in the water of lost childhood, and his treatment of the source material is clearly a labor of love.<br/><br/>The film also benefits from the stop-action animation employed, giving it the feeling of one of those Rankin/Bass productions from the 1960s and 1970s. The film veers occasionally into twee territory working this vibe, but Anderson's usual directorial style of static compositions and tight close-ups seems a perfect match. At times, Anderson seems to play this up deliberately, pausing on a mealtime scene for one of Anderson's pregnant pauses, followed by the characters devouring their meals in wild-animal mode.<br/><br/>The exchanges scripted by Anderson and Noah Baumbach also reflect this congruence:<br/><br/>""They'll kill the children!""<br/><br/>""Over my dead body they will.""<br/><br/>""That's what I'm saying, you'll be dead, too, in that scenario.""<br/><br/>""Well, I'm arguing against that.""<br/><br/>Anderson's predilection for casting more actors than he has parts is evident here, too, but it kind of works. The usual gang of suspects, i. e. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wally Wolodarsky, etc., all provide sterling support as various animal characters, while Michael Gambon shines particularly as Mr. Bean, the nastiest of the human farmers.<br/><br/>It's a more overtly comical offering than you usually get from Anderson. The school Ash goes to has a sign reading ""Co-Ed, All Species."" The word ""cuss"" is used as a substitute for a popular profanity, as in ""This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everybody."" The humor may play a bit above the heads of little ones at times, but the message of accepting one's differences as strengths rather than weaknesses is cleverly developed. As morals go, it's a pretty good one.<br/><br/>So is ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox."" At its best, which is often, it brings out the kid in you with its easy charm and pervading sense of wonder. It's not Anderson's greatest film, but it shows why he's worth watching."

","I'll preface this review of Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" by stating that I'm not really much of a fan of Mr. Anderson's films. For those who enjoy his work, though, this, despite being a bit of a departure, contains much of interest.<br/><br/>The story (based on a Roald Dahl children's book) concerns the exploits of a group of anthropomorphic animals, principally a family of foxes. Mr. Fox is a reformed thief who's grown bored of his sedate lifestyle and is hankering for one last job. However, when he formulates a plan and puts it into practise he soon finds that the retaliation may be more than he can handle.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and, while he does a good job, I have a thing against animated characters being voiced by instantly recognizable actors. In contrast, Meryl Streep & Jason Schwartzman are more reasonable choices and they both give good readings, especially Schwartzman, who gives the film's best performance in my opinion. Apart from these individuals, the cast includes Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon and others, all of whom turn in satisfactory performances.<br/><br/>The script occupies a strange middle ground between a children's story and a story aimed at adults. Given this fact, I'm not surprised that the film barely made back half it's budget at the U.S. box office. I wouldn't recommend it for kids and I expect that the adult market for animation is pretty limited. Nevertheless, the script is more literate than usual for an American animated film, so therefore a welcome change of pace.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a sight to behold. The use of stop-motion animation sets it apart from most contemporary animated films and I really have to applaud Anderson's direction. Musically, the film is above average as well. Prominent use is made of ""Heroes and Villains"" (The Beach Boys), ""Street Fighting Man"" (The Rolling Stones) and, for the finale, the Bobby Fuller Four gem ""Let Her Dance"". None of it makes much sense in context but it's good to hear nonetheless.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think that ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a well-made animated film but likely one with a narrow audience. Like Wes Anderson's other films, this one seems like it was made to appeal mainly to fans of Wes Anderson films."
"weronews","8","0","0","8 April 2010"," Fox Hole Puppetry
","Wes Anderson never tells traditional stories and never in a traditional manner. Since he entered the artistic world with ""Bottle Rocket"" in 1996, he treated us to accessible fare (the likes of ""Rushmore"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") and bits that are a little harder to swallow (""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,"" ""The Darjeeling Limited""), constantly keeping it entertaining and whimsical. So who better to discard CGI imagery and take one big step back to good ol' fashioned stop motion animation in order to tell Road Dahl's classic story (with a few liberties taken in the script)? George Clooney's recognizable voice is ideally cast to bring sly Mr. Fox to puppet life, and Meryl Streep, sounding a little restrained, is a pleasure as his wife - that would be Mrs. Fox. Long-time Anderson regulars (Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and - yes - Bill Murray) lend their voices to all sorts of critters. The story eases along fluidly with wryly funny - but not sitcommy - dialogue, and the scenery is so stunningly beautiful that you tend to forget how many hours of work must have gone into this little gem. Yet it all looks so deceptively simple."

"Chris Knipp","9","3","9","18 November 2009"," Wonderful work by the team coordinated by Anderson, but Anderson is best with live action
","Anybody can tell you that an animated film written by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach and directed by Mr. Anderson will be more about family rivalries and quirky characters than about cute animals, despite Fantastic Mr. Fox's basis in a famous Roald Dahl children's tale that's been called ""great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds."" Dahl was a Brit, and much of this production is English. But it's a hybrid of Yank and UK elements, with the animals, headed by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as his wife, with Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Angelika Huston, and Adrien Brody, are a star-studded and somewhat cultish American voice crew. The animals outwit three despicable farmers and steal their livestock for food. These agricultural baddies, described by Dahl as ""Boggis and Bunce and Bean/One fat, one short, one lean./These horrible crooks/So different in looks/Were nonetheless equally mean,"" are not only humans, but in the film contrast in all being played by Brits. Mr. Fox premiered as the gala opening night film at the London Film Festival, with Mr. Clooney on hand to add glamor. Media reaction was positive, though privately some English viewers were less pleased with the ""Americaniation"" of the material.<br/><br/>The stop-motion animation using stuffed dolls -- especially with Anderson's reliance on extreme closeups -- may result in the foxes and other critters appearing seedy at times, but the process is executed so slickly and photographed so brightly (with heavy emphasis on orangey earth colors) that the contrast with more hi tech pixilations and computerizations may not be so great to the untutored eye as some think. More serous for the kid audience is, well, how serious the material is, as well as more complicated, in this enlarged version of the Roald Dahl story. Take the quote offered by IMDb:<br/><br/>Mr. Fox: (sighs) Who am I, Kylie? <br/><br/>Kylie: Who how? What now? <br/><br/>Mr. Fox: Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth? <br/><br/>Kylie: I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.<br/><br/>Not very funny, and right over the heads of the seven-year-olds; but still, pretty cool stuff for an animated children's tale. Fox (one wants to say Clooney, so ably does he insinuate himself into the role) is often referring to the fact that they are finally just ""wild animals."" And the film is most captivating when the various creatures eat -- explosively devouring a pile of food and leaving crushed fragments -- or burrow into the ground -- again with explosive, instinctive animality. One wishes these hints of the savage creature inside the talking animated model came more often, and more surprisingly. These are places where 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' feels truly original.<br/><br/>It might have been nice if the film hadn't gotten so elaborately caught up in the grand war campaign between Fox and his friends (no, there's no Fassbinder in here) and the three agri-business meanies (that's what they almost become in the film) played by Robin Hurlstone (Boggis), Hugo Guinness (Bunce) and Michael Gambon (Beane). Though some British viewers have chafed at this, the intimate dysfunctionality (so typical of the maker of 'The Royal Tennenbaums,' 'The Life Aquatic' and 'The Darjeeling Limited') provides the best stuff, the moments when the dialog sparkles and charms and makes you think. The script is so subtle, even with stuffed animals, at nuancing the conflicts between Fox and his wife; at conveying their son Ash's (Schwartzman's) insecurities and his rivalries with the too-talented visiting cousin, Kristofersson (Eric Chase Anderson), that you may wish the film focused more on the intimate stuff. As with Anderson's other movies, it's character, not action, that matters. So you kind of wonder why there is so much action. Nonetheless there are action sequences that work very well, which is perhaps where the animators come in, the vast Visual Effects crew, and cinematographer Tristan Oliver -- who seem to have had a life of their own and partly had to fend for themselves in London, with Anderson directing things from a distance, via e-mail, from his Paris apartment. But if the direction was phoned-in, it seems to have worked pretty cussing well (an oddity of the script is its substituting the word ""cus"" where a stronger swear word, including the F-one, is meant). 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an animated feature that's both sophisticated and winning. Those (including a couple of name New York reviewers) who say this is Anderson's best movie yet, however, may just not like his other movies that much. Wes does wonderful work here with the voices of Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Wilson, and the rest, and he's shown he can coordinate a great animation team. But he does even better work as an auteur when he gets to put human bodies as well as voices on the screen. Still, this is the year's smartest and most winning animated feature."

","The source material is very well known, it isn't completely adhered to and some American influences are apparent but suffice to say we all know the story well so I'll concentrate my preview on what Mr Anderson does with it. The visual style is, for the first few minutes, rather distracting and dated. It steadily grew on me, to the point that it became a distinct and unique feature. I can't recall another mainstream feature to use the stop motion technique in this way, in recent years. The visual trickery and inventiveness is impressive, kudos to the team who brought this to the big screen. You see the puppet's hair bristles move constantly, after their positions have ever so slightly changed.<br/><br/>The film's big appeal is the humour, and the assembled talent delivers it in spades. Clooney is simply magnificent, completely capturing the lead character's personality, wit and charm. Able support is provided by a star line up - Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon and Meryl Streep. Plenty of jokes that will fly over the heads of younger viewers, perhaps the majority, even. Then again, letting Wes Anderson direct an animation feature, it is to be expected...<br/><br/>The British audience I watched this with appeared to thoroughly enjoy the film, there were more single adults than families even though it was an afternoon screening, and I will be fascinated to see how this film does when it gets its Stateside release. It may be too offbeat, both visually and story/humour-wise, to appeal to the Pixar demograph but it is clearly a labour of love, and deserves to succeed.<br/><br/>Would watch again on DVD and television. I recommend this to other IMDb'ers."

","Describing oneself as ""fantastic"" is a very strong statement. The meaning of this word does not define ones ability to do things or fame from others. It simply is a word to describe the various types of good we as beings have. The perfect way to share this story is through animation! Wes Anderson's triumphant tale based on Roald Dahl's story called ""Fantastic Mr.Fox"" is a delightful and inspiring animated feature that all audiences can relate to. George Clooney plays the voice of Mr.Fox, a reckless and brave critter who moves in to a new tree near some of the meanest farmers around. He lives with his swift and artsy wife Mrs.Fox (Meryl Streep), and their angry son Ash who doesn't seem to excel at anything. After Mr.Fox and his friend Kylie, an opossum, steal treats from the farmers farm, Mr.Fox endangers his friends and family by causing the farmers to destroy their environment and hunt them down, causing other creatures to be in peril as well. Many other cute animals such as mice, moles, badgers, rabbits, and beavers are all envisioned through the beautiful mind of Wes Anderson. The slickness and art put behind the unique stop-animation is both exhilarating and humbling to admire at the same time. The animation is very beautiful and has an almost real life portrait feel to it. It's like nothing you've ever seen before due to the beautiful English setting and cute creatures created by the wonderful production team. Wes Anderson's rich dialog is so charming that every viewer will be enthralled by. Children will adore the sweet humor and be blown away by the sweet animals they get to experience. Anderson does a daring job with the pen by making humor and a plot that can be analyzed and enjoyed entirely different by others. Kids and adults will enjoy the important message about how everyone is fantastic no matter what, but there are also things that only certain audiences will take into count. For instance, the marriage between Mr. and Mrs.Fox is examined in a way in which the trust and love between the two of them is studied thoroughly. It can get pretty deep! ""Fantastic Mr.Fox"" is a visually inspiring work of art that when fought in the extra mile can execute beautiful themes and a widely rich story that is the stuff of cinematic history."
"merrilltoyco","10","2","5","23 February 2010"," Wes Anderson's Perfect Transition to the Mainstream, and You Know They Need Him There
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is technically one of the very best films ever created. That may sound like an overstatement, but only to those who overlook the few filmmakers out there who are actually advancing the art, the way an art is supposed to be advanced. Wes Anderson is one of those filmmakers, and you can't study film without seeing that his clear, playacting style of film is completely original and making waves in dozens, if not hundreds of young directors. There's a reason why Scorcese called Wes Anderson ""the new Scorsese""- being about the biggest compliment Scorcese could give. But up until now, the cause for this compliment has only been demonstrated in a small set of perfectly crafted adult comedies like ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", and ""The Darjeeling Limited"".<br/><br/>Well, at last Wes Anderson has created something that we can all watch together. But what's cooler is that the decision on Mr. Anderson's part to make something for General Audinces doesn't appear at all to be based on caring about that at all, let alone having some Dreamworks-esquire Disney-envy; but upon the fact that– like Walt Disney– Wes Anderson simply has a genuine appreciation of Aesopic storytelling, and is extraordinarily good at both it, and animation. In fact, no one has added as much to the canon on how humanized animals could behave since Disney himself (note Anderson's animals' sudden bursts of raw animalistic behavior when eating and fighting, which serves hilariously to both animalize the characters more, and even build their strengths– while simultaneously satirizing certain human behaviors that can often be, humorously animalistic themselves). <br/><br/>In fact it looks as though all can be glad because– as you'll see a lot of critics saying– if there's anyone who could give Disney a run for their incalculable money, it's Anderson. We're all impressed by Disney– that's why I always hope they have someone keeping them on their toes. But again, taking down Disney does not seem to be one of Anderson's motivations at all. Again, it's his natural, evident love for what he's done here with Fantastic Mr. Fox that makes Mr. Anderson the most likely person to succeed, however incidentally, at creating the next major animation studio with it's own thing going. And he should do exactly that, between live action films.<br/><br/>When successful, center-buzz art-film directors like Wes Anderson get all the more artsy, with full-on stop-motion animation (which, once you quickly get past the initial movement of it with the help of some excellent storytelling, can look more real than the best cgi– because you can feel that it IS real) and the result is mainstream fare, however intentionally limited it's release, I feel like falling over with joy. And how impressive is it that a feature-length, stop-motion animation film– which, being more foreign now, requires stronger storytelling to suspend the audience's disbelief– works as well as a Pixar film; and what does that say about Wes Anderson's storytelling ability?<br/><br/>Now, about the film– I love it when people think that animation is just for kids, so I will tell you that this is more of a family film than a kid's movie; and I'm saying that because everyone will enjoy this film more if they know what they're getting into– i.e. adults should know and not just be surprised by the fact that they are probably the film's intended core audience– because that's cool here. Looney Tunes were the same way. For example, with Mr. Fox, all of the dialogue is very proper and intelligent, and many, many of the situational and subtle humor will be less grappled by kids. It is not, however, dirty. It also involves a hilariously satirical depiction of the use of swearing, wherein the characters will begin to say sentences that overuse the word ""cuss"", in places where there would normally be even some of the spiciest language, in reality. That being said, I don't know how that can hurt kids any more than public school. And when it comes to how even little children will enjoy what really is advanced entertainment, it's still a bunch of talking animals. They freaking love it.<br/><br/>So while this new style of animating may in a very real way compete with the best, it will do so because it's really nothing like it, especially when compared to how close the other competitors all are to each other. This is not Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, or A bug's Life, or something in between– because in spite of the fact that the characters are a bunch of talking animals, it's still– in every other way– very different than other cartoons. And if it's slightly more mature than the rest, that's because it's a Wes Anderson take on a Roald Dahl story– and both are noted for mischief, high invention, and the flavour of England.<br/><br/>And Fantastic Mr. Fox, while being a reminder of Wes Anderson's unparalleled auteurism– which includes his firm grasp on Art Direction, Direction, Writing, Story, Costuming, Music, and about twenty other key elements in film– is, perhaps first and foremost, a quintessential reminder of just how truly, truly funny he can be. He's one of the world's greatest humorist, and we wouldn't believe it because we're living in his time. When you really stop and analyze it– all of his trademarks are chosen because of their specific power to accentuate or produce humor– the only exception being that which he implements for the accentuation or production of pure, good, old-fashioned tomfoolery. And if the latter is not for the kids, then nothing is.<br/><br/>I love Wes Anderson's films, and in a very thought-through kind of way, I think that Fantastic Mr. Fox might just be his best one. That is saying about as much about this film as I can say. It's absolutely perfect, and I hope Anderson takes us on this kind of outing again and often.<br/><br/>Bravo, Wes Anderson. You rule."

","The film is good but for me would have made a much better 1 hour special. I like kids films and I did not really enjoy this. I think it is more aimed at adults who want to regress to childhood rather than for children themselves. For me the music did not work in a children's film. The set music pieces did not work, the choreography was a little stilted. The rat knife fight was a little more vicious and aggressive than is necessary in a children's film.<br/><br/>The last few years as the US is going from bad to worse war, financial collapse, vicious political divides they seem to be wanting cinema that is not representative of the rest of the world. UP is an example of a film not really for children but childlike adults. Slumdog Millionaire got an Oscar for best film.

In a time when so many film companies, excluding Pixar and occasionally Dreamworks, decide that an obvious plot with moronic humor can be shoveled into children's' little heads because they're young, it does my heart good to see a film made that treats children like smart, mature people. It's about time somebody realized that children don't all laugh at farts. I was in stitches, myself, as was everyone else I went with. Don't think ""is it too mature for my baby?"" because then you're deciding to lessen your child's capacity for smartness.

"thesubstream","9","2","5","8 December 2009"," It's one of the best films of the year, if not the best
","Like the pairing of Werner Herzog and Nic Cage in the new Bad Lieutenant movie, the combination of director Wes Anderson and writer Roald Dahl seems, in hindsight, like a no-brainer. Peanut butter and jam, scotch and soda. Fantastic Mr. Fox, Anderson's stop-motion adaptation of Dahl's beloved book of the same name seems from its opening frames to be an absolute classic. It's one of the best films of the year, if not the best, and more fun by miles than anything I've seen in years.<br/><br/>George Clooney and Meryl Streep voice Mr. and Mrs. Fox, who move into a new tree-home near the farms of three cruel farmers. Their son, the diminutive Ash (Jason Schwartzman) is dismayed at both his inability to match the legendary athletic prowess of his dashing father and at the arrival of a cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Mr. Fox, who gave up life as a chicken thief when he married, is drawn back into a life of fox-crime, but his actions have repercussions when farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean (Robin Hurlstone, Hugo Guinness and Michael Gambon) seek retribution and lay siege to Fox's den.<br/><br/>Anderson's films from Bottle Rocket through The Royal Tennenbaums and The Life Aquatic have followed a pretty linear progression as he's become more and more the auteur: heavily stylized (to the point in his recent work of distraction) ensemble pieces about smart, odd, fracturing middle-class families, with rock music from the '60's. The problem is that as his work has progressed, it has gotten harder and harder to read his characters as in any way authentically human. That is not to say that his later films suffer in comparison, just that they're so heavily stylized and so odd that while they're dazzling displays of cohesive style and wit and meticulous planning, they lack the ram-shackle humanist charm that made his early films stand out. His later films seem less about humans than weird human simulacra that live in a weird sea-going commune or in a New York with a 375th St. YMCA.<br/><br/>In the stop-motion animated world of Mr. Fox Anderson's stylistic quirks lose their distancing surreality and become instead marvels, utter naturalistic joys. It's a sublime pairing, and it highlights what has always been Anderson's true strength: his writing. It's funny, scary and moving, and like Dahl's work it retains its feel of coming intact from kid-land with all of the loopiness and anarchic joie-de-vivre that entails. Hilariously funny and with as much depth as any grown-up film made this year, it's not just fun and funny, it's a spectacularly well-made film. 9.2/10."

","How did they pull this off? The movie is chock full of low brow, a-typical Wes Anderson adult humor.

It's at least on par with my previous favorite, Rushmore. There is some criticism here about the precision of the adaptation, regardless, it is Wes Anderson's screenplay that sells this movie. I have not read the book, but I'm sure that some sense of heart was moved over to this theatrical version.<br/><br/>The voice overs and mouth animation is spectacular.

","First of all, I've never gotten into Wes Anderson's work.

Not only that, but's it's made in old-fashioned, 70's-esque stop-motion animation which clearly wears the time and loving care went into it on it's sleeves.<br/><br/>All the main characters are likable, with each of them getting equal screen time. None of them are complete idiots which is so prominent in today's animated cartoons and feature lengths. Also, they're all so nicely dressed in neat little human outfits, which gets the film bonus points.<br/><br/>The dialogue is laced with clever jokes, puns, quips, conservations, and arguments that reflect the film's ""hipster"" atmosphere.<br/><br/>The music is amazing, and clearly influenced by bluegrass, folk, and Eastern music cultures.

","At the heart of Fantastic Mr Fox is a tale about masculinity, and one that is served up within the narrative of a fox instead of a human, and so the phallic symbol is instead a tail. This tail is worn as a trophy and is the objective for both Mr Fox and Ash, the less than athletic son who is living in the shadow of his father and his cousin's ability/achievements. Both these character's story lines are written well, no matter how close or far they may be from the Roald Dahl novel. And the stop motion animation makes for a great medium for these children's books which also carry heavier themes. If we can't get hand drawn animated Quentin Blake style illustrations (someone get on that) then this way is equally as good. It's all accompanied by the pleasant and whimsical score of Desplat. The mandolin, flute and xylophone combine quite well especially in the third track, and Kristofferson's Theme is a wonderfully melancholy accompaniment to the quiet whirring of the toy train which stifles a young fox's tears. Additionally, the childlike gibberish and chanting of Petey's Song by Jarvis Croker is charming and not a bad song in the slightest. <br/><br/>At times the visuals and fluidity reaches the heights of Wallace and Gromit and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which is no easy feat to do. The art design is meticulously gorgeous, right down to the 12 chickens miniature meals, the scientific contraptions of Bean, the water splash effects, the spotless kitchen, the grimy television set, a miniature working motorcycle complete with sidecar! The world of across the river is beautifully and stunningly realised with loving care and detail. Given most of it was captured in live action, it retains a cinematic quality; I particularly love the lighting that is displayed in 3 separate ways in the cellar of Bean, down to the warm glow that illuminates all the bottles of apple cider. The humans are realised with a wonderful sense of character and ambition - well Bean mostly, who is stick thin yet sinister, dark yet lively. The little disappointment was the fur of the fox models, which bristled in the wind but felt a little like fake toys, especially with the fondness of Anderson to use extreme close ups to showcase emotion. The welling of tears in the eyes is well done, but looks almost too good next to the plastic strands of orange and white. <br/><br/>The voice cast is mostly adequate. Owen Wilson as Anderson alumni was easily recognisable as the sports coach, but that did not stick out. Two in particular stick out to me, and it's a shame that they are two main characters. Firstly, Jason Schwartzman as a long time Anderson collaborator voices Ash, which I feel is a big misstep given how authentically his character is written with real pangs of jealously and moodiness as well as bravery and sympathy. These would shine a lot more had an appropriately aged voice actor be cast. Schwartzman sounds too sarcastic, too whiny, and is overshadowed by Eric Anderson as the wonderfully tender Kristofferson. The second issue is with Clooney as Mr Fox, who is immediately recognisable from the get go. His strong and confident voice is appropriate for some scenes, like when he takes the lead in digging, or when he is chastising Kylie while raiding and killing chickens. Other more vulnerable scenes he simply does not echo the screenplay, such as the heart-to-heart with Felicity near the waterfall, or the talk with Ash. It doesn't ruin those moments, but hearing how unshaken or how callous Clooney sounds is a little jarring. <br/><br/>One of those moments is one of my favourite of the whole film, the encounter near the end with the wolf. It's a culmination of the entire narrative arc of Mr Fox's struggle with his inherent animalistic nature, which is so humorously displayed whenever they wolf down a delicacy (but not before slowly savouring in visually, which adds to the appeal of the humour). In the beginning, he attempts to woo Felicity by showing his dangerous and wild side, how easily he snaps the chicken's neck. We never find out how effective this was, because the pregnancy of Ash forces him to find another way of life. Years later (how many fox years is that?) he is unable to fight his urges and risks his life to start up again. The consequences of this are drastic, and again he must fight against feeding his own ego and appetite for adventure (watch how effortlessly he steals attention from Badger during the toast - Clooney's voice is especially great when addressing crowds and speaking of his own victories). He loses his tail and his symbol for masculinity in the process, but reconciles - another pregnancy confronts him and he decides to return to his domesticated way of life. ""I have a phobia of wolves!"" he shouts, yet we are now struck but how unafraid he sounds compared to those moments beforehand when someone mentions wolves. He can no longer run away into the wilderness like the wolf can, a beast of wild, unbridled power, but he still shares a momentary sign of recognition. He can at least speak English, unlike the wolf. And he can also gorge himself at Boggis, Bunce and Bean Supermarkets. <br/><br/>Fantastic Mr Fox, despite its shortcomings, is a delightful little tale that hits emotional notes with surprising complexity considering its source material is a children's novel. The stop motion medium is perhaps where Anderson's picture book/painterly aesthetic shines; whether you call it needlessly quirky or not (hint: it's not). It takes talking animals and gives them a warm and whimsical tone, but not without pulling its punches when more serious moments call for reflection. I don't think that stop motion watery tears welling from a plastic eyeball could ever substitute real life sadness, but Fox sure tries its best."

","From the very moment this movie begins, you immediately know it's a Wes Anderson movie: his fingerprints are all over it. Indeed, before it is even an adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic it's a Wes Anderson movie - and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, what would be the point in making the film be exactly the same in style and tone as the book? The book is already marvellous in its own right, and it already exists so you could just go and read it. Both the book and the film deserve to be experienced (because the film is an adaptation, not a copy.)<br/><br/>The movie is a stop-motion animation following the exploits of Mr.Fox, a retired chicken thief who now writes for a local newspaper after having a child. However, when he moves into a tree that just so happens to be across from three mean farmers, Mr.Fox can't help but get back into the game. The story mostly sticks to the plot of the book, but it does deviate slightly by adding in a few scenes before his retirement and by altering the ending. It also replaces his three children with Ash (Mr.Fox's son) and Kristoferson (Mr.Fox's Nephew) and places more emphasis on his relationship with his wife, Mrs.Fox. I don't mind the changes, however, as I feel that they do make for a more entertaining and fleshed out movie.<br/><br/>The cast is comprised of a few acting heavyweights; most notably George Clooney as Mr.Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs.Fox, Michael Gambon as Bean and Bill Murray as Badger. Also joining the cast in much smaller roles (for only one or two scenes) are Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody. The cast help bring realism to the characters, and it's amusing to see animals hold human conversations. I have no complaints with any of the casting choices, as they all match their characters perfectly.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox is filled with tiny little details that are barely noticeable but make the film unique and really show how hard the animators worked to bring this world to life. The stop motion looks choppy, but that is intentional as the film was shot in 12 frames per second instead of the standard 24. I especially liked the running gag where every expletive was replaced with the word 'cuss', so phrases like ""you scared the cuss out of us!"" were both common and amusing. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was an enjoyable animation with a good plot, quirky humour and excellent casting. It's certainly a Wes Anderson movie, despite its animated nature. 7/10"

He doesn't comprise any on the his visual, his color palette, and his language. There's no mistake that this is all Wes Anderson. The story isn't of much consequence. The dialog is filled with the dry wit that Wes Anderson is known for. The camera style on shooting head on remain even thought it's animation. Add to it, Wes has enticed the voice talents of all his famous friends including George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, and Jason Schwartzman. George is especially effective as the suave Mr Fox. It's interesting to see Wes Anderson try something different. However I don't this medium fits him that well. His style is already very static. The restriction of animation really decreases the emotional effectiveness of actors especially this type of claymation."

The voice actors Clooney, Streep, Murray and Gambon all turn in gifted performances. A valuable bonus is the extra 45 minutes of video which detail several aspects of the creation of the film - which makes the viewer value every second on the screen as part of two years of dedicated craftsmanship by a huge team of artists.

I think I initially expected it to be a fairly straight adaptation of the Roald Dahl original (a modern classic I, along with many others in the UK, grew up with), something I should have realised it wouldn't necessarily be given Wes Anderson's unique way of fingerprinting his films. Upon successive viewings, I realised that Anderson had simply reinterpreted Dahl's vision in his own unique, beautiful fashion, and by doing so made it Dahl-esque in other ways. Definitely recommended."

","Wes Anderson's films are about mid life crises, castration anxieties, emasculated man-children, self doubting child-men and tweed wearing posh people who fantasise about being macho enough to wrestle big fish. Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr Fox"", based on a story by Roald Dahl, is no different, despite starring a stop-motion fox.<br/><br/>The film stars actor George Clooney – cast due to countless past roles as a thief - as Mr Fox, an ex robber who now lives a responsible life with his wife and son. They're all relatively happy, normal and peaceful, until a midlife crisis hits Fox like a ton of bricks. ""I don't want to live in a hole any more!"" he yells, desperate to cast aside his suburban life and sink his jaws into some larger achievement. After all, doesn't he deserve more out of life?<br/><br/>Fox's answer, like Edward Norton's in ""Fight Club"", is to embrace the feral beast within. Roping his friends into his midlife crisis he embarks on a string of dangerous heists, breaking into the factories of 3 villainous farmers and stealing their delicious loot. As Fox becomes more successful, Anderson's camera begins to focus more on his emancipated animal tail and less on the constrictions of his human neck tie. One phallic symbol – one of freedom the other of servitude - has essentially replaced the other, and when the evil farmers shoot off Fox's tail and keep it as a trophy, all sorts of interesting thematic avenues are opened up. Yes, this is literally a stop-motion kid's film about the conflict between wild, natural masculinity and the neutered alienation of the postindustrial workplace.<br/><br/>Like ""Fight Club"", Fox also sets up an underground union of sorts. In an attempt to release his friends from bondage, Fox urges all the animals in the land to revert to their scientific, Latin names, and suggests to them that they each have natural, in born talents which it is in their benefit to set free. The animals agree, and together they start a little war against the farmers, using a series of subterranean tunnel networks to undermine their human overlords. From this point onwards Fox becomes a Robin Hood figure, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.<br/><br/>These kinds of meretricious tales were common in the works of Roald Dahl. Dahl loved tales in which the poor and dispossessed outwit the powerful and cruel and often told stories in which those who own the means of production dominate others, both physically and psychologically. What Anderson does is take things a little further. Fox may be a rebel, but it is suggested that he has the capacity to be just as evil and egotistical as those he fights. ""I think I have this thing where I want everyone to think I'm the greatest,"" Fox says, though he does eventually learn to direct his ego toward the benefit of the animal community as a whole. <br/><br/>The film differs from the book in other ways. Anderson introduces Fox's son, who is your classic Wes Andersonian messed up kid. At once hating and admiring the masculinity of his constrictive father, the son is going through a psycho-sexual dilemma akin to his dad's, torn between a life of domestication and that of a wild, free animal. In other words, the head of the son's little Oedipal complex is the father, whilst the head of the father's complex are the farmers, both daddy and son itching to break free of those whom they believe to be holding them in bondage. The film simplifies very complex issues, and is wrong to localise its cast's anxieties around a series of daddy figures, but the notion that one (the father) must relinquish the ego and set free the son before first seeking freedom from The Big Other is something Anderson's other films often tangentially deal with, the artist possibly responding to the fact that the ego has been in decline now for generations. Unable to libidinize objects itself, today the libidinization of objects is accomplished for the ego by the superego in the form of mass culture, the educational system, media, technology and advertising. The ego itself is now libidinized externally, for example in the form of virtual ""Yous"" (the You of YouTube) and ""faces"" (""Face"" book). Unable to unite itself with the objects libidinized from without, the ego then suffers through greed, dissatisfaction and despair, afflictions which tend to plague Anderson's heroes. <br/><br/>The film ends with a rather bleak ending. The farmers don't catch Fox, but he is forced to live underground, always in hiding and always in fear, allowed only to come up to the surface to take food from a huge supermarket. Fox now has the illusion of freedom, of unfettered access to product, his bourgeois aspirations met, but in reality he still has a foot over his head and is unable to actually regrow his tail. In this way, Fox's masculine impulses have condemned both his friends and family, a collective defeat which the animals assuage with acts of light rebellion- they occasionally steal the very produce the farmers sell. Throw in the fact that Fox's wife swiftly becomes pregnant (further domesticating Fox) and that Fox suddenly learns he is unable to ""talk"" with wild animals, and the film's ending is revealed to be something pessimistic masquerading as victory.<br/><br/>What makes this ending doubly bleak is the fact that Anderson genuinely doesn't understand how regressive and dark it all is (like Dahl, Anderson is firmly wedded to the ideals of the American Dream); he seems to think his heroes have won and have earned the right to party. <br/><br/>8.5/10 – At its best, this flick examines the risks and consequences behind Hollywood's typical ""be true to yourself"" message. Stylistically, like Anderson's other features, its a postmodern collage of 1960s vogue, self-conscious whimsy, much quirkiness, Euro-camp and layers of schmaltzy psychodrama. Actress Meryl Streep stands out as a stop motion fox."

About 30 minutes of the movie was the action. Don't get me wrong, I know how hard it is to make a fast frame movie. It must have taken 6 months to gather all the scenes.<br/><br/>I would really prefer the book over this movie. Not a gold mine here.<br/><br/>6/10"

The brilliant Roald Dahl mangled by the American movie machine. It's a crying shame.<br/><br/>I see the movie costed about 40 million (!) to make. Sure, to pay Clooney and Streep (oh my, without them, this movie'd be impossible to rate). Bad, bad, bad.<br/><br/>How, Wes Anderson, how did you manage to almost literally drain this wonderful story of each and every emotion? Of all wit? Of each joke? I guess that's an achievement. How difficult can it be, with this cast, with such a story, to make it into such garbage?<br/><br/>Yuck!"
"mormonboy23","3","2","7","26 July 2010"," Not so fantastic....
","So far, Roald Dahl's stories have made a successful transfer to the big screen. This film could be said to have horribly ruined that positive trend. James and the Giant Peach, another Roald Dahl story, was brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation as well back in 1996. Similar to the way that Microsoft took a step backwards by upgrading everyone to the inferior Windows Vista, director Wes Anderson lets this film take a plunge by getting a high-definition camera and taking half the pictures that a fluent stop-motion film would require. This results in staccato movements that distract the audience and sap all the potential magic that could have been in the film. Indeed a lot of mistakes are made in the film. Whatever cleverness that Dahl may have originally written into his story is ruined by the director's idea of an alternate ending and overall an apparent carelessness to the way the film was constructed. I'm not saying the film is complete garbage, some parts do stand out, hinting at how good the original story may have been. But somehow even the clever parts, like the characters saying ""cuss"" when they intend to swear, becomes distracting and even unfriendly towards younger audiences when you realize that the swear it's replacing is the ""f-word"", just shy of them saying ""mothercusser"". Probably the worst stop-motion film I've ever seen, The Fantastic Mr. Fox is in no way fantastic and should be left alone."

Fast, fun and sharply etched with fine comedic bravado throughout (thank you again Bill Murray for your insouciant vocals) and a truly amazing tour-de-force for the stop-motion animators and production design by Nelson Lowry (seriously should be considered for an Oscar) with its autumnal palette and homemade puppetry look (waycool how everything bristles to life!)

","I did read the Roald Dahl children's book ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" when I was a child, and I remember enjoying it, though I did have some issues with it (more on that later). When I sat down to watch this filmed version of the tale, I couldn't help but wonder how they would take what was a somewhat short book and make it to feature film length. As it turns out, only a short amount of the movie follows the book; the first third is a new backstory, then the next fifteen minutes or so follows the book, and the remaining running time is a kind of a sequel to what happened in the book. <br/><br/>The sequel portion of the movie is a little interesting, since as a child I wondered what happened after the point where the book ended. Though at times it felt like blatant padding, just like what the first thirty minutes felt at times. But the padding wasn't the main issue I had with the movie. The problem was the same that I had with the book as a child - I didn't much like the character of Mr. Fox, even more so in this movie. In the movie, he is such a braggart, a heartless thief, and so irresponsible that I was greatly annoyed by him. This is a fatal blow, in my opinion.<br/><br/>As for the animation, it was interesting to watch, if a little crude and cheap at times. But interesting animation almost never makes up for unlikable characters and boring story padding. I have a feeling that if Dahl were alive to see this filmed adaptation of his book, he'd be very unhappy... though reports state that he disliked almost all of the filmed adaptations of his writing."

I won't compare it with the Roald Dahl book which I never read, but it doesn't make a difference, The movie was charmless and so bland and boring I bailed after twenty minutes. I doubt even little kids would enjoy this.<br/><br/>So what happens? Mr. and Mrs. Fox are at a farm, first conversing, then stealing a squab from it. Then Mr. Fox sees a trap and gets curious and ends up trapping himself and his wife in it. Then all of a sudden, two years pass (no explanation of how they got out of the trap) and they have an adolescent son, then they have a young cousin visit when his father is ill. In the meantime, Mr. Fox got a job in the newspapers and they move from their old hole into a tree home, even though they are located near disreputable farmers.<br/><br/>My description makes the movie sound more interesting than it actually was. Where there should have been laughs and/or excitement, there are none. Everything is done in such a bland and blah way, even the puppets seemed like they were bored and wished they were somewhere else. Not for kids, adults, or anybody else, unless they need assistance in falling asleep."

","I used to love reading Roald Dahl's stories when I was a kid, so this stop motion version of one of his favourite works intrigued me. Also, I'd never seen a Wes Anderson film before, so I was eager to see what all the fuss was about surrounding this maverick director.<br/><br/>My feelings about FANTASTIC MR. FOX are mixed. There are many elements of the original story present and correct here, but at the same time the story has been muddled and become very Americanised. I don't mind the fact that the animals have American accents (George Clooney et al) but I hate the intrusive pop music that keeps playing on the soundtrack in order to evoke emotion - I always despise films that play this cheap trick.<br/><br/>The heart of the story - humans vs. animals - is a good one and there are a lot of funny and quirky moments, but other parts of the film left me cold. The characters of the young foxes are played by a couple of adult voice actors and the effect is a distinctly odd, and slightly creepy, one. Still, it's not all bad, and it's hard to dislike a film that utilises so much stop motion as this one does."

",""" Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a story about a fox, who, after giving up, he returns to robbery. But when the farmers, who he steals from, decide to kill him, he will try to outsmart them. A good and interesting movie, with a lots of humor and twists. The animals look realistic in their human-like style of life, with clothes, jobs and Community rules. Even the small roles are entertaining. However, I found the end a little too predictable, but, considering that it is an animated film, it is somehow expected. Nice touch to have famous actors to "" play"" the animals too, even though some of them were hard to ' recognize', but still, they gave a dramatic note to the film. So 6 out of 10, because it wasn't perfect but it was entertaining and funny."
"Stoh80","9","1","3","25 November 2012"," A vastly underrated quirky, funny, perhaps even slightly profound animated film
","Wes Anderson's very unorthodox take on Roald Dahl's classic Fantastic Mr. Fox really shows what animation can do. Here, fabled director Anderson, known for his hipster-esque style and dry humor, portrays the story of a fox who, going through a mid-life crisis, decides to get back into his old line of work and start stealing chickens again. Though the story is simple, the aesthetics and overall emotional appeal of the movie is astounding.<br/><br/>Some might scoff at motion-stop, but the animation really does fit well with the film. The world it is set in is charming and colorful, and the movement of the characters is realistic when it needs to be, and cartoonish when it doesn't. The whole barrage of stars that lent their voices for this film is pretty impressive—George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson. These actors portrayed their respective characters very well, making their lines sound natural and lifelike. From Davy Crockett to the Beach Boys, this film also features an eclectic, yet appropriate, range of songs.<br/><br/>I found Fantastic Mr. Fox most memorable for all of the little things. Every gesture, every facial expression, every under-the-breath comment from one of the characters adds to the film. In just about every scene you can find something interesting going on in the background, things you probably won't notice the first run through. The movie beckons you to pay close attention so you can truly get all of its emotional undertones and quirky character nuances. These little things may not ultimately contribute to the overall story of the movie, but that's not a bad thing. It's refreshing to see a movie that includes these unnecessary details that adds depth to the characters and environment (even if they are puppets!). In fact, I found these characters to be more lifelike and relatable than those in many live-action films. The chemistry between them is great, and even casual, seemingly unimportant conversations among these woodland creatures left me chuckling (""No you're not. You're disloyal.""). Though a dry and somewhat awkward comedy, it can also be touching or even profound at moments, making it a very enticing film indeed.<br/><br/>Though marketed as a children's movie, it is obvious that this film has something for people of all ages. For anyone a fan of Wes Anderson, Roald Dahl, or animation in general, I wholeheartedly recommend this vastly underrated film. Anderson is off on the right foot for this genre, making me await any animated film he hopefully comes out with next."

","Mr Fox is a fox and he acts as such. Stealing chickens and causing trouble for the three farmers that live close to him. The farmers soon decide that enough is enough and they are going to fight back. Anderson makes a pretty much perfect animated film. It has heart without the schmaltz, it has humour without immaturity, it has vocal talent without the overacting. Wes Anderson stays true to himself, covering his usual style and themes and filling the film with his style of humour. It's quirky and offbeat, without being irritating or pretentious. A lot of the delivery is fantastic and the script itself is simply sparkling with superiority. The animation was astonishing in it's complex simplicity. I love how Anderson used a slower frame rate to really make the animation obvious. Rather than being a distraction, it was captivating. I really can't wait to watch this again."
"RainDogJr","10","1","3","16 March 2012"," Street Fighting Fox; this is pure Wes Anderson ""melted gold""!
","I'm writing this after watching FANTASTIC MR. FOX for the, at least, fifth time. Also after reading for the very first time the book by Roald Dalh (I read it at a public library last Thursday – it's very short so I finished it in like an hour – really nice stuff for sure). So I guess you already realized that I'm a huge fan of this movie (and that I will be making some references to the book), but I still want to say this: it's not only one of my favorites from the mighty Wes Anderson but just ever, without a damn doubt. <br/><br/>I refer Anderson as ""mighty"" just because I have yet not to LOVE one of his films. And I really admire the fact that none of his six feature films (his seventh, MOONRISE KINGDOM, will open the Cannes festival!) feels like a ""minor work"". They do share a lot with each other (just like, for instance, Woody Allen films), but so far Anderson has created six very memorable pieces and each one really stand out by its own. FANTASTIC MR. FOX was certainly the most interesting and strange project as it was Anderson making an animated picture. <br/><br/>And the animation, I must say, is simply stunning. It's stop motion paradise, actually. Take for instance that scene of the fight between the characters of Mr. Fox (voice of George Clooney!) and the Rat (an unrecognizable Willem Dafoe). It's simply a lesson on stop-motion; I hate the word (due to its overuse) but I'll have to use it for this: creativity. They did such great work full of creativity in scenes like that fight. I cherish that stuff a lot. The character design is also quite the thing! It made me feel like a kid again since each time I saw the movie I was like ""I want the toys of all the characters!"" <br/><br/>FANTASTIC MR. FOX is as stop-motion paradise as film adaptation paradise. Since the very beginning this is PURE Anderson. It never feels as something strange having chapter titles and stuff because we are used to that with Anderson; just think in his THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS for that. So it's always clear in the tone that this is a Wes Anderson film, and let's not forget that here we also have the Rolling Stones! One of my favorites: ""Street Fighting Man""! <br/><br/>So with all of this one could think Roald Dahl's book share things with Anderson's bodywork. But now that I have read the book I know that this is also a lesson on how to make yours, in the best way possible, something previously released; this is film adaptation paradise, like I said. For instance, the book is for kids and none of Anderson's films are, not even this one. For the record, I borrowed my DVD of FANTASTIC MR. FOX to the seven or six-year-old nephew of my girlfriend, thinking he was going to enjoy it. He just said that it was ""weird"". And I really can't blame him. Actually, just put the word ""wonderfully"" before ""weird"" and you have exactly what this film is. <br/><br/>Anderson not only added things to the history from the book -a very simple and ironic story about foxes being smarter than some horrible humans- but also gave to the characters, with those additions, similarities with his very own characters. If Mr. Fox is like a superhero that everybody admires in the book, here there's much more going on around him. I remember thinking during my very first viewing in Clooney's very own character from O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? while seeing the personality of Mr. Fox (then voice acting of Clooney is a real success), and I also recall the character Dignan from BOTTLE ROCKET thanks to him! <br/><br/>And a character that doesn't appear in the book, Mr. Fox's son Ash (voiced by Jason ""Max Fischer himself"" Schwartzman), is like the quintessential Wes Anderson character: a small fellow who suffers from being *different* (and who's jealous of his more athletic and attractive cousin Kristofferson – a complete new character as well). So I think, is what filmmakers must do when adapting a book or whatever: remain faithful to the main story but at the same time own the damn thing. Anderson's first adapted film is a true winner, and made of him a much richer filmmaker; it's simply pure ""melted gold""!"

You truly get an inner energy while watching. The movie is cute, funny and really has a great story. Plus there are little things that happen that make this film more original. The script has many parts when the actor should swear. But instead of swearing, they say the word cuss. So it would be something like this. ""What the cuss do you think you are doing?""

The sum of morals exposed in this movie are just too many for me to write about here, however what I can say is that they are delivered seamlessly. The art direction is one that cannot fail, from my point of view. Stop motion has always been something that fascinated me, ever since I first saw ""A nightmare before Christmas"", but that's just me. The acting is well-done and deliver, without being grating.

The Fantastic Mr. Fox goes from common chicken thief to journalist. This is actually funnier than you may think. It is a blend of sophistication with old school story telling. Local farmers are tired of their chicken houses being raided...and yes they have a real good idea of who is causing their grief. Mr. Fox goes into survival mode and must outwit the chicken farmers and doing so saves a whole community. Mr. Fox is fantastic and a hero.

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a brilliant animation film with a charming ""retro"" animation, a fascinating screenplay and sparkling voice acting from the whole cast (the members who stand out are, by my point of view, George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Bill Murray).<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox is based on a book written by Roald Dahl (1916-1990), one of the few authors who have enjoyed quite a luck with the film adaptations from their books.Movies such as The Witches, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) respected on a big degree Dahl's unusual tone of prose, oriented to children but never condescending or simpleton.Fantastic Mr. Fox is an addition to that honourable group thanks to the irreverent humor co-screenwriters Wes Anderson (who was also the director) and Noah Baumbach brought to the screenplay, stylishly merging the adventure destined to the childish spectators with commentaries on adult subjects.<br/><br/>The first thing which strikes in Fantastic Mr. Fox is the rudimentary style of ""stop motion"" animation employed to bring the characters to life.This old technique has been replaced in the two last decades by the more efficient digital animation, but even the few movies which are still made with ""stop motion"" (such as Coraline or The Corpse Bride) show a perfect manufacture which is mistake-free and polished to the point of sterility.On the contrary, Anderson and the effects supervisor Tim Ledbury chose a more simple and organic system which stresses the craft value of that discipline, and it makes the ""mistakes"" (such as the characteristic ""rippling"" which is noted on the models as a consequence of its manipulation during the animation by hand) to take part into its charm and personality.And the same applies to the ingenious models which work as scenarios and backgrounds, which are full of funny details which do not obstruct their work of creating an imaginative and consistent set.<br/><br/>However, Fantastic Mr. Fox offers much more than attractive images.Its screenplay is surprisingly mature for a family film, and even though its characters are anthropomorphic animals, they are not used as excuse to reduce the level of the narrative.On the contrary, the adventures of Mr. Fox are exciting and very entertaining, but what I mostly liked was the dynamic with its wife and son, as well as its interaction with friends, enemies and the rest of the community.The result is an absolutely fascinating film experience.<br/><br/>The only fail I found on this movie is that a few elements from the screenplay are not very well polished.But that minor fail did not avoid me from enjoying Fantastic Mr. Fox very much.I totally recommend it, because even if we ignore its multiple levels of narrative deepness, we basically have an hilarious comedy with nice characters, brilliant dialogs and a hugely entertaining screenplay.We really need more animation movies like this one."

They're never completely happy, because they never know exactly what it is that will make them happy, a conundrum supremely identifiable for his audiences. But what might feel like tedious existential angst in the hands of some colder and more cerebral director never does with Anderson, because he fills his movies with warmth and wit.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is beautiful to look at and has terrific voice work from big stars like George Clooney and Meryl Streep.

He's a man who seems not to be able to do a superficial film, and each character he creates has infinite depth and wisdom and seems much more human than any, um, Jerry Bruckheimer could come up with (even though his films ARE good, too).<br/><br/>Whatever. The point is that Wes Anderson has surprised me beyond limits. Here is one of the masters of dramatic, depressing comedies taking a book written by Roald Dahl (one of the most whimsical and best-selling children's' novelist) and making it into a stop-motion animated film for the entire family. Impossible, you say? I used to say that too, but after watching the end result, I can declare that Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" won't disappoint any adult or child this year.<br/><br/>Most of you already know the sinopsis of Dahl's book, but in a nutshell, the film is about Mr. Fox, Mrs. Fox and their son Ash who live a somewhat poor but content life in their burrow. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) used to be a chicken thief in his day, but after meeting Mrs. Fox and putting her in danger after discovering she's pregnant, he vows to stop the adrenaline-packed life of a chicken thief and becomes instead a columnist for a newspaper few people read. Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) seems to be okay with this, but Mr. Fox is going through heavy existential problems where his spirit is at unrest and where his animal instincts overpower him. Ash (Jason Schwartzman), their son, is a depressed and sour young fox who begs for society's attention but is usually overlooked or ignored because, let''s face it, he's unimpressive.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox buys a beautiful, large tree from his real estate agent against the legal advice of his Badger attorney (Bill Murray), and it all seems ideal at first, but Mr. Fox is very much aware that his neighbors are none others than Bogis, Bunce and Bean, the three meanest farmers around...and also the wealthiest and the ones who farm and harvest the best chicken, turkeys and apples respectively. His instincts kick in, he begins stealing again, and soon finds himself in a heap-load of trouble. But, as the title of the film aptly highlights the word 'fantastic', this is no ordinary fox! Yes, it's a children's' story, and yes, it's a fable, but as much as it's fantastic and preposterous it's profound and intelligent. Obviously, Anderson has taken the artistic liberty of adapting the story as freely as his imagination (and his PG-restrained rating) will let him. He's omitted a character or two, he's added about seven more, he's stretched the story to include many more plot twists and he's given each character a roundness and a credibility that you'd never imagine seeing in a fox, a badger, a mole, or their likes. As in previous films, Anderson deals with topics such as existentialism, nature vs. nurture, not fitting in, dysfunctional families, excess of envy and, most of all, repressed emotion which will eventually explode in sudden bouts of depressing anger; yeah, definitely NOT topics for children...but how can I put it? Anderson has managed to tone himself down without reducing a smidgen of depth to a point where the film is adequate enough for children and marvelously moving for adults. Tell me, how many other filmmakers can do this? The dialogue is pitch-perfect, as always. The cinematography is grandiose and frames not characters per se, but entire settings; it makes the viewer feel like a voyeur including him or herself into these animals' life instead of simply an audience at a movie theater. Camera positions, cuts and dolleys add comedy to the events going on screen, and the sublimely country-ish score by Alexandre Desplat make this the perfectly-ambienced film.<br/><br/>There are scenes of raw, heart-wrenching emotion: notice a scene where Mr. Fox fights with Rat during their second encounter, or the scene where Mr. Fox gives a toast at a supermarket; these scenes take your breath away and launch your brains into a cataclysm of thoughts and opinions about a wide array of topics. Notice other scenes, like the one where Ash is working at his chemistry school lab or where Ash and his cousin Kristofferson watch a train set in their room; these are incredibly hilarious, and speak of genius in each second of them. I think that, with the obvious superiority of Disney/Pixar's ""Up"", ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the second best family film of the year.<br/><br/>See it! And have your children see it too. Films don't get any more rewarding than this! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!"

","For those who've grown just a wee bit tired of all those ""family-friendly"" animated features we've been inundated with over the years, I commend to you ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" Wes Anderson's sly little creation that, for once, is aimed less at the kids in the audience than at the adults. Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no ""Fritz the Cat,"" and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic ""cuss"" - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.<br/><br/>Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that? But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.<br/><br/>Like Anderson's live-action works, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.<br/><br/>It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time."

","To call Fantastic Mr.Fox a children's movie is a disservice to the film. This is just as adult as most of Wes Anderson's R rated features, in the sense of the maturity of the plot and character development. The only thing missing from the movie is profanity, which isn't even really that extreme in any of his movies anyway. <br/><br/>Mr.Anderson seems to have an obsession with amateur criminals, and this is also prevalent in Fantastic Mr.Fox. Bottle Rocket was the defining movie for a group of idiots trying to be criminals, but even in The Life Aquatic you see the clumsy theft of the sea lab and the ridiculous rescue attempt. In Fantastic Mr.Fox, most of the crimes go fairly well until the consequences are made evident. Ash's attempt to free Kristofferson was an incredibly memorable scene in this movie because of the unprofessionalism that it presented. <br/><br/>What was great in this movie was that the characters were so real that you almost forgot they were animals. My only complaint about the film is that a lot of kids will see it and feel confused and possibly not entertained due to the dry humor that it uses. This was a major bonus for me, as I am a huge fan of dry humor, but children may not understand and a lot of adults don't find it funny."
"d_art","8","1","3","23 February 2010"," 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is cleverly executed
","Based on Roald Dahl's children's novel of the same name, Fantastic Mr. Fox is about a thieving fox named Mr. Fox. Once he finds out his wife is pregnant, he sheds his thieving ways, raises a family and becomes a journalist. However, his old habits don't remain dormant for long and he starts to steal chickens, ducks, turkeys, and cider each night from three mean and wealthy farmers--Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Fed up, the farmers decide to try to ambush him with whatever means possible, which causes a lot of grief for his family and friends.<br/><br/>Directed and written (based on Dahl's novel) by Wes Anderson (Rushmore), Mr. Fox has been created in the old school tradition of stop motion animation. While the creatures may not look slick and perfect like CG, they have an infectious charm of looking handcrafted, cuddly, and solid. Their facial expressions and their movements have subtleties that give a human touch you don't get with CG.<br/><br/>When I was in elementary school, I recall a time when the teacher read us the book. I remember the story being not too complicated. It did, however, make me want to try apple cider—I loved the way the author described it. Here, the plot, dialogue, and characters have been expanded to create a satiric story full of ironic touches, extra details, and modernized. These details really set the mood. The animals are all fully dressed and talk like adults, about their family issues, mortgages, and life decisions. Mr. Fox's family includes his wife Mrs. Fox, his son Ash, and his overachieving nephew, Kristofferson. The family dynamics are fun and almost sitcom-like. I suppose they could have their own TV show. The animal neighbors of Mr. Fox are equally human in their behavior, with a dash of erratic animal wildness thrown in.<br/><br/>The three farmers play the bad guys, and while most humans aren't portrayed as complex as the animals, the meaner characters are presented with flourish. Mr. Bean (I think that was the farmer's name), the leader of the farmers, is lean, sinister-looking, covered in shadows, has a pistol in hand and eerily-lit cigarette lighting his face. The music also plays an integral part in creating various moods of the film, including a zany musical number involving banjos, and occasional retro-style soulful vocals. There are also moments that parody other films, such as West Side Story.<br/><br/>Anderson's dialogue is clever, and Mr. Fox is quite the spitfire with words. I bet some kids will find the wordiness a little boring (although amusing for us adults). Nevertheless, it is a fun film, something's always happening, and there's plenty of breezy action. It's definitely a lot lighthearted than Where The Wild Things Are (a fine, analytical film, if not particularly focused for the kids). For those who are purists of the source material, they may find this film a little too smug and Mr. Fox too aware of himself for his own good.<br/><br/>George Clooney in the voice of Mr. Fox is a perfect fit—in fact, the role must've been tailor-fit for him. One can't imagine anyone else playing Mr. Fox. Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox and Bill Murray as Badger are fun, and Willem Dafoe as Rat (a villain role) is hilarious. Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fun film that is cleverly written and executed, helped by George Clooney's star power and delivery. For some, it may seem like Mr. Fox is constantly winking at the audience, but even those who may not love the film will still find many things to like about it. I give this film *** out of **** stars.<br/><br/>You can see more of my review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art"
"Ampero","10","1","3","28 January 2010"," Wonderful Surprise!!
","With Wes Anderson at the helm of Director, George Clooney finds himself in yet another snatch-and-run thief caper. Only this time you'll find yourself wanting to re-watch scenes and the entire movie over and over again. Stop-motion animation will always have a soft spot in my heart for nostalgic and technical reasons. I always want to see how far they would go and they always remind me of being dazzled by them as a kid. This movie delivers in much more ways than taking you back. Filled with endless quotes and humour that will make even the most robotic viewer bubble-over.<br/><br/>I Like Wes Anderson's movies, they always come from a different angle with what the core story is and they always have a unique human element that you can both see yourself in and appreciate. Based on a story from Roald Dahl, we join up with Mr. Fox who is prompted to change his line of work as a poultry thief when his wife, Mrs. Fox, gets pregnant. The world is very detailed and feels very familiar as all the animals interact in an almost seamless human way whilst not abandoning their animal nature. The voice talent casting is superb as all the animals seem justly matched and equally theatrical. The story is very engaging from its start but gets even more-so when Mr. Fox, bored with being and overlooked newspaper columnist decides to don bandit hats with his possum friend, Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky), for one last big job â€“ stealing goods from the three biggest farmers in the nearby town, Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). This plan, and its success, triggers the three farmers to deal with their fox friend and his family, therein putting all the wood lawn animals under siege and prompting Mr. Fox to be as fantastic as he can to rescue all the animals and get the farmers off of his back. With juggling all of this, Mr. Fox also finds himself at ends in his marriage and we get some Meryl Streep (Mrs. Fox) goodness, which is always sweet. Some fun arcs keep the fluidity of the movie both digestible and add an appreciation to the supporting characters, so much so that it makes you feel that no animal was 'just there'. For example- there is Mr. Fox's son, Ash, who tries his best to prove to his parents that he's not 'different' and has his father's athletic abilities with his efforts getting challenged by the likes of his subtle, thunder-stealing cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson).<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I didn't know what to expect. It delivers in so many ways from the beautifully illustrated environment,<br/><br/>the nuances of each animal and their respective voice actor, the humorous dialogue, the story and the surprise depth of the highlighted characters. It feels like the cast and the production crew had fun with making this movie and viewers always benefit when that happens since glee is contagious. When you realize how painstaking it must've been to add life and unique style to all the characters and make the movie not-feel-like-a-stop-motion-movie for the viewer, the whole mood gets even more relaxed and enjoyable.<br/><br/>George Clooney shines in his role as he brings enough cockiness and confidence to Mr. Fox as you'd expect from his stint as Danny Ocean. Wes Anderson doesn't abandon his favourite call guys either; Bill Murray and Owen Wilson both have fitting parts. Another great feature is how Wes blends the movie to appeal to both adults and kids. Its accessible world is engaging enough for the young and the wit in the dialogue is very rewarding for the adults, no one is alienated. Giving the villains the British grit adds another layer to it, especially when you remember Michael Gambon's role in Layer Cake.<br/><br/>If there's any way you can organize a group of friends to watch this gem, do so, they will be very thankful for it and the flurry of inside jokes your group would gain is priceless.<br/><br/>Standout Line: ""He gets a bandit hat? He just got here and he got a bandit hat? Where's my Bandit hat? Why didn't I get shot at!?"""
"Polaris_DiB","7","1","3","14 January 2010"," Anderson World realized to its utter fantasia pinnacle.
","It is said that animation is the most pure way of controlling every element of a movie production, and nowhere is this proved more than in Wes Anderson's The Fantastic Mr. Fox. Viewers familiar with Wes Anderson's world (a self-defined and hermetically closed off alternate reality that remains consistent with each passing movie) are going to find themselves right at home--so much so that it's almost impossible to watch the film as anything other than warm homages to his own emotional topography. Quite literally: story? What story? We're in Wes Anderson Land, where the characters are quirky and the humor is almost always understated.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep Bill Murray Jason Schwartzmann Willem Dafoe Owen Wilson is blah blah blah. You recognize the voices and you especially recognize them from previous Anderson films. The music. Warm-hearted childhood narration with darker undertones. Okay now that we've gotten the basics covered, what's new? THE ANIMATION! Holy cuss but it's pretty! It has the same movement and feeling of the Brothers Quay and Jan Svankmajer, without, you know, the utter disturbing darkness and phantasmagoric splendor. Anderson always loves blocking his shots, as in not only deciding how the action should be blocked but literally putting everything on lateral rectilinear spaces, and the childhood shoe-box diorama feel of this thing is absolutely perfect for his vision. The movement only gets weird when the action gets fast, but otherwise it is hard not to get utterly involved with every little detail of this make-shift fantasia. This movie is at its best in close-up; people who get put off by the uncanny nature of stuffed animal eyes should probably stay home, everyone else will be drawn into them.<br/><br/>Is it fair to discuss this movie solely as an Anderson production without taking into account the demographic it is promoted to? Well unfortunately, I'm not reading much of a positive reaction in kids. I went to see this with my friend because she was babysitting a four and a half year old and neither he nor the children of his general age-group seemed very impressed by the goings-on. Certainly I wouldn't argue that every kid who sees this was or will be turned off by it, but the audience appreciation seemed to come from the adults more in response to the detail and how the movie was made over the story and the characters. The story itself is pretty basic, and the funniest lines of dialog seem to fly right over kids' heads. Like what was expected of Where the Wild Things Are, The Fantastic Mr. Fox is really a nostalgic homage for the 20-30 something crowd, but unlike Where the Wild Things Are it didn't actually end up being a cerebral rumination on childhood, playing instead to Anderson's greatest strength: mop-headed hipsters unapologetic about their inner child and ready to watch some Roald Dahl accompanied by the Beach Boys. Of which, luckily, I am a member, which means the movie made no beef with me.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"dobbin-4","9","1","3","6 January 2010"," Not Anderson's best, in my opinion, but certainly a very entertaining movie
","Fantastic Mr. Fox based off the classic story by Roald Dahl is a very abstract kids film done by legendary director Wes Anderson. This film by Anderson is aimed more at the family market (Which was expected to all those who have read or heard of the book) and it seems like he pulled it off. The movie is lined with a strong cast of acting professionals, ranging from starring roles (George Clooney, Merryl Streep) too supporting roles (Bill Murray) just to name a few. The movie sometimes goes out on a bit of a limb and while most of the time is funny and entertaining there are moments which are just plain annoying. The story, while not staying very true to the book, is executed moderately well by Anderson and although his style of directing may not fit as well into the family film market he certainly has made an entertaining film worth a watch. Overall I would give it a 7/10."

"griffolyon12","10","1","4","6 January 2010"," Fantastic as a Fox!
","Fantastic is the operative word in director Wes Anderson's adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic, Fantastic Mr. Fox. The film tells the story of Mr. Fox, who gave up his life of stealing chickens to settle down with his wife, Mrs. Fox, and start a family, but when Mr. Fox relapses into his criminal ways 12 fox-years later, everything just busts loose. What the cuss! <br/><br/>The film is a marvelous piece of stop-motion animation. Where as we all have seen stuff like Wallace and Grommet, and many have seen Nightmare Before Christmas, the stop-motion in this film is so much more clever, charming, and lovable as a form of artistic expression than any other example of the form. One moment in particular, Mr. and Mrs. Fox's conversation in front of the underground waterfall is simply breathtaking, but not only that, the design of the furry animals in the film are just so cute and adorable.<br/><br/>The animation is brought to life, thanks to the terrific voice-acting from the likes of George Clooney and Meryl Streep as Mr. and Mrs. Fox, but it is Jason Schwartzman that steals the show as their misunderstood son, Ash, who simply wants to be an athlete and win his dads approval. In many ways, the film is like all Wes Anderson films, in that it is all about family dynamics, except this time relaying those dynamics to the entire family community. You can't help but love to see Bill Murray's Badger get in an argument with George Clooney's Mr. Fox, and the great cousin rivaly between Ash and Kristofferson (Eric Anderson), is absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>While Wes Anderson has made many films, this one is his finest. It includes all of the stuff that I have always enjoyed about his works, such as the dynamic of the dysfunctional family, but it sheds itself of all that has held me back in his previous works; not to mention, his typical absurdities tend to work far better in the realm of fantastical animation than it does in live-action.<br/><br/>This really is a wonderful family film. It is easily accessible, and in many ways, it's like the old school Warner's cartoons that I used to watch when I was little, very slapstick, but also witty with fantastic dialogue. The film is fantastical in all respects, it never takes itself seriously, and that is why it works, cause even when it gets serious, Anderson pulls back and delivers some humor. When the credits roll on Fantastic Mr. Fox, you will have had such a good time at the movies, that you wont even realize how much time has passed and you will be dancing along with the characters.<br/><br/>I give Fantastic Mr. Fox a 10 out of 10!"

","Wes Anderson's stop-motion masterpiece 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is a brilliant, spirited and heartwarming movie that will dazzle you more than any other animated film.<br/><br/>The brilliant writer/director of great films such as 'Rushmore', 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'The Darjeeling Limited', Wes Anderson, comes with this groundbreaking adaptation of Roald Dahl's brilliant children's book. Now, with the help of amazing Noah Baumbach - writer of 'The Squid and the Whale' and 'Margot at the Wedding' - Anderson wrote a delightful screenplay that made me cry, laugh and cheer through the whole movie. But, let's remark this: this isn't the usual animated film; this deals with real life themes (OK, you may not steal chicken), and, most important, it deals with family relationships even more maturely than most non-family films, in a very funny, imaginative and lovely way.<br/><br/>The ensemble voice cast is one the most originally selected (although some of them are Anderson's usual) I've ever seen on films. And, each character has its, well, characteristics: George Clooney (as Mr. Fox) is a strongly passionate - and funny - voice. I cannot think of any other actor to play his role. And, Meryl Streep (as Ms. Fox) made a deliciously sly (and impressively smooth) voice work. Jason Schwartzman also did a fantastic work (as Ash, Mr. and Ms. Fox's son), he is very funny and heartwarming. Also, the rest of the cast (Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe) did an incredibly great work.<br/><br/>The photography is amazing, you know? Kind of Royal Tenenbaums-like cinematography. The editing was, also great. And, well, the usual typography in Anderson's movies.<br/><br/>Finally, Alexandre Desplat's fantastic score is the juicy cherry at the top of this delicious cake. Lovely, funny and tender. This is the best score of his career.<br/><br/>Verdict: A work of utter brilliance. Enjoyable, funny, heartwarming, full of funny scenes and intelligent dialogues. 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is the best picture of the year (and a strong contender for the Oscars). Fantastic Mr. Anderson does it again!<br/><br/>10/10"

When I found out further that it was to be an animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's book,'The Fantastic Mr.Fox',I was doing cerebral back flips. Wes Anderson directs a screen play written by Anderson & Noah Baumbach (The Squid & The Whale),based on the book by Roald Dahl (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory,James & The Giant Peach,etc.). The story concerns the afore mentioned Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney),who finds out from his life partner ,Mrs.Fox (Meryl Streep,last seen in 'Julie & Julia',and currently in 'It's Complicated') that she's expecting a fox pup,in a farmer's steel trap & promises if they get out,he would renounce his evil ways & make a nice life for both of them. Problem is,some years later,he gets the old itch to go out & kill chickens & steal food. In the tradition of the 'Oceans' series,he schemes one more heist from the local farmers. Problem is,one heist turns into another & another,until things get out of control. Besides George Clooney & Meryl Streep,the likes of Anderson regular,Jason Schwartzman,Bill Murray,Owen Wilson,as well as the likes of Michael Gambon,Willem Dafoe, & even Wes Anderson,himself, lend their voices to this fun little film that despite the wave of 3D-CGI animation,instead settles for old school stop motion animation (the same kind of animation used for Gumby,Wallace & Gromit,and others),which,although not the best stop motion animation I've seen,is still worth seeking out. Rated PG by the MPAA,this film serves up some occasionally harrowing action scenes,some suggested rude talk (the characters substitute the word ""curse"" for the real thing),and a bit of smoking & drinking by the humans in the story."
"doctorsmoothlove","7","1","4","23 December 2009"," Mr. Fox really is Fantastic
","I've noticed that ever since The Nightmare before Christmas was released in 1993, no entirely stop-motion or claymation film (intended for children) has received mostly negative reviews. This year there were two films of this type and each will probably be nominated for an Oscar. All of these projects span multiple years and each leaves a unique legacy. Coraline, the other stop-motion film this year, was the first to be filmed entirely in 3-D. Even though nearly two decades have passed, directors can still focus on one aspect of the production at the sake of the others. Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox is the first of its type to be dialog-heavy.<br/><br/>Anderson is as much an auteur as Burton and likewise indulges himself too much. At times, the cast of this film could be transplanted to The Royal Tenenbaums. His formula has proved itself over three films now as financially viable and clever enough to attract a sizable home audience. I won't discredit him yet, but none of his movies have left me with a lasting satisfaction. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a sumptuous candy bar of a movie. One to cherish while partaking but unfortunately one that aggravates if too much is ingested.<br/><br/>The story begins with Mr. Fox's maudlin recollection of his previously thrilling life. He has been reduced to living in a bloody hole and working as a journalist. He longs to return to his days as a chicken thief and live a more prestigious life. The family reluctantly agrees with his suggestion that they move into a tree, and Mr. Fox begins reliving his past. The targets of his nightly visits are three disgruntled but largely incompetent farmers who vow revenge. The three stooges surround and destroy the Fox residence, but forgot that foxes can dig. As the family flees underground, they encounter their neighbors who have been disturbed by the explosion. After confronting the three farmers in a comedic war, the animals settle in the sewers and live off of grocery wares owned by the three farmers.<br/><br/>Anderson couldn't have picked a better voice actor for Mr. Fox. George Clooney's refined masculinity imbues the character with larger than life personality. No matter the situation, Mr. Fox seems to deliver a debonair speech, a timely response, or a pithy comeback. Even other characters acknowledge his superiority by attempting to mimic his mannerisms and catch phrases. I really like how Anderson didn't feel restrained by this literary requirement. Instead, he plays it for many chuckles. Mr. Fox, being the better-than-you person he is, can notice his nephew's talent at thievery is clearly higher than his son's and takes him on missions. The conflict Mr. Fox faces is the reality that he really is fantastic but no one else is. He has to live with his own smugness while still appearing sincere. By the concluding segment, I think Mr. Fox has finally learned at least a pretend humility only hindered by his uncanny ability to get stuff done.<br/><br/>2009 has been such as strong year for animated films that I can say that any of the big five potential nominees, including this one, could win without my complaint. Still, I think Fantastic Mr. Fox is the dark horse. The film is marketed as a children's picture but is more suited to adults. Don't hesitate to bring your children to see it. They may relate to Mr. Fox's son's inability to view himself worthy as his father's son or at least enjoy the still unusual animation."
"Quebec_Dragon","8","1","4","16 December 2009"," Delightfully fun Mr. Fox
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is an adaptation of a somewhat famous children's book by writer Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was originally written by him). I cannot really say if it's faithful or not (apparently not very much) nor can I say how much it compares to director Wes Anderson's other works (my fan friend says you have lots of his signature touches). However, I can say that it's likely adults will enjoy it more than kids. This is a completely stop-motion picture instead of the more ubiquitous 3d computer graphics showcase. It has a certain retro vibe to it and although it's charming, often funny, you shouldn't expect the animation quality and smoothness of Nightmare Before Christmas or Coraline. The jerkiness is especially noticeable when the animals are dancing. However, the faces and the (constantly moving) fur are especially well done. Actually, I suspect the many close-up shots were used to save on the animation costs of animating the whole puppet. Most importantly, the whole movie using real puppets, props and decors has a solid ""realness"" quality to it often absent from 3d graphics. <br/><br/>Enough about that. How's the story ? Quite delightful and entertaining with personable characters and bundles of dry and awkward humor that actually works. The running gag of the opossum making swirly eyes when he gets confused never gets old. I also enjoyed variations on the word cuss used profusely instead of the famous f word. The voice acting is top-notch and George Clooney is a perfect fit for the suave and charismatic Mr. Fox. You'll notice his voice but you won't notice most of the other famous voices unless you're a big Wes Anderson fan. The dialogue is very fine and the choice of music is surprising, appropriate and good. Fantastic Mr. Fox is pretty fantastic and because of the way it was made and looks, this might age quite well and become a future classic. Whatever you do, don't let the fact that it's supposed to be a ""kid's movie"" deter you from watching it. For interested parents, it's not overtly violent although there's poultry killing (heard, not shown) and beyond the amusing antics, it even has some morale (but doesn't hit you over the head with it). <br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"

"howard.schumann","9","1","5","29 November 2009"," About the value of community and family
","Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson's retro stop-motion animated version of the classic Roald Dahl novel, tells the story of the charming rogue, Mr. Fox who, through a series of adventures and misadventures, learns the value of community and family. It is a hard lesson to learn, however, and eliminating larceny from his life may be too big a stretch for Mr. Fox who, after all, tells his wife that he poaches poultry ''because I'm a wild animal."" George Clooney is the silky smooth voice coming from Mr. Fox's mouth while Meryl Streep voices the role of Mrs. Fox. Both Clooney and Streep seem completely at home in their roles, giving the movie even more bounce and joie de vivre.<br/><br/>Anderson, working with co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach, connects with Dahl's sensibility but expands on the story, bringing in diversions such as the game of ""whack-bat"" and a Tennenbaum-like helping of family dysfunction. The main idea of the book remains, however, that once we are sure of who we are, we have the strength to take on even the most determined adversaries, for example, ""three of the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers"" in the world. When a young Mr. Fox learns that his wife is pregnant, he makes a promise to stop his life of chicken thievery and turn into an honest man - 'er fox. Fast forward two years and the reformed Mr. Fox is now a newspaper columnist and has even changed his clothes from dapper to casual. <br/><br/>He also has a son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman) whom he considers to be slightly weird because he wears a superhero cape. Looking into the possibility of buying a new home inside a beech tree that has lots of shade, he is told by his lawyer, Badger (Bill Murray) to stay far away because that tree is too close to the property of three mean farmers: Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and, the nastiest of them all, Bean (Michael Gambon). Ignoring the advice of his lawyer, Mr. Fox not only moves into his new digs but plans one last bit of thievery to show the gleesome threesome who is boss. <br/><br/>He brings back his old partner Kylie the opossum (Wally Wolodarsky) to aid in the crime but things become complicated when his athletic cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) comes to stay with the family and catches Fox's attention. Needless to say, the mature Kristofferson who also does yoga and meditation makes Ash jealous who, like most teenagers, is somewhat insecure and eager to please his dad. Fox brings the whole family together, however, to try and defeat the mean farmers in a three-part plan to steal chickens, turkeys, and spiked apple cider, taking them underground, through tunnels, and up into the streets.<br/><br/>A bit too quirky and snappy for younger children, Fantastic Mr. Fox is more likely to appeal to teenagers with its eclectic soundtrack that includes Burl Ives, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and the Bobby Fuller Four. Anderson seems to have had a lot of fun in making the film and it shows. With the 70s style costumes and animation technique, the feeling is of watching real characters in motion rather than being drowned in a sea of graphics. Ultimately, the story is what is most important anyway, and here a subversive Dahl novel is enhanced by the even more subversive Anderson, advising us that whether we are four-legged or two-legged, we should rejoice in the knowledge of how unique we truly are."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes being creative and clever just isn't enough. Writer/director Wes Anderson has a track record of extremely creative projects. Some work very well (Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore) while others fall just short of the mark (Life Aquatic, Darjeeling Limited). When Mr. Anderson hooks up with writer Noah Baumbach (Squid and the Whale) to take on a Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) story, a movie lover can't help but get very excited! <br/><br/>The look of the film is very unusual and ""fantastic"" in its own right. The fur or coats of the animals is pretty amazing and even the expressive faces are new to the big screen. What really fell short for me was the voice acting of some very impressive folks. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray all fall a bit flat and just play it too cool ... dare I say it ... they were all a bit boring! Willem Dafoe as the rat was really the only one who brought any life to his role.<br/><br/>So while I absolutely love the look of the film and the characters, I was quite disappointed in the pace and passion of the story and the manner in which it's acted. It is probably too slow for both kids and adults, so I am not sure who the audience will be ... other than film technicians who will appreciate the look."

","Wes Anderson stories are always intricate tapestries and I must say that in this method of filming (animation) his imagination truly has a chance to shine.<br/><br/>In some aspects it reminds me of the Royal Tannenbaums - a family breaking apart due to a maverick father and a strong mother trying to keep it all together. The members family test each other in trying times and find redemption in the end, though that is where the similarities end. <br/><br/>The cinematography is rich and colourful, very Wes Andersonish (whatever that means). I left the theatre feeling content and reflective. I have been a little bit disappointed with some of his latest work with the Lift Aquatic and the Darjeeling Limited but he fully redeems himself here. Definitely worth the viewing.

","Quick demographic (to let you know if you will relate to my review). I am in my early 30s, and my wife is in her late 20s. We are the parents of a typical 10 year old boy and a typical 7 year old girl (and a 2 month old baby, but he doesn't exactly watch movies at this point haha). We are all fairly well educated, but not excessively literary or critical. We watch plenty of movies, but we also miss lots of movies.<br/><br/>Okay, we really really liked this movie. At first, I was worried because it seemed a little strange in the first few minutes. I was concerned about the animation, and the colors. I have never read any book related to this story, so I went with pretty much no other expectations. The movie is excellent. The character development is fantastic, the voices and voice acting were spectacularly done. The animation was really pleasant, and their funny little touches and attention to detail really make this an excellent movie.<br/><br/>My kids also really enjoyed the show. There was plenty of humor, and true-to-life situational humor to keep you chuckling almost all the way through the show. But at the same time, you really find yourself liking the characters, even the bad guys.<br/><br/>In a way, I feel that the show picked up on a lot of that which was good in early cartoons (like Bugs Bunny or Wile E Coyote), but in a modern, highly entertaining way. Not that this movie resembles those cartoons at all, because it doesn't ... just that there is an element to the humor that was used in those old shows that seems to be missing in most of the cartoons these days.<br/><br/>We all enjoyed this movie, and ARE recommending it to everyone we know."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great film. I wasn't sure about the film after seeing the trailers, but since trailers for Pixar films don't really get me that excited, I knew better than to let the trailer to scare me off. Glad I went to see it. It was touching, heart-warming, thrilling and, importantly, very funny. The other people in the theater with me were laughing at several of the jokes with me. The technical work and cinematography was great as well. The characters looked more realistic than most of the CG stuff I've seen (If the next words out of your mouth is ""No ****, Sherlock, it's real figures being photographed"" I don't blame you, I'm just saying, it's great. If the next words out of your mouth is ""No cuss, Sherlock, it's real figures being photographed"" you saw the film and you're a fan after my own heart). The fur was surprisingly well done. I expected the fur to go crazy like the 1933 Kong, but it was never distracting like Kong's fur. I highly recommend you going to see this film. Wes Anderson and his crew did an excellent job. They must've been under the impression they were working with Pixar :)."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I am going to let him off easy. I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. The characters are good, also. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox (George Clooney)'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially engaging. The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. I'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment."

The farmers decide to unite and put an end to the culprit once and for all which endangers the fox's family and friends. At this point the fox's natural instinct for survival kicks in and he cleverly sets out a plan to save his loved ones. This movie is clever, witty, quirky, heartwarming and insightful. It contains all of Anderson's idiosyncrasies. I believe Anderson is asking why do we act on some of our natural human instincts? Why can't we resist and be willing to change?

Everything is stop motion, from the smoke to the water; you would never notice. It is all of the small details that happen simultaneously that make it feel so real.

","Wes Anderson and Roald Dahl meet in the middle for this eccentric, free-spirited interpretation of an early 1970s short story. I'll admit to not being a fan the first time I saw this, years ago, but upon a second viewing (now a parent, watching it with my kids) I can better appreciate it. As I've become more familiar with Mr. Dahl since that time, I found the author's calling cards more obvious, a close match for the director's idiosyncratic directing style and obsessive attention to detail.<br/><br/>Stuffed with small character moments and a warm, soft pace, it operates with an unusual cadence that takes time and effort to accept. The voice acting is star-studded and mostly effective, particularly George Clooney's turn as the smooth-talking lead with a taste for one last heist, though the actors do often get caught up by the constant long-winded, dry, breathless dialog. Many supporting players sound positively bored by that process. The animation fits the tone quite well, using stop-motion puppets that closely resemble a set of well-loved kids' toys, and that helps give the screen a familiar, welcoming atmosphere. Like walking through the door to your old childhood bedroom, twenty years on. It's a worthwhile alternative to today's louder, flashier fare."

Until around the time Wes Anderson starts adding up his ""fantastic"" ideas to the original story from the book (which is around the time when the animals start digging in the middle of the picture). There are also some major changes even from the get go, but that first half is really something both enjoyable and clever. But then this out of ordinary and interesting stop motion picture goes down the drain, turning into yet another boring and somewhat stupid animation; with a climax (of this stupidity) in a form of jumping a fence on a motorcycle, by using a ramp that was placed there apparently for no logical reason. Yeah, let us just turn this movie into shallow action comedy<br/><br/>After witnessing that jump scene, no sane film enthusiast should dare to speak of this cinematic endeavor in terms of having a proper script.

","To begin, I was a big fan of Roald Dahl as a kid, but this was his worst book by far. It was a dull simple bare bones story but the makers of this film really added the meat and interest to the plot. The characters were given unique personalities that were un-expounded upon in Dahl's book and extra events were added so that it could be made into a full feature. The writers definitely made this into an engaging story. From the beginning it was evident that Wes Anderson had a hand in making this (which was good in this instance) from the vintage artsy style to the panning cutaway room camera shots to his reoccurring all star cast. Stop motion has always fascinated me and the detail and quality of this work was incredible with only a few small hiccups when it came to the additional challenge of fur. The movie was all around funny, quirky, had enjoyable creative ticks, and pleasurable music. Only a few complaints remain in the end: that wolf scene made no sense and I hate cheesy dancing scenes at the end of movies that they typically include in kids movies or Bollywood Films. I find them utterly ridiculous, but even with that this is a gem of a film that achieves the rare accomplishment of outshining the book from which it originated."

","So it turns out that Wes Anderson's unique rhythm and wry sense of humour is a natural fit for stop-motion animation. Indeed, after a few minutes you mostly forget you're watching an animated movie as there's little difference between this and Anderson's other films. His signatures are very much at home here and really feel alive in this new environment.<br/><br/>It's quite refreshing to watch an animated film that doesn't rely on puns and slapstick humour. The characters are interesting and the tone was so low key that even the more ridiculous elements have a soft landing. It's a children's movie where actions have consequences while also featuring better heist planning than Ocean's Eleven. Remarkable.<br/><br/>As film scores can make or break an animated film, it was critical for first-time Anderson collaborator Alexandre Desplat to not only deliver a quality animated score, but to reconcile that with Anderson's style. Desplat manages to do both and, not surprisingly, went on to work with Anderson on Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel.<br/><br/>In the end, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not so much a movie that makes you feel like a kid again as it is a children's movie that's grown up. But in many ways, as a reluctant adult, that suits me better."
"nevenmazic","9","0","1","4 November 2013"," A great movie with great acting, beautiful animation and, of course, Wes Anderson's brilliance.
","What differs Anderson's movies and non-Anderson's movies is a specific style of portraying characters and scenes. In Fantastic Mr. Fox Anderson does it brilliantly, yet again. The devil is in the details, how exactly one character says a line, with what intonation, what level of volume, what pronunciation of certain words, all of these are parameters which influence a speaking scene in Anderson's movies. What's especially refreshing is seeing all those elements put together in an animated movie. Animation is really well done and the scenes are beautiful. The story is interesting, fun and plausible if you suspend some belief which lowered movie's grade by one point in my review. So if you're looking for a movie with brilliant acting, pretty scenes, good music, family themes and laid back atmosphere, look no further."

","Based on the famous book by Roald Dahl with the same name, the story narrates the life of Mr. Fox (Clooney) who lives life by raiding nearby farms. When he learns of his wife's pregnancy, he decides to quit his hobby in favour of the family and their to-be child. Two years later (Twelve in fox years) Mr. Fox, Mrs. Fox (Streep) and their son Ash (Schwartzman) move to a new hole under a tree which is close to the fields of three farmers; Boggis (Hurlstone), Bunce (Guiness) and Bean (Gambon). When Ash's cousin Kristofferson (Anderson) comes over to stay over the weekend, Ash feels insecure when everyone praises him and his capabilities over Ash. With Mr. Fox feeding his family with his nightly jaunts, the farmers are tired of the thefts and decide they need to get rid of Mr.Fox once and for all. The movie is made in stop-motion animation technology which gives it a good childish look and feel. Roald Dahl wrote books for children and the movie too aims to target the same segment with the movie. However, in spite of the movie being made for a younger audience the movie can still be very entertaining to the mature mind too. It is a great wholesome entertainer that people of all ages would enjoy. This is what you call a well-rounded entertaining movie."

","I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie, and I've always been weary of claymation so I didn't actually think I would love this movie as much as I did. It was pretty spectacular and seriously underrated! George Clooney's iconic voice lends much personality to his character even when he was being a bit monochromatic or sarcastic. There are scenes in this movie that are still at the top of my favorites list and whenever I get a chance I try to show this movie to as many people as I can. This movie is mainly for adults rather than children, but I'm guessing children could be entertained by it too. I loved the way they skirted around swearing by coming up with a unique way to do it and my friends and I love quoting it around kids and parents, who aren't sure what to make of it when it happens. There is a particular scene where a farmer loses his temper and to this day it makes me fall out of my chair laughing. The wolf at the very end almost makes me lose it too. I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for animated movie that is more suitable for adults, you'll be pleasantly surprised!"

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a really good animated feature, that despite its critical praise, is vastly underrated. I use this term because it made next to nothing at the box office and the audience have not been giving this movie the greatest reviews. But, this is what a Wes Anderson movie should be. A quirky tale with above-average storytelling.<br/><br/>This is about a fox who goes back to his old ways and steals things from three angry, older men. These dastardly men now go for revenge against Mr. Fox, his family, and all his other animal friends.<br/><br/>The voice casting works just fine. I recognized great talent such as Clooney, Streep, Murray, Wilson, and Gambon. Also, Wes Anderson's directing is solid and he stays true to the source material even though he obviously added some content.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great, underrated animated film. Studios should make more stop-motion films in the future. I rate this film 9/10."
"StevePulaski","8","0","3","27 June 2012"," We continue to care for the foxes in this film, even when they do get into deep cuss
","I always thought it was a delight to see a director step out of their comfort zone and direct a film they usually don't touch. Kevin Smith did with Red State, Martin Scorsese does it every film, but one of his most noticeable was Hugo, and now, Wes Anderson takes his indelible quirkiness and injects it into the pleasant animated film, Fantastic Mr. Fox.<br/><br/>I hope everyone at some point read a book by Roald Dahl, whether it was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, this, James and the Giant Peach, or The Witches. It seems almost all children were acquainted with his books at one point or another. Authors like that become etched into school curriculum. Joining Dahl can be the late Maurice Sendak, Beverly Clearly, or perhaps, for elementary-schoolers, the author of Holes and the Wayside series, Louis Sachar.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox presents us with the story of Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney), his wife, Felicity (Meryl Streep), and their twelve-year-old son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox is having a difficult time remaining collective since, well, he's a wild fox. Being that the tree that live in is very close to factories run by strict farmers and Mr. Fox has urges that desperately need to be fulfilled, him and his pal, Kylie Sven Opposum (Wallace Wolodarsky) decide they should try and steal produce from their farm. This becomes a recurring habit, and eventually leads to a war between the farmers and the burrowing foxes.<br/><br/>The film is occupies a delightful elegance in its stop motion animation. Its characters, right down to the fur on their backs, are animated with rich and inviting colors, as well as the sets they live in clearly being meticulously detailed. The style is primitive and great to look at, and provides us with a different form of animated entertainment instead of Pixar, Dreamworks, and Disney monopolizing the field.<br/><br/>One positive is that the film doesn't become buried under its own quirkiness so much so that we care little about the characters, which tends to happen in many of Wes Anderson's other pictures. What we have is a solid script, taken a step further than usual, along with big name actors subtly providing the voices behind these characters, so as not to throw in our face what big stars the movie has, and we continue to care for the foxes in this film, even when they do get into deep cuss.<br/><br/>Voiced by: George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Chase Anderson, Bill Murray, and Owen Wilson. Directed by: Wes Anderson."
"billcr12","7","0","2","9 June 2012"," Creative Story
","Roald Dahl was well known for his fantasy stories which were Twilight Zone type of tales. Mr. Fox was one of his children's books. As the name implies, the lead is a fox. George Clooney is the voice of Mr. Fox and his wife, Felicity(Meryl Streep) get caught in a trap while stealing from a farm. He then becomes a newspaper writer, and moves his family to a house at the base of a tree, despite the warnings of his lawyer Badger(Bill Murray). The tree is close to the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, three very mean and ambitious men. After Fox steals food from their farms, they shoot at him but only blow his tail off. They also remove the tree above his den with a bulldozer. They wait at the entrance with guns for the animals to come out, and nearing starvation, Fox digs tunnels to the farms and takes more food. The farmers flood the tunnels and Fox and his neighbors are forced to live in a sewer. The battle with the farmers continues and Clooney's Mr. Fox leads the opposition to the very end. The animation is excellent, and although I' m not the biggest fan of cartoons, I was amused by The Fantastic Mr. Fox."

","It has it's moments, but they don't come from the animation. For those used to fare along the lines of Wallace & Gromit, your normal levels of visual appreciation are unlikely to be reached. Some good comedy (and yes, some of it is visual), Clooney makes for a great funny-man and some of his lines here are hilarious! This film is fast paced, sometimes too much, and the viewer can easily miss dialogue as well as some action. That same fast pace can really keep an audience engrossed, there is a lot to see and much going on. Story is very creative and, again, colorful to both the mind and the eye. Much to like here, I just expected much more."
"nickmesafilms","9","0","1","8 April 2012"," Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) - What a Fantastic Mr. Foxy-Fox! He's Just Dre-amy!
","The wonderful stories of the late Roald Dahl, from ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", and ""Matilda"", have been adapted in plenty of film adaptations. You know, at first, I didn't think that a ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" movie was a good idea, until I saw the ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" movie, it's actually pretty cool. Based on a popular children's novel of the same name, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" stars George Clooney giving voice to the title role as Mr. Fox, a fox who steals food each night from three mean and wealthy farmers, 'Boggis, Bunce, and Bean'. The farmers had enough with Mr. Fox's antics, and they try to kill him by digging their way into their home, without knowing that the foxes are hiding underground, and they have to live without being bothered by farmers. Aside from Clooney's hilarious and excellent voice performance, the rest of the cast includes Meryl Streep as Mr. Fox's wife, Jason Schwartzman as Ash, the son who tries to become an athlete, Bill Murray as Mr. Fox's lawyer, and Owen Wilson in a short performance as Ash's school coach. It is ""movie magic"" to watch these actors bring voice to these colorful characters. Wes Anderson seems to be the perfect director for this movie, he's always been known for making such strange and whimsical movies that fall on a dysfunctional yet satisfying level. The writing is sharp and believable, the characters are funny, and the animation is pretty impressive. The jokes are pretty cocky, and there are moments when you chuckle or cringe. I will say that is a pretty entertaining movie with sharp characters, smart writing, beautiful music, and impressive animation. Although this movie is weird and cocky, it's totally worth your time. The whole family will love it, even adults. If you're a little kid who adores the books by Roald Dahl, or if you never read the book, this is still a pretty fun movie that will totally fool your senses. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", in my review, ""an entertaining romp, playful and smart""."

","Mr. Fox (George Clooney) used to be a highly-skilled food thief, until the day his wife (Meryl Streep) announced she was pregnant. Now he's a newspaper columnist, yet still gets that itch. When he scratches it, the farmers he steals from decide to get their revenge...<br/><br/>As adaptations go, Wes Anderson's take on Roald Dahl's children's classic could be defined as ""loose"". That doesn't make the film unendurable, but it does mean that this film loses just a hint of the magic that other adaps of Dahl's work have.<br/><br/>The stop-motion puppetry, though at times a little crude, is still deserving of applause; it's different, you don't see this kind of animation any more. The crudeness actually helps to define it as a Wes Anderson film: slightly off-beat, odd ball with a quietly delicious sense of surreal humour. Why hasn't Anderson done animation sooner? In fact, one could argue that with his style of storytelling Anderson is quietly becoming one of the few auteurs that there are in the world today. <br/><br/>An impressive voice cast - recorded out in the real world for most scenes instead of studios - help to bring the story to life, though Anderson's attempts to flesh the characters out sometimes create more of a problem. In particular, Bean the cider farmer (Michael Gambon) is promoted to head villain, whereas in the original novel all three farmers are equal in importance and hate for the fox.<br/><br/>The script finishes the main story of the novel two-thirds into the film, before branching out into a rescue mission for an abandoned fox cub. This actually works quite well, and is helped by good jokes, great animation and a nifty score. The music is lovely in this film throughout, including a great cameo by Jarvis Cocker.<br/><br/>Purists wont like it, and the very young will probably feel alienated by it, something a closer adaptation might have avoided, but on the whole this is a lovely film, a great addition to Anderson's work. <br/><br/>7/10"

From the wolf scene (all those who already watched the film will understand what I mean)to the ending 'war' scene ,all scenes which were not in the book, it is an innovative and outstanding achievement to all those involved.

"robotbling","7","0","1","12 December 2011"," Not as polished as other stop-motion films, but lots of fun
","(www.plasticpals.com) Wes Anderson's trademarked balance of comedy and character study shines through in this stop-motion animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was a pretty big fan of Dahl's work as a boy, but somehow this fox escaped me. Anderson's voice cast includes George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, and his old mainstays Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman. Despite the big names the film never feels like a Hollywood product thanks to its distinctly hand-crafted look, which eschews the near-CG perfectionism of recent stop-motion films like Coraline.<br/><br/>From the first trailer I saw, I felt something about it was a bit off. The anthropomorphic animals' matted fur twitches from the animators' unseen manipulations, creating the effect of a taxidermist's nightmare.<br/><br/>This slightly disturbing quality isn't as much of an issue once you settle into it, but is somewhat cringe-worthy in close-ups. That said, the animators were given free reign to push the boundaries of cartoon physics and speed, resulting in highly energetic scenes. Unfortunately, the illusion is broken in a few of the film's scenes due to a lack of fluidity.<br/><br/>The story is a charming one. When he moves next to the farms of Boggis Bunce and Bean, Mr. Fox can't help but break a promise to his wife never to steal again. His escapades don't go unnoticed by the farmers, who will stop at nothing to take revenge. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox's son must deal with an unwanted rival in nearly all aspects of life when his talented taller cousin comes to stay with them. The farmers go nuts, all hell breaks loose, and soon all the animals in the area become threatened.<br/><br/>Of course, many hilarious hijinks are had throughout, not to mention when Mr. Fox rallies the rest of the animals for one final showdown, winner take all. More so than most animated films, I feel like this one can be enjoyed more by the adults in the audience than the children (judging from the howls of laughter in the cinema).<br/><br/>It's a classic, funny tale and great fun to watch."
"estreet-eva","5","0","4","5 December 2011"," Enjoyable but overrated
","Neither fantastic nor a flop, Wes Anderson?s infringement on Nick Park?s (?Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit) stop motion animation territory presents an uneven mix of elements. Extrapolating from Roald Dahl?s children book the film mixes some concepts the kids will find confusing (Felicity Fox announces she is ?pregnant? twice and Mr. Fox has an ?existential crisis?) with elongated frantic chase scenes, many in tunnels, which eventually get tiresome for the adults. Mr. Fox kills ?Rat? on screen in an extended scene but during his killing of squabs and chickens the camera demurely looks away. Ultimate both constituents will find the film entertaining but unmemorable. There is a lot to like here, however, Clooney is pitch perfect as the self-centered Mr. Fox and Willem Dafoe dials up his trademarked brand of creepiness to the extent that you are happy to see the end of Rat. Anderson?s detailed set decoration lends a needed air of realism but his animation skills are not in the same league in terms of rendering characters attractive and endearing as Nick Park. In short, walk but don?t run to see it with the kids and be prepared to do some explaining."

","While Fantastic Mr. Fox is quite definitely Wes Anderson's most commercial film so far, it treads the line between Hollywood and art-house surprisingly well, and manages to be an extremely intelligent family movie in the strictest meaning of the term - a movie to be enjoyed by both children and adults, each on a different levels. Kids will enjoy every minute, and adults will enjoy it more because they'll understand it more (watch Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are for a failed attempt at achieving that very balance). With terrific voice talents and wonderful animation, this is one of the most truly enjoyable films I've seen in a long time, and at this point I'd like to point out that I didn't use the word 'fantastic' once in this review; I'd like a reward please."

","The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the lives of the Fox family – Mr (George Clooney), Mrs(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman) – and their animal neighbors and friends. Mr. Fox, once a professional chicken stealer, decides to settle down with his wife after she becomes pregnant and instead take up a career in writing. After moving to a new home in the trunk of a tree, Mr. Fox takes notice in three massive fowl and fruit farms. Risking everything. Mr. Fox decides to embark on one last big job – stealing from all three farms. What happens after that can only be described as pure confusion and debauchery.<br/><br/>As with most Rhold Dahl stories, the book Fantastic Mr. Fox works to both excite kids and humor adults. As a result, the original short story is considered a classic for many families. Though some adaptations of Rhold Dahl classics (see BOTH adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have strayed from Dahl's dry, quirky humor, the film version of one of his best loved stories have honored this side of Dahl's story, projecting a humor perhaps more suited to adults than children, but creating an overall story that will appeal to all. <br/><br/>This movie would likely have been impossible without the work of numerous wonderful voice actors. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson all provide voices in the movie, among other lesser known but still wonderfully talented actors. As a result, the voices blend beautifully into the animation. Instead of feeling like characters with a voice shoved in, the voices and the characters are one. <br/><br/>The animation is perhaps the most appealing aspect of the movie. The script and humor works with the animation in ways traditional or digital animation could not. In many instances, the animation itself provides part of the story. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. Adding to the animation is a muted, fall palette of colors, giving the entire film a homey, comforting feel."

","Pretty much exactly how I imagined a stop-motion Wes Anderson movie to turn out. The first two acts are really clever, genuine and quirky, then the third drags on forever. Anderson pulled in his usual cast of characters (really, has he made a film without Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and / or Jason Schwartzman?) but they once again pull a miracle by feeling right at home in the new characters' skins, and the new additions fit right in alongside them. George Clooney was perfect as the slightly shady, endlessly charismatic lead, Willem Dafoe has a great cameo as one of the villains and everyone else's performance seems to key off that energy. I re-watched The Life Aquatic With Zissou a few months back and enjoyed it much more on my second viewing, which is consistent with most of Anderson's movies for me, and fully expect this one to get better with repeat viewings, as well. Even bearing that in mind, it was mostly charming and truly entertaining as a goofball throwback to the old school the first time through."

The end was the end, and that is about that. I liked how every ""cussing"" cus word was said as ""cus"", something cute for adults that still made the film a ""kids movie."" I also liked the ravenous eating habits as well as the animation technique. I have enjoyed all of Wes Anderson's films including ""The Life Aquatic"" (though marginally in that particular case), and I saw elements of his unique visual style translated into animation. The acting is good with an award winning cast, and the movie is very watchable for children. I am a big kid so I liked it, but I did not love it and do not think this film is for everyone out there, and think even amongst the intellectual sect there is probably much disagreement as to the worth of this film.

"ajs-10","7","0","2","5 June 2011"," Love the animation...
","Over the years many tales by Roald Dahl have been adapted for the screen, both for TV and for the big screen. This is the latest big-screen adaptation of one of his works. For me, while it was quite an engaging tale I felt it wasn't made for an audience outside the United States. This is not a criticism, it just seemed to me that it had all become a little too 'Americanised' (if that's a word). The stop-motion animation, the sets and everything technical about it was very well done but I felt the characters had lost the mystique they had when I read this as a youngster. I will always now hear George Clooney as Mr. Fox and to me that's all wrong (I explain why later). Here's a very brief summary of the plot, and then some more of my thoughts.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox loves to steal chickens, ducks, anything he can eat or drink really. Unfortunately this is a dangerous business and his wife persuades him to find a safer occupation when she falls pregnant. So he takes up writing for a local newspaper. Several years later he decides it's time they moved and so they go to live in the trunk of a tree. This affords him a great view of three local farms, owned by Franklin Bean, Walter Boggis and Nathan Bunce. Unable to resist the temptation he enlists the help of Kylie Sven Opossum and raids all three farms. The farmers aren't going to take this lying down and Mr. Fox and his family, and in fact the whole community, find themselves trapped. Can Mr. Fox find a cunning way to save the day? As usual, my contract with the Spoiler Police prevents me telling you here.<br/><br/>I love the animation of this film, I always think stop-motion gives a very unique look and it works really well here. Although I have a slight dislike for the accents, to me Mr. Fox should be a very devious upper class English accent, but hey, you can't always get what you want as the Rolling Stones once said. Anyhow, a decent effort from the voice talents of; George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, Bill Murray as Badger, Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean and even Jarvis Cocker who gave us a song as Petey.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, visually, it's a treat, I love the look and feel of the film. Plot wise, well it's based on a Roald Dhal story so you can't go too far wrong there. I liked the choice of music in the film, a couple of Beach Boys numbers were very welcome. I think if it wasn't for the voices I would have enjoyed it more, but it's worth seeing for the animation.<br/><br/>My Score: 6.9/10"

","Wes Anderson creates another film, that did poorly at the box office, but was a fantastic film. The film comes off weird, but a couple minutes in, you'll be loving the whole vibe. The oddness of the characters, the animation, and the music all gives it a tone that you think would be off putting but is one of the most refreshing takes on a movie in a while.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (Clooney) promises his lovely wife (Streep)that he will stop stealing, in light of getting caught red handed. George Clooney, Meryl Streep and small parts from Anderson usual's, Murray and Wilson make up the extraordinary cast. The characters are unique and develop throughout the film. Mr. Fox is a animal trying to find freedom from his boring, monotonous day, and Badger is a hot-headed lawyer. The writing is top notch, and never gets boring, and the music is perfect for the movie. There is constantly ambiance noises (they recorded voices outside in a forest) like birds and crickets. But best of all is the animation. The whole film is brought to life by this.

","This Roald Dahl film was a ""truly"" entertaining film to watch. The animation was a spectacle and truly captures the works of Wes Anderson. The Fantastic Mr. Fox examines takes you into the world on a clan of animals all in a stop motion animation flick. The facial expressions and attention to detail was superb and original. The lighting of the film along with its animation brings out the characteristics in each of the animals. The close ups and spot light effect on the animals were fun and detailed. The world of Fantastic Mr. Fox brings you to an intelligent and clever set of animals that are quite sophisticated and hold various careers. George Clooney is the main character and is the reason for all the good and bad results for his friends and family. He yearns to be wild and untamed but is restricted by society. George Clooney has such a unique voice that warms you up and wants to like him. This smooth talking fox moved his family to tree in a more dangerous neighborhood, not taking advice from his lawyer, Bill Murray, the Badger. What makes it dangerous is the location to Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, the local farmers to the area. Facing hardships and greed, Fox tries to make a better life, steals from the farmers and gets his clan in and out of trouble. His nephew comes over when they are movie into the tree fox. Kristofferson ends up being captured trying a risky move of his own and Fox sets up a rescue mission that involves surrendering himself to the farmers. The three farmers set up an attack but the collaboration of the animals make a brilliant plan to fend off the humans. Fox, Ash and Kylie the Opossum dip and dive to rescue Kristofferson. With the karate that Ash learned from his more athletic and charming cousin, he uses his new skills to save him. Throughout the movie Fox is witty and fearless but admits to his phobia of wolves. The scene was enjoyable to watch because it proves that Fantastic Fox and the humanly clan of creatures, were all still ""wild animals."" This film really touches on the comedy for children and witty humor for adults. I could definitely see this being a pure adult film where as kids could not appreciate some parts of the film such as the argument between Fox and the Opossum. ""A Titanium Card? Says Mr. Fox: ""How did you qualify for this?"" Kylie says ""I pay my bills on time."" The adult humor makes you think and in my opinion kept me into the movie."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Delightful animation movie features stop motion, which has sadly been pretty much forgotten over the years, although a few examples show up every once in a while. The story here concerns a fox (George Clooney) who gets his wife (Meryl Streep), kids and the other animals kicked out of their homes after stealing chickens from a trio of farmers who then decide to take revenge on the animals. After letting everyone down the fox must try and come up with a way to strike back at the farmer and reclaim their land. FANTASTIC MR. FOX is rather refreshing because it's an original film that doesn't try to cater to any certain type of viewer and instead just comes off as a fresh work that can go into any direction it wants without having to play by any sort of rules. Based on a book by Roald Dahl, there's no question that this film isn't going to be for everybody but the story is so good, the visuals terrific and the voice work is downright wonderful and in the end if you're able to accept this type of film then you're going to love it. The visual look of the film is so beautiful that you really just want to pause scenes and gaze at the beauty in them. There are so many terrific looking scenes but one of my favorites is a POV shot of a rabid dog chasing the fox. Another terrific sequence comes when the fox has let everyone down and he stands out in the rain while his wife comes to talk with him. The look of the rain is unlike any visual I've seen in any movie before and it's certainly one I won't forget. The story itself allows for many kid-like qualities but the screenplay makes sure that adults will get the many jokes thrown their way. I really loved how the bad words were covered up by the creatures simply saying cuss and it's easy for the adults to fill in what word was suppose to be there. Clooney has one of the greatest voices out there when it comes to giving off any sort of emotion and I thought he was terrific here. He can do sly and be a smart aleck while at the same time being charming and he brings that to the fox character and makes him quite memorable. The supporting voices include Streep, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe among others. I'm really not sure how many kids will enjoy this thing but those familiar with different types of animation will probably find this to be quite refreshing. Its sense of humor and messages are all very well handled and when you consider the talent and look this is certainly a must-see."

","Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roahl Dahl's book of the same name casts aside the CGI animation of Pixar for some old-school stop-motion animation. It tells the familiar story of the cheeky Mr. Fox (voiced with the usual charm of George Clooney) who leaves his days of stealing chickens behind him to marry Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) and settle down with their newly born son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). After buying up some new property that is situated near the land of Boggis, Bunce and Bean, three farmers with a terrible reputation, Mr. Fox is tempted into his old ways. He plans the heist of the century (in fox terms) to hit each farm individually without getting a scratch, aided by his lovable-but- dumb friend Badger (Bill Murray), and eventually his visiting nephew and natural athlete Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson).<br/><br/>When the farmers discover what Mr. Fox is up to, Franklin Bean (Michael Gambon) unites the three and plans a revenge attack on Fox's burrow. Soon, Mr. Fox has to team up with his own gang of rather hopeless animals to escape the tractors that have begun digging up their home. They also have to face Bean's cider-loving, knife-wielding, finger- snapping bodyguard Rat (Willem Dafoe). Feeling guilty for the situation he has placed his family and friends into, Mr. Fox must come up with a plan to defeat the persistent farmers.<br/><br/>Anderson's sense of humour that has been so present in his previous films is in full flow here. Clooney can deliver a quirky line like no other actor working in cinema today and his time working with the Coen brothers have clearly paid off. Mr. Fox is selfish, cocky and obnoxious, but with Clooney behind the microphone he is a completely lovable character. The quirkiness is upped by the presence of Anderson regulars Murray and Schwartzman, whose personalities shine through the animation and give their clay characters an important human feel. Michael Gambon also has a field day voicing the sadistic and psychopathic Bean, who in his own way is absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>Anderson's decision to go with stop-motion animation adds a nostalgic edge to the film. The book is clearly beloved to the director, and to many people who have read this or any of the number of children's classics by Roahl Dahl. I remember reading Matilda, James And The Giant Peach and The BFG as a child in school and being fascinated and enthralled, and Fantastic Mr. Fox brought those memories back. Of course, the film's sense of humour is not in tone with the book, but the overall feel and charm of the film really captures the spirit of Dahl's books. The opening heist has Mr. Fox ingeniously navigate his way through a farmyard in the style of Super Mario Brothers. It is super- charged, throwing reason and continuity out the window for the sake of having some immature fun, and it works.<br/><br/>Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson's two greatest films, were two of the best American comedies to come out in recent years, and Fantastic Mr. Fox adds something different and equally impressive to an already-impressive CV. It also cements his status as a director whose films you can always look forward to. The film's giddiness and unashamed childishness elevates the film, and it's nice to see a children's story adapted without the need for flashy effects or feeling the need to darken the tone. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"willii02","8","0","1","6 February 2011"," A fantastic animated comedy with a strong clear message
","Before you read any further I would like to warn you that this review may contain spoilers. The Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightfully colorful animated comedy film about a Fox who is addicted to stealing birds from farmers directed by Wes Andersen. The film is filled with an outstanding ensemble of cast members who lend their voices to the many unique characters. In the movie Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) are stealing chickens from a farm and they are caught in a fox trap. Mrs. Fox tells Mr. Fox that she is pregnant and he vows that if they make it out of that mess he will never steal another bird again. Mr. Fox lives up to his word but is not happy with his current line of work. The ultimate plot in this film takes place when the family moves to a new home above ground. Mr. Fox and Kylie Sven Opossum (Wally Wolodarsky) plot to steal the possessions of each of the three farmers whose properties are in proximity to Mr. Fox's new home. Nathan Bunce (Hugo Guiness) raises Ducks and Geese, Walter Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) raises chickens, and Franklin Bean (Michael Gambon) raises turkeys and grows apples. The theme of this film is that the decisions one person makes not only affects that person but can also have a profound affect on the people around that person. Mr. Fox's decision to steal from the farmers' greatly affects the landscape around him. As the film develops, the farmers plot to get revenge on Mr. Fox for stealing from them. They will stop at nothing and don't care who is harmed in the process as they try and get to Mr. Fox who has gone underground with his family. This sets off a major chain of events and leads to the compromise of the safety of all of the animals in the wilderness. All the animals are forced underground because of Mr. Fox and his uncontrollable desire to steal from the farmers. The decisions people make don't always have to have a negative effect on people. They can also lead to a positive outcome but they still have an effect on another person's life. A good example of this is the Tears of the Sun Movie. If the soldiers' decide to leave, all of the refugees die, but the soldiers' decision to risk their own well being to save the refugees helped to save a majority of them. The lighting underground when the other animals finally meet up with Mr. Fox and his family is that of flashlights and a dim lamp. This coupled with the close-up shots show the element of how Mr. Fox realizes the seriousness of what he has caused and the effect of the others. Another aspect of the film is the motif of them continually being shown digging around underground. This shows the effect of the decisions that Mr. Fox has made on the other animals and their attempts to adjust. You should always weigh all decisions carefully. There are consequences to every decision that a person makes in life and you should know how that decision not only affects you but what affect it may have on those close to you."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is easily the best animated feature of 2009. It should be rewarded with an Oscar nomination (and is every bit deserving of a win) even though Pixar's Up (2009) could land the coveted statuette based on popular votes. Adapted from the beloved Roald Dahl children's book of the same name, the film tells the story of Mr. Fox and his sneaky scheme to steal poultry, especially chicken, from three nearby farms run by three nasty, detestable humans with a collective mission: to kill Mr. Fox and his family.<br/><br/>Director Wes Anderson who is well-known for films such as Bottle Rocket (1996), Rushmore (1998), and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) is one of the key American filmmakers of the 90s to revive the low-budget independent offbeat comedy. Even though much of his works remain under-appreciated, Anderson has a loyal following claiming that he is one of the great filmmakers of our time. While that might be exaggerating it a fair bit, Fantastic Mr. Fox shows us why he is on course to being judged as such.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the stop-motion tradition of the Wallace And Gromit films, and refutes the argument that brilliant animated films can only be made by Pixar. Anderson's obsession with detail and his mastery of mise-en-scene also means that the film is far from 'kiddish'; on the contrary, it can be seen as quality art. While children may enjoy the visuals and the odd dose of behavioral humor (e.g. how the foxes consume their meal or how they dig themselves out of trouble), parents who are forced to tag along are far more likely to appreciate the authenticity of the character and set models used, and the themes of 'family', 'responsibility', and 'collectivism' which reverberate with quiet resonance throughout the film.<br/><br/>There is some superb voice work on show here with George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. Supporting voice talents include stars Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Michael Gambon, William Dafoe, and Owen Wilson. An 'ethnic' influence is evident in one of the characters here whose obsession with yoga and its meditative properties recalls a certain 'spiritual' Schwartzman in The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Anderson's previous film about three brothers on a bonding trip to India.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox also explores the important theme of domesticity versus the wild. Mr. Fox has a lovely family and he dotes on them. In short, he lives a comfortable life in his big house under a tree. But more often than not, he succumbs to his animalistic instinct by 'hunting' for food from the farms. He enjoys the temporal satisfaction of being a wild animal, or in this case, a sly, scheming fox. In a key scene, Mr. Fox has a fleeting encounter with a black wolf. Even though suppressed by a psychological fear of wolves, he admires from distance the dark beauty of the creature, its freedom to roam the lands, to hunt, and its fortune to avoid the tepidity that is domesticity.<br/><br/>An Anderson masterpiece of craftsmanship and direction, Fantastic Mr. Fox very much assures itself of a spot in my top ten films of 2009.<br/><br/>GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","Roald Dahl is an incredible children's author and his books are very British affairs, with a bit of his Norwegian backgrounds and legends thrown in. So it was worry that one of his novels was being turned into a American film, with an American director and cast. But fortunately it is a good film.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is a successful hunter and poacher of farm animals and he has amazing abilities avoiding traps. But when his wife, Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant, Mr. Fox gives up his hunting ways for his family. Two Years later (twelve fox years), Mr. Fox is bored with his life so decides to go for one last big score, robbing the three meaning farmers in the valley, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. But by robbing them Bean (Michael Gambon) leads the farmers one a hunt, doing everything they can to kill Mr. Fox and his family. Whilst this adventure and heist is going on, Mr. Fox's son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) develops a rivalry with his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) because of his intelligence and athletic ability and Mr. Fox ending up favouring him over his own son.<br/><br/>The director Wes Anderson is one of the darlings of American indie cinema. He wrote and shot Fantastic Mr. Fox almost like an indie film, particularly the family drama about a son trying to prove himself to his father and a man (or this case a fox) having to fight against his nature. The way some of the sequences are shot and move reminded me of classic platformer games, particularly Sonic the Hedgehog and the undergrounds scenes showing the network of tunnels was like the first version of Worms.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox works as a heist film with Mr. Fox coming up with plans to rob the farmers, who is arrogant about his abilities and ignores his family because of his exploits. They is a lot of humour in the film involving the lines and dialogue and some visual gags: but this was not a film that does not have as much appeal to young children as it should have. There are still gags that children will like though. A running gag in the film is Bean giving orders over a walkie-talkie. There is a fight between Mr. Fox and Rat (Willem Dafoe) which was skilfully done when they are jumping up in the air in the darkness with lightening flashing so it was quick still images.<br/><br/>The animation style is style and on the trailers it did look weak. But it worked in the film; the designs of all the animals and humans are detailed and I do have a soft-spot for stop-motion animation. Stop-motion allows for more real world physic and detailed characters and set designs, like the painting of the badgers. The movement is fluid, like in the platformer style sequences, but other scenes were crude and not that well done, like the digging, the flooding and the dancing looked like a student film working on a limited budget . One thing I also don't understand is why the animals are American (i.e, opossums and beavers) let the town looks like an old fashioned English town.<br/><br/>Wes Anderson shot the film almost like a live action film, obviously directing how he knows best. It just small touches like the way the camera zooms into towards a face or the wide shots, giving the film a extra in it's cinematography.<br/><br/>There is an excellent voice cast and both Wes Anderson and Spike Jonze with Where the Wild Things Are actually got their voice actors together and performed the film and get a more natural performance out the actors. The traditional way is for the actor to stand in a room and say the line in about 25 different ways with the director and editor picks the best version. Many of the actors in Fantastic Mr. Fox are natural comic performances and many of them had good chemistry. Clooney leads the film well and Bill Murray and Wallace Wolodarsky had a very good, funny supporting roles.<br/><br/>Finally there is a good soundtrack in this film, with songs from the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, to banjo music and the playful score by Alexandre Desplat."
"runamokprods","9","0","1","19 November 2010"," I liked it the first time, loved it the second
","Utterly odd and unique in the best way. Sweet, funny, breezy stop motion animation film based on the Roald Dahl novel. It's always delightful, and very well voice-acted by the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon. <br/><br/>A fox/father decides to settle down, stop stealing chickens and become a respectable newspaperman, but hitting a mid life crisis the part of him that longs to steal birds can't be denied one last big heist, which leads to ever more dire (and funnier) consequences. <br/><br/>I liked the film on first viewing, but found I loved it on the second. First, for film fans, or fans of Anderson's work, it's hysterical how he has translated his personal style, both visual and character, to animation. This looks and feels like his other films in a way that is by itself an absolute crack-up. But more important it turns out that Anderson and Dahl are a great mix, with Dahl's great imagination taking Anderson's cock-eyed view of life, and expanding it to a broader canvas. In the end, while populated by puppet animals, this is as human, touching and funny as almost anything Anderson has done. It may be too sophisticated for little kids, but any child advanced enough to enjoy Dahl's books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc.) should have a grand old time, along with their parents."

","For some reason everything Wes Anderson does seems so off-beat yet so calculated, it has the same amount of the dreaded ""quirkiness"" and charm as other films, it just feels so forced and worst of all at times fake.<br/><br/>In saying that this is his best film since Bottle Rocket.<br/><br/>I hated The Royal Tenenbaums for the F-word above, liked Rushmore more for what it wanted to be (and perhaps what I wanted it to be), and thought The Life Aquatic a spectacular failure that had potential greatness somewhere in it - if that even makes sense.<br/><br/>(As an aside I also watched The Darjeeling Limited and liked it, but didn't feel passionate about it enough in any one direction to have an opinion on it.)<br/><br/>Now given that we have a director who wants to peddle charm and quirkiness in equal and liberal amounts, what better setting than the re-telling of a children's story about a cast of human-like animals told in stop motion animation?<br/><br/>If you can come up with a more ideal scenario please tell me, I can't do it. (Better yet tell Wes Anderson!)<br/><br/>George Clooney is (not yet Fantastic) Mr Fox.<br/><br/><ul><li>His Mrs Fox is Meryl Streep. - His lawyer-badger is Bill Murray. - (Later) His son Ash is Jason Schwartzmann.</li></ul><br/><br/>Sounds good already don't it?<br/><br/>Early in proceedings Mr & Mrs Fox are a huntin' chickens, only a near miss caused Mrs F to demand that Mr F rethink his career path, as she is preggers.<br/><br/>Fast forward 2 years, or as we are told 12 Fox years. <br/><br/>>>>>>>>>>><br/><br/>Mr Fox is now a successful local journalist with the a young son and devoted wife, only he feels that living in the ground is somehow beneath him, or at least the ground. He wants some new digs that don't require digging, and after ignoring the sage advice of his lawyer takes residence in a tree near three dangerous-to-animals local farmers. At the same time Ash's cousin Kristofferson comes to stay with the family, which doesn't impress Ash as the newcomer seems superior in every way.<br/><br/>While everything seems perfect from the outside, Mr Fox is toey and decides to pull off one last job, or three last jobs if you will, as he sets out to rob from each of the neighbouring farms.<br/><br/>So with Kylie the opossum alongside for the lark, Mr Fox does exactly that, and incurs the inevitable wrath that comes with stealing from dangerous farmers.<br/><br/>The three farmers band together to eradicate their local pests and his family, firstly with shovels, then ditch-diggers, then explosives, forcing Mr Fox to do something to both save his family, their friends and earn the kudos that come with the title of Fantastic.<br/><br/>Stop motion animation is at once strange yet it draws you in with the herky-jerky actions, Wes Anderson obviously had a great time with the device and some of the visuals are hilarious, including a letter scene that involves many animals dancing to celebrate success, and a musical number that is genuinely charming.<br/><br/>This is the perfect vehicle for Anderson as some of his dialogue sounds forced and unnatural when coming from a human, but for whatever reason movie-goers are more forgiving when the same intricate dialogue is said by an animal. After all, if we accept that an animal has the capacity for speech, it isn't a stretch to expect them to be witty, urbane and whimsical.<br/><br/>Wes Anderson also has a great ear for music, and his films always have memorable and catchy tunes that don't seem to be used in other films, (and always the Rolling Stones. Always.) The music is also cleverly integrated as Mr Fox carries on his person a walkman that he turns on and off with relevant music to support his thoughts or actions.<br/><br/>The voice acting thankfully doesn't have the distracting impact of making you think ""Hey, that's Bill Murray"", the dialogue is dry and witty and the puppets (?) spectacularly detailed and well designed.<br/><br/>Mr Fox has amazingly long skinny legs and a great clothes designer, and the various animals that they come across are all unique yet faithful to the actual source animal, and for some reason George Clooney's voice coming out of his mouth just seems right.<br/><br/>If Wes Anderson has the choice between making self indulgent films like Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, or making self indulgent films like this, I sincerely hope that he goes down this path. Tim Burton seems to have done exactly that, and despite the awkward Chocolate Factory gaffe he is chugging along nicely.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7 / 10. There is nothing awesome about Fantastic Mr Fox, but I could watch films like this every week and never grow tired of them.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
"sean-goodroad","8","0","1","31 October 2010"," An enjoyable family film of theft and responsibility.
","""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is rare in modern cinema, being filmed in stop motion animation. Using stop motion sets it apart from other recent animated features that rely more on computer images (CGI) this choice adds to the effect of the adventures of a fox that tries to fight against his own thieving nature. ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" effectively presents the whimsical nature of its children's book (written by Roald Dahl, best known for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) roots with the choice of animation technique. The theme of responsibility and honesty are common in children's stories but are effectively packaged. The hero being well intentioned but flawed (if not almost entirely careless) character makes the film accessible to the whole family without being overly pushy in delivery.<br/><br/>Vocal casting is overall well done, but at times it can be annoying and cliché for an animated feature. George Clooney lends his voice for the role of Mr. Fox adding a feeling of ""smooth"" cockiness while maintaining the ability to garner the audience's sympathy when needed. The voice of Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) carries a tone of ""responsibility"" while at times being demanding in nature (and irritating in its constant seriousness). Jason Schwartzman's typical role choice of an awkward socially inept character is a good fit for the role of Ash (the son of Mr. and Mrs. Fox). The most surprising vocal talent in the film is Willem Defoe's character of the psychotic French accented, Rat.<br/><br/>Animation techniques used in this film are reminiscent of cartoonish, technically sophisticated Ray Harryhausen, offering smoother movements and better character integration with the backgrounds. From a technical standpoint the style very effectively matches the story, sound effects are comedic and appropriate (Mr. Fox's whistling seems to be borrowed from Donald Sutherland's character ""Hawkeye"" Pierce in ""M.A.S.H. (1970),"" which was also used more recently in ""The Losers (2010)""), lighting is appropriate for mood, and the effects are suitable to the films fantastic nature.<br/><br/>The awkward humor and overall style of ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is similar to Wes Anderson's other films ""The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)"", ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)"" and ""Rushmore (1998)"". It's hard to point exactly what the similarity in Wes Anderson's movies is, but those familiar with his past films will notice it in this one as well (many actors in Anderson's previous pictures also appear in this one). In all, ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is an enjoyable film of an impulsive fox and the prices he and others must pay for his actions. Despite some of the occasional annoyances from some of the vocal talent (this is personal taste), delivering the themes of delivery responsibility and friendship in an effective and enjoyable manner makes it worth watching at least once (even to just see modern use of stop motion). And perhaps the greatest message of all is not about stealing squibs or seeking adventure but about remembering to dance."

","Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory are the films I have seen adapted from the books by Roald Dahl, and this was the next one from director Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums). Basically Mr. Fox (George Clooney) spends most of his time raiding farms, but when Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) reveals she is pregnant, he makes the decision to quit. Two years later Mr. Fox has bought a new house in a tree for him, his wife and their son Ash (Jason Schwartzman), and Mr. Fox has become a newspaper columnist. The tree is located very close to the farms belonging to Franklin Bean (Sir Michael Gambon), Walter Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) and Nathan Bunce (Hugo Guinness), and his old career is soon to return. After moving in Mr. Fox's nephew Kristofferson Silverfox (Eric Chase Anderson) has come to live with them, but this doesn't stop Mr. Fox with his friend Kylie Sven Opossum (Wallace Wolodarsky) planning to steal chickens, turkeys and alcoholic cider. After the successful ""final raid"" of the three farms, led by the nasty Bean, he and the also mean Boggis and Bunce decide enough's enough, and that they should catch and kill Mr. Fox and the gang. Bean did manage to shoot the tail of Mr. Fox off, but they know that the animals are digging underground all over the place to get away, so the farmers try to drown them in the tunnels with a hoard of cider. Mr. Fox and the gang have retreated to the sewers, but they know they have to go back when Kristofferson has been captured, with only the Rat (Willem Dafoe) knowing his location. Mr. Fox sends a message to the farmers negotiating his surrender for Kristofferson's release, but in fact the animals have planned a counter attack. In the end the farmers are defeated by the cunning of Mr. Fox and the animals, they manage to get his mauled tail back, and they have accepted living int he sewers to stay safe, but they have found a pothole leading to salvation in a supermarket, run by Bean, Boggis and Bunce. Also starring Bill Murray as Badger, Owen Wilson as Coach Skip, Jarvis Cocker as Petey, Wes Anderson as Weasel, Brian Cox as Action 12 Reporter and Adrien Brody as Rickity the Field Mouse. The film is made by the old fashioned stop motion in stead of the modern CGI effects, this makes the film much more charming. Obviously the Americanisation of the story does stop it being completely British, but Clooney is great choice for the leading, and the other supporting characters are great fun too, it a most watchable family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Alexandre Desplat and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Animated Film and Best Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!"

","I have never been so absorbed by a group of animated figures. Even more impressive than the stop action process used here (it must have taken forever), is a delightful set of people/animals that charm us and make us care. As with all Roald Dahl children's books, we get to see the dark side of humanity, no punches pulled. The animals are a combination of their natural propensities and ""human"" qualities. The story involves an upwardly mobile fox, voiced by George Clooney, who wants the best for his family, but can't seem to avoid killing chickens or robbing the people who live on the edge of his domain. He is a ""wild animal"" and this makes it hard for him to restrain himself. He is also quite irresponsible but so charming that he can talk his way out of anything. Into the mix is his faithful wife (who really gets fed up with him) and a son who is small, aspires to be an athlete, and is in the throes of teenage low self-esteem. A whiz kid cousin come to visit and upsets the apple cart. Ultimately, the actions of Mr. Fox bring about a battle with the dangerous humans and the fun begins. This is a delight to look at. Even if you're not into ""children's"" animated films, I became totally absorbed."

","There have been many of Roald Dahl's books brought to the movie world. We've had movies such as James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, The BFG and now Fantastic Mr. Fox, which has proved to be quite the diamond. The story is brilliant which is to be expected since it's based on a Roald Dahl book, the animation is bright and colourful and is simply superb as it uses the original classic stop motion animation. The voice acting has no faults and the characters were beautifully written and a lot of fun to watch. It's guaranteed to leave you grinning from ear to ear after you finish watching it.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I must admit I did have some doubts but after putting them aside and watching the movie, I could see I had nothing to worry about as this is truly a classic animation for children and adults to watch. The humour involved in the movie is great and timed perfectly. It surprised me as well because, and I don't know if this is me but, the animation looked choppy and kind of slow yet when watching the animation, it was nice and smooth and ran perfectly. Almost everything about Fantastic Mr. Fox was near enough perfect to how a family animation should be. However, nothing is ever perfect and I doubt I'll ever see a perfect movie. Having said that, this movie comes pretty close to being the perfect family movie. I really do recommend this movie to everyone as I have yet to find a person who didn't fall for the charm of Fantastic Mr. Fox. This will definitely keep the whole family entertained and adults and children will adore it.

By the time the end credits were rolling, I wanted to ask the kids in the theatre whether they enjoyed the movie or not. I couldn't help but wonder how I would have felt had I seen it when I was 7, 8, or 9. It would have had an odd effect on me, indeed.<br/><br/>This is not a traditional animated film, even if it does use one of the more traditional forms of animation. It is not always straightforward and direct nor does it even try to keep the senses fully satisfied during every second. In fact, the soundtrack can be very quiet at times with only simple, low level foley effects added in to what would otherwise be silent stretches with no music to dictate the emotions with. I can imagine that I probably would not have enjoyed it as a child, because my taste was limited to what fulfilled my superficial expectations.<br/><br/>But kids should be taken to see this just so they can experience something different, yet in a familiar format. There is a lot that's expressed with these characters. Much of the narrative deals with finding one's identity. Mr. Fox asks:<br/><br/>""Why a fox? Why not a horse, a beetle, or a bald eagle?""<br/><br/>But nevertheless he is a fox, and in his attempt to live up to his desire of being ""fantastic,"" he does what he does best and hatches up a master plan to steal from some rather mean farmers who in turn seek vengeance. This gets not only Mr. Fox, but the surrounding community running for their lives. Meanwhile, his son deals with insecurity after the arrival of his perfect cousin.<br/><br/>The script is witty, at times hilarious, and layered and Anderson makes nice use of the photography. His quirky direction is fitting to the main idea presented: we are all different, but ""there is something fantastic about that."" We have our abilities and inabilities and I suppose we can change how we feel about them. In the end, we just are who we are and do what we do and sometimes it might mean that no matter what we do to redeem ourselves, we are just another dead rat behind a Chinese restaurant."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is an impressive work, one requiring enormous time and effort to animate the characters and build the miniature, detailed sets. This is a medium that reminds me of films that are usually childish, cheesy, or very old, yet there wasn't any of that in this effort.<br/><br/>The story was well adapted for the screen, and I thought it did a good job of incorporating Roald Dahl's great book without ruining it. The idea of pinning on bits before and after the time frame of the book, and the addition of more storyline about the Fox family was well done, too.<br/><br/>As per usual, the music in the film was well chosen and added to the fun element. The whimsical Wes Anderson touch is in effect, unexpected bits in the dialog, little extras here and there. <br/><br/>All in all, a great one to see, and an excellent example of what can be done in the medium. Highly recommended."

","Having read the Roald Dahl book with my kids, I was looking forward to seeing this film.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of good points: the animation and creative details in the sets are fantastic. Clooney and Murray are both very funny - I thought Meryl Streep was pretty flat. A lot of the visual gags and the witty, modern script is funny for adult viewers.<br/><br/>I have 2 beefs with this movie: 1) It strays very far from the tone and conception of the book. Probably any attempt to turn a short children's book into 90 minutes of screen time requires lots of padding, extra characters, story, and scenes. The characters are all turned into hip modern (sub)urbanites. If you haven't read the book, this won't bother you.<br/><br/>2) This film is marketed as a kids movie, or at least ""family-friendly"". Unless you're comfortable with a lot of transparently-veiled swearing, you may conclude (as I have) that this movie is not for family viewing. As stated in the parent's guide, ""Instead of using profanity, characters say sentences that would contain a swear word, but the word is replaced by the word ""cuss"". What is not stated is that not 5 minutes goes by in this movie without a swear replacing ""cuss"" for f*** (apparently Anderson has an infatuation for the f-word). Also, the characters use the same tone and inflection as if they were really swearing - ""What the cuss!?"" ""cluster-cuss"", etc. The ratings board was really asleep at the wheel giving this film a PG rating with all the transparent swearing going on. Ruined an otherwise good movie for me."
"colinrgeorge","9","0","1","6 April 2010"," ""Fantastic Mr. Fox""
","Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a different breed of animated film. It bares a disarming emotional maturity coupled with a sweetly mischievous cartoony vitality that both renews my faith in Anderson as a director and reaffirms 2009 as a hell of a year for animation.<br/><br/>Things were admittedly getting rocky between the indie auteur and I. ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" the perfect nexus of Anderson's flamboyant cinematic technique, borderline obsessive-compulsive art direction, and satirically bourgeois humor, was proceeded by two films with all the technical and artistic flare of his best work, though his families of dryly depressive characters, often portrayed by a stock catalogue of recycled actors, began feeling increasingly redundant and masturbatory. His follow-up to ""Tenenbaums"" was ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" a puzzlingly defended film distinguished by breathtaking visuals, smarmy caricatures, and unrepentant vacuity. 2007's ""Darjeeling Limited"" surpassed that film in substance, but Anderson still felt like he was running on fumes, incapable of a single wholly original character or relationship. For his grandiose symmetrical photography and audacious camera-work, the guy could be a dead ringer for Kubrick if his stories were up to snuff. Anderson needed a change, and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is everything he and his audience could have hoped for.<br/><br/>It's not just that the film revels in gorgeous traditional stop-motion claymation, rich with its tactile textures and charmingly rippling fur, or the magnanimity of the miniature set-pieces, or backdrops lit with the deep auburns and siennas of perpetual sunset. ""Mr. Fox"" has a story, and a pretty good one at that, courtesy children's author Roald Dahl, adapted for the screen by Anderson and Noah Baumbach. The director's meticulous perfectionism actually feels more at home in the world of animation, which from inception presents the heightened reality he strives for. The dolly shots and intricate sets suddenly service the storytelling rather than primp Anderson's aggressive showmanship.<br/><br/>But contrary to what the exuberant color palette and genial clay critters might suggest, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is not really a film geared to young children, though they'll no doubt appreciate it for the animalistic silliness and amiable pace. Rather it's the subtext, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and his midlife crisis, which will resonate most with adults. The film has a surprising amount to say about our own animal nature through the anthropomorphizing of its critters, who will frequently drop their civilized countenances to hiss or snarl or gobble down food, but which somehow makes them feel all the more relatable.<br/><br/>Case in point, Mr. Fox gives up his danger-prone life of killing chickens to raise a family (taking up a more pedestrian gig in the field of--gag!--journalism), but finds himself drawn back to his life's modus operandi for 'one last big score.' Dahl and Anderson are not afraid to portray unpleasantness, nor do they gloss over the fact that Mr. Fox does some not- especially-nice things to the birds he catches. The film never talks down to a potentially younger audience, and the difference is immediately refreshing when compared to children's films that are merely content to cast nasty creatures as pleasant surrogate humans.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the deepest animated movie of the year, and I think the best, if only by a hair. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a serious contender as well, though being a fairy tale, it often doesn't pack the punch or offer the rewarding surprises Wes Anderson's film does. It actually shares more in common with Spike Jonze's ""Where the Wild Things Are"" than this year's Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks efforts. ""Mr. Fox"" is more effortlessly charming and poignant that that commendable film, and holds its own among the year's best live action as well. It's a film that pairs adventure with a markedly fresh family drama, tenderness and love with the unpredictable and the untamed.<br/><br/>In short, it's a wild animal."
"arthera09","7","0","1","3 April 2010"," Not what I was hoping for
","I love Wes Anderson. I think he is one of the most talented film makers out there right now. I must say that this is probably my least favorite film of his. I loved the music and it really set the mood for the movie. The animation was something special. I never expect to be surprised by stop animation and I always think I have seen it all, but there were just some fantastic shots for me. The dialog was fantastic for the most part and the writing was tight in that aspect. The reason that I give it a seven though is because I never connected with the film. I enjoyed all of the aspects of the movie, but it never came together with me. I did not connect with any of the characters and the story never seemed to flow for me with respect to the characters. My favorite character was the mother and she did not do anything and in the end did not have a satisfactory part of the story. I also did not feel any of the joy of being a kid while watching this film; not like with a pixar film. I know it is unfair to compare any movie to a pixar film, but one has to now. One of the biggest issues that I had with the movie was the use of ""cuss"". I felt like it was used to much. By the end of the movie I was getting tired of it and I wished Anderson and Baumbauch used it less and just used their wit, which they have more than 90% of Hollywood combined. I do not know why I did not enjoy this movie. I had my reservations because of the stop motion, but that was actually the most satisfying part of the movie. The biggest thing that the movie lacked for me was a character that was the emotional core of the film. There was nothing for me to connect on a human level. That is why I love Wes Anderson and without the emotional core it is just a quirky stop-motion movie that is a really good movie, but not the movie I was hoping for."

Based on Roald Dahl's classic, Fantastic Mr. Fox infiltrates Wes Anderson's trademark quirky blend of humor into a gripping narrative. While the material might be too snarky and sophisticated for children, adults should enjoy Anderson's refreshing approach. The movie's look is pleasantly off-beat, yet imaginative with superbly designed characters and sweet ingenious action pieces. The truly extraordinary world created on screen is incredibly detailed and resonates with Anderson's style very well. Apart from being a sheer delight to watch, Fantastic Mr. Fox stands as a great story abounding with odd comedic touches and a spark of melodrama thrown inbetween.

The good voice cast is of great help, though.<br/><br/>But the most interesting aspect of Wes Anderson's first-time foray into feature-length stop-motion animation (though there were some animated sequences in earlier pics) is certainly the clash between wild-life instincts and a civilized way of living.

"cowman57-1","6","0","1","1 February 2010"," Typical Wes Anderson quirkiness, this time in stop-action.
","Even though Fantastic Mr. Fox was a stop-action movie allegedly meant for children, you could still tell undeniably that it was a Wes Anderson production. It's fair to say that throughout the years Anderson (who is only 40!) has garnered a strong cult following (other notable films of his include: The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited). Though his movies are often offbeat and a bit funky, I think they pack a lot of heart. They give a perhaps skewed yet sincere perspective on the world and on basic human relationships. Since I'm a sucker for strange movies, I'm a fan; I have a lot of respect for his interesting, unique style and I was pleased that Fantastic Mr. Fox kept the same feel.<br/><br/>One of the most obvious reasons Fantastic Mr. Fox is similar to his other movies, is that the same ever-present group of Anderson's favorite actors made their appearances (albeit in cartoonish animal form this time): Bill Murray as a badger-lawyer, a Wilson brother (Owen this time) as a gym coach, and Jason Schwartzman as Mr. Fox's son, Ash. These friends help make Anderson's movies what they are and I can't imagine not having them.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, I was impressed by the number of other big names doing voices (George Clooney, Meryl Streep, William Dafoe, Michael Gambon AKA Dumbledore). This probably points to the fact that Anderson is getting a lot of street cred in Hollywood these days, as he deserves, and people are really taking him seriously. Though I'm sure everybody in LA has known he's a genius from the very beginning.<br/><br/>As far as dialogue goes, Fantastic Mr. Fox retained Anderson's subtle humor and cool-headed/almost passive/laid-back observations of life. How can I explain this? Sentences are short and super-condensed. They are to the point. There were many quirky obsessions, like the word ""cuss."" Though naturally there was action and drama, the way the characters talk makes it seem like everything is under control. Or maybe it's that all his characters have resigned to the fact that life is life and we can't change things. Do we take it seriously or can we laugh at it? Both maybe:<br/><br/>Ash: You should probably put your bandit hat on now. Personally, I- I don't have one, but I modified this tube sock. Kristofferson: You look good. Ash: Yeah, I do.<br/><br/>Finally, even though it was via a new medium, the movie maintained Anderson's interesting way of shooting scenes. I may also lack an accurate way of describing it, but I certainly know it when I see it. His shots are slow and the camera stays in one place and lets the small things happen. In a way, we see things in the same way his characters talk- quiet/still.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another interesting point about this movie: Stop-action animation. The eyes of the characters were strange. It felt like the color scheme was brown and orange, making it seem straight from the 70's. Most films using this medium are meant for children. And, although there were lots of kids in the theater, I'm not so sure they connected with this story as much as they would, say a Disney movie. I think lots of the subtleties of the dialogue and many of the jokes were lost on them.<br/><br/>The story was amusing and felt like an old fashioned fable with a lesson involved (something the kids may have been able to pick up on): don't be greedy. Also, be yourself. So, I for one enjoyed watching this movie, quirks and all."

","""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the story of the titular Mr. Fox, his family, his stealing shenanigans and his rivalry with the three notorious farmers from whom he stole. This film is an adult version of a children's story by Roald Dahl, as interpreted by American director/writer Wes Anderson. It was interpreted in rather old-fashioned-looking, almost monochromatic (orange-yellow-brown) stop-motion animation. The attention of my sons were not held by the slow beginning and by all the talking. My daughter was not even interested to watch it at all.<br/><br/>I, on the other hand, quite enjoyed it. The dialogue is funny and witty, and very adult. There is even a hilarious attempt to hide all profanity with the word ""cuss"". I do not really like stop-animation movies (like ""Gumby"" or ""Wallace and Grommit""), but their pain-stakingly detailed efforts are appreciated.<br/><br/>George Clooney definitely inhabits the character of Mr. Fox. He appropriately channeled Danny Ocean, especially in light of the heists that Mr. Fox was pulling, complete with smug attitude. Meryl Streep portrays Mrs. Felicity Fox. I felt there was nothing really special about it. Any actress could have done it just as well. Apparently the supporting cast is composed of actors who are staples of Wes Anderson films like Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, etc. I particularly liked how Murray voiced Attorney Badger.<br/><br/>I read an excerpt of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" from the Roald Dahl book that we had. It turns out while the main characters and the stealing capers are similar, the rest of the movie (like the cousin rivalry, among others) is entirely Wes Anderson. I had never seen a Wes Anderson movie before, although I had long heard of his work like ""Rushmore"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". But after watching ""Mr. Fox,"" I think I will check them out."
"destroy-apathy","8","0","1","27 January 2010"," Works for all the family
","Context: Saw this at a kids showing on a Saturday morning (quid each), with the whole family hoping that Mr Fox crosses the demographics correctly, entertaining my three year old son and four year old nephew as well as me, an established fan of Wes Anderson's work and my wife who neither loves nor loathes his other films.<br/><br/>The kids: Well by the end of the film the kids were still sat there and hadn't become bored or restless. My son particularly liked Mr Fox's whistle clicky thing and attempted to replicate it at every instance. The animation was easily entertaining enough to hold their attention and have them laughing along, commenting and shouting out what was happening on nunerous occasions.<br/><br/>As for me, I was more than happy with the pacing of the film, the characters within and the overall message. Controversial as this may be, I didn't think too much to Life Aquatic and I still haven't seen Darjeeling, so after hearing bad things about this one from most commentators at the time of its release, I was apprehensive. The dialogue between characters had Anderson's stamp all over it and gave all the characters the depth that they required.<br/><br/>I liked the overall theme of the film; the animal characters seemingly representing independent retailers: mere mortals up against the conglomerates realised in this film through the form of the big farmers. All evil in their own right but led by one particular cold blooded, cider brewing machine-farmer. This all sounds very cliché at the minute, which is all fine but things that follow the structure too definitively often bore me a little too much and end up too average. I think this film really drifted from this when approaching its conclusion. Mr Fox wanted out of the life he was in and wanted bigger things; the usual message here would be for this to fail and him to go ""oh yeah, everything was fine before and I should go back to that with my tail between my legs"". Well this film does neither this nor have his new vision a success, instead a new outcome is reached. The animals live in a new environment: a sewer that can easily be seen to represent a modern urban setting. What this means to me is that individuals/society can rise from a traditional and more recognisably natural level, whilst not succumbing to 'the man'. They can live in a new setting, not growing the way that people envisage they should just because that's how people did in previous generations, being defined by class and the family skill set that you are born into; you can decide who you want to be and create your own little narrative. This does not mean that you have to sell your soul, benefiting only yourself and thus lose your humanity. Nor does it mean that you reject the idea of skilled individuals in a society being masters of their class and contributing together for the benefit of society as a whole, hence the fact that all these tradesmen: the lawyer, the tailor, etc all live in this sewer environment. The part that tops this off, the icing on the cake if you will, is that it does not look down upon the establishment of the farmer (conglomerate) owned supermarket, rather it shows that free individuals can exploit these resources rather than being dictated to by them.<br/><br/>This overall message celebrates the state of contemporary western society rather than being hopelessly and nostalgically conservative. It shows that there are flaws but that this is how we are, we have got to this point by following our hearts, rather than doing what others consider to be the right thing. Just as Mrs Fox condones Mr Fox's irrational actions that jeopardize the lives of his friends and family; she condones this because she understands that to suppress one's real life is far worse even if it is the safer option.<br/><br/>www.destroy-apathy.blogspot.com"

","If you are to invent a story about a fox family surviving all the crude farmers in the world, would you also invent a nursery rhyme for it? Of course you will. But the awesomeness in this simple story comes from many other things.<br/><br/>The weird, slightly exaggerating human portraits plus the fairy tale set-ups and everything already gave this story an exotic touch. Having George Clooney and Meryl Streep dubbing the Fox couple certainly dumped more grown-up ingredients into it. After so many years of Wallace and Gromit or Coraline, you might just become picky about production values of clay animations. Try to sit through the first minute realizing it's not as polished as other technically-excellent animations, and it will reward you a lot more. Seeing the twitching movements and little mannerisms of Mr. Fox in classic songs is really one-of-a-kind enjoyment. simply put, you don't really need much brain to enjoy it, but you certainly need more sensibility to fetch everything intended.<br/><br/>One thing good about fairy tale is you don't really need to explain why the protagonists are robbers, and why do they kill chickens, and stuff like that. Down to its core, it's still a very heart-warming family drama. For the record, if you don't want your little boy to adapt a crime career like Mr. Fox, you'd better sit through this fantastic movie with him because it's gonna render some great sweet family talk!Go to see it! 9/10 for heartwarming fun!"

What didn't I like? Thankfully, there are very few things I disliked; but my major bone to pick was sadly one of the casting choices. For some reason (maybe I'm just too familiar with him), hearing George Clooney as Mr. Fox himself just didn't gel with me. I just couldn't accept this voice coming from that character, and it was rather hard not to see the person over the puppet. Perhaps if I was younger and had no real idea who Clooney was, it may have set better. In any case, that's really the only serious issue I had with the film itself. The story itself is nothing short of brilliant; it really does have something for everyone without being stupid. It's one of the few ""family"" films lately that has the 'nards to toss a bit of grimness and real darkness into the mix.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox's actions DO have very severe consequences, not only for his own family but everyone around him as well.

","I came to this with an open mind and had none of the misgivings that some others brought with them.<br/><br/>I know there are people out there who knew 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' in book form, but I'd never heard of it, and I'd read a lot of Roald Dahl, particularly the short stories. The film's setting is clearly Home Counties England, somewhere between Reading and Cheltenham, but the half-Norwegian Dahl was such an Americanized writer that I never really thought of him as really English, so I had no problem with the American actors who played the animals.<br/><br/>The charm of the film is in its unpretentious sets and its refusal to engage in grand themes. That movie-trailer scene of Clooney/Foxy looking at the stars and wondering why he's a fox and not a badger--that seems to be joke about all overwrought film scripts. The film ends with a dance in a supermarket--what could be less pretentious or more open-ended? I do feel it is a shame that more couldn't be done with Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. She has nothing to do but stand around and be the wary, censorious wife. Most of the other characters are variants of the Wes Anderson stock company we've been looking at since 'Bottle Rocket,' and that's fine with me, but it makes the characterization flatter than it needs to be. The most exciting character is Willem Dafoe's rat, who never gets a chance to develop.<br/><br/>Still, it's all very pleasant and technologically interesting, without ever hitting you over the head with techno-innovations and philosophical pain. That's charming enough in itself."

","There are many criticisms towards Wes Anderson films, mainly, that they are pretty to look at but do not have much beneath the surface. To that I respond if you do not see anything beneath it's because you are not looking. Fantastic Mr. Fox is like many of Anderson's past endeavors: The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited. It's centered around the importance of family and what you will do to protect them.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox is fantastic, as his wife and his children, but being fantastic sometimes isn't enough. Tired of the inertia of daily life Mr. Fox steals from the top three farmers in the area in an effort to reclaim some of that, ""pure wild animal craziness"". Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) seeking a responsible husband to take care of her and her children wants no part of his coop-raiding days and seeks an end to all of it. Unfortunately Mr. Fox does not heed her advice and Boggis, Bunce and Bean launch an all-out war against Fox and his family.<br/><br/>George Clooney was perfect casting for Mr. Fox, the suave, sly and often persuasive head of the Fox family who realizing he is reaching up there in years decides to just be what he is - a wild animal. Uncharacteristic to most of Mr. Clooney's roles, however, is the emotional vulnerability he lends to Mr. Fox. Despite the smooth polished exterior he has created, Mr. Fox is not all that different from his introverted son, Ash.<br/><br/>Anderson's latest brings back some of the fun of Rushmore that Darjeeling lacked and it shows. The earth tones used to create the home of the characters evoke a warm, friendly feeling and ground the story in a way that sometimes The Life Aquatic did not. It really is a pleasure to see stop-motion animation revived and done so well.<br/><br/>Led by an excellent voice cast headed by Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Dafoe and Murray(see 9, this what an actual ensemble animation film looks like) each character is fleshed out effectively to avoid cardboard cutouts."

Both of Ash's parents seem more interested in his more confident and talented cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), who is staying temporarily with the family.<br/><br/>Wes Anderson has consistently been a director interested in the dysfunctional family. The Royal Tenenbaums detailed the way that a selfish and scheming father became disconnected from his incredibly talented children and then eventually reunited his family. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou continued with similar themes through the way a series of dangerous sea adventures initially separated but then brought together a man and the son he never knew he had. While Rushmore, one of the earlier Anderson films, was essentially about the way a schoolboy had to find his feet, amidst his own crazy and often reckless behaviour. The continuation of these same themes throughout this film carries an air of familiarity about it. Mr. Fox's continuous need for risk and danger, even in spite of the danger it brings to his family and neighbours, illustrates his arrogance and his ego, in a similar vein to the men in Anderson's previous films. While the use of Schwartzman's voice work here, whose big break came from playing the boy in Rushmore, further echoes the similarities between his roles in both films. Yet as with nearly all of Anderson's films, it is the charm and the humour that he brings to the material as a writer and director, which makes this familiar territory still engaging for adults and well worth visiting once more. The rapid pacing of the film though ensures that the narrative and its questions of self and existence are not overstated in a way that will isolate children from the film though. There is a very solid balance between action and more thoughtful moments in the narrative.<br/><br/>The way that Fantastic Mr. Fox has been visually constructed also reflects Anderson's appreciation for the offbeat and quirky tones of all of his films. This is a 2D film that uses both puppets and clay animation techniques as well. It may not have the sheer beauty and slickness of Pixar's Up, but it is certainly just as dynamic and exciting, particularly during its action sequences. The rapid variations in angles to a scene and the changes in perspective and depth, make this one of the most uniquely photographed animated pictures in several years. The level of detail in the houses and locations is splendid, reflecting the extraordinary amount of time and care that was taken to create this world. Much of the furniture in the film was apparently modelled on the pieces from Dahl's own home itself, suggesting there is still great intent to keep the spirit of the original author alive, in spite of the thorough expansion of the source material. The richness of the visuals is further complimented through the tremendous work of the voice cast. The use of an entirely American cast in a traditional English story is an initially skeptical decision. Yet George Clooney is a perfect fit as Mr. Fox because he is provided with sharp dialogue and focused characterisation that allows him to convey a sense of charm, arrogance and sneakiness throughout the film. Both Meryl Streep and Jason Schwartzman are thoroughly convincing supports too. Although Willem Dafoe is a bit creepy as a sleazy, kung fu fighting rat. It because of Anderson's script though, with his trademark deadpan humour, that he is able to really ignite the enthusiasm of a very strong, well-known cast.<br/><br/>This is a rather small film with common themes and relationships from Anderson, but because of the wittiness of the script, in providing such clever writing to the cast and the audience, it remains a real pleasure to watch. The more serious and complex subtext of the narrative might be overlooked by very small children, but they will still thoroughly relish the unique look and style of the film and the very inventive and well designed action sequences. It might not quite reach the emotional core of Up but there is still something for everyone in Fantastic Mr. Fox."
"dbborroughs","6","0","1","28 December 2009"," Good film seems more Wes Anderson and less Roald Dahl
","Wes Anderson takes a Rolad Dahl film and makes it his own. There is no getting around it this is an Anderson film except animated. If you don't like Anderson's style then just stay away. If you do, then give it a shot. The plot has George Clooney's Fox settling down with Meyrl Streep when she is pregnant. Years later he's a columnist for a newspaper and is feeling middle aged. He moves his family into a new house and despite promising his wife never to steal chickens again, he begins to go back to his old ways which precipitates a war with the three biggest farmers in the country. An amusing film filled with angst and humor and Anderson's skewed view of life. If Anderson sold this as a kids film he has proved once again how dense the people in Hollywood really are since the vast majority of this film would go over most kid's heads. I like the film but I don't see it as the be all and end all, certainly I wouldn't put as the front runner for this years animated Oscar. My problems with the film stem from the films rambling nature which took up much of the first half. Once the war starts the film seems to settle down, though to me the ending, which was cribbed from Dahl's notes seems an after thought. I do like that Clooney's lead is very fallible, but at the same time he is kind of a jerk and more than once I wanted to shout at the screen questions about why everyone was still around him. Reservations aside this is very much worth seeing if you like Anderson's style."
"gregking4","7","0","1","27 December 2009"," a beautifully constructed animated world of imagination and fancy that will appeal to all ages
","Fantastic Mr Fox marks Wes Anderson's first foray into animation, and he uses the stop motion process effectively. Fantastic Mr Fox has been adapted from Roald Dahl's short story, and Anderson's droll sense of humor makes for a perfect match with Dahl's offbeat sensibility. It takes a certain sensibility to do justice to Roald Dahl's tales – Tim Burton beautifully adapted his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and gave it a suitably surreal visual style that enriched the story – and Anderson has a similar aesthetic approach here. Mr Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a lovable rogue. At the urging of his wife (Meryl Streep) though he is forced to give away his usual habits of stealing chickens and settle down with a regular job to support his family. He lands a job as a journalist. But surrounded by a chicken farm, a squab farm and a cider distillery, temptation is too great. Eventually he secretly reverts back to his old habits of raiding the local chicken warehouses at night. He is also seeking revenge on the evil farmer who blew off his tail with a shotgun. Boggins, Bean and Bunce, a trifecta of local farmers tired of his raids on their chicken farms, threaten to drive him away by destroying the woods he calls home. Mr Fox gathers together his friends and family to try and outwit them. He also has to deal with his self-absorbed slacker son Ash (Jason Schwartzmann). Ash falls into a funk when he finds himself constantly being compared to his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) who is spending the summer with his family, and who proves a dab hand at just about every activity he attempts. Anderson and his regular co-writer Noah Baumbach have expanded on the original source. While they still remain faithful to its spirit the pair have suffused the material with a layer of darkness. Anderson has stamped his own take on the story with his usual quirky and subversive wit. The insightful examination of the dynamics of the dysfunctional Fox family; is also a feature of his previous films like The Royal Tannenbaums. Anderson and his production team have created a vibrant and believable world for his characters to inhabit. The puppetry is superb, and the animals are given a real sense of texture. A superb voice cast brings the flawed characters to life, and apparently Anderson recorded them together in a sound booth on a Connecticut farm rather than in isolation in sound booths in a studio. Clooney is perfectly cast here as the incredibly daring Mr Fox; slick and very smooth his laid back comic approach reminds audiences of a foxy equivalent of his Danny Ocean character. His signature whistle and finger click becomes ingratiating. Streep is very good as his patient and knowing wife. Anderson has used many of his regulars to provide the voices for supporting characters, including Bill Murray, who plays a lawyer badger, Owen Wilson and Schwartzmann. Willem Dafoe provides the voice of a rat security guard, while Michael Gambon brings a touch of malevolence to his role as Farmer Bean. With Fantastic Mr Fox Anderson has created a beautifully constructed animated world of imagination and fancy that will appeal to all ages."

","I had read this funny short story from Roald Dahl (author of The BFG, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and other stories), about a very clever fox who steal poultry from farmer neighbours for his family; besides I love foxes. I had seen the new ""Mr. Fox"" animated film two Fridays ago.<br/><br/>In this film, Mr. Fox a newspaper columnist living in a den with his landscape-painter wife Felicity and son Ash, wanted to do something big - ""My father died at seven and a half. I don't want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm going to do something about it."" So he went and bought a tree-house. But his lawyer Mr. Badger warns him not to buy the tree property, because near the area, three very mean,rich farmers Mr. Boggis the chicken farmer as fat as a young male elephant seal because of eating chicken. Short and dumpy Mr. Bunce the goose/duck farmer who eats doughnuts stuffed with goose pâté. And lean Mr. Bean the turkey/apple farmer known also for his alcoholic Apple Cider. Now these farmers are so mean, that the local children would sing a limerick to taunt them : ""Boggis and Bunce and Bean One fat, one short, one lean These horrible crooks So different in looks Were none the less equally mean."" But despite the warnings, Mr. Fox and his family moved in the tree-house. Then (I think) a week after the move, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson, comes for a visit while his father is ill (with I don't know what). Of course for Ash, it becomes a rivalry issue in athletics and his father's praise. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox ponder over what Badger said. So despite the promise he had made to Felicity years ago (the beginning of the film), he and Kylie the opossum building superintendent, sneak out at night and steal various types of produce and poultry from one farm to another...without his wife knowing, and also three angry farmers out to get him.<br/><br/>That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends. Overall, I really enjoy this film."
"blogandsqualor","10","0","2","20 December 2009"," A Modern Classic for All Ages and Viewers
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is not just the ultimate Wes Anderson film; it's also one of the most unique works of art ever released, an instant classic for kids, adults, hipsters, and the rest of us at large. It captures a magic that few, if any filmmaker has ever been able to find, and moves Anderson from beloved to genius.<br/><br/>Based on the classic Roald Dahl tale, Anderson's take follows Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) through his mid-life, or 7 year-old crisis. Once a talented and adventurous bird thief, he now finds himself living in a hole with a dead end job, a beautiful wife (the perfect Meryl Streep) and a disappointment of a son (stand-out Jason Schwartzman). After an impulsive move into a larger home within a tree trunk and a visit by his talented nephew Kristofferson, Mr. Fox finds himself drawn back into his old ways and into the chicken coups of big box farming operators Boggis, Bunce, and Bean (Michael Gambon).<br/><br/>Like all Anderson movies (most notably The Royal Tenebaums), this film occupies a strange mental and physical space that's both beautiful and intriguing, always evoking a nostalgia that you can't quite place but know deep in your heart. But unlike his other films, it's as if everything that is Wes Anderson was finally allowed to fully germinate and blooms in this entirely stop motion film. Every shot contains an inventive touch that hearkens back the genius of Chuck Jones' Looney Tunes and the twisted beauty of Dahl's England, the town and interiors mirroring Dahl's own home and village. One of the most beautiful and haunting scenes is a glimpse of a wolf across the road; an iconic image that has forever been burned on my brain. The scene pictured below is another example (especially when the boys turn off the lights and switch on a play train that slides into the ""real"" train on the outside), so rich in atmosphere that it leaves me smiling every time I get a glimpse of it.<br/><br/>Anderson is known for being an obsessive, difficult, and anal-retentive director, all characteristics that allowed him to complete such an impressive work. The film is flawless in its execution. Close-ups on the foxes' faces are expressive and incredibly lifelike. Smoke and flowing water feel real and visceral even if they are just a few cotton balls strung together. Most importantly, the foxes and celebrity voices melt into their surroundings, allowing the film to shake off any box it might have been forced into. Combined with the hilarious, snappy script by Noah Baumbach (Anderson fanboy of The Squid and the Whale fame), you forget you're watching animals or Clooney on screen and fall in love with each character independently.<br/><br/>The music is the final piece of the puzzle. Anderson throws a mix of Beach Boys, Burl Ives, and The Wellingtons among others, my favorite being the inclusion of the love story from Disney's Robin Hood (which starred two foxes).<br/><br/>I don't know what else to say, other than it's utterly, indelibly, and totally fantastic. You'll just have to see it yourself."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox was a very delightful and charming film. It is a film that perhaps young children will not understand or be interested in, but it has a lot of intelligence put into it. The voice performances were fantastic, as was the animation. At times though I could not help but admire the film more than enjoy it, since I thought that at times I was not entertained by it so much. But since it has some very quotable lines and upbeat music unlike any other animated film, props have to be given to it. I have only seen three animated films, this, Up,, and Coraline, and cannot rank any of them. To me, any of them are worthy of winning the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and I do hope they all get nominated. Overall, a pleasing film."

","I loved the book Fantastic Mr Fox, I love dry humour. The combination was just perfect, it was like what would have really happened if Roald Dahl had added all the tiny intricacy's of fox family life. This is film making at its best, no shiny bells and whistles, just take a story and expand on it and bring it to life. Roald Dhal would have been proud because he was a pretty warped man with a dry sense of humour. There was so much to see in this film, tiny details that if u blink you would miss. The hilarity of them digging and the premise of their lifestyle as wild animals is just genius and just works. Wes Anderson just tells story's how they should be told, there is a reality to his work that separates his films from all the trash that you usually watch. Its the sort of thing that wouldn't work with every film but when he gets it right it works so well. I have to give this an 8/10 for originality, style and overall humour. I will most definitely buy this on DVD and sit and watch after a night out with friends. I can't say that about many other Wes Anderson films."
"Reef-Shark","10","0","2","16 December 2009"," Best comedy of 2009!
","When I first heard word of Wes Anderson adapting one of Roald Dahl's books I of course instantly was both interested and concerned. Being a Houstonian I have always felt inclined to support the work of Houston-born writer/director Wes Anderson.<br/><br/>Thus far I've enjoyed his dry sense of humor; kind of like an Americanized version of British humor...but it is also very adult, sophisticated humor, so I couldn't imagine him doing a family movie.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I have one thing to say...Fantastic Mr. Fox certainly is FANTASTIC! Wes Anderson has made one of the best films of 2009; one that is just as good as his other movies, if not being his best yet! Everything, from voice-actors, to the use of stop animation: this film is perfectly balanced in what is certainly the best comedy of the year.<br/><br/>How did Wes Anderson pull it off? Well, he honestly didn't make this so much as a kid's movie as he did make another entry in his series of odd-ball comedies- only this time cutting back mature subjects to a PG-rating. What results is a very mature comedy that doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks or slapstick for laughs (though there is a bit of slapstick for those kids who won't understand the humor in Anderson's dialog).<br/><br/>The story centers on Mr. Fox (voiced by the always entertaining George Clooney), who is the foxiest fox who ever foxed. An expert chicken thief he likes living dangerously...that is until his lover (voiced by Meryl Streep) becomes pregnant and demands that they settle down. After getting caught in a fox trap he agrees to her terms that if they survive he shall never steal again.<br/><br/>Two years later (which is far more in fox years) the couple is living in a hole with their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzmen). Mr. Fox is a newspaper columnist, who is fairly certain no one actual reads his column and is now upset that he won't amount to anything (like his father) so he decides they must move out. His choice is a tree, but this tree happens to be located next door to the three meanest farmers the animals have ever seen. His lawyer, Badger (voiced by Anderson regular Bill Murray) tries to talk Fox out of his choice home, but he won't hear it.<br/><br/>After moving to the tree they are joined by their nephew Kristofferson (voiced by Eric Chase Anderson) who quickly becomes Ash's center of jealousy. Kristofferson is perfect in just about every way, spending his time meditating while practicing yoga, being naturally gifted in sports - everything Ash wishes he was.<br/><br/>But while those trivial matters go on Mr. Fox can't resist the call of the wild, and with his opossum building superintendent, Kylie (voiced by Wallace Wolodarsky) plans a return to his dangerous life of ""cussing with"" the farmers' heads. At first this starts as simple crimes, but soon the farmers declare war against Mr. Fox and the entire animal populace! It becomes the job of Fox save everyone from the farmers' wrath...which he caused! <br/><br/>There's also a great (not to mention HILARIOUS) bit involving Willem Dafoe as an insane, finger snapping rat-henchman under the employ of the farmers, but I wouldn't spoil that for the you! You'll have to see the movie to get what I'm talking bout.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox of course differs from its source material, but for what it is Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great comedy. I say ""comedy"" instead of ""animation"" or ""Family"" movie because its values really are more comedy oriented than they are trying to entertain an entire group of people. In fact, the theater I saw this movie in was full of kids under the age of 10 and very seldom did any of them laugh: the humor was just way over their heads, and I won't hold that against them.<br/><br/>For adults and mat kids over the age of 10 or so Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fantasy comedy full of whimsical characters that will leave them chuckling, and quoting its ingenious script long after they've left the theater. Parents can also approve of the film's message of ""everyone has their own individual talents,"" be it thief, landscape artist, or demolitions expert.<br/><br/>It won't stand up against a movie like Pixar's Up in a 'Best Animated Feature' contest, but then again I doubt it was even trying to. What the movie does is set out to be a sophisticated comedy - something that is rated PG, but is just as good as any comedy directly aimed at older audiences. Fantastic Mr. Fox is rated PG but is more adult and sophisticated than this year's smash hit The Hangover.<br/><br/>Fantastic Mr. Fox truly is the most fantastic movie of the year."
"yousoldmysoulforpogs","6","0","1","14 December 2009"," Has its place
","Didn't quite meet expectations but still okay I guess. Wes Anderson is definitely a director who carries specific traits to all his films and although I enjoyed ""The Darjeeling Limited"", and ""Rushmore"" wasn't BAD or anything, I still don't get the fuss over ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" (is it the ironic surreal ""humour""? the soundtrack? Bill Murray?). To sum up Anderson's tac to film-making is simple: ""off-beat, ironic, absurdist sense of humour"". However, it often fails, and in the case of ""Fox"", the frequent (yet sparsely successful) stabs at humour arguably get in the way of what could (and again arguably should) be a whacky inventive narrative. Despite this, the film was an interesting experience - most notably because I initially persisted to attempt to view it as a child's film - when on the whole, it really isn't and it's plain to conclude from a number of conversations that it really wanted to be 'adult' and swear and talk about sex. Considering the reputation of the title's original novel, this is a reality that ultimately couldn't materialise - which is a real shame because I think the humour might have actually worked if it could. I wasn't entirely impressed by the soundtrack either sadly. If perhaps Anderson had asked Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo to write music like he has done on so many occasions already (suitably a veteran in soundtrack-writing for children's programming -repeat 'children's'), I could be claiming different. I won't say the movie's bad because honestly, it isn't really. Most Roald Dahl stories, no matter how wide a film treatment can be, always seem to wind up finishing excellent and though I probably wouldn't choose to watch this film again, it has its place."
"TOMNEL","8","0","2","11 December 2009"," An animation style all it's own, and to back it up, great characters.
","Wes Anderson has been criticized for his works being too slow, and not funny enough, and for a variety of things. Like all of his other films, this is unmistakably a Wes Anderson film through and through, with offbeat characters, and quietly funny scenes, and subtle character development. This movie is quite subtle in the jokes and in a lot of lines, so children may or may not understand different parts of the film to be funny, but even if they don't they'll be dazzled by the odd, but amazing looking animation.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (George Clooney) has to give up his life as a chicken thief once he finds out Mrs. Felicity Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant. Two human years later he's working as a newspaper columnist to feed his wife and his not so athletic son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox, being the wild animal that he is, grows tired of his mundane life and along with his buddy Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky), he begins robbing farms again, which angers three farmers who are dead set on killing Mr. Fox. Meanwhile, Fox's athletic nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) moves in and makes Ash jealous. Chaos ensues throughout.<br/><br/>This movie's animation style is a style of it's own. It's stop motion animated, and has that extra dimension because of this, but instead of making all kinds of wide sets to put the characters on, everything is flat. This movie at times resembles a traditionally drawn cartoon, because of it's flat animation. That sounds like a bad thing, but it is actually very unique and great to look at. The sets and the characters and everything just look amazing.<br/><br/>Character development is subtle...especially to kids. It will definitely either be very subtle or fly over kids' heads altogether. One scene Ash in mean to Kristofferson because he's jealous, and they bond silently over the running of a toy train. It's a sweet scene, but again development is quiet and implied. Another scene (not giving away any spoilers here), where the simple response of a creature after a long speech is to raise it's arm in an agreeing manner, is also quiet but meaningful.<br/><br/>Problems with this movie range from some bouts of ""humorous"" dialogue that aren't overly hilarious, to strange character quirks that have you puzzled until the end, but it's still a well done, original and entertaining family film. Director/writer Wes Anderson did a good job writing like himself but keeping the Roald Dahl touch in there.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. PG for fake cussing, drinking and smoking (Yeah, that's right, movies are rated up for smoking now!)"
"moviemanMA","10","0","2","10 December 2009"," Anderson strikes again
","When a director whose films have taken on a steady fan base decides to change direction with an entirely new genre, it's a risky move. None as risky as Wes Anderson's latest work Fantastic Mr. Fox, his animated feature film debut. I can't think of any filmmakers going behind the camera of an animated film having been this successful in live action.<br/><br/>Well, his risk has payed off and I am confident in saying that Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the year's best. It is based on the classic children's book of the same name by famed writer Roald Dahl. It's the story of a fox who gets the idea of stealing from three of the meanest local farmers: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. It has been many years since I have read the book, but it was an excellent read when growing up.<br/><br/>When I saw that Anderson was making this film, I was as anxious as ever. Then I saw the trailer and all my worries went away. Anderson is able to transfer his style to animation flawlessly. His use of tracking side shots, symmetric division of the screen with his characters, colorful sets, and his amazing soundtrack with both original tracks and carefully selected tracks from other artists like Burl Ives, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>Rather than just getting a bunch of big name actors in a sound studio one at a time, Anderson devised a system where he actually the recorded the actors acting out what their characters are doing. Be it eating, rolling, or digging, the actors performed their actions along with their lines. The film features some of Anderson's stars from other films like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wallace Woldarsky, and Michael Gamdon, as well as two important lead performances by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. I love the casting Anderson chose for each character. I don't think it could have gone any better.<br/><br/>Anderson uses stop animation wonderfully here. It gives the characters a certain edge to them and it makes them wacky enough and serious enough so that kids and adults can enjoy the whole production. It's rated PG and I think that parents will agree that some of the film just isn't for kids, and that is not a knock against the film. I just don't think kids will really get what Anderson is trying to accomplish here. It's not too graphic or inappropriate but some of the humor is a little over their heads. No worries though, kids will love it and will not be harmed by it in any way.<br/><br/>There is so much to enjoy here. The clever writing, the beautiful sets, and the, I hate to say it, fantastic story, all add up to an impressive film that shows Anderson is a filmmaker capable of doing whatever he wants. Perhaps a black and white, silent film starring only dogs. On second thought that might be right in his wheelhouse. I have to think of a real challenge for him."

","This is easily Wes Anderson's finest film. I've enjoyed his films in the past but I never thought any of them were truly 'fantastic'! But, this one is extremely amusing, mesmerizing, and an absolute joy to watch. <br/><br/>Much will likely be made of the quality of special effects. Yet, that will dramatically miss the point of this great film. The actors voices are perfect for their characters. But, regardless of the actors or special effects, what ultimately makes a movie rise above others (as evidenced by the greatness of the first three Star Wars films, for example, as opposed to the droll final three) is writing and dialog. <br/><br/>The combination of Anderson's best dialog of any film he's written or directed with excellent interpretation and the great original story line from Roald Dahl and voilÃ  - a fantastic film about a fantastic fox. <br/><br/>This simply has not been a banner year for films. In fact, there haven't been many great movies in recent years (one wonders - did all the writers simply quit permanently?).

There really is so much to see and it seems impossible to take it all in with just one viewing. This film has a look to it that no other movie I can think of has. It's very fascinating to look at. I love the way that the fur subtly moved on the faces of the foxes; a very nice touch.<br/><br/>The script is really neat too. Going into it, I was not really sure how this film would come out plot-wise, but I think it really turned out quite nicely. I have said in other reviews that Wes Anderson is my favorite director right now and this film definitely has his style and wit throughout. <br/><br/>All the characters are quite interesting as well. One of my favorite scenes was the introduction of the three human villains. It is very memorable and the descriptions used were very impactful. <br/><br/>This movie is not realistic, nor does it try to be.

"dfranzen70","8","0","1","3 December 2009"," Utterly charming and entertaining
","Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roald Dahl's book is clever, audacious, and a lot of fun. Shot using stop animation, this one-of-a-kind movie has the elegance of both The Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with the quirkiness you'd expect from an Anderson film. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray lend distinctive voices to a witty, delicious script.<br/><br/>Mr. Fox (Clooney) is an unrepentant thief until he makes a promise to Mrs. Fox (Streep) that he'll quit for good (after he informs him that she's pregnant) if they escape a farmer's trap. They do, and he makes good on the promise, moving the family from their underground home to an isolated tree near three vicious, desperate super farmers. But it's not long before Mr. Fox is pining to pull off One More Job, which turns into several more jobs, with the help of Kylie the opossum.<br/><br/>However, the three farmers aren't your typical placid farmfolk, they're vengeful jerks, so after Mr. Fox makes off with much of their birds and cider, they vow revenge, which includes using a backhoe to remove not only the tree but also a huge chunk of the earth.<br/><br/>There's also an interesting subplot involving Mr. Fox's son Ash (Schwartzman), who feels that his parents think he's worthless and that he can't possibly compete with the super-debonair Mr. Fox. Ash is at that awkward age anyway, so dealing with his famed dad isn't easy. Then, on top of that, Ash's cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) arrives for an extended stay, and he's perfect in virtually everything. So poor Ash can't measure up to his dad OR his cousin.<br/><br/>What makes this movie really work, though, is the magnificent animation style. We've all seen those old Rankin-Fitch Christmas classics, right? This is sort of like that, only even more stylized and fluid. The film was shot at a rate of 12 frames per second, rather than the standard 24, so that viewers could really see the actual stop-motion animation process itself. And the result is that the movie feels more organic, more natural, and more poetic.<br/><br/>A Wes Anderson movie is usually oddly endearing anyway, but this one is exceptional in its uniquity. The set pieces are dazzling (for example, the hair on the humans is from actual human hair, from the movie's crew), and the backgrounds are meticulous works of art. Neat trivia: Mr. Fox's study is a faithful recreation of Roald Dahl's garden hut, where he wrote most of his beloved books.<br/><br/>It's fun seeing Clooney in a role he's best suited to anyway, the devilish rogue. (One gets the feeling sometimes that he'd really like to be James Bond.) Mr. Fox is certainly not without his flaws (need for spotlight, need to be right, delusions of grandeur), but his heart belongs to his family and to the other woodland creatures. The characters are nuanced just enough for kids to grasp their intentions and attitudes while not being too simplistic for adults to enjoy."

","This is one of the best movies in 2009's animated film circuit. I was shocked back in 2008 when Ben Lyon said 'rent it' for ""Igor"" (wich sucked). well at least I saw some movie this year to make up for seeing ""Igor"" & this is one of them Fantastic Mr. Fox is the best animated movie ever, next to ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" & ""Astro Boy"".<br/><br/>the jokes are very good, I don't know why Michale Phillips from ""At The Movies"" said to skip this one. the jokes are really 'that' funny, 'espeacilly' the pine-corn grenade fire scene.<br/><br/>people who don't like this movie thinks it's fallen flat & lost it's charm. but its not. watch Mr. Fox, because it's cool, funny, witty, smart, & better than ""Shark Tale"" & ""Igor"" combined."

","A story about two foxes, Mr. & Mrs. Fox who once had a living in stealing chickens from a farm. However after escaping from a trap, Mrs. Fox told her husband that she doesn't want to steal chickens anymore due to the risk of getting trap became higher than before. Mr. Fox ending up agreeing with his wife that he'll find a new line of work in order for them to start a family. Some years later, Mr. Fox is now a newspaper writer for a column that's not very well received in the paper. Mrs. Fox spends her time doing scenery paintings. They both ended up having a son who tries to become an athlete but is too short to be fitted for sports.<br/><br/>Everything seem good for Mr. Fox & his family, only with the exception on his career as a newspaper writer and the fox hole they're living in. So he goes to a real estate agent to check out on a tree that is on sale. The reason being is that it's next door to three big time farms owned by Mr. Boggis, Bunce, & Bean. All three of the farmers don't tolerate with wild animals or carnivores that steal their profits. Mr. Fox asked his lawyer about it, but his lawyer says it's not wise to live next to three wildlife hating farmers. However Mr. Fox ignores his lawyer's advice and has his family move in. While keeping it a secret from his wife, he plots out three plans to steal from each of the three farmers their profits. As it's in a foxes's nature to steal chickens and anything else that's editable. However messing with these three farmers would mean trouble to Mr. Fox and anyone who's connected with him. The farmers on't rest until Mr. Fox is shot and stuffed with cotton. But pretty soon, the farmers will learn that you should never try to out smart a fox.<br/><br/>I never read the book, but I gotta say I really enjoyed this movie. For Wes Anderson's first animated film, I love the idea of the whole film made in Stop Motion Animation instead of the now commonly done CGI. That's one of the reasons this movie stands out more than the recently released animated films. I also love the story, action, & character alike. I've seen Wes's other films so I knew this movie was going to have some great moments and at least one memorable quote. Just like what was presented in his previous films. Also it has an all star cast along with people who have worked with Wes in the past.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an animated movie that looks better than Planet 51, then Fantastic Mr. Fox is the other choice. Cause this movie is something that both kids and adults will enjoy together. To me it's a movie I'll definitely watch again and again."

","Fantastic Mr. Fox is not a bad movie. It is a bit like Ocean's Eleven only animated, which means it is okay but nothing to get too excited about. While the movie has several shortcoming, its main problem is that it is not for kids. While many animated movies contain content for adults to keep them from getting completely bored while catering mostly for the target audience - that is, kids - this movie is for adults only and kids (and by that I mean anyone under 14) will likely get bored. The story is too complex for kids to follow and there is no real action to speak of that will get kids excited. I sum, it is an okay grown-up movie for the DVD but nothing more."

","My spouse, more than I, loves to see kid's movies. We'd seen the preview of Fantastic Mr. Fox at the theater and I groaned at the thought of having to sit through it My impression was the animation was stiff and outdated. The color was so reddish brown it seemed ""off"" as though the film was faded. Still, we eventually ran out of movies we wanted to see and ended up at this one. Boy, what a pleasant surprise! I had seen Gene Shalit review it the other day and he sure didn't give it raves. Critics don't phase me much but I was already doubtful. In the end, I can't promise everyone will enjoy it as much as we did. It depends on your sense of humor re: what you think is funny. However, for us it had at least two ""laugh out loud"" moments, spontaneous laughs where you even surprise yourself. The music, the characters, the setting, are all offbeat in a way that suits this story. I loved the personalities. The rat was hilarious and this was one entertaining movie. Kids will probably enjoy it but I can't imagine that they'll enjoy it as much as adults. You won't be checking the time on your cell phone in this one."

","A lot of work went into the design and stop motion animation and a lot comes out. Mr Fox promised the wife he'd give up his wild animal ways and stick to newspaper columns, but you can't take the chicken-stealing ways out of a fox. Ultimately it leads to war with humans, and it's vulpes vulpes' ingenuity and pluck that might just give them a chance.<br/><br/>With a son and nephew (Ash and Kristofferson) learning to appreciate each other; a piano playing mole; Willem Dafoe-voiced security rat; Bill Murray's lawyer/badger; a fast talking rabbit chef and rabid beagles (don't forget the blueberries! Beagles love blueberries.) Visually looks great (would have to watch again to catch various in jokes, etc) and it was funny. Enjoyed.<br/><br/>Whistle, click-click. That's my trademark."
