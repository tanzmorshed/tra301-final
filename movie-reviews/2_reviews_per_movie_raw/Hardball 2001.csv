"Theoriginaltruebrit","Null","56","59","8 March 2002"," Much better than I expected
","Due to alot of negative reviews on this site I did not expect the movie to be as good as it was.  However after watching it this evening I was delighted by the entire experience.  While I agree that it goes along with the ""ducks"" formula it deviates from it by not showing us the final game with the final ten seconds for the team to win.  It spared us that and just let us know with the final credits that the team won.  I thought the performances in the movie were excellent, although even I (living here in the deep south) found the accents of the children a little difficult to comprehend.  As for the overall effect of the movie it entranced me, completely, I kept having to rewind scenes to view them again and again. And, more importantly, if anyone ever doubted Keanu's ability to act then one should only view the eulogy scene to know that his critics have been simply barking up the wrong tree.  Strong, emotional, sympathetic and completely believable... speaking as as part time amateur actress, do you know how hard it is to cry, and cry believably?  Do you know how hard it is to make your chin tremble..? My conversion to Mel Gibson fan was watching him ""cry"" in Lethal Weapon... this has been my reconversion to Keanu fan..., to cry so believably in a movie is worth quids in my book and to be able to express emotion in such a way is worth any amount of praise.  Wonderful movie.  Go see it."

","This is a stressful movie, with the gambling addiction and the gambling machine on one hand, and street gangs on the other.  I really like the kids and think Keanu Reeves plays it straight with them.  New York Times and local reviewers aside--way aside, this movie is definitely worth a look.  I spent eight years on Chicago's South Side, and i'm grateful a cinema team is willing to show some emotion about some of the stuff that is part of grim daily life.  The plot formula is good:  i don't like cold voyeuristic slice-of-life with this material.  I like that the material is used with an up-beat ending.  Let us enjoy the entertainment of it, and find some hope in it.   Goethe said that hope is always the better choice.  And i will say it here:  Keanu Reeves can act."
"Darguz","9","54","60","26 October 2003"," Wow.
","It never ceases to amaze me how people can have such widely differing *strong* reactions to a film. A number of negative reviews here, but let me add one more positive.<br/><br/>I loved this film, from beginning to end. I loved every aspect of it: the story, the acting, the plot. I expected just another ""Coach takes over losing team and makes them winners"" story. Those are fine stories now and then, and I was not expecting anything more than mild entertainment. But this film moved me. Now, I'm a middle-aged white boy, and while I've never been rich I've never gone hungry either, and I've never had to worry about getting shot on the way home, so maybe I don't really know what that ""sh*t"" is all about and maybe this film wasn't ""realistic"" in portraying all that; but it communicated to me, and that's what any film is all about. And sometimes in order to communicate, you have to go half way between where you are and where the other person is, and maybe that's what this film did. But whatever, I got it."
"graphixauthority","8","35","39","29 June 2003"," Kids May Gain From Seeing This Movie?
","When I first saw this movie, I watched it with my daughter who was 10 years old at the time.  The language was kind of edgy but not too serious.  I'm sure she hears worst from her friends at school (even though we try to ignore those facts). This flick had it all. From the coach struggling with his own morality, vices and (of course) romance, to the kids plagued by the daily atrocities of their neighborhood.  Through these tribulations, however, we learn that ""showing up"" (coined from the movie) was the best way to face and overcome our problems.  This applies to all of us across the board.<br/><br/>
I read a few reviews that discouraged kids from seeing this movie and I wholeheartedly disagree.  Why can we let our kids watch The Bad News Bears and The Mighty Ducks but discard a movie that gives us a taste of the reality of our inner city youth whom want to play ""Hardball""?  Yes they spoke more freely with there swearing than a kid from the burbs. But isn't that the point? They're not from the burbs.  Yes there was a shooting scene but you didn't actually see the shot hit.  But it's ok for our kids to see the Matrix where people are getting shot left and right. sheez.  I hope that one day America can stop hiding the inner city from their kids and let them know how their less fortunate counterparts living (and dying).  Maybe they will take less for granted and appreciate their situation more after seeing this flick.  Maybe they will want to help solve some of the problems when they get older except ignoring them like their parents are doing because their parents sheltered them from the same things in the 70's & 80's.  I'm not trying to sell this movie by saying it's going to change any social order or make your kid a better person.  What I'm saying is... Let them watch it, talk about it and ""YOU"" will make your kid a better person through your dialogue and time.  This movie is just to supplement your efforts."

","this movie was good. the little kids were funny, keanu reeves was pretty cool. i also saw on the news the night before i went to go see this movie that there was some big black guy whining about the language used by the kids. he said that it was a ""poor and grim representation of america's preseption of inner city children."" um..im wondering if this man even HAS kids of his own, and if he does, he should hang out with them more often. the language of the kids was strong, but if u mean to tell me that the majority of kids living in the projects, or ANYWHERE ELSE for that matter, don't use that kind of language, get your head examined. anyway, this was a good movie and i enjoyed it."
"wrygrass","10","31","41","9 September 2001"," A little miracle of a movie: moving, realistic anduplifting
","This film portrays the life of a group of boys who play one summer on a baseball league organized in the projects in Chicago. With out flinching an iota in portraying the material decay and the real fear of violence that permeates its setting, the film still shows the beauty of life--the importance of ""just showing up"" and trying. The young, unknown boys give outstanding performances which are matched by a moving performance by Keanu Reeves. Reeves, in his most emotive performance to-date, plays the team's coach who is redeemed by his contact with the kids, by simply learning to care about someone besides himself. Definitely NOT the ""Bad News Bears,"" but a great movie experience for everyone--sports lovers or not."
"aklukens","Null","8","9","8 September 2001"," Predictable but an A+ nonetheless. Parental slant to review-
","Tonight I attended a sneak preview of the movie Hardball with a 10 year old boy in tow.  Hardball shows the very gritty, dangerous life of some inner city kids who are not only trying to survive, but to find some-thing worth caring about- in this case, baseball.<br/><br/>Though not playing to a sold out house, the audience was very loud and enthusiastic, even breaking into cheers at points.  I thought the storyline was predictable (bum coach becomes a better man and gets the girl, kids learn teamwork and sportsmanship) and similar to other movies about kids sports teams.  What is unique to this movie is it's view of the kids off the field- their lives in housing projects, the dangers, drugs and problems they face just living every day.  It's a daring and very affecting storyline, and the cheering of the audience proved to me that it worked very, very well.<br/><br/>Very solid jobs by cast, including Keanu Reeves, who does a fabulous job as the shiftless/compulsive gambler/reluctant coach who becomes much more to his team after realizing these kids actually have a rougher life than his own.  This role seemed as well-suited for Reeves as The Matrix...and he didn't even look good doing it. [He does clean up and flash the famous smile near the end!]<br/><br/>The kids steal the show here- and the audience I sat with fell for them as hard as their coach did! Lots of sniffling and clapping in the house. My son loved the movie, too, the moral themes are well wrapped up in the story and not sappy.<br/><br/>Some rough language, disturbing scenes of housing project life and the gambling/bookie world, some sexual references, one death.  However, I would grab the kids and go if over first grade.  Good opportunity to talk to the kids about winning/losing, drugs, violence and education.  Best see it with your boys film since the Mighty Titans scored a touchdown.  You may want to go again..."
"philip_vanderveken","7","16","21","22 June 2005"," Not original, but it works
","I want to start by saying that this movie was actually a pleasant surprise. Knowing that this was a movie based on a true story, made with Keanu Reeves and a lot of kid-actors in it, I honestly feared the worst. But after watching it I must say that it really wasn't all that bad.<br/><br/>Sure, the story is as predictable as you can get them in Hollywood. With a desperate white guy who is forced into coaching a children's sporting team from a rough black neighborhood, you already know perfectly what to expect and of course he will only keep doing his job because of a beautiful lady at first (the kids school teacher), but in the end he will learn the true value of these kids' will to win and to make something of their lives, so they can get out of the neighborhood. No the movie never gets far away from the stereotypes. But somehow it didn't bother me all that much for once.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the best performances I've ever seen from Reeves (except for his roles in ""The Matrix"" and ""The Gift"") and despite the fact that this movie isn't a comedy, the dramatic story is relieved with some nice humorous touches. I don't know anything about baseball and normally I don't care about movies with baseball as the subject either, but for once I kept watching.<br/><br/>As a conclusion I would like to say that if you are looking for an original movie, you better start looking somewhere else, but if you want to see a drama that exceeds the average Disney boundaries, you might want to give it a try. As I already said, I was pleasantly surprised by it and that's why I give this movie a 7/10."
"Steve-176","Null","12","16","19 June 2002"," Rough head white guy coaches little black kids in Chicago baseball. Very effectively made with some tough bits that are well above average. 4 Flys Out Of Five
","In spite of its rather predictable set up Hardball is remarkably effective. It's a terrific example of a mainstream film that squeezes itself sufficiently out of the comfort zone to be both thought provoking and moving without too often lapsing into the triteness we see so often.<br/><br/>
Hardball is yet another genre movie about a desperate white guy (Keanu Reeves) forced into coaching a children's sporting team from a rough black neighbourhood. Does he coach a mob of losers to victory? Does he mature while he does the job? Do the children gain valuable insights from their new friend? Does a love interest hover for our desperado coach?<br/><br/>
The first third of Hardball shows us Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) in the throws of digging an even deeper hole for himself with bad bets. He's literally on the run from his creditors and is frantic to get one big win to get the ghouls off his back.<br/><br/>We've seen that thousands of times before on T.V. and film but Hardball worked the trick beautifully. A baseball bat smashing a hole in a wall, where a head was a few moments before, can be extraordinarily effective cinema if done right. I was sold. O'Neill's gambling mate Ticky, played by character actor John Hawkes, has a bit of Steve Buscemi look about him and that has to be a recommendation. <br/><br/>Then we meet the children. The film is set in the notorious Cabrini-Green area of Chicago, a high rise low income housing area which is being progressively torn down. Cabrini-Green is now under redevolopment in what's a bold mixed income experiment, incorporating low/no-income citizens into what an area that was always surrounded by prime real estate.<br/><br/>
The children are tough talking 13 year olds, but we're soon shown that they're very frightened. Hardball shows their world as being one where they are rightfully scared to be out after dark. One where people sit on the floor in their high rise for fear of bullets coming in through the windows. Again it was very effective film making.<br/><br/>The baseball is little league stuff in every sense of the word. The coach doesn't seem to know much about baseball and his charges, strangely, instantly improve their game on his arrival. There's the designated tear jerking triumphs and I'm sufficiently chump enough to have been sold on that too!<br/><br/>The token woman is provided by Diane Lane and she's O.K. but that whole plot line could and probably should have been left out. But Hardball was strong cinematic fare and well worth a look.<br/><br/>4 Sporting Flys Out Of Five"
"jimakros","6","15","21","25 July 2005"," i liked it a lot
","I liked this movie.Yes,its about a baseball little league,yes it has the usual ""lets be a team and win"" attitude,but its very well acted by these kids and the dialog sounds real,also its not concentrated only on the kids.<br/><br/>Its more like what the kids get to mean to this guy,who is sort of a loser,and doesn't actually care much about baseball or anything else.<br/><br/>I thought it was well acted,surprisingly good for Keanu Reeves who is not one of my favorite actors,but he seems inspired in this movie. I thought it was very well directed and the whole ghetto setting seems disturbingly realistic.It passes its social message in a simple,direct way without preaching.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a low key likable movie."

"darosslfc","8","6","8","5 September 2015"," Reality and Entertainment
","Hard Ball is a slice of life film about an aimless young man given the opportunity to make a difference in the life of ten young boys from the projects of Chicago. Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is an addict to gambling and this weakness lands him in a spot of trouble where he has to pay off two bookies and needs money fast. He reaches out to an old friend, who's in business, for cash and agrees to coach a little league team for the money. <br/><br/>The film goes on to tell the story of O'Neill and the boys as they change each others perspectives and end up helping each other become better people. John Gatins (Coach Carter, Flight) begins his writing career with this as his second feature film. It is a straight forwards predictable story but it has a special quality about it. <br/><br/>The film stays away from making things bigger than they are and opts for a realistic outlook on the lives of the characters involved. Keanu Reeves gives a performance that not many would attribute to his successful career, but is a performance that shouldn't be overlooked. Michael B. Jordan (Chronicle, Fruitvale Station) is a one of the kids and gives a performance that foreshadows his career to come.<br/><br/>Hard Ball, while not an Oscar worthy film, is one that will lift you up without asking for the suspension of belief. You don't need to put aside unrealistic happenings in the film because it doesn't try to be something its not. This film is there to give you insight into a story that you don't see everyday. It leans towards reality rather than entertainment and achieves both."
"glittergirlie8","8","6","8","16 May 2002"," very under-rated film
","One sunny afternoon, a man handed me a flier asking me if I would like to see a free screening of a movie.  Who was I to say no???  The movie was Hardball.  As first I was a little hesitant.  I like some of the work that Keanu has done but I can't say that I liked all of it.  Hardball was a pleasant surprise.  The boys made me laugh, the story made me want to cry and at one point I did.  I really do think that Keanu surprised me and made me reconsider my views on his abilities.  Given the right material and good Direction, the man can act.  One scene literally brought my friends and I to tears.  I would recommend this movie to just about anyone."
"doctorben","5","6","9","22 September 2001"," An average movie, nothing spectacular.
","Hardball is about a group of boys from the Chicago projects who play on what we must assume is the worst team in Little League.  Until, of course, down and out Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is cornered into coaching the team in return for a loan from a friend to pay off his gambling debts. Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane), the boys' teacher, is also along for part of the ride.<br/><br/>I apologize up front for the lazy synopsis I just gave but for a movie as generic and average as this I just couldn't spend the brain energy on making it anymore exciting than that.  Now don't get me wrong this wasn't really a bad movie, it just wasn't a really good movie either.  This movie seems to have a hard time figuring out what it is about.  Is it about Conor's gambling problem and his attempts to not get killed for his bad debts?  Or is it about a Little League team and a coach who learn to care for each other and rely on each other?  Or is it about Conor and Elizabeth and their relationship?  If you picked any of these answers you are wrong. It's about none of them.  Oh it dabbles in all of them but doesn't really take any of them far enough to say it is actually about them.  The movie seems to dip in and out of the different story lines without really advancing them or resolving anything.  Take the boys and the little league team for example.  They start of as the worst team on the league.  By game two they are kicking butts and taking numbers.  When did they learn all these skills.  Were they just pretending to be so bad to lure the other teams into a false sense of security?  We don't get to see Conor (Keanu) really doing any coaching or forming any bonds with the boys on the team, yet we are supposed to believe that these things happened.  One boy finds out he can't play for the team because of his age and runs off to join a gang.  What happens to him, not important apparently and Conor seems like he doesn't care either.  And the gambling thing?  Resolved halfway through and it just goes away.  We don't see him making any of these amends, we are supposed to accept that it has happened.  Plot holes galore, things not resolved, blech!  Lazy writing I say.  Now the story wasn't all bad, it was redeemed a little by the last 10 minutes, but it wasn't enough to pull this out of the average category.<br/><br/>Now lets talk a little about the actors.  I like Keanu Reeves, really I do.  It's just that he needs very specific roles.  If you need someone to look lost and confused and not much else, Keanu is your man.  I though he was perfect for The Matrix.  Really though people, as much as some of you Keanu fans want to believe it, the man can't act.  That's all there is to it.  It's not like he's reading his lines off a queue card or anything like some 'actors' (i.e. pretty boy Justin Chambers of The Musketeer) he's just a little robotic.  It's not a good show of your acting chops when you are outdone by a group of 10 year olds.  I thought all the kids in this movie were pretty good, they were likable and they had me laughing (in the good way) a few times.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was not horrible and if you are deciding between this and The Musketeer (now there was a real crapper but you can go read my review for that and find out what I really thought), Hardball should win hands down.  It's just that there are some better movies out there right now you should be putting your money down to see."
"CinematicInceptions","7","2","2","27 December 2015"," Not incredible, but rather emotional and enjoyable.
","Outside of the emotional ending, this movie isn't anything special, but I think it is a little underrated. On the surface, it's a sports movie and was advertised to be one, but there is actually not that much focus on the team as a baseball team. We only see about fifteen minutes of the team playing baseball in a couple of practices and maybe three games. The ""ship"" isn't even the climax of the movie and you don't even care that they win it, outside of that being expected by nature of the genre.<br/><br/>Most of the story centers on Conor O'Neill, whose life is not in great shape. He's deep in debt with people who probably don't have a great source of income themselves and seems generally miserable. He takes a job coaching a U-10 baseball team and eventually warms up to the kids and by the end he appreciates their situation. The couple of scenes were we see life in the kids' neighborhood, and they seemed pretty accurate- maybe a little over done at a couple points, but you hear about gang violence in the news a lot so it's probably spot on and I just have no experience to judge it on. Basically, the story is about Conor and the team giving each other hope, and this is all but stated outright over the course of the movie, so you don't have to go hunting for the theme. There are two subplots, one involving Conor's gambling habits and the other with the kids' teacher Miss Wilkes.<br/><br/>Conor is slightly reminiscent of Travis Bickle, though of course not as memorable, and is hardly what you'd call a model protagonist. Consequently, we have two foils for him: Miss Wilkes and Ticky. Miss Wilkes shows Conor's faults of not wanting to be as good a person as he can. Ticky represents Conor's former life of unsuccessful gambling and makes Conor's choice to break away from gambling a little more concrete. A couple of the players are examined more deeply to the extent that you'll probably know about half the players by name and have picked out a favorite by the end. There are a few minor antagonists in the guy from Smith and Stevens, the people Conor owes for his blown bets, and one of the opposing coaches coupled with the league administrators.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good for the most part, even from the ten kids. As expected, Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane give the best performances, but certainly not their best showings. The script is well paced and feels realistic, which is all it needs to be. There's nothing special in terms of directing outside of G-Baby's funeral at the end, which was really well done and is probably the most emotional scene in any movie I've watched.<br/><br/>It's a very different role for Keanu Reeves, so don't expect him to have any action-hero moments like in the Matrix. There might be a few things that annoy you like the players trash talking each other or Miss Wilkes being shown as sort of a perfect character. Outside of that it should be mildly entertaining for any given viewer, so keep it on until you get bored with it. Overall Rating: 7.8/10"
"The_Wood","4","10","19","25 February 2002"," how to turn endearing into shameful 4/10
","Hardball makes for an interesting viewing.  At the beginning of the movie, it looks like it's going to live up to what it looks like: a common and uninvolved story of a white guy who is trying to teach black kids how to live better lives.  You know, your stereotypical Hollywood pompous crap.<br/><br/>The movie has its own idea of comedy.  The young kids say obscene remarks to one another, and we're suppose to think it's cute.  Keanu Reeves, playing the fish out of water, makes it even funnier with his uproarious reactions to the children's manners -- oh how funny.  And of course, what would an inner city tale be without different types of rap music blaring every five minutes.<br/><br/>As the movie gets going, it begins to surprise.  We realize that these gifted young actors, are ACTUALLY -- gifted young actors.  When they aren't reading stereotypical dialogue from the foolish script, they are able to create likable, in-depth characters, that are fun to watch.  The film does a nice job exploring why Keanu Reeves is coaching the team -- and while Diane Lane and D.B. Sweeney are barely used -- they do help the film become something more then your typical inner city youth saga. I liked these parts, which makes the film all the more disappointing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie does end up going back to its shameful ways.  The last 10 minutes of the film are so typical, so obvious, that you'll want to puke.  Of course the movie has to kill off one of the kids -- this wouldn't be a show about black kids if they didn't.  And of course the movie has to spell out that Keanu wasn't really showing the kids how to play baseball, but how to live better lives.  Without his presence, one of the kids ends up joining a gang.<br/><br/>The film is offensive to minorities more so then any Hollywood film of recent memory.  After watching Hardball, I wondered how hard it would be to make ""just"" a baseball movie -- instead of trying to make a film that's trying to change the world.  The message of this film: All minority kids are doomed unless you can play baseball.  Ignore your parents; ignore your teachers; make sure you have a white coach to save the day.  This is Patch Adams teaches baseball.  What a sour film."
"lgoodman","4","5","8","2 April 2004"," Not a good film
","At first, I expected this to be another Mighty Ducks-type of movie, with heartwarming interaction between a messed-up guy and a lovable group of kids who teach him about teamwork and the love of the game.  But no.  In Hardball, Keanu Reeves started out grumpy, and he stayed grumpy.  The kids, despite the trauma in their lives that could be pretty sympathetic, weren't lovable, and you didn't feel like you got to know them on any kind of personal level.  If Keanu's character had grown, if his coaching had seemed to mean anything to the kids or if you could in any way understand Diane Lane's contention that the kids trusted him and they're never wrong, then this movie might have been okay.  As it is, however the story was bad, and the weak acting only added to that to make this movie less than enjoyable.<br/><br/>I'm a huge baseball fan, but even so, I'd say skip this and go rent The Mighty Ducks.  Or, if you want to stick to the baseball storyline and you aren't so hung up on the 'down-on-his-luck curmudgeonly coach with a team of spunky kids' plot, then Little Big League or Rookie of the Year are both fun family films with cute kids and good baseball.  All of these movies are far superior to Hardball.<br/><br/>Four stars out of ten"
"Slutmagic2021","8","3","4","29 March 2008"," Great
","Keanu Reeves has taken a lot....and I do mean A lot of doo-doo (imdb has dumb censorship rules so I can't say a certain word that rhymes with bit) for his acting. And with his performance in Jonny Mnemonic I can see why but I think people often forget that, when given the right role, he can be great. Speed, A Scanner Darkly and of course The Matrix are prime examples of how Keanu can really be a great actor. And with out a doubt, Harball proves this once again.<br/><br/>The story of Hardball sounds like a generic sports movie and listening to the plot on paper makes it sound like Mighty Ducks with baseball. However, while the story may not be the most original thing, the approach is what makes Hardball stand out. Instead of taking the easy way out by making it a family comedy where the team comes together to win with their ""used to be a douche-bag coach"", Hardball is a surprisingly powerful drama. Keanu is very good as a gambler who excepts a job coaching inner-city kids on a baseball team to help pay a debt he owes. Along the way he realizes he is kind of an A-hole and not really going anywhere but down and really starts to enjoy the kids. The movie takes itself pretty seriously which works really well. Diane Lane is the obligatory love interest and does a great job as always. All of the kids on the Baseball team turn in great performances as well but it is really Keanu that steals the show. He really shines in a speech he gives near the end at a funeral and wow....I never cry during a movie....and still have not....but I was pretty close during that scene. How he didn't get at least nominated for an Oscar for that is further proof that the people who choose the nominations are idiots.<br/><br/>So overall....a well done Drama with a great performance by Reeves and all involved. Check it out.<br/><br/>My grade A-"
"synefra","7","4","6","9 October 2001"," Not a revelation but worth seeing
","I didn't really want to see Hardball, I went in with low expectations. So I was almost surprised when staring at the 'rate this movie' screen I gave it 7/10, but let me tell you why (and trust me I thought about it for a few long moments deciding what to give it and why). First the downside: the story was predictable in every way, it was almost painful for me to see children so young using such language and being abused in so many ways, but it was realistic. The high rating I gave it was because the young actors were so very talented, and while the story was obvious it still managed to make me care what happened and what was happening. I wasn't engrossed, I didn't sob like a baby, I didn't find it a revelation on life and death. However, it was very much what it purported to be, a story about showing up. And it did have an interesting message about how something, that to one person can be so insignificant, can be so profound and life-changing to others. Keanu Reeves gets a lot of bad press about being a 'bad actor' but I found him very believable and thought he did an extremely good job. He has a lot of charisma and an amazing ability to make you care about his characters, and want, in the end, the best for them."
"revfig","1","9","18","16 September 2001"," Watchable, but ridiculous
","Warning: Contains spoilers<br/><br/>This movie on first look seems like ""Mighty Ducks"" with black kids and baseball. It seems as if the makers knew this, and shyed away from it by having all of the little kids cuss ... alot. Some of it is funny, but the rest of it is out of line.<br/><br/>If you're going to it to see some baseball action, then prepare to be disappointed. The team starts off sucking, like you see in the previews. They suck at the first practice. I mean, they can't hit, throw, catch, field, or do anything right. This carries on to the first game, when they lose horribly. But the second game, they get a new pitcher ... and suddenly the team is the best players ever! There's a play in ""61*"" on HBO that the baseball commentators hail as one of the most amazing plays they ever saw, and these kids duplicate it like its nothing. They show no reason why the team suddenly gets good, except they get a new pitcher.<br/><br/>Speaking of unreal baseball, they make every event more ""dramatic"" with pointless dives that are, at some points, five feet away! In one instance, with the bases loaded and 2 outs, one guy hits a little blooper to the first baseman... the pitcher dives horrendously, and the ball goes OVER the pitcher as he dives. To make matters even worse, the kid gets to first base, and the ball lays there in the dirt, right where the first-basemen is supposed to be ... except that there is no first-baseman! They simply forget the fact that the ball was hit right to a position, so they remedy it by eliminating the player! In a real-time situation, the first baseman would easily had caught it, and gotten the last out of the inning.<br/><br/>It seems like, halfway through the movie, the producers were like ""Hey! We forgot a villian!"". For this reason, one of the opposing coaches, for no reason at all, suddenly becomes sporadically mean. No reason at all, and he's transformed into a giant dickhead. And so, the ""climax game"" as you see in sports is the pre-championship game against the dickhead coach's team. Naturally they win. Then they go to the championship, show Reeve's speech... and fade out to end. As the credits roll, you see pics of the team with trophies, as if to say ""In case you were wondering, they won the big game, we just didn't feel it was important to show"".<br/><br/>One last note, one of the kids gets shot. Hey, I warned you with the spoiler. Anyways, the bullet hole in his chest is like half an inch in diameter, but the only gun ever pointed even near his direction during the scene was a shotgun!

Yeah thats the only reason I give this movie kudos, I'm a very nice person and i couldn't give it a 1...it's for the kids. Everyone in this movie does a good job acting the kids seem very believable and so do other small roles. Then there's Keanu i don't have anything against him I don't mind the acting in most of his movies, I actually enjoi the Bill and Ted Awesome Adventures. However this movie *ugh it was so bad it really took me out of it, I could tell he's acting, it was like he was reading the lines rite then and there. This movie is nothing special u wont miss anything by not watching it. I guess it's a good movie to watch w/family or something, but i think if ur past the age when u actually appreciate talent and most of your favorites aren't comedies and scary flicks, you'll think it's really utter garbage."

D.B. Sweeney, whom I usually enjoy, was lost playing the hardline opposing coach.  Keanu Reeves was in Johnny Utah mode, which would have been great if this was Point Break 2.

More time should have been spent on his fathers death, and the ensuing downward spiral to make you actually FEEL something about Connor O'Neill.

","When this movie came out I was only 8-years old. I bought the DVD and watched it only because of baseball, but at that time I did not have any clue about what this film was trying to say. I watched this movie again last night (after 11 years), and I must admit that the tears were rolling down the cheeks when the film was finished.<br/><br/>The film has a simple story about a gambler who tries to figure out what he can do for living. After getting an offer from an old friend, his life which was like a roller-coaster turns out to be a quiet wave. This film makes a man to look at everybody's life before he decides if his life is perfect or not. Reeves meets eight young individuals who change his life and learns that life has several other values than money.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves, who is best known for his role as Neo in The Matrix trilogy, has done a great job as usual and has given life throughout the film. His performance in the climax makes the audience to get in tears. Diane Lane, who plays Reeves's love interest and the kids played by Bryan C. Hearne, Julian Griffith, Michael Jordan, A. Delon Ellis Jr., Kristopher Lofter, Michael Perkins, Brian M. Reed and DeWayne Warren have all delivered a mind-blowing performance.<br/><br/>This film might be a message to those who are out there on the edge for give up. It describes that nobody in this world have a perfect life. Recommended for everyone!"
"CarsonTrent","5","2","3","4 April 2006"," The hollow man
","It's a common assumption that Keanu is stupid. This comes from his acting, when it's not about portraying a drug addict(""I love you to death"") or a plain stupid guy(""Bill and Ted's bogus journey""), where he fits perfectly. However, after a closer look, and after reading some of his personal quotes, I discovered that stupid is not what he is, probably, because he has a pretty interesting insight on life, and that is very uncommon for people who have achieved fame and wealth at an early age. The money certainly didn't spoil Keanu. The problem is, as in this movie, where he tries to portray a compulsive gambler, and fails, that he is definitely not gifted as an actor. He looks like an actor, but doesn't manage to transcend his feelings to the screen. The biggest flaw, though, is, that like Tom Cruise, he has absolutely no smoothness. He's like a brick.<br/><br/>Thus, the rough, hollow , always the same interpretation in all his movies.<br/><br/>What leaves to be enjoyed in this movie, are the kids, which are great, and the somewhat touching story."

It's very well made and written and it has a very emotional scene near the end involving the character G-Baby, plus The baseball action is actually not too bad. Diane Lane was really good as usual, but I wish they gave her more screen time and more to do, and I liked the ending, plus Keanu and Lane had pretty good chemistry together. Keanu had a pretty cool emotional speech, and I feel this film is underrated, plus it took me a while to warm up to Reeve's character at 1st because he was rather unlikable at the start, and an obsessive gambler. Keanu had a great relationship with the kids, and while I wish they would have shown us the final game, The ending they chose fit the film well, plus there were some pretty nifty defensive plays as well. This is great fun for the whole family, that may be Baseball's version of the Mighty Ducks, with a really good story and excellent performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Brian Robbins does a great! job here with very good camera work and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Keanu Reeves is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is rather unlikable at 1st, but then grows on you, he also had pretty good chemistry with Lane, gives one of his best performances, as always had charisma, and you will begin to feel sorry for his gambling addiction after a while. (Reeves Rules!!!!!!!). Diane Lane is incredibly gorgeous, and is amazing with what she had to do, just her screen presence and beauty is enough alone for me, she had pretty good chemistry with Reeves, I just wish they gave her a bigger part and more to do (Lane Rules!!!!!!!).

It gets so bad that he is forced to go to a friend who works in the Chicago stock exchange and begs for $1200 in order to pay off some people it's best not to mess with. Quite unexpectedly, his friend makes him an unusual offer in which he will pay $500 a week if Conor agrees to help him coach a minor league team of black kids living in the projects. It's then that his friend decides to skip out and essentially leaves him all by himself. Although he is promised his money he realizes that in order to field a team he needs two more kids and they are being held back by a mean teacher at the school who refuses to let them play. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it attempted to combine several different cinematic elements into a fairly cohesive plot and succeeded to a certain extent. For example, it had elements of comedy, drama and romance but none of them seemed to overwhelm the other—at least for the most part. It also starred Diane Lane (as ""Elisabeth Wilkes"") who is always a welcome addition to any film. On the flip side, however, there were a couple of occasions when the acting just wasn't sufficient for the situation at hand which made the movie seem a bit uneven. Even so, I enjoyed the movie and as a result I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

Hard Ball focused on a baseball team with very little skill, until a coach, has to coach the team for a period of time to get the some money! Before coach leaves his team he relieves that it was more than a team all along! Once he's comfortable he helps this team! Knowing he still has his own personal problems. A dramatic change in the movie was G-Baby. I won't go into detail but that is a major turning point in the movie. After the G-baby thing, the team goes on to play in the championship, and for the outcome, you'll have to watch the movie! Overall the actors, the plot, and shots in the movie were great!

"zardoz-13","4","4","10","6 February 2008"," The people who made ""Hardball"" should be shipped back down to the minor league of filmmakers
","Imagine what Hollywood would make if it combined ""The Bad News Bears"" with ""Boyz N the Hood?"" Or ""The Mighty Ducks"" got tight with ""Dangerous Minds?"" ""Varsity Blues"" director Brian Robbins and ""Summer Catch"" scenarist John Gatins cover ""Hardball"" with so much sap they should have called it ""Spitball."" This hopelessly derivative and shamelessly schmaltzy sporting fable offers little that hasn't been done better before, aside from its star appearing in such a movie. Hollywood spouts ideological gobbledygook through both dialogue and actions. ""Hardball"" rolls back time to the 'white man's burden' problem dramas. I haven't seen anything in the press about Spike Lee's reaction to ""Hardball,"" but I'm dying to know about his complaints. ""Hardball"" dodges the question why whites are coaching blacks in modern-day American team sports. Is this commentary about the paucity of black role models in contemporary America? ""Hardball"" mirrors the 1965 Moynihan report. Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan argued racism prevented African-American men in the ghettos from obtaining good paying jobs. Humiliated because they could not support their families, these men without self-esteem abandoned their role as husbands and/or fathers and fled, leaving their wives an awful burden. ""Hardball"" projects this image of African-Americans in Chicago's real-life Cabrini Green, more of a war-zone itself than a housing project. Lacking black father role-models for themselves, a team of foul-mouthed fifth graders bond with an amoral, compulsive gambler who smokes like a chimney, guzzles like a fish, and frequents sports bars. Baseball redeems oddballs in this bummer of a hardboiled sandlot saga. Reportedly, Paramount Pictures slashed the controversial R-rated version of this rough-hewn opus and wound up with a strongly-worded PG-13 rating. Nevertheless, Gatins' heavy-handed, tear jerking morality tale still comes out swinging.<br/><br/>Prepare yourself for the worst if you waltz into ""Hardball"" hoping for a ""Cosby"" sitcom. This cynical, no-holds-barred, saga about social conscientiousness reforms the unsavory Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves of ""The Matrix"") after he agrees to coach the KeKambas, an impoverished Chicago Housing Authority Little League baseball club. Conor owes several grand to several bone-crushing thugs when he asks his arrogant stockbroker chum, Jimmy (Mike McGlone of ""The Brothers McMullen""), for a loan. Instead, Jimmy pays Conor $500-a-week to supervise a team of African-American misfits. Conor tutors two of them before their tough-minded Catholic school English teacher Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane of ""The Perfect Storm"") lets them suit up. Of course, each character boasts some trait or affliction that sets him aside from the others. A chubby athlete struggles with asthma; one wears glasses; another isn't old enough; and two brawl like bobcats. When Conor stages batting practice, these fifth graders watch the balls either bounce off them or fly past them. They ridicule each other without mercy. Conor cuts out the name calling, and the boys get down to business. Incredibly, KeKambas' pitcher Miles Pennfield II (Alan Ellis, Jr.) emerges as a strike-out ace. The secret of Miles' success is his Walkman and the Notorious B.I.G. tune ""Big Poppa"" that he listens to repeatedly and relies on for a sense of rhythm. Eventually, villainous opposing team coach Matt Hyland (D.B. Sweeney of ""The Cutting Edge"") forces Miles to remove them, and our hero suffers like Samson with shorn hair. The best example of Hyland's villainy occurs when G-Baby (DeWayne Warren), clearly under age, steps up to the plate for his first time at a crucial point in a game. Sadly, neither Robbins nor Gatins tap Sweeney's obnoxious coach for a greater source of drama. John Gatins' convoluted screenplay consists of two interwoven stories: the plight of the KeKambas and O'Neill's gambling habit. The overnight transformation of the KeKambas when Conor takes them to a ball game is as far-fetched as they are goofy.<br/><br/>""Hardball"" hurls Keanu Reeves his most unorthodox role. As Conor O'Neill, he incarnates the most credible but contemptible character in his career. ""Hardball"" pokes fun at its hero but commendably keeps our anti-hero in peril. Robbins doesn't depict Conor in a complimentary light, until our protagonist undergoes his Biblical Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus conversion and shuns gambling. Conor's transition from sinner to saint is outlandishly melodramatic. Typically derided for giving wooden performances, Keanu Reeves burrows farther into this role than any other.<br/><br/>Diane Lane does wonders with her one-dimensional role. Since the kids trust Conor, she warms up to the lout. Robbins, who helmed ""Ready To Rumble,"" never lets the Lane & Reeves romance interfere with the action on the field. Their best scene together occurs at school when Conor accuses Elizabeth of liking him. This scene represents one of Keanu Reeves' closest scraps with acting. Pouring out personality, he indulges in elaborate gestures and facial expressions. Lane and he generate a modicum of chemistry, and they make a believable couple. The plot transition that brings them together is too good to be true, so you'll either applaud it or laugh yourself silly about it.<br/><br/>Robbins misses more than he hits in ""Hardball"" as a director. He makes us aware of social consciousness issues, chiefly the precarious environment where the KeKambas live. Dope-pedaling, trigger-happy gangstas plague the housing project and prey on the kids. Residents huddle on the floor beneath window level for safety's sake. Nevertheless, he fares well with some scenes, especially when asthmatic Jefferson (Julian Griffith) tries to get home after dark and gangstas attack him. This is a pretty chilling scene. Meanwhile, just when Conor believes he is washed up, his luck abruptly changes for the better. Predictably, the KeKambas win the pennant, but not before sudden tragedy of the ""Pay It Forward"" variety exerts a terrible toll on them. This is the lowest and wildest pitch Robbins makes in an effort to win us over to this maudlin melodrama. Even if you hate ""Hardball,"" as I did, you'll find it difficult to exit with a dry eye."

","OK, so Keanu's career started with such films as the Bill & Ted duology, (was it originally supposed to be a trilogy but after the second everyone said WHY BOTHER??), and continued on with Point Break in recent years he's actually been known for attempting SOME acting (notably in my mind ""A Walk in the Clouds"" and the ""Matrix"" trilogy... though honestly it's mostly the action that kept us interested and the FX... NOT Keanu's acting prowess). Now with Hardball Keanu has attempted the thing that has seemed to frighten so many big name comedic and action stars... DRAMA. <br/><br/>Point... I'm surprised his character wasn't shot at SEVERAL points in the movie, but hey you can't kill THE hero til the end... if then.<br/><br/>Point... Keanu looks to be just about as Irish as Morgan Freeman (if you don't get this reference check out Shawshank Redemption).<br/><br/>But if you ignore these small points, you have a very good film. And it IS a work of fiction, meant to entertain, and it did that admirably.<br/><br/>It has the moral that to succeed... first you must SHOW UP.<br/><br/>Too many people give up and sit at home like a 50 pound of Idaho Potatoes watching Friends episodes and wondering why there was never a spin-off starring Lisa Kudrow, and Matt LeBlanc's characters (maybe called Where's My Brain??). But Oh, I don't mean to rant on about things I don't like, rather I wanted to share how much I DID like this movie. I'd put off watching it for a LONG time, usually fearing that it would be TOO heavy and preachy. But far from that it was engaging, light in areas that were spaced JUST right. Yes it was moving. When G-Baby died there were few dry eyes in the room. When Keanu said, ""yes, I'm interested"" in whatever Dianne had to offer it was moving. So I DID enjoy the movie... but first I had to show up (and rent it)."
"veracious_lies","8","2","4","17 June 2003"," No Mighty sucks, with a touch of ghetto life.
","The best thing about this movie is that it truly doesn't focus on baseball, even though the title might suggest that. It's a movie about life, not baseball. I think the movie's title represents the movie well, but is still very misleading and sounds silly. ""Ball"" because there is the baseball element, ""hard"", because that's how life is for the main character, gambling addict, and the kids in the team.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked this movie. When I first saw the title & read the plot summary, I thought it was going to suck majorly, but I thought I'd watch it because it was a Keanu Reeves-movie and I like any film with him at least a little, because he's a pleasure to watch on screen. Then I read some of the user comments here & was pleasantly surprised. When I watched the film, I was even more surprised of the humor in it, the sense of rough reality. It most certainly wasn't a fun kids' film like Mighty Ducks... A lot more cursing, a lot more violence. Don't get me wrong, the violence wasn't THAT bad. There was only like 2 scenes of it.<br/><br/>I really liked the drama in this movie. I like Keanu Reeves' character. His life is a complete mess with all his debts & associations with bookies. Naturally, with the story, he evolves, changes. Keanu Reeves did a good job. He doesn't usually get to act much, because I guess the directors a. Don't find him a good actor or/and b. Only want him to look pretty on-screen. This has got to be my favorite movie with him so far alongside the first Matrix. Absolutely. He gets to act, he does a good job at it. A good break for Keanu.<br/><br/>The kids were great actors & very funny. I liked their input a lot on this movie. None of them really stood out, but as a group they worked well and did a good job on the film.<br/><br/>Then onto the parts that weren't all that.. great. First of all, it's really disturbing to hear Keanu Reeves sing Notorious B.I.G's ""Big Poppa"". Now matter how drunk his character is, he just shouldn't sing that. Second of all, the love affair between Connor [Keanu's character] and Diane Lane's character, Elizabeth, seemed a little forced. It brought some pretty funny moments to the movie & Diane Lane was a good, emotional actress, as usual, but it didn't give the story much & didn't seem very essential. Her character was necessary, but the romance seemed slightly forced.<br/><br/>If you get to watch it on DVD, watch the deleted scenes as well. Some pretty nice scenes there.<br/><br/>All in all, in my pretty loose rating scale [I could give lots of movies 9, very little movies a 1], I'd rate this one 7+/10. Or perhaps even an 8.

"mattymatt4ever","7","2","4","22 September 2001"," A familiar journey, nicely anchored by humor, charm and moving drama
","I'm sure we've went down this road before.  Washed-up loser gets into a big mess; he/she becomes a coach of a pain-in-the-neck sports team.  ""Mighty Ducks"" and ""Sunset Park"" are two movies that come to mind.  Brian Robbins is obviously a big sports fan.  It seems as if his career focus is to make sports films.  Robbins also directed ""Varsity Blues"" and ""Ready To Rumble."" But I think ""Hardball"" has a much more raw atmosphere.  It's set in a cruddy inner-city in Chicago.  <br/><br/>In the tradition of ""Bad News Bears"" the little tykes on the team possess amazingly filthy mouths.  I'm surprised this film actually earned the PG-13 rating (it was originally going to be an R).  Sure, the f-word is only mentioned once, but every other curse word in the book is mentioned almost repeatedly.  Some of the kids' foul language and slang is quite amusing and funny.  But at times it seems redundant and strictly for shock value. <br/><br/>
Keanu Reeves is terrific in a moderately different role.  He plays a gambling-addicted ticket scalper, who can never keep himself out of trouble. The opening scene is amusing.  Keanu enters a Church on a rainy night to pray that the Bulls cover the point spread.  Though I always felt Keanu was a talented actor (many seem to disagree), I have to hand it to him for taking on a role that requires him to be non-glamorous, unshaven and quite grungy.  And he's entirely convincing.  The beautiful Diane Lane plays a Catholic school teacher, who's concerned with the students from her class doing their book reports before going out on the field.  Her job is to pretty much serve as Keanu's female diversion.  Geez, I wonder if he gets her at the end.  <br/><br/>Don't expect any big surprises; this is your standard sports comedy/drama. But it's funny, entertaining, well-acted and moving.  The film ends on a very depressing note, which had me crying my eyes out.  And of course, it delivers a wholesome message about sportsmanship--though it's obvious that Keanu would've had a much tougher time coaching the team if those were real ghetto kids.  But to every film, there has be an arc.  I'll let that slide. Besides, how can you pass on the chance to see Keanu sing ""Big Poppa"" by Notorious B.I.G.?  Talk about a chance of a lifetime! <br/><br/>
My score:  7 (out of 10)"

","A fairly good ball movie, Brian Robbins' ""Hardball"" stars Keanu Reeves as a chronic gambler who agrees to coach a children's baseball team in the hopes of paying off outstanding debts. Along the way, kids and adults grow, change and learn valuable life lessons.<br/><br/>Formulaic? Yes, but ""Hardball"" does some interesting things. Like ""Bad News Bears"" it mixes sentimentality with grit, and elsewhere paints a depressing portrait of urban life, specifically the hardships faced by those growing up in Chicago's ABLA housing projects. The film's cinematography is at times novel – lots of redbrick tower blocks, sunbaked pitches and dank bars – and the always ethereal Diane Lane melts the eyes. Based loosely on a true story.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – See ""Bull Durham"" and ""Up For Grabs""."

","This is the story about Connor O'Neal(Keanu Reeves), a guy with a big gambling debt. He makes his living by scalping tickets and then making bets. In order to pay off his debts, he goes to an old friend who works at a big broker firm. Instead of giving Connor money, he gives him a job coaching a bunch of troubled kids in a rundown Chicago neighborhood. He is very resentful and judgemental at first, but he becomes very attached to the kids. He becomes somewhat of a father figure for many of the kids since, as Kofi says, ""Where I come from, don't nobody's father ever come back."" Anyway, despite several tragic events, the boys go on to play in ""the ship."" I enjoy movies that invoke a certain emotional feeling inside one's heart.

They have different names different characters different habits but they are all very cute and struggling. They live in a hard environment but never give up.

It's a shame, though, as Keanu Reeves really shines as a lost soul who gets to coach a team of Little League baseball players by mere chance.

One mustn't forget,""Those who can -- do. Those who can't -- teach."" What makes difference about teachers is, in many cases, pupils' collective quality and school budget.<br/><br/>While teaching, I noticed kids tended to understand and amuse themselves with such SF fantasies as The Matrix which I hardly understood.

It was 10am on a Wednesday and I was the only person in the theater . . . ooops!  And it's a film about baseball, something about which I know nothing and have little interest. As someone said earlier, 'Bad News Bears meet Boys in the Hood', anyway I was dry and warm and I could always stretch out and have a nap. I was prepared to be bored. From the outset however I was struck by the gritty inner city existance of the characters, and particularly the contrast for the children between the comfort and relative safety of their school, and their homes where people sit on the floor to avoid stray bullets. I think this was important to show that baseball wasn't the only saving light these kids had, and as 'hardball' and street wise as they may have been, they were at least getting guidance and an education in a seemingly good educational environment as well. Being by myself, I wasn't ashamed to get a lump in my throat at the 'right' bits and was grateful the movie didn't end with the usual nail biting, slow motion score to win the title. You kind of knew they'd win anyway but leading into the final game I wouldn't have been all that disappointed if they'd lost.

","Contains Spoiler I was surprised at the excellent performance by Keanu Reaves. Diane Lane is an old pro, and an underrated actress. But I watched this because its a baseball movie, and it ranks among those I like, though it falls short of my very favorites. The baseball scenes are very good  believable and they ring true.<br/><br/>But there were two major flaws: first of all, Reeves takes the team of Chicago youths to a baseball game  in Detroit's Tiger Stadium. (Apparently other parts of the film were done in Detroit as well.) The Sammy Sosa appears in a uniform without a logo. I suppose the setting could have been 1991, while Sosa and Thomas were both with the Sox, but a drive to Detroit would be far-fetched. But a Cubs-Sox game would not have been in Tiger Stadium. This may not be essential to the story, but it is an essential detail for baseball fans. Secondly, each game takes place at the same park, perhaps because of budgeting purposes. Some league play all games on the same field. But in both games against the team with the ""bad guy"" coach with the nice uniforms, they are the home team on the score board. It would have been a nice touch to go to their field in the first game and then home for the finale. Otherwise, besides some over-the-top sentimentality and the kids being a little TOO easy to win over this movie was enjoyable. My kids were in tears as G lay dying in his brother's arms."

","Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is a gambler with high debts with very dangerous guys. He spends his time drinking, gambling and scalping tickets. He accepts to coach a baseball team of kids from the poor zone of Chicago to get some money, pay his debts with `The Barber' and be not killed. There he meets the school teacher Elizabeth Wilkes ( Diane Lane  it is amazing how beautiful she became again after leaving Christopher Lambert). With the contact of these kids, Conor becomes a new man. I did not like this movie. First of all, it is plot supported by baseball, a sport not practiced in Brazil and therefore totally indifferent for me. Second, the character of Keanu Reeves is corrupted and nasty. The viewer does not become sympathetic with him. I did not see he training the kids, just bored on his spot and with minor interventions when the kids struggle between them. I believe baseball has some tactics and techniques to be trained and developed. Third, most of the boys have amateurish acting, grinning when they should not have to, for example. Last but not the least, there is no message in this film other them the redemption of the character of Keanu Reeves, only after he earned a big amount in a bet and paid his debts. Indeed I found this movie a little boring. Maybe Americans and fans of baseball may appreciate this movie more than I did. My vote is six."

","How many bookies are out there who will take a word of mouth bet from somebody who owes? For that matter, how many gambling idiots have thugs after them?--we will beat you up an kill you if you don't pay us now-- This movie is entertaining and does touch on some important subjects, but the clichés just don't stop. Innocent people die frequently in lower income neighborhoods from stray bullets that are from gang activity. It would have made some sense for us to see more police in the movie. But I guess that would take away from the plot. Plot?....A loser white guy is called on to help the inner-city black kids in South Chicago's projects? I guess Hollywood believes there's incredible funding for the children in America's ghettos. OK Reeves, get to work dude, like, these kids in da hood are like, counting on you. Now Ms Lane is still insanely pretty, but her placement in the movie is hard to believe. That's not to say that there are no white people working with black kids in the inner-city, but think about it. I've worked in an inner-city school in California and just helping the kids during the school day was a challenge. For outside of school activities, ridiculous amounts of preparation had to be worked on. Now, maybe Chicago doesn't have as many communication problems that California does with non-English speaking parents, but just being able to talk with parents who speak English takes time and often doesn't go well. Try getting the older daughter, with a mother who works three jobs, to set up a time, for the teacher, or coach in this case, to talk with the mother about her 11 year old son's need to start paying attention. This movie doesn't even go near subjects like that. I not too put off by Keanu's acting ability in this movie, though I still think he's a one-trick pony, and there were no tricks in this script for him to do. He still seems likable. But, a white guy who's a ticket scalping, gambling loser coaching a little league team of poor black kids in the projects....??? I guess Hollywood still thinks that the lives of poor black kids in the inner-cities can only be improved with help from caring white people (even if these are white people with shady backgrounds). There's no need to mention that just shopping for food in the low-income communities is sometimes impossible. Maybe an already made sandwich from the corner liquor store will satisfy the kids hunger, but the city bus line to that one suburban-like big grocery store in the neighborhood one and a half miles away has been canceled and Mama's going to have to figure out another way to get some real food that's affordable. I'm sorry, but although the movie hits some subjects that need to be discussed in our society, the script needs some major work. Why can't these ultra-rich studio executives consider getting input from the social workers in the inner-city, some active residents, teachers, youths, some freshly out of jail young men who are working on cleaning themselves up, etc. Sickeningly rich movie producers just have no idea what the real world is like for most working people. But, this movie is still fun to watch when I've got nothing else to do."

I thought the kids in the movie did great too. They were funny and had a lot of motivation in winning the championship. I was really upset that kid died at the end. I thought that shouldn't have happened because that takes the spirit away from the film. Everyone was having fun, they were finally winning and the end just stopped all the excitement.

","*** CONTAINS SPOILERS**** If it was not for the kids this movie would have been unbareable. Keanu Reeves continues to amaze because he may be this worst leading actor of his generation and he manages to continue to land leading roles.<br/><br/>There were two main problems that I had with this movie, the first being a minor one where during the longest baseball montage of the movie the 12 and 13 year olds are making diving catches, behind the back double plays, ect. This is completely unrealistic. The main problem that I had with this movie was that the viewer is supposed to feel bad for Reeve's character for the gambling losses that he has accumulated. The problem being that you have no reason to be sorry for him, as he put himself in that situation in the first place. His character seems to have a gambling problem and the solution that the movie gives is to keep gambling until you can pay off your debts. Which in all reality is the last thing that should happen. Gambling and gambling addiction is a serious problem and just giving it up is not possible for most people inflicted with the disease, as Reeve's character does at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Just dreadful, but saved by the preformances of the kids."

D.B Sweeney was just so sweet and lovable as he always has been, but the young lady opposite of Keanu Reeves I am unfamiliar with. Me thinks her name is Diane Lane.

","I watched this movie last night and thought it was an exceptional film. It had humor. It was heart-wrenchingly sad. It was a most sobering social commentary, although it did offer the notion that hope, indeed, does spring eternal. It's beyond my comprehension why some folks feel the need to aim such contemptuous and hateful barbs at Keanu Reeves. He gave an outstanding performance,one of his very best, and portrayed the very emotions that Conor, no doubt, would be feeling at any given time. I saw fear, pain, desperation, hopelessness...probably the same feelings I'd have if in the same situation. Conor O'Neill, having dug himself into this pit from hell, the kids being in their own pits from hell through no fault of their own, both needing something or someone; Conor needing redemption and someone to have faith in him since he was fresh out of faith in himself, the kids needing someone they could trust and feel safe with. How providential that they were thrown together! It was uplifting to see both parties bridge the gap and come together, both being able to finally look up and feel that, just maybe, it will be okay to be hopeful. What a transformation for everyone! Keanu has such rapport with these kids! Clearly, his heart was in this one, and clearly, the kids, who all performed admirably, responded to him in kind. Yes, I am a die-hard Keanu fan, and yes, I'll go to my grave declaring that he most certainly CAN act!  My suggestion is this...don't pay attention to the negative reviews. Go see this wonderful movie and decide for yourself. I don't believe you'll be disappointed."

Even though, after seeing ""Hardball"" many times it may have lost some touch, I have not forgotten the effect it had on me the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>In ""Hardball"" Keanu Reeves plays a gambler who is offered to get paid under the table by a friend, if he coaches a Little League baseball team for children in the Cabrini Green Housing Projects. Really, I feel that this film is no more about gambling than it is about baseball, even though there's a lot of baseball. I feel that this film is really about one man's conversion brought on by the children he coaches. He touches their lives and they touch his. Keanu Reeves is also touched with a light, chaste romance with Diane Lane as a school teacher of some of the team's boys.<br/><br/>Some people may have felt that this film is predictable or formulaic, but I felt everything flowed so beautifully that it seemed real and felt great. As a matter of fact, I feel that ""Hardball"" doesn't fall prey to certain cliches.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the music is electrifying, the cinematography very good, humor is there, and ""Hardball"" is ultimately uplifting and moving.

"paul-nemecek","5","0","1","3 July 2018"," Hardball Goes Down Swinging
","Hardball is a well-intentioned, tender-hearted film that gets lost in clichés, stereotypes, and bad writing. Keanu Reeves plays Coner O'Neal, a heavy-drinking compulsive gambler who is clearly down on his luck. When he asks a stockbroker-friend to loan him some money, his friend instead offers him a job-coaching Little League ball players for $500 a week. The catch is that this particular Little League team is made up of residents from Cabrini-Green, Chicago's most notorious public housing project.<br/><br/>So, we end up with the white mentor meets black street kid cliché (Finding Forrester). The basic plot line of the film is the standard sports film cliché. For me, almost all sports films are variations of Rocky. For example, Hoosiers is ""rural Rockies play basketball"". The Mighty Ducks could be subtitled ""little Rockies play hockey"". Even Cool Runnings is ""Jamaican Rockies go bob-sledding"". The closest parallel is probably Bad News Bears, but Mighty Ducks is a close second.<br/><br/>As is the case in many of these films, the basic formula is loser coach coaches loser athletes and they all become winners in the end. A common subplot occurs when the down-and-out coach loses faith in himself, but is propped up by the love of a good woman (""Yo' Adrian""). As I have stated before formula can be okay, if you create richly drawn characters and interesting contexts with unusual plot twists that keep us in suspense. Alas, Hardball had none of this.<br/><br/>This is essentially a formula film with poorly developed characters, few innovations, and flat interpersonal relationships throughout the film. If you are interested in the film because you like sports films, see any of the other films listed above on video instead. Major League II even looks good by comparison. If your primary interest is in the lives of low-income minorities in the inner city check out the documentary Hoop Dreams, Menace II Society, Boyz in the Hood, or Clockers. If the interracial mentoring is what appeals, Finding Forrester is a much better choice. If you were interested in this film because you are a Keanu Reeves fan, see your therapist or wait for Matrix II.<br/><br/>To be fair, there was one moment at the end of the film that was poignant, well-acted, and moving. This is a clear case of too little too late though. The film ended by swinging for the fences, but in the final analysis Hardball went down swinging."

","Hardball (2001): Dir: Brian Robbins / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Diane Lane, D.B. Sweeney, John Hawkes, Michael B. Jordan: 80, 000, 000th sports baseball movie about the hardened lives kids endure. It stars Keanu Reeves as a drunken gambler thrust into coaching an urban kids baseball team by a friend who will pay him $500 a week to do so. He figures that the money will pay off debts but he never factored in the behavior. This all leads to a happy ending for all save for the audience. Director Brian Robbins is responsible for Varsity Blues, as well as such crap as Good Burger and Ready to Rumble. He lets the material get away on him like a bunch of kids at an amusement park. It has no originality and characters say lines like, ""I'm blown away by your ability to show up."" I am blown away by his ability to say that with a straight face. Reeves makes little impression playing a role that has been done fifty times over. Diane Lane is basically a romantic prop for when Reeves has a free moment. Are we to be surprised when these two hook up? D.B. Sweeney plays Reeves's crime pal, although being in this film is perhaps his biggest crime. This is the kind of film that you line up and bat baseballs at just to see if one can smash a dent in it. It is one of the worst sports films ever made.

"Rob-210","8","0","1","23 June 2002"," A Really Pleasant Surprise
","Reviews of this movie, especially in the UK,have been very unflattering but I thought it was well acted and in a small way quite inspiring. Cynics will scoff at the story of an impoverished kids baseball team from the wrong side of the tracks overcoming adversity to win a trophy, thanks in part to the efforts of  a reformed gambler and drunkard Conor O'Neill (Reeves), but if only life was like this occasionally ! Maybe it is ?  Diane Lane was, as ever, quite luminous and the way her acting has shone in recent years is,for me,one of the highlights of going to the movies. The role of schoolteacher Elizabeth Wilkes is only a supporting one here,but she exudes real presence every time she comes on screen. I'm not a great fan of Keanu Reeves but he is very believable in Hardball and all the kids were excellent too. Yes it is an idealistic, sentimental and corny movie but I loved it and Reeves' address in the church was genuinely moving. Just as his character was "" uplifted just for a moment "" by one of his team so I was for the duration of this movie and for some time after. Nice soundtrack too."
"soccert14","10","0","2","4 June 2002"," I liked it and he's a good actor and very good looking.And I think the whole family will be moved by his scensative heroic act.
","hardball is about a gambler who needs money to pay off people he owes money to so this guy says he'll give em a job coaching a last place baseball team but then learns to like them as he didn't when first started.I liked it i thought he is a very good actor and hes really hot in hardball and in speed which is very good. And how he helped those kids in the movie made it all worth while but was very sad when he cried and when g-baby died.I liked hardball better because it dealt with helping kids and coming together."

","You have to be made of wood (Caztroy 8) to not like this one. It's a great story of overcoming your own problems to put you in a spot where you can help others overcome there's. I would recommend this movie to anybody in any age group, any gender, whether or not you know the first thing about baseball. You will not be disappointed!!!"
"stevie_y96","10","0","1","28 April 2002"," Best Ever
","Hardball by far has to be the best movie ever made.  It combines the spirit of team work with the real truth of what it is like to live in the poverty level parts of big cities.  It shows the true meaning of life; survival. Hardball brings out all kinds of emotions from the viewers.  Only the truly great movies do that.  This movie is a must see for all sports fans and especially those that are not.  Hardball shows the world how great sports are and how meaningful they can be."

","This movie touched my 9 yr old son so much, he made me go out and buy the DVD so that he could watch it over and over!  This is an excellent movie, and as usual, Brian Robbins has outdone himself especially with the cast. Thanks for making such good movies!"
"pvdugas","Null","0","1","31 March 2002"," Definitely worth $23.00 on DVD
","I've loved Keanu Reeves for years. This movie showcased what I enjoy most about him, his sensitive side and his ability to create a memorable character. Hardball was extremely well written, directed and acted.  The new talent in this movie was awesome to watch, especially ""G-Baby"" who let's face it, steals the entire movie. <br/><br/>Hardball is more than just ""Showing up"".  It's a testament to the differences we all have in life. Keanu shows how the human spirit can affect positive change in an individual. Not only did he need the boys, they needed him as well. It's a movie that shows the reality of living in poverty and how that affects young boys in the inner cities. The trip to their first professional baseball game was monumental.  Keanu Reeves expressions throughout the movie helped to shape it. Some times you don't need dialog. Emotional, funny, heartwarming. Hardball is all these things. It's a must have movie, one that you can watch over and over again."
"srmccarthy","7","0","1","24 March 2002"," Great re-make of ""Comeback Kid""
","I see many people refer to ""Bad News Bears"", but that is well out of date concerning the real inspiration for this movie.  This is an obvious re-make of the 1990 movie ""The Comeback Kid"".  I had nothing but contempt for The Comeback Kid, as it left me high and dry, but this movie brought the true meaning and expression to life for me!     Do not be fooled into believing that this is a rap infested torture that has nothing you would regard as touching, because it is far from that! It is more than a monument to the original (C.B.K.), it is an instruction! The story is about a man, overwhelmed in debt (brought about by gambling) , given a chance to change his lifestyle by making a difference to a bunch of un-wanted city children.  You might not believe it when you begin watching this, but unless you are anti-sentiment, this movie will bring tears to your eyes (both of sorrow and joy)!<br/><br/>COMEBACK KID vs HARDBALL:<br/><br/>SPOILER!!!!<br/><br/>    Although both of these movies had a tragic situation that brought about the positive outcome, Hardball won my acceptance because it explained the reason for the positive outcome!  Face it, in Comeback Kid, it was never made clear why the boy was inspired to join the team of boys, but Hardball makes it very clear!"
"keanuette","10","0","1","5 March 2002"," A Great Movie ~ 5 Stars!!
","Wow. Keanu Reeves only gets better and better. He gives another great performance as the messed up gambling low life, Conor O'Neill who finds redemption in training a little league baseball team from the projects.<br/><br/>Hardball hits you in all the right places. It's got heart, it's got a great storyline and a great ensemble cast. I was very moved by the performance of the young team of baseball players. You could really feel their struggle to get away from their poverty stricken lives by escaping to play baseball and triumphing against the odds. <br/><br/>This is a feel-good movie. It lets you know there are people out there who care for others welfare and will do all they can to help, which was very evident.<br/><br/>I just wished it had a slightly longer running time, in order to explore the relationship between Conor and Miss Wilkes [played by Diane Lane].<br/><br/>
It has a great soundtrack, which I recommend you buy"
"jcgreg","Null","0","1","28 February 2002"," Very good
","i think the very best Baseball film of all time is ""Sandlot"". However this move really touched me. I cried so hard that I actually got sick. It really affected me. That is something we want our ART to do. Mission accomplished. I strongly recommend this film"
"DunnDeeDaGreat","Null","0","1","19 February 2002"," Uplifting for the human sprit
","Hardball is a uplifting movie that makes one feel good inside. Keanu Reeves shows some of his best atcing since River's Edge. Diane Lane is very good in the female lead also. The kids on the team are all also veyr good actors , many of whom make a apperance for the first time on screen. The film will make you laugh and cry and I 'm proud to have it in my DVD collection. I give it *** out of ****."
"Clothahump","7","0","2","29 October 2001"," PG-13? Not hardly!
","Lame opening, strong ending.  But a PG-13?  No way.  This movie should have been rated R for language and violence, which shows how totally bogus the rating system really is.  It appears some big bucks got laid out so that this movie would appear palatable to parents with young kids."
"mermieetg","10","0","1","7 October 2001"," Great Movie for all people
","I saw this movie in the cinema. It was funny and at times<br/><br/>it made you cry.  Keanu was very good.  I have all of his movies on DVD and I will purchase this one also. He improves with everything he does.  This movie makes you think and take away something when you leave. You can't ask for anything better in a film."
"curtis-8","Null","0","1","6 October 2001"," Again with this?
","How many damn ""uplifting"" movies and TV shows are going to be made about inner-city black kids being ""uplifted"" by upper middle class white people? Pardon me, but didn't our country get over this after ""Diff'rent Strokes"" and ""Dangerous Minds""? I'm not one for political correctness, but gah-dayum, how many times can we see variations on this same tired bit? <br/><br/>You know what I'd like to see? A movie about a troubled inner-city black coach (or teacher, or anything) who has to take a bunch of shiftless, no 'count, money-grubbing, spoiled little suburban white kids and turn each of them into a decent human being with a real purpose in life beyond video games, TV, bad heavy-metal records, and waiting until they're sixteenth birthday to get that Camero their mom and dad promised them if they ""kept their grades up."" After turning the bunch of white losers into winners with rhythm, the black coach finds out that he has changed for the better as well, no longer talking out loud to the screen during movies or calling women ""ho's"", yadda, yadda, yadda.<br/><br/>But I think I'll have to write that one myself. <br/><br/>Maybe the Wayans Brothers would direct it."
"Quinoa1984","5","0","1","29 September 2001"," Starts out Ok, then quickly unravels downward
","Brian Robbins' Hardball is a movie that actually has a decent concept- a troubled gambler (Keanu Reeves) takes on coaching a baseball team in inner-city Chicago to pay off his large gambling debt.  Not bad, but then of course the film diverges into a pit of cliches, usual endings, and Reeves. This movie might have gotten a higher grade if not for Reeves.  The thing with him as an actor is that when he's good (Matrix, the Gift) he can be good, but when he gets a role like this (or like Sweet November for instance)  it's almost a near abomination.  One thing to point out that was a decent touch- the pitcher on the team (I don't remember the name) Reeves coaches listens to ""Big Poppa"" by Biggie smalls in order to pitch strikes. D+"
"jinbabez88","10","0","1","20 September 2001"," Better than I expected
","Actually, I've waiting for this movie to play ever since August 2001. I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves and so of course I would go and watch it. I thought this movie would be like Sweet November, slow and a little boring. But this movie was great, emotional, and real. I totally loved it. I think its mostly funny when the kids swear. I give this movie a B+. And of course Keanu was beautiful as ever. He had that buzz cut like on Speed. I loved it!"
