","It was made to be silly. There's nothing in this movie that's meant to offend anyone. It's a silly, fun-loving, harmless movie. I enjoyed it when I was 8 and I still do now at 18. Anyone who takes this movie seriously, needs to relax, have fun, enjoy the goofiness. This movie is one you can enjoy with your friends, family and young children DON'T have to be sent out of the room for inappropriate action.<br/><br/>It's silly, remember that. It's supposed to make you laugh!<br/><br/>All the girls are young, and the band still together. A few years later, everything fell apart for them. Enjoy the youth and laughter while you can."
"passthepopcorn6","6","74","108","21 December 2004"," Nostalgic...
","When I was seven and this movie came out, it was the biggest thing around. Everyone wanted to be the Spice Girls. After they split up and weren't cool anymore, everyone forgot about the movie. But ho, ho, what's this? Years later, here I am cleaning out my old Disney and Barney videos and stumble across my old friend that I used to watch everyday. Even at my old age of fifteen, never failed to crack me up.<br/><br/>Obviously, this isn't meant to be a contender for Oscars. Anyone can see that. But I can't find much to hate about a movie that's practically the visual to go along with the song ""Girls just wanna have fun."" That's all it is, fun. And a lot of good fun at that. It's just a guilty pleasure, and it's so much fun to watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas. You just need to keep in mind that it was publicity for their new record and it's not meant to be one of those heavy movies you over-analyze. Recommendation: This movie is much funner when you watch it jumping up and down on a couch like a seven year old."
"kathco","6","56","82","28 October 2006"," Much better & much funnier than you'd think
","This movie is FUN. And the sad thing is that most people are too close-minded to see that. The general consensus seems to be: ""It's the Spice Girls in a movie? It's going to be awful!"" and either they never see the movie, or they allow their prejudices to judge the movie for them.<br/><br/>Firstly, let me say that I am not, and was never, a Spice Girls fan. I was way too old for their target market when they were popular, and whilst one or two of their songs had catchy tunes, some were downright annoying. They were a very cleverly manufactured girl band in a time when that market was wide-open. Giving each girl a distinctive character and style was a stroke of genius on the part of their 'creators', and while they didn't have particularly strong voices (except perhaps for Mel C), they didn't have particularly bad ones either. I've heard far worse. So I went into this movie purely out of curiosity, expecting it to be somewhere between awful and merely silly, but I ended up enjoying myself thoroughly. Also, my 65-year-old father loves this movie, and he saw it only having heard vaguely of the Spice Girls, but not knowing their music at all. Yes, Spiceworld is an exploitation movie; BUT it does an excellent job at it! What I loved most was the way it poked fun at itself all the way through. The character of the screenwriter pitching his idea to the girls' manager (brilliantly played by Richard E. Grant) saying ""It's obvious to us that the Spicegirls are movie stars!"", when it's obvious that they're not, and everyone knows it - there's even a scene at the beginning where he says, ""Yes, but can they ACT?"" and his boss responds with, 'Who cares?"", or similar. I loved that. And while the girls CAN'T really act (some are worse than others; I've read that Victoria was the only one who had taken acting lessons before, but I can't say it showed since I thought she was the weakest link), it's obvious that they're having fun with the script, and they don't do too badly at all.<br/><br/>The script was another great surprise to me; it's full of good lines and funny characters that poke fun at themselves and their stereotypes. An example of this is the great Roger Moore playing the ""Chief"", who is presumably the Big Boss of the Spice Girls. We only ever see him on the phone with Clifford the manager (Richard E. Grant), and every time we do he is stroking, in pure Bond Villain (or Dr Evil) fashion, a small white animal on his lap. But every time you see him he has a different animal; first it's a cat, then a rabbit, a tiny white pig etc. I thought that was such a great way of poking fun at the stereotype of the villain always having a white pet. And then the character himself has these fantastically enigmatic, senseless, but hysterical lines, like: ""When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy, it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness. Whether they're clean or not."" and: ""The headless chicken can only know where he's been. He can't see where he's going. Do not be that chicken."" I love that off-the-wall humour, and this movie is full of it. Of course, some people just don't GET that kind of humour, which is fine by me as long as it doesn't make them slam the film because of it.<br/><br/>Other moments I love, which elevate this film from could-have-been-dodgy to funny, are the casting of Meatloaf as the Spice Girls bus driver, and then having him say lines like: {on fixing the clogged toilets} ""Hey, I love these girls. I'll do anything for them...but I won't do that!"" - which is, of course, a play on Meatloaf's hit song ""Anything for Love"". Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls, which of course were made up for them anyway, like Victoria not knowing what to wear, and Mel C saying ""It must be really hard for you, Victoria, trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress"", and Victoria responding ""Exactly!"", or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued, and yelling ""This dress is dry-clean only!"", or Geri saying ""Calm down, haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'?"" There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's not the greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","22","30","11 February 2004"," Made me wanna zigga zig, ah!
","To be a teenage girl when the Spice Girls were around, there was no better time to be 12. I admit it, I was such a fan of the girl power group. How could you not be? Admit it, you say you hated them, but secretly you had a poster of Ginger Spice in your closet. They were cute, they were fun, they were talented and before you knew it they were gone. But for 2 years, it was nothing but girl power! So out of the height of their fame we naturally had to see if the Spice Girls were good for something else and that meant a movie! The Spice Girls made a movie, to show how crazy their lives were at the time and let them just have fun with it and they did spice up our lives real good.<br/><br/>The Spice Girls are enjoying their fame, but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of it. A sinister newspaper owner, Kevin McMaxford, is trying to ruin the girls' reputation in order to cash in on the headlines, and even dispatches a photographer to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Annoying film director, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth, who stalks the band along with his crew, hoping to use them as documentary subjects; at the same time, the girls' manager, Clifford, is fending off two overeager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon, who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for the girls' film. Amid this, the girls must prepare for a concert at the Albert Hall, their biggest performance yet. But between all this craziness, would they even want to continue to sing at the price of their friendships? You'll have to see, but I'm sure you could figure it out.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people are a little too harsh on this film, the girls gave it a genuine try. You can tell they just had fun and wanted to do this for the fans. I think there were actually some really funny parts, like when they went through the spice boot camp. The whole last scene where they are going through their action scene in London, it's so random and just a good time. See, what I liked about this film was it's harmless nature. It was made for the fans specifically because we loved them so much. I admit that I'll watch it every once in a while still just to go back down memory lane and it still brings a smile on my face. The songs are so darn catchy, I can't help it. There are some very fun cameos that get a good giggle. The story is very predictable and the movie is over the top silly, but that is what makes it fun. I'm here to defend the film, I think people over analyze things way too much. Sometimes, you can't explain it, but you just want to let go of the real world and spice up your life a little bit. The Spice Girls may never win an Oscar, but they won the world's hearts for 2 short years, the girl power may have fizzled a little, but I'll take a trip down memory lane any time for Spice World.<br/><br/>6/10"
"imdb-9908","8","28","40","2 April 2006"," To *HECK* with all the naysayers!
","SPICEWORLD is a good, enjoyable movie. It is NOT Cinéma Vérité, nor is it supposed to be. You want a deep, poignant movie? A thriller? An action-flick? Watch something else. This movie is a farce, and was intended to be only that, nothing more. You people who didn't like the movie are expecting LORD OF THE RINGS or something, and this will never reach that level. But for a fun, energetic, insane romp with countless nods to classic movies, stars, and actors, this is perfect.<br/><br/>The Spice Girls had their time in the limelight and used it to produce essentially a theatrically-released extended music video. If you're old enough to remember M-TV when it was actually JUST a music video channel, this is what SPICEWORLD is (think of the classic Michael Jackson video/movies like THRILLER where it was music and a bit of story tossed in for good measure). Nope, not Oscar material by a long shot, but still quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>Oh yes... one last thing: I saw this movie on PPV in 1998 and immediately fell in love with it and the Spice Girls. I was 28 then, and even though I'm 36 now, I still enjoy this movie for what it is. Perhaps that's because I'm OLD ENOUGH to know what it ISN'T."
"Ace-38","Null","7","8","6 July 1999"," Cheesy, Goofy, Silly, and lots of fun to watch
","The Spice Girls.......what can be said about them that hasn't already been said?  Well, for starters..none of them can act.  Playing themselves (albeit slightly exaggerated) seems to be a stretch.  The lone shining star as far as acting is Meat Loaf, who in his role as SpiceBus driver provides comedy release without being Jar-Jarish.  The fact he delivers the line ""hey I love these girls, and I'd do anything for them...but I won't do that..."" without blushing is priceless.<br/><br/>This movie has some of the cheesiest scenes in the history of film, with the aliens scene being among the worst, but when this movie hits with the goofiness, it hits well.  I still laugh to this day when I think of the plastic SpiceBus jumping over the plastic London Bridge.  Surprisingly, one of the best musical numbers is the cafe scene...where the girls show that they actually do have some discernible talent.<br/><br/>This is the best summary of the movie I can give:  I hated the Spice Girls until I saw this movie, and now I have to say that I actually own a CD of theirs"

","I was very early tweens when the Spice Girls dominated the world, and I remember the film coming out to cinemas; counting down the days till I could go see it! As a child and massive fan I found the film entertaining as it was to cracked up to be, it was all the phenomenon of the time. Looking back now it was a great time for me enjoying it and themselves as a girl group enjoying massive success and this is why I can accept why the film may not be any BAFTA hands down winner, obviously the film was never meant to be! It was written by their managers wife! And has too many more than subtle references about Britain. The acting is cheesy but no way did it tarnish any of the many important actors/comedians/singers who cameo'd in this film because as I remember Richard E. Grant saying it was just so great to be part of the experience, it really was a time-line in history. Now who cares whether he was lying or being honest we know he is an actor who gets paid big bucks, but the fact Roger Moore was in this film and Meatloaf, I don't think you can call them all sellouts. Fact is Spice Girls did make an impact on us all, this is just a bit of history left to show their mark."

","I love this movie simply because it's a good laugh. The acting is terrible, the plot is cheesy, but I love it all the same. You watch this movie, and you're going to think it's the worst excuse for a singing group promoting itself ever. And you'll be right. It is bad. But that's what makes it so great! It's a cheesy movie full of cheesy jokes. It's not supposed to be an academy award winner. It should be the first of the genre ""Cheesy for the sake of being Cheesy"". I mean, if Meatloaf voluntarily in this movie, we all know that it's not to be taken seriously. Mr. ""Bat-Out-Of-Hell"" himself wouldn't be in one of these movies to try and earn his acting credibility. Love this movie for what it is. A cheesy good laugh to watch if you're depressed."
"jess_martello","10","14","21","30 April 2006"," This movie was cheesy enough to be awesome
","The outfits! The ""acting""! The plot!! What could be better than a movie so bad that it's good? Spice World was created to milk Spice Girl fans for all they were worth, and it worked! I saw it and rented it, didn't you? I believe this movie is worthy of a 10 rating because it was created just to please younger fans and humor the idea of a Spice Girls movie. Remember the Beatles movies? They were ridiculous, yet they are still a treasure in the movie community. Spice World should be remembered and enjoyed. Only true fans of their pop music can learn to enjoy this film. This movie is hilarious because it's so bad. The only way you could hate it is if you are a SERIOUS movie critic, and in that case you're boring because you like 21 Grams and other equally boring yet ""moving"" works. Enjoy the horrible movies for what they're worth!"
"adam b","1","24","44","1 February 1999"," Every bit as good as their music . . . unfortunately.
","I was actually pretty apathetic of the Spice Girls until I saw this movie, but this is too much.  This is the first English-speaking movie I've seen that requires English subtitles so you can figure out what the little darlings are saying.  Fortunately, there's no plot, so you just treat it like a 90 minute long music video. For an added challenge, see if you can resist the urge to keep from clawing your own eyes out of their sockets while protecting your ears from bleeding while the gals sing and prance their way into your spleen.  A spice world is a cruel world, indeed."

The acting is horrible, the plot is infantile (at best), and the dialog is stupid.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.<br/><br/>An interesting side-note... almost everyone either voted 1 or 10.

I know that this movie is not really about the acting but trying would have helped. Admittedly I am not exactly the biggest Spice Girls fan but I am extremely open minded but it doesn't matter how open minded you are, it is close to impossible to enjoy this big, ugly, embarrasing piece of film.

"Neonsamurai","2","51","103","4 October 2002"," This is reason the UK has gun control
","As I recall, just before this film was released, the laws concerning gun ownership in the UK were changed. This meant that literally thousands of automatic pistols and large calibre revolvers were removed from the hands of the general public. Coincidence? I don't think so. <br/><br/>The government knew that the combination of Spice World and privately owned combat handguns would result in retaliatory strikes against both the countries film and music industries, by vengeance hungry members or the public. I don't own any guns, but I'd have probably joined in anyway, using a broom or a saucepan to dish out some Spice Girl inspired justice on the people that created this film.<br/><br/>In hindsight, this could have saved us from the likes of Atomic Kitten and there would have been a good chance of sorting out Elton John as well. But alas the government foresaw this and here we are, shaking our heads as the British film industry spasms in its continued death throes.<br/><br/>`But it's aimed at kids and Spice Girl fans!' you may shout, thinking that such a statement will somehow appease me. But, you'd be wrong, because the idea of letting those mad harridans, drive around the country in a bus, sing songs or say girl power is almost as insane to me as letting Rosie O'Donnell have her own talk show.<br/><br/>If I worked in a video store and someone tried to hire out this movie then I'd refuse to let them have it, and possibly punch them for good measure. That also goes for Moonwalker."
"sapienza","1","22","40","11 January 1999"," Well, at least I didn't go blind.
","I went to see Spice World on opening night with some friends (no, I am *not* a 12-year old Girl -- I'm a 21-year old College Student), fully expecting to see a 2-hour long commercial for the Spice Girls.  The only other people in the theater with us were some teeny-boppers dressed up like the Spice Girls and some gangsta wannabes, who were probably hoping that there might be a flash of nudity.  By the end of the movie, the wannabes had thrown all their drink ice at the movie screen and were booing it out loud.  This is one reason not to watch this movie, even on video at home.  There is a chance the ice you throw at the tv screen may somehow harm it, and your booing will wake the neighbors.<br/><br/>The teeny-boppers were not impressed with everyone else's responses to the film (violent vomiting, painful spasms), but I'm sure they've seen it another 40 times on video, alternating it with viewings of Titanic.<br/><br/>In short, this is a bad movie.  A very, very, very bad movie.  If you have read Douglas Adams' ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", then think of it this way: it is only slightly better than a Vogon poetry reading.<br/><br/>I wouldn't advise you to see it, but if you do, look out for:<br/><br/>1. The suits the tv guy wears.  He's a pretty spiffy dresser.<br/><br/>2. The bus-jumping scene.  This was just kitschy enough to *actually* be funny.<br/><br/>3. Roger Moore.  Pity him.

The answer amigo, is this: I had a bad hangover and unfortunately this was the only thing on the T.V. right then. <br/><br/>Plot is nowhere to be found, decent actors are also completely absent, really annoying idiots however, are there plenty of here, but since this movie is about Spice Girls, it just couldn't be done without including five of the most obnoxious, irritating, stupid cows ever to be vomited out of the U.K..

","At the age of 9 I was a Spice Girls fan. And I immensely enjoyed it in the cinema. Now I do realize how silly actually this movie was. Spice World is, and is meant to be, purely the fan-fantasy featuring five of their favorite singers doing... well, whatever. The film goes around with several subplots, one more forgettable than the other. But throughout we do see Spice Girls interacting (and overacting). When you are a child fan, that is how you imagine they must spend some of their free time, or at least, you fantasize about it in a similar fashion. Their personalities in the film are actually only exaggerated versions on what stereotype their nicknames presented them with. <br/><br/>If you are not a Spice Girls fan, do not see this film. You will probably not enjoy. Unless you are looking something 'so bad it's good'. Film goes nowhere and gives you nothing, unless you are a fan and enjoy seeing them on big screen, mostly singing familiar songs, bickering and having fun.

And in regard to all the other posters decrying Roger Moore's involvement in the movie, I recommend that you catch the flick on cable or rent the tape and watch Mr. Moore's scenes again, carefully.  He's always in Chief's minimalist office/sitting room, there's no one there but the animals (and behind the cameraman are the lighting guys and the animal wrangler), and Mr. Moore works wonders with jaw-breakingly nonsensical dialogue.  Not only all that, but he ended up with probably the most sophisticated and opulent wardrobe of anyone in the movie!<br/><br/>Oh, and for those folks who think Mr. Moore may have been desperate for money to do this movie--Do you remember that little programme on the telly back in the 60s?  ""The Saint""?  Five series (seasons) in black and white and two series in colour?  Mr. Moore was co-producer of the two color seasons and gets his bit whenever a videotape is sold or the package is aired, which is quite often on both counts.

"johnnysugar","7","9","15","11 August 2003"," Clever and energetic, and not nearly as bad as you've heard
","In the 1990's, the Spice Girls were the reigning queens of pop, selling countless amounts of records across the world.  An unprecedented marketing blitz followed, culminating in the film ""Spice World.""  Backlash was inevitable, and many were ready to dismiss the film or praise the film solely based on their dislike or enjoyment of the Spice Girls' music.  When reviewed as a film in its own right, ""Spice World"" is a very entertaining movie with its tongue always firmly in its meta-textual cheek.<br/><br/>The Spice Girls -- Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Melanie Brown (Scary), Emma Bunton (Baby), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), and Victoria Adams (Posh, now Victoria Beckham) -- play themselves.  The Girls are getting ready for their first live concert in Royal Albert Hall, but their preparation is beset with several obstacles, including the overdue pregnancy of the Girls' best friend (""AbFab""'s Naoko Mori) and a vicious tabloid editor (Barry Humphries) that wants to see them ruined so he can the ensuing headlines will sell millions of papers.  A host of supporting characters add to the mix, including the Girls' high-strung manager (Richard Grant), an insidious paparazzo (Richard O'Brien), a clueless documentary film-maker (Alan Cumming), and a Hollywood producer/screenwriter duo (George Wendt/Mark McKinney) relentless pitching ideas to the Girls' manager for movie spin-offs.<br/><br/>The Girls do play themselves to a point, but they are more accurately playing themselves as the public sees them.  Sporty is always on an exercise bike, for instance, and Baby is never without a lollipop or stuffed animal. They live up to their stereotypes and play them to the ultimate hilt.  The Girls themselves seem relaxed, with the most confident performance coming from Geri, who seems quite natural on the screen.  Mel B and Emma both seem almost as relaxed, but Mel C seems like she needs a little more coaching on screen presence.  Victoria, unfortunately, looks quite uncomfortable whenever the camera focuses on her, and in some scenes she actually comes off as resentful that she had to star in this film.<br/><br/>The director, Bob Spiers, is best known perhaps for his work on the series ""Absolutely Fabulous"", and he brings the same comic hand to this film has he did to that supremely funny show.  The comedy is played light, never too much over-the-top, although a good deal of silliness is inserted.  Dramatic moments are often muted by a small joke or bit of campy melodrama.  Nothing is ever taken too seriously, and the film clips along at a good pace, peppered with hilarious fantasy sequences, knowing self-parody, and satirical jabs at everything from hospital drama to action movie car chases.<br/><br/>The film is full of cameos as well, including both musicians and non-musicians.  Elvis Costello turns up as a bartender, while Meatloaf plays the driver of the Spice Bus (a double-decker bus emblazoned with SPICE on its roof).  Jennifer Saunders shows up as a bitchy fashionista, while Bob Hoskins' role is too funny to give away here.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why some people dislike the film, however.  The soundtrack tries to fit as many Spice Girls songs as possible into the film, which is to be expected, but the songs themselves are of a wildly varying quality, from the rousing ""Spice Up Your Life"" to the questionable ""Viva Forever."" It's also hard to buy the Girls' backstory as struggling musicians, and the film lacks any kind of dramatic tension, which may be intentional, but it gives the film a fluffy quality that does not appeal to everybody.  Some moments in the film now seem oddly indicative of future events: about a year of the release, Geri would leave the group and the Girls' next album without her would signal the end of the act, with all the Girls going on to solo careers of amazingly diverse success (Geri and Mel C have score the best, while nobody wants to hear Victoria's album, ever).  Keep this in mind during the fantasy sequence with Stephen Fry as a square judge.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Spice World"" is a very entertaining diversion. It's a pop song in film format: it's airy, fun, and slightly mindless, but for a while you forget about your worries.  Certainly not as bad as people have made it out to be, but one to avoid if you really just don't like the Spice Girls.  7 out of 10."

","I've liked the Spice Girls for years, but I'm not sure why. Ordinarily, I don't care for their brand of dance-pop fluff, but somehow they make it sound good. Regardless of what anyone says, they are talented singers and dancers, and they show that numerous times. They're also pretty and most of them wear outfits that show a lot. And while they're not accomplished actresses, they are simply adorable.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone intended this movie to be taken seriously. It's just good clean (well, slightly naughty) fun. Roger Moore comes the closest to giving a good performance, in a role that appears to be spoofing Bond villains. Just in case we don't get the joke, he pets a long-haired cat. <br/><br/>One of the funniest scenes has the girls complaining about people thinking they fit the stereotypical image people have of them. Of course, Emma says this while on a swing in a three-year-old's fantasy world.<br/><br/>The girls actually show they have intelligence. Or do they? I thought Melanie B was the one with brains. She's no better off than the others!<br/><br/>Another humorous incident: Victoria can't make up her mind whether to wear the short black Gucci dress or the short black Gucci dress. Emma suggests she wear the short black Gucci dress. Problem solved! <br/><br/>Of course, the girls are being harassed by the tabloids, whose top personnel are shown being evil.<br/><br/>And then there are the guys pitching their idea for a Spice Girls movie. Some of what we see is supposedly their imagination. Including a Dukes of Hazzard style incident with a bus, which was done so cheaply it's obviously not real. <br/><br/>In the closing credits, the girls are actually more talented delivering dialogue because they are being themselves, not merely playing exaggerated versions of themselves. I've never seen communication with the movie audience quite like this! <br/><br/>It's not for people looking for Shakespeare. But if you want to laugh and hear music that is bubbly and upbeat, this is pretty good."

The movie features tons of great cameo spots but actors you love. If the movie was really that awful, would there be all these great people in it? Also, the Executive producer was Simon Fuller of ""American Idol"" fame. I'll be the first to admit that the plot is paper thin and yes, the jokes are corny in spots. But the movie totally succeeds at it's goal and should be appreciated for what it is, which is simply a fun film. Definitely worth picking up. You can easily find it on DVD for under $10."

","As I am not a Spice Girls fan I thought that the movie would be a drag and very boring, but I was wrong. Although the girls and half the cast couldn't act, this movie was very funny and enjoyable. Most of the cast were just famous people making cameos, but the actors who were playing main characters were good. The whole thing reminded me a bit of The Beatles' movies, I guess it's just a modern day spoof. The movie is just one joke and anyone who takes it seriously need their heads checked out! One of the funniest bits in the movie is (quite near the end) the journey from the hospital to the Albert Hall. The bit with the bus 'flying through the air' was hilarious. Another good bit was 'Bob, we've got to sort out your hair' and poor old Bob Geldof ended up a ridiculous hair style... v. funny!"

","The Spice Girls deserved the brutal fall from grace for this cinematic blunder.  Although the girls are talented and have full personalities they are buried under tons of lousy plot twists.  It starts great and then comes the moronic ""drama"" moments with Roger Moore (what a waste of a greatly talented actor) then the other ""drama"" with Bob Hoskins & Mark McKinney which serves only to irritate and detract.  Every ""drama"" scene drains the movie of any fun shown before. Half way into the film it becomes really bad.  Frankly I felt the director said, ""We got their money, who cares what they see next?""  Then the film becomes a cheap montage of lousy sets and action. What is truly sad is that the Spice Girls do have talent and actually interesting personalities.  They deserved a good movie to showcase their skills.  And this movie dragged them off the stage.  I was a fan and I felt exploited and insulted by this worthless film.  I hate the Spice Girls because of this film.  It bluntly stated, ""We feel our fans are idiots. They'll gladly buy any cheap item we drop in their laps."" This movie has made me disgusted with the Spice Girls.  They obviously care as little for their fans as they did with their careers.

But my buddy insisted that it is one of those movies you can enjoy BECAUSE it's bad, a la MST3K.<br/><br/>And then I heard that this movie had both Richard O'Brien and Meat Loaf in it, two stars from Rocky Horror Picture Show. I was interested to see those two actors together in a movie again, so I decided to give Spice World a try.<br/><br/>I do not exaggerate when I say Spice World was one of the most horrifying and painful viewing experiences I have ever witnessed, and that's even accounting for the fact that I was able to (thank you Lord) skip through the millions of vacuous musical numbers using my tivo.<br/><br/>I don't think there was a single good performance in this movie, not even by the real actors in it. Meat Loaf and Richard O'Brien are, of course, wasted. Few speaking lines, no musical contributions, really just cameos.<br/><br/>For those who like bad movies (i.e. enjoy making fun of them MST3K style), this is still NOT a good movie for you. I think that's because the movie is already supposed to be a comedy. For some reason, it's difficult to crack funny jokes at a bad comedy. Maybe that's why MST3K never used comedies in their show.

I was so excited about the movie coming out, i cant remember my initial thoughts on it but i have always thought it was a funny movie. I think the plot was good although parts i didn't get such as the guy who wants to make a movie of the spice girls and the creepy photographer. Overall the film gives off a feel good image and a let your hair down one. The spice girls different personalities make it good viewing too. I think at times the movie tried to be too serious forgetting the fact that some of the story lines were a bit too silly and that the spice girls aren't professional actors. However the funnier and less strained scenes were brilliant such as the bits at the old house and the photo-shoot. Now being nearly 18 i am well out of the movies original target audience, although i was when it was released! So now being older i can pick up on things that are not good but that doesn't take away my initial love of the movie. Also people seem to be dissing the spice girls on here, for them i will say this they were and still are one of if not the biggest girl band of all time, their songs are catchy and original and they were a strong young women who made valuable contributions to music!!!"

","I'm not even sure if you can call SPICE WORLD a movie, per se. That's because instead of having actors and a plot, the film plays like a giant advertisement for this prefabricated ""super group"". In other words, the cynical folks who brought us this ""film"" were basically trying to squeeze every last drop from the franchise and sell more records. Fortunately for the world, the group was already on their way out and the film made much more of a fizzle than a sizzle at the box office (thank God).<br/><br/>As with other vanity products, the actors really cannot act and have the charisma of cheese. While I know this may sound like sacrilege to some, this is a lot like Paul McCartney's vanity opus, GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROADSTREET. Like this other film, lots of glitzy locales, special guest stars and noise were all used to try to hide the fact that the singers were not all that talented as actresses. Had all the glitz been removed, you would have been left with...well...nothing. So, instead there are a billion costume changes, crazy sets and pointless cameos--all to hide the utter vapid nature of the film. <br/><br/>Overall, a total waste of time for anyone but a Spice Girl zombie-fan. I saw it because I am a masochist--otherwise, don't bother."

","I was doubtful about this movie but my daughter insisted we watch it together. I was amazed at how art house it was – with throw backs to the old Beatles movie genre and other madcap '70's and 80's productions (Thunderbirds, the Monkees, etc). Apart from the catchy music and the generally enjoyable overacting – the all star cast makes it a genuine 'spot the actor' vehicle. (For example: this from http://filmbabble. blogspot.com/2007/06/20 -great-modern-movie-cameos.html : ""Elvis Costello as a bartender and credited as 'Himself' Costello plays a nice tongue-in-cheek note as the Girls talk about their possible flash-in-the-pan prospects"".) It spoofs everything about those bad movies we loved to watch – model buses jumping over model bridges, E.T. (the Movie) in 'bad green coats', the Magical Mystery Tour amazing bus, media moguls (Rupert Murdoch anyone?), Hollywood 'run and go' action movies, over-sexed Italian dancers etc. The more I watched the more I saw. I drove my daughter crazy pointing out ... 'hey that is a takeoff from ...'. If you are studying cinema or just have a movie trivia interest, Spice World certainly gives you more to argue about than Citizen Kain (sorry Orsen) or Pret-a-Porter (apologies to Robert too). If this movie was written by the Directors wife – she was a movie buff. It is better than you think!"

There are many many memorable moments from this film that every time it comes up in conversation people will always quote. One being the 'bus going over the bridge' scene and instead of having the stunt proceed a clay model is used.<br/><br/>The script is very funny and will get a laugh from even the most skeptical.

","This film is a blast! Definitely not to be taken seriously (some people act like they were expecting Shakespeare here), it's a funny, charming, witty and light hearted romp through a week or so in the life of the Spice Girls. Of course, the girls play stereotyped versions of themselves - Mel C is always exercising, while Baby is constantly sucking lollipops and Posh obsesses over which black Gucci dress to wear. <br/><br/>The girls aren't bad actors; they seem quite natural, which is probably not as easy as it sounds when making a film. The plot is quite simple, but the twists and turns it takes (eg the screen writers explaining their premise to Richard E Grant becomes a narrative of the girls actually doing the crazy things that so far have only been committed to paper) make it a wild ride. <br/><br/>My favorite part of the film is the incredible special effect of the double decker Spice bus leaping over an open drawbridge. The build up to this scene was perfectly tense, and the climax of the scene was brilliantly conceived and executed. I've seen this film many times over the last few years. Andjust so you know, I'm a 32 year old, straight Australian male."

","Between the ages of 9 and 11, the Spice Girls were my favourite pop group, which was a legitimate enough reason to see this film. It was the first film I ever saw at the then-new Virgin Cinema (now a Cineworld) in Spytty Park, Newport, South Wales and I have loved it ever since. Within the following year when the video was released, I was in my now-defunct local Woolworth's with my mother and sister and when my mother asked if I wanted her to buy this movie on video, it was an offer I couldn't refuse. I have watched it several times when I was younger but not in recent years because the video is in my bed drawer with the bed drawer side to the wall (like my 'Charlie's Angels' movie DVD) so I decided to rent the DVD after not having seen the film for as long as I could remember. It's as excellent today as it's always been and upon watching this today, I spotted a few things that I hadn't noticed in previous viewings such as Mel B styling Bob Geldof's hair at a party, Jonathan Ross interviewing the girls early in the film and Barry Humphries playing the hot-headed newspaper editor Kevin McMaxford.<br/><br/>While this film has lines that are silly and make no sense (such as Clifford's hair-in-plug holes announcement) and a cheap-looking scene of the Spice Bus jumping over the Tower Bridge as the girls rush to their concert, the dialogue is memorable and funny in parts, the cinematography is suitably varied, the editing is straightforward yet effective, the pacing is swift and the acting is just right with the Spice Girls truly allowing their personalities to shine, particularly Emma and Victoria (who smiles a bit more here than people may think). Despite some of the songs having different instrumentations than one would normally hear, the music is a essential asset to this romp and it was a good idea for the Spice Girls to use their second album Spiceworld as the main soundtrack and there were even some delights from their debut album Spice. The incidental music may be rarely used but it included a groovy piece when we first see the girls' pregnant friend Nicola and creepy, tense music when the bald photographer steps out of the toilet for example. Although the Spice Girls are the main stars here, there was fantastic support from Meat Loaf (who references one of his songs before the girls encounter some aliens) as Dennis the Spice Bus driver, Richard E Grant as Clifford, Naoko Mori as Nicola and Claire Rushbrook as Deborah plus more celebrity cameos from the likes of Elton John as himself, Michael Barrymore as Mr Step and Stephen Fry as the judge.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent musical comedy that didn't deserve the Razzie it received. 10/10."

Though some of the scenes could be considered corny or out of place, this film was overall very entertaining to its target audience: the fans. It is not for everyone. Just as I will never love the movie Purple Rain as much as my mother did due to her generation's love for Prince, not many will love Spice World the way Spice Girls fans do.<br/><br/>The Spice Girls were positive role models in the 90's for girls like me. Scary Spice inspired me to love my huge curly hair. Sporty Spice inspired me to embrace my inner tom-boy. Their songs were catchy and widely popular for a while. Their movie venture may not have been as successful as their songs. However, it was not a total flop. Spice World had a wacky but interesting story line and a few compelling sub-story lines.

They were my superstars that I hung posters up on my room. They were the girls I looked for inspiration, this ladies who were my idols at the tender age of seven. While watching this movie I got excited and loved singing to the songs with all my best friends. So what if it isn't a award winning performance? I will find this ""ancient"" movie in my attic one day thinking back to the 90s, and I will blow the dust off of the paper cover protecting the video cassette. What good memories it brings back. <br/><br/>If you were young at the time and loved the Spice Girls, then by all means watch it for those memories. If you were never a fan or never knew about them, don't watch it. I guess it's just a movie for us who have been fans screaming on the couch when we were in grade one."

","I was packing boxes because i was moving away and I find a box of old VSH's in my closet. So I start going trough them and I fall on Spice World. I decided to watch it. WHen that movie came out in 1997 i'd watch it almost every day. Back then I was about 6 or 7 now I'm 16, and i have to admit I found it really good for a movie of the 90's it brought back a lot of good memories of my childhood. People that say this movie sucked don't realize that this movie wasn't made to be serious it was made for fun, of course its not the best movie but i'll still give it a 10 because of the effort they made for this film. The Spice Girls were my childhood hero and I actually still listen to Melanie C's new solo album Beautiful Intentions and think she's great."

","OK, this movie was a totally pre-teen chick flick. It was incredibly corny, but hey i Kind of liked it. I was a fan of the spice girls, and their acting wasn't to to bad. I suggest no one to watch this if you're over the age of 14 and if your a guy. lol It's really just about them performing and being themselves, not a lot to it. OK, apparently i need to write more to post this comment.Ummm It's a cute movie, If you have daughters that are small they would probably like it. I never thought the Spice girls would be in a movie till this came out, it was pretty unexpected.Overall this move wasn't extremely bad, it was more like aimed at a certain audience."

","I have to say I am biased. I loved this movie when I was younger; I just find the Spice Girls to be fun. This movie has a wonderful imagination. There is the perfect amount of silliness to keep the older viewer watching. In my opinion, they have copious talent that today's popular female singers (eg, Lindsey Lohan, Britney Spears, Hillary Duff) couldn't dream of. For example, how many people, at any point in time, actually enjoyed watching one of their movies? I prefer to stay out of the 'popular' music of today, for I find it extremely lacking. The Spice Girls also stand more for 'girl power,' whereas today's singers won't have anything to do with it if it doesn't deal with ultimate dependence on a guy. I'll say it again, I love this movie. It's an enigma to me how movies as horrible as Napoleon Dynamite end up with higher ratings."

","Well, firstly, this had to be more popular when it first came out, like most movies. It's not meant to be serious, it's simply lighthearted and shouldn't be treated otherwise. Secondly, you have to realize that the Spice Girls aren't serious. Should they make a movie, it wouldn't be anything depressing or even anything that made you think. It is most pleasant to watch on a sleepover with your best friends and dance around lipsynching the words. You must be a Spice Girls fan to watch this movie. So it definitely depends on what you like, etc. So maybe it would have been more popular in 1996-1997, when the Girls first came out.<br/><br/>9/10--Because I'M a Spice Girls fan. ;-)"

","Being a massive Spice Girls fan when they were popular (I was a mere 12- or 13-year-old at the time), I really enjoyed the movie. Even now, as I remember the movie, I still think it's pretty good. For a movie with a British pop group, sure it's no ""A Hard Day's Night"" (the famous Beatles 1964 feature), but it's still fun. The music (while not the greatest) is infectious pop, the laughs are good, and the acting is good (not necessarily referring to the Spice Girls themselves, but the supporting roles). Although the Spice Girls do a bang-up job at portraying themselves as shown through the media and their so-called personas. I give it a 7 because it's not the best movie ever, but because it's a fun movie and for me, it's a stroll down memory lane."

Don't you get it? It's a satire about film making... And with the fabulous cameos (Elvis Costello, Elton John, MEATLOAF!! just to name a few..)how could you not love it? Just a teensy bit?<br/><br/>Trust me, the British know film, and they know what they're doing with this one. Instead of showing one ""real"" side of the spice girls, they've shoved 50 years of stereotypical rubbish into one movie. You've got people trying to make a movie, a documentary, and the tabloids trying to break the girls apart, along with aliens, hot Italian models and random deja vus. All in one.

It's just a guilty pleasure, and it's so much fun to watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas. You just need to keep in mind that it was publicity for their new record and it's not meant to be one of those heavy movies you over-analyse.

","Not sure why they included the word 'World' in their Spice World title when the girls occupy just two countries in this movie. Wait, backing up, why the hell would anyone think this was a good idea?<br/><br/>It's hard to pinpoint the most ridiculous and awful part of this over-complicated, and yet, plot less film. Was it the aliens that the girls could understand because of the subtitles? Was it the doctor on holiday when a baby just appears after birth? Was it the toilet photographer? Was it the Dr Who bus? Was it the Rocky theme for a half a dozen steps? Was it the neglecting-the-pregnant-friend morning scene so they could train sing at fruity boot camp? Was it Bond's sad turn as Blofeld? Was it the dozens of called in favors from the guest appearances? Was it the girls breaking the fourth wall in the end credits and, incredibly, believing there were more than one person in the audience? Was it the two teen fans that looked even less interested in spending time with the Spice Girls than anyone watching this even when they're playfully thrown from a random boat?<br/><br/>My excuse for watching this terrible plea to buy their CDs was that I listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast and it's all-but pointless listening to that hilarious podcast if you haven't seen the movie they make fun of on their show. I cannot wait to hear what they have to say about this. (I actually have a good idea as I watched this film.)<br/><br/>Basically we have five girlfriend singers who are stalked by an amateur documentary maker, sabotaged by a tabloid editor, yelled at by their manager, fantasized by the movie-within-the-movie director/writer and made to feel guilty by a random, yet never explained, pregnant friend. Mercifully – not really, but I do try to be positive at times – the girls keep on rocking and remain BFFs for-eve-r!<br/><br/>How on Earth did this make From Justin to Kelly look comprehensible?<br/><br/>My guess, this movie began the downfall of the group and even if you're a die-hard fan to the end, spare yourself from this dreadful pile of donkey's discharge.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Admittedly, I actually attended a Spice Girls concert once, back in the 1990s. Personally, I only liked 2-3 of their songs (still do,) but not enough to see them in concert. But, for a friend who absolutely loved them, I bought two tickets for us to go since he was feeling down. For whatever reason, he couldn't go and he sent me with his boyfriend who also liked them. It was literally one of the most painful experiences I've hadthat is, up until I saw this movie. After showing up a ton late, the girls played a dozen or so songs I'd never heard of, nor liked, and took – no kidding, 4-5 15-minute intermissions in between every 2-3 songs. It wasn't bad enough I didn't really want to be there in the first place, I was barely friends with the boyfriend replacement and I didn't care for their music as a whole, but they stretched it out as long as possible with far too many breaks.<br/><br/>And still, I would rather go back to that concert than watch this again."
"SyncSessions","10","6","11","11 December 2007"," Wonderful movie
","This is the best movie I have ever seen. These 5 women are true stars, and shine in their brilliant performances in this film. Spice World has it all; comedy, friendship, girl power, and fantastic music. They really know how to give the fans what they want. The costumes are flashy and the plots and goofy and interesting. Every movie needs a good alien scene. Not to mention one with guys' asses showing through the cut outs in shiny purple jumpsuits. The only ridiculously unbelievable part of this movie is the bad guy, who wants to see the demise of the Spice Girls. The notion that anyone could dislike these five music geniuses is heinous. Overall, this movie gives people a reason to live."
"MarissaWalrus","10","6","11","15 August 2007"," An euphoric experience that everyone essentially must enjoy
","Movies come in three basic categories: flick, movie, and film. What Spice World amazingly does is break the barrier to create a whole new category that cannot be describe in any words for it's so profound beyond any comprehension. The pure excellence of this movie has forced me to never compare any other movie to this one; it's quite difficult to compare any movie that I have seen and will see to a movie that's more than a standard deviation above a film.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that Spice World is the best movie made and is a universal symbol for what the cinema should be. Always. It is crafted with such delicate perfection that it's tantamount, if not paramount to, a Hearts on Fire Diamond.<br/><br/>Now, the message of this is a vital message that our society has never received before: Girl Power. This is not a simple movie about feminism or oppression of women, or how to break barriers that are implanted by the almighty Man. It's about none of that. We see five young ladies struggle with the identities that society has knighted them with. As most hardcore Spice Girls fans know is that they did not chose to be deemed ""Ginger Spice"" ""Posh Spice"" and so on and so forth. Those alter egos were in fact forced upon them with a printing of a magazine. We see these ladies not as the ""Spice Girls"" but rather as women who are broken and are in a constant struggle with their true identity meanwhile the struggle of their job being that facade of flamboyancy that is just so them.<br/><br/>""I think we're just getting comfortable with who we are"" is the beautifulest line in the movie and is response to Melanie C stating ""Why do people stereotype us all the time?"" I teared up when I heard that. This film took the universal concept of identity that everyone struggles with at some point in their life, and they made this wonderful piece of art.<br/><br/>Aside from its profound meaning, it's a genuinely fun movie to watch. Ever since I saw Spice World, I am strong with my stance that every single movie should feature Meatloaf as a character making weak references to his gloriously powerful songs such as ""I'd do anything for love, but I won't do that"". With a pinch of pop culture references, the cinematic experience the viewer goes through is tantamount to an euphoria.<br/><br/>Thanks to Spice World, I have learned the true meaning behind Geri's words of ""Girl Power"". This film is definitely one of the movies that everyone must see at least twice. The only criticism I have is the unrealistic transition between outside bus to inside the Spice Bus. However, such minute details can be overlooked."

","Let's just be brutally honest here; this is a Spice Girls vehicle. No doubt about it. From the biggest hater of the film to the biggest fan of the girls, everyone might as well admit from the very beginning: this film was primarily (and, in the opinion of many, purely) made to promote the Spice Girls as well as their then-new album. The moment you realize/accept that fact is the moment that this film gets easier to sit through. However, it still is very, very hard to sit through, and the majority of the people I know wouldn't be able to sit through the entirety of this mess of a film, not even to satisfy the most basic human instincts of curiosity by finding out what happens in the end. The film pretty much plays like a 90-minute promotional video, or a compilation of music videos with pointless plot in-between each performance to keep the music from getting to be too much. Newsflash: the people who would willingly watch this would most likely be just as happy with a 90-minute compilation of music videos or live performances; they don't care about the film itself. I'm not saying that every single Spice Girls fan hated, or even disliked the film itself(I'm not even claiming that one single fan didn't enjoy seeing the girls being ""themselves""); what I am saying is that they wouldn't have cared if this feature was a 90-minute long music video, instead of the barely coherent mess that the movie is. But, back to the point I was trying to make; the film is a Spice Girls movie. Not a comedy, or a music movie, but a Spice Girls movie. Made entirely for the fans. This, of course, means that the movie is exclusively enjoyable for the fans... and now that the girl-band is no longer a hot subject, and it's no longer ""in"" to like them, their fan-base has been reduced to a minimum. Therefore, now, only seven years after the film was made(or a few years ago, for that matter; ever since they stopped being popular) the film will only appeal to those who are still fans. As you have probably figured out by everything I've written up to this point, I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of the girls. They are charming, sure, their songs are catchy(admit it, even you've hummed along one or two of their singles when it came on the radio), and they are, undeniably, quite attractive, but that's all there is to it... and that's certainly not enough to carry a feature film, once they're no longer famous. Of course, the director probably didn't think about that, and merely made the film to capitalize on their popularity. Oh well. The film now belongs in the same category as one of those films made about some famous guy/girl/group of people that people no longer care about... probably all inspired by The Beatles(unless someone came before them... I'm not sure if they were the first bands to do feature films). The thing is, The Beatles not only were popular back when they made their films, some 30-40 years ago; they still are popular. The Spice Girls aren't. They were merely the newest of the popular teen-bands... and they didn't last much longer than most others. Now, that's enough for the analyzing, on to the review. The plot is barely coherent and poorly paced, constantly throwing new characters into the story, that appear for a few minutes only to disappear again, as well as introducing subplots that are never used to full advantage. The acting is atrocious. The characters are tired stereotypes. The cinematography is forgettable and unimaginative. The humor is British humor at its worst(I think, at least; I haven't seen enough British comedies to determine if there is a lower level than this). All in all, the film have little to offer(apart from one or two clever references and some good self-parodying in one or two places) to anyone but Spice Girls fans. I recommend this exclusively to Spice Girls fans. It's to painful to sit through for virtually anyone else, even if it's just to laugh at the pure stupidity of it. Everyone but Spice Girls fans: Avoid at all costs. 1/10"

There is nothing redeemable about this whatsoever, it's pure trash, and since the 'music' of The Spice Girls has no longevity neither does this.<br/><br/>If you want to pick this up along with the girl's entire back catalogue of CDs, I recommend checking out the bargain bins in charity shops.

Of course on their way a draw bridge is going up and they do the same old ""Speed"" scene.

C'mon, lighten up! This movie was never meant to inspire or stimulate the intellect. It was made strictly for laughs. The Spice Girls even made fun of themselves. Anything is fair game! The first time I saw ""Spice World"" was in 1998 when I took my daughter, then 10, to the movies. Although she enjoyed it (she was big on the Spice Girls at that time), for me it was sheer torture and an insult to my intelligence. I wanted to cover my face and hope that nobody saw me. I felt that the movie was an excellent example of intellectual manslaughter! If this wasn't bad enough, when the movie was released on video, my daughter wanted the video as well. So we got to see the movie in the privacy of our home. Oh boy! But seeing the movie in the spirit that it was made in, was a totally different experience. It was actually entertaining in a corny way! It definitely qualifies as a candidate for the Golden Turkey Award because it is so bad that it's good! The great and talented Sir Roger Moore obviously read the script before he agreed to contribute his talents to this movie. So it is obviously that he saw the movie for what it was meant to be, a satire, or as they put it it, a mockumentary.<br/><br/>The movie was loosely based on the Beatles' HARD DAY'S NIGHT. (OK, before you Beatles fans go into a frenzy over that remark, let me explain and redeem myself!) The movie is about a wildly popular group as they tour the country. In 1964, the Beatles traveled by train. In 1997, the Spice Girls traveled by their ridiculously luxurious bus. The scene around the bus should serve as a tip off that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously! Both movies involved a villain who hated the main attraction of the movie.<br/><br/>So unless you are an ""old teenager"" with fond memories of the ""good old days"" (the 1990s), you may want to lock the door, put on a set of head phones (or turn the volume down low so nobody can hear what you are trying to watch) before putting this movie on.<br/><br/>Then, just lighten up and try not to take everything so damned seriously. You may actually find yourself enjoying this awful movie!"

","I remember when I was first exposed to Spice Girls . It was my friend's 8th birthday party in, I believe, 1996. The party consisted of cake, presents, and a talent show. My friend entered in the contest sporting a curly wig doing the robot dance to ""Wannabe"". Needless to say, she got top scores<br/><br/>and won the contest. Since that day and 50 million records later, the Spice Girls hit their climax in the film 'Spice World"".<br/><br/>Named after their sophomore album, Spice World has almost zero story line. <br/><br/>Spice World includes everything from aliens, underground clubs, and Posh<br/><br/>Spice driving a giant Union Jack double decker bus over Tower Bridge. It has some mindless yet memorable lines (the one about manta-rays comes to mind)<br/><br/>and even features a cameo from Roger Moore.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, Spice World is on my list as one of my top cult faves ever.

It also never takes itself too seriously and has tons of great jokes plus meta moments. The girls play a heightened self-parody version of themselves in the film. This is most evident when they are on the bus and talk about how people stereotype them. There is clearly a layer of irony in how oblivious they are. The film also makes fun of movie hallmarks encountering many movie cliches such as alien spaceships, manipulative press, bus chases, the rags to riches flashback etc.<br/><br/>The film delivers these tropes in a very tongue in cheek way, clearly satirizing them but never to a pretentious extent. The most impressive thing about it is that while the film is clearly mocking a lot of things it never forgets to be fun and highly entertaining. There are also surrealistic elements to the film such as the conversations between the heads of the press plotting to destroy the careers of the Spice Girls, the conversations between the movie executives and the bus chase scene. These give the film a very unique style of comedy which is more akin to sketch comedy and I would go as far to say that the bus chase is one of my favourite scenes in all of film period.<br/><br/>A very fun, adrenaline-filled film that has been criminally overlooked. Besides, you can't go wrong with the music of the Spice Girls which the movie constantly assaults you with. Also, Baby Spice is the best spice don't @ me."

","Never have the words ""this is one for fans of <insert name>"" been more appropriate than with this movie. It doesn't really take a lot to sum it up, as there is next to no plot, but be it known: Spice Girls fans will adore this movie. Those who are fairly tolerant of the Spicies, without being avid fans, will find it amusing. Everyone else will cringe at a slackly made filmic cash cow that was devised just to pump more money out of Spice Girls fans back when the girls were in their heyday.<br/><br/>That said, this film will definitely go down as a part of pop-culture history. The Spice Girls were the epitome of mid-1990s 'girl group' phenomena, and this movie sums them up nicely: catchy, bratty, fun and simple. The movie has a lot of cameos, plenty of in-jokes and some funky musical numbers as the girls prepare for their first live gig, but it was never going to win any Brit awards.<br/><br/>So there you have it.

That's not too difficult to figure out, or so I thought until I read some of the reviews here.  <br/><br/>Did they think that Baby Spice would win an Oscar for her performance?  Did they think that a movie 'based' on the Girls' lives would be thought-provoking?  Maybe they just thought that this would be the first PG-rated movie with full nudity.  I can't figure it out.<br/><br/>I personally like the Spice Girls.  They seem like they are a lot of fun, and their music is upbeat.  To be honest, I think that they brought us out of the drudge of Grunge and Hard-core rap that we were experiencing in the mid-90's.  They brought the happiness back to music.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I blame them fully for the popularity of all these teeny-bopper singers that have invaded my radio, but that's not my point.<br/><br/>'Spice World' is just a fun little movie that is a guilty pleasure for me and many other people.

","In 1997, you couldn't turn your heads round without seeing the Spice Girls on every crisp packet, sweet wrapper, and condom packet in the land (well, maybe not the last one). They were the biggest craze I personally have ever witnessed. After making two hit albums, they decided to have a go at acting, and made a film finally released in December '97 (I believe). I was too embarrassed to queue up to see it at the cinema.<br/><br/>In mid-'98, SpiceWorld was released on video in a range of special edition tins with all five members on. Quite ironic really, considering Geri had left the band in March. The woman at the counter couldn't help but chuckle as I'm at the counter with £15 purchasing this. Something tells me I should have worn a mask to hide my identity.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I haven't seen it again. It sits on the shelf gathering dust. I'm giving it away at a car boot sale next week. It's an absolutely poor film. The Spice Girls are about as useful as actresses as a pea-shooter in a gun battle. The plot is absolutely hideous. Not that I can be bothered to remember any of it. Richard E Grant stars as The Spice Girls manager, who tries to stop some villains trying to make them look like retired amateur porn stars. Could have fooled me, they already do. The gags are so useless and make the five stars of this movie look total idiots. What's so frightening is, the gags are scripted!

"The_Movie_Cat","6","3","6","27 December 1999"," ""Can they act? Did anyone care if Marilyn Monroe could act?""
","I was stunned to find the panning this film got. Okay, it's not high art, but it's a good laugh, surely?<br/><br/>One thing removed from this film in just two years is the veneer of satire. Released in England at a time when the media had begun a predictable backlash and the Spice Girls were about to jettison their manager, this tale of dictating management and not-that-subtle Robert Maxwell spoofs was vaguely on the money. Now that such things are behind the group, and they are indeed back in media favour (for marriages and babies more than the music, and without Geri) this edge is stripped from the film.<br/><br/>So, what are we left with? Well, the girls aren't about to threaten the Academy Awards, though ""Baby Spice"", who had acted professionally before the group, is noticeably stronger than the rest. Characterisation is strictly one-dimensional, with the constant ""Gucci dress"" fixations of Victoria and crowbarred-in football associations of ""Sporty"" the most irritating element. Suprisingly, the loudest member, Mel G, has the least material foisted on her, and takes the minor role in all the amateurish vignettes. Baby is allowed to smile cutely, and Geri is the brunt of a cavalcade of bra jokes. But this isn't so bad, surely? To spend 90 minutes in the company of five pretty girls, well, four pretty girls, three, well, two, surely, isn't so hard.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the lack of on-screen presence the girls generate means that they have to be supported by a wide variety of actors, and even other pop stars that achieve a greater presence in momentary cameos (look out for the great scene with Elvis Costello, forced to work as a barman now times are hard). George Wendt, Richard O'Brien, Barry Humphries and even Meatloaf add an air of interest to proceedings, meaning that when the camera switches back to the stars it does tend to sag.<br/><br/>When the girls do start to get interesting is when they're performing their songs. Though as most of their songs are remixed or rejigged snippets, this would surely fail to attract the teeny-tot audience at which the film is primarily aimed. As I've said, there are moments of attempted satire, though these are less well-aimed barbs than poorly-aimed damp squibs.<br/><br/>Yet still I contend: songs, girls, Roger Moore sending himself up rotten and Richard E.Grant overacting enormously. Not a classic, certainly, but surely good for a throwaway laugh?"

","About half way through Spice World, it dawned on me that it wasn't going to get any better than the level it was maintaining and a nasty thought hit me: ""when people ask me why I actually motivated myself to sit down and watch this all the way through, I am going to have to think of something to say in reply rather than merely shrug and look down at the floor in embarrassment."" I found myself for the next ten minutes thinking up various excuses I could use as reasons but eventually settled for 'Curiosity'.<br/><br/>Yes; when a film is so bad it motivates you to actually think up reasons you're going to have to say to people when they ask you why you watched it, it's struggling. As it was with Thunderbirds, I was curious as to know what the hell it was all about. I was old enough to remember the Spice Girls and old enough to dislike them but distinctly recall this film getting released. Following the break up and now apparent reunification, Spice World as a film doesn't even hold together as a piece of nostalgic nonsense that should be good enough to kill a few hours as we watch global female icons strut around in little costumes and sing silly little songs. Spice World does not even give us the luxury of having a plot; instead it is more of a documentary-come-spoof of not only the band in question but certain generic films of yesteryear. This means it plays out more like Epic Movie than anything else.<br/><br/>Spice World is really just one massive contradiction. It contradicts itself, its characters contradict what they want to be and how they want to be seen as and even the immediate ending contradicts whether or not it is a film within a film. At the time of the Spice Girls, there was very much an atmosphere of the band wanting to take over. The title of this film: 'Spice World' suggests a world full of 'spice'; the video for the song of the same name is set in a dystopian future where everything is exactly that; the 'V' sign the girls use to signify girl power is commonly associated with 'victory', ie; Victory, girl power rules'; there is also the familiar sight of a band cashing in on consumerism and globalisation as they make their presence more known around the world. But rather than Spice World posing as some sort of political/musical version of Battleship Potemkin; its scenes play out more like a retread of films that we've already seen. Roger Moore was James Bond and he spoofs the Bond villain persona; Richard E. Grant sits and listens to film pitches alá The Player and the final incident involving a bomb blowing up not only means the film is confused as to whether its fiction or not but whether or not it thinks the fourth wall is reparable once it has been broken.<br/><br/>The worst example of contradictory content in the film comes very early on when the girls are sitting in a bus, that looks more like an actual room than anything else, discussing how they hate being seen as the 'baby'; the 'posh one' the 'scary one', etc. Fine you think, maybe they are getting sick of that but what follows is an immediate counteraction to their complaint in the form of a montage showing each of the girls dressed as Wonder Woman, Marilyn Monroe and then of each other. The girls go from wearing their clothes, acting dumb and stating that ""there's more to us than just our persona tags"" to..........wearing even more clothes and costumes and acting in an even dumber manner. You can imagine the thought process: so Ginger Spice doesn't like to be called Ginger Spice anymore; ""Ok, I know; I'll dress up like Wonder Woman and crack a whip."" Yes, I can see there's so much more to you than your generic tags. The other glaring example of contradiction in this film that the girls fall foul of comes in the form of their allegiances. Nearer the beginning of the film rather than the middle, the girls talk about how important their fans are to them; this idea returns to haunt them since the actual final third revolves around a dilemma the girls face: stay with a friend as they give birth and shun fans waiting at the gig or vice-versa. There should be no argument: they've established their fans come first but what happens is they counter balance their priorities by staying in the hospital with their pregnant friend.<br/><br/>Spice World is a film that does absolutely no favours for anyone and that includes the girls themselves. The Spice Girls come across as plastic, one-dimensional and rather stupid; frequently getting their priorities, beliefs and ideas mixed up with one another; never giving us the impression these are smart and good people making smart and good music. The film's portrayal of Italians and homosexuals is disappointing as is the incompetent film crew consisting of a black man and a fat person; the way the bad guy is a fat, spitting Australian bent on magazine sales who has an English assistant is horrible; the film's narrative wants us to believe that stuff being printed in the newspapers by a man who gets the scoops in an impossible manner is entertaining and realistic but it's just silly. There just isn't enough space to cover all the things horribly wrong with this film but I am surprised this didn't destroy the Spice Girls when it first came out. Cheap laughs; a nasty narrative; horrible archetypes and so many times in which the focus band of the title come across as incompetent is enough to label this trash, 'trash'."

But hey, if you answered ""Yes"" to those questions, chances are you've already seen the Spice Girls more than once. You remember that they were a huge hit, that Spice Girls paraphernalia drowned girlish child and tweenie stores, and that you and your best friends would pretend you were the Spice Girls during recess and argue about who got to be Baby Spice. If you answered ""Yes,"" chances are Spice Girls still retains that touch of magic it always has. What is the ""touch""? Who can be sure. Perhaps it's the fact those Spice Girls kicked butt, that their clothes were cool, that they came out on top, those neat accents (if you didn't grow up in the UK), their awesome clothes, and those completely addictive songs that were the most fun to sing during slumber parties. It is what it is. That being said, for all you ""No,"" people, the Spice Girls is not going to have the same memories or magic touch for you.

If the movie was a huge sign of girl power, since they say it over and over and over again, then i get the point that girl power is high shoes and short skirts and pure garbage. i give them the credit for their singing, i like their singing. but the acting really must go somewhere far far away, and thank the lord another movie wasnt made.  they should have done a live concert and then made into a dvd special collectors item, and thrown in some free stickers. that could have made more money than that movie ever couldve made with the sales of owning it and seeing it in the cinema. if you were ever a spice girl crazed fan, who felt the need to view every item of girl power produced, trust me when i say that you are NOT missing anything if you never saw this.

","I saw this one through an illegal black box in 1998. I'm a closet fan of the Spice Girls and I still have songs that I downloaded through Napster on CD-R. However, much like (name your pop-star), they aren't actors and it shows here.<br/><br/>BUT, they know it and the SG make a quasi-documentary based on The Beatle's ""Hard Day's Night"". Because I haven't seen ""Hard Day's Night"", I won't be as critical here as others. I think the movie does a good job of depicting a week in the life of the SG but too much of the film is spent with utter silliness and stupidity with their ""Girl Power"" stuff. Lots of cameo appearances here as well, with the one surprise being former ""Kids In The Hall"" alum Mark McKinney.<br/><br/>There is one scene that is total BS though: There is a flashback scene in the middle where the SG are nobodies and they're at a greasy spoon with their Oriental friend and they say they have a song and a dance routine that they hope will give them fame. Oh, I guess that means that you weren't put together by a producer and given dance lessons and song lyrics from others. You were always buddy-buddy and aren't like all the other put together for a buck pop groups. What total crap! Why would they even try to sell that fact anyway? I guess they think 9 year-olds wouldn't have a clue about the true motives of why they were cobbled up. Truly the biggest lie on celluloid ever. Otherwise, this ""film"" is tolerable."
"Electrified_Voltage","3","2","4","25 November 2007"," Regardless of what you think of the Spice Girls' music, this is an unfocused mess!
","I remember during the Spice Girls' heyday in the late 90's, I despised them for a while. When I think back, I don't know exactly why I did, but I was only eleven/twelve years old at the time, so I've obviously changed a bit since then. Right now, I'm basically indifferent to the group, so I don't have any strong feelings about their reunion. Anyway, I obviously wouldn't have even thought of watching this movie back in the day, but a decade after it first came out, I have finally watched it, and have learned that I wasn't missing much.<br/><br/>The film shows the Spice Girls (Melanie B, Melanie C, Emma, Victoria, and Geri) as they travel around in England on their double-decker bus, meeting lots of people, and sometimes having fun, but also experiencing all sorts of trouble. Meanwhile, a newspaper editor named Kevin McMaxford, who hates the Spice Girls, is spreading rumours about them to try and ruin their reputation, and a film director named Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth keeps coming up with silly movie ideas for the band. The five pop stars have a gig coming up in a few days at the Royal Albert Hall in London, but as it draws near, a lot gets in their way! <br/><br/>Some love the Spice Girls and some hate them, but regardless of that, as a film, ""Spice World"" is a very poor effort. The story isn't very well-written, carelessly slopped together, and it seems a lot of things were just thrown in, such as the group meeting extraterrestrial fans. The film often seems rushed, jumping from one scene to another too quickly. The script, which was clearly just slopped together as well, is very poor, with both the band members and other characters blurting out lines which are supposed to be funny, but are just ridiculous! Almost all the gags in the film (yes, this is a comedy) are lame. I never laughed, and none of the gags ever gave me a full smile. Lastly, the ending of the film is a tad abrupt.<br/><br/>Now, if I were a big Spice Girls fan, I'm sure that would have helped a bit, as a good number of their songs are featured in this film, whether in full or in part, but I still certainly wouldn't have cared for much else in the film. I think I've made it clear that regardless of the music, this is one unfocused mess of a film! It was probably meant for the group's preteen fans mainly. I remember a lot of them, the majority of them girls, but there were definitely quite a few boys as well, and I'm sure most of these fans liked it. However, the movie really doesn't have a lot for most people, apart from the songs for fans, and sadly, that is not enough to make up for the extremely poor quality of ""Spice World""."

I know that I love it because I grew up with the Spice Girls.

The story is simply empty other than these bunch of skimpy dressed girls fooling around all over London and a brief encounter of some kind of aliens.

Too bad they've could've improved the plot a little bit, it would've been a big hit. Girl power is alive and well, but it didn't help The Spice Girls staying power. 2 out of 5 stars for Campiness."

","Girl-bands (or boy-bands for that matter) should just stick to what they know best - singing and making music videos, and this movie serves to prove my point. With their zero acting ability, the movie more than bored me. The only reason I (and my friends) continued watching was the concert and singing parts. Only then were they in their element. Should have rented a video of the concert. Cost the same and I get to see and hear more singing, and no acting at all."
"HallmarkMovieBuff","Null","2","6","2 December 2007"," The ultimate derivative work
","A hodgepodge of cultural references, a plethora of cameos, and innumerable implicit references to other movies combine to prove once again that, for any given pop group, a documentary would be better than a padded script, and a straight concert film would be better than a documentary. Take every category under which any film was ever filed, and there's a bit of it thrown in here.<br/><br/>This could have been a decent concert film if it hadn't been constantly interrupted by so-called plot...and if there were actually more songs. Granted, there are a few inventive situations scattered throughout for off-stage interplay, but the whole thing could have been much better if all the men and their subplots just disappeared and the girls were just allowed to sing and play.<br/><br/>Previously unavailable on DVD except in pan and scan mode (at least every place I've ever shopped), this film has finally been re-released on DVD in its original wide screen format on the eve of a tenth year reunion tour. What the DVD needs, but lacks, is a play mode which just strings together all the musical scenes, cutting out the talky distractions."

","I remember watching this movie when I was around six, and loving it. I borrowed it from my cousin about a million times. Recently, I raided my cousins movie collection to find something to borrow, and when I saw Spice World, I thought, why not? It would be fun taking a trip down memory lane. Now that I have seen it again, I'm not entirely sure how I ever managed to watch the entire thing. It's quite possibly one of the worse movies I've ever seen. The plot was crap, the acting was crap, the best thing about it was the music (which isn't even that great itself) and if I wanted to hear SG music, I'd buy a CD. Believe me, you wouldn't want to waste your time or your money on this low budget,mediocre film. I've seen it, and now I can't help but wonder exactly how many hours I spent watching this movie throughout my life, that I'll never get back."

","Spice World (1997): Dir: Bob Spiers / Cast: Geri Halliwell, Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm: Contributes absolutely nothing as something hailed as a musical. It presents a muddled premise that plays off many dimwitted subplots. Title regards influence as if the world really needs more Spice Girls. We see the Spice Girls in concert, bizarre movie ideas, unsatisfied reporters, media problems, signing autographs for aliens, and yes, a childbirth scene. Just what is this nonsense about? Directed like a bad music video by Bob Spiers who previously gave the world the horrible remake of That Darn Cat. With that film being a total waste of film it is obvious that lightning strikes twice and this poor sap gets struck with a second terrible film choice. The only difference here is that he gets to direct five reasonably attractive women who cannot act. The film is colorful to look at but not pleasant to experience. Despite their popularity The Spice Girls cannot act nor lip synch their own music. They are colorful in their flashy outfits as well as being attractive to boot, but that doesn't carry their performances above embarrassment. Plus we have a variety of celebrity cameos who had nothing better to do than sign onto this piece of crap. If you are looking to spice up your world then I recommend the weather channel and leave this film to suffer in its own defeat. Score: 2 / 10"

","As the Spice Girls prepare for what may be their most prestigious concert, everyone in the world wants them. <br/><br/>Their manager Clifford and his behind the scenes boss want to control the girls' lives with the sole goal of getting them to the concert in the best shape possible. <br/><br/>A documentary crew wants access during the girls' busy schedule. A Hollywood pitch team wants them to star in a movie. The London tabloids want to print whatever they can get their hands on, even if it ruins the girls' careers. <br/><br/>Through it all, the girls evaluate their lives and wonder if they've lost sight of what is really important in life.........<br/><br/>The ironic thing about this film is that the things that are shown as a 'danger' to them in the film, are the exact same thing that gave these five stars the career and the money they have today.<br/><br/>And it's the same people who thought it would be a good idea to release a Spice Girls film, to milk every last penny they could from the girls. And it's a good job they released it when they did, because they had just reached their peak.<br/><br/>So the film is nothing more than an excuse for them to sing their hits, and inbetween have some fun little cameos for the older members of the audience. And it's just all over the place.<br/><br/>Obviously the group can't act, but they have screen presence, and the story is paper thin, throwing everything in the mix to try and avoid people from spotting the incoherence of the plot.<br/><br/>It is rubbish, just like the processed pap that the group released over their two years at the top of their 'game', and paved the way for the loud mouthed teenagers we have strutting the streets being totally abhorrent toward one another and their peers.<br/><br/>That's Girl Power.<br/><br/>An utterly vile piece of filth that should never be seen by anyone."

The Spice girls in a way gathered all the pop life elements in their movie, mocking even themselves, they tried to show the world that this is all a fun ride and you must enjoy every minute of it while it lasts, and this is what they did in their 2 years world domination rally! You can't watch this movie though if you're a pop music or Spice Girls hater, if you are into pop and into light comedy and cheesy jokes then this movie is for your eyes only (a little wink to Roger Moore's cameo). Relax, get your best friend with whom you spent most of the 90's hearing ace of base and Take that on your CD player and enjoy this movie for old times sake! Now the acting, the plot, the script etc... They all fade into the background when you've got the Spice girls up front doing their thing!

"Crap_Connoisseur","Null","1","2","10 January 2006"," A Classic Of World Cinema
","Sometimes IMDb really mystifies me. Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge Of The Sith is in the top 250, while Spice World lurks in the bottom 100. Admittedly, both films are equally rubbish but at least Spice World is awful in a highly original manner unlike the afore mentioned bucket of cinematic vomit.<br/><br/>Spice World is a trash classic and a true oddity of the 1990s. In an era where films seem to be manufactured on a conveyor belt, Spice World is truly one of a kind. A film that places the Spice Girls within a fictional narrative involving aliens and delivering babies is surely unique. Love it or hate it, but at least admit that it is different.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the movie is hilarious. I didn't really expect any of the Spice Girls to be great actresses but watching them struggle to even convincingly play themselves is amusing. The plot is suitably ridiculous and the musical segments are agreeable enough. Spice World may be crap, but it is always entertaining.<br/><br/>If watching Posh Spice fall into a river is not your idea of great cinema, then I pity you. Give me Spice World over George Lucas' lazy CGI marathon any day."

But know that I've re-watched it, all I can say is that gets better. The line I'm using as summary is just an ace line from the only Spice that brings a good performance: Victoria. Don't know if she's playing herself and she just cartoonize herself even more. She has the best lines and she knows how to bring em.<br/><br/>The stupid situations are getting better. Nothing compares with the scene when they are in the country house and start to talk about they nightmares. Or when they see themselves as moms. They had really good charm."

","I remember watching this when it first came out and it was OK but nothing special. Recently I came across a copy and gave it a second viewing, and found it a great laugh and a very pleasurable way to spend eighty-odd minutes. In a time when so many people in the entertainment business take themselves so seriously it is great to watch the five girls make fun of themselves, they knew their acting ability was minimal, except perhaps for Geri, who may have a future in this field. The plot works on several levels, on one hand it can be seen as pure slapstick but also their are more serious threads running through it, such as press intrusion, media distortion of offhand comments (such as Geri's remark about the pope) and the girl's dilemma of balancing their responsibilities between their management and loyalty to a friend (Nicola). This film came out at a time when you couldn't watch TV or open a paper without seeing articles about the Spice Girls, I think many people were put off the girls by this and hence the negative reaction to the film initially. If you can watch this with an open mind just sit back and allow your self to have a laugh at the comedy, enjoy the music and perhaps take on board some of the serious questions the film poses."

","This movie is not nearly as bad as people would have you think. Instead, it's a victim of the huge Spice Girls backlash of the late 1990s, when the market was saturated with Spice Girls this and that.<br/><br/>Basically, a copycat of ""A Hard Days Night"" with the Beatles, the movie does what it was intended to do: appeal to 11 year old girls. Other people, particularly adults, who so violently HATE this are a little disturbed, in my opinion. It's not supposed to be shakespeare and the girls never claimed to be Lawrence Olivier. It's silly, dumb and sugary sweet, and there's nothing wrong with that at all.<br/><br/>When I was in college, this was the weekly free movie (we got to see one movie of their choosing a week for free if we showed our student ID at the door). People hooted and hollered and derided it to no end, but secretly I'm sure they all liked it on some level, just like I did. See, it's not COOL to like the Spice Girls. <br/><br/>A harmless family movie that you can rent and enjoy with your young daughters, without worrying about foul language, violence and sexual innuendo."

Most people who say they hate them or try to commit you to an institution if you say you like them, probably have never given the music a serious listen, and certainly never watched this movie. I'm a huge fan of the Beatles, so I found it quite easy to get sucked into the Spice phenomenon, and must say that everyone I've turned onto their music begrudgingly though it may be, admits they cant help liking it. As far as the film, again think of A Hard Days Night. Completely plot less, just a vehicle to hear the music and see the larger than life performers on the big screen. Ahh, but it was a slick well made film wasn't it and the charisma of the stars did in fact carry it over the goal line. So it can also be said, constant reader, of Spice World. Take my advice and rent it, if you feel you must you can always do so under a phony name."

As their music is running throughout the movie, if you truly can't stand it, you will not like it.

It would have been better if there had been more music though, but overall a worthy effort."
"notoriousaurus","10","1","2","20 February 2001"," Beautiful, simply beautiful.
","It is a shame that most movies fail where an outrageous comedy such as Spice World succeeds. The back of the laserdisc that I purchased without seeing compared the movie as a cross between A Hard Day's Night and This Is Spinal Tap. You couldn't have a better comparison.<br/><br/>I am not the biggest Spice girls fan, but writing this review in 2001 long after their 15 minutes of fame are over, I can be a little less closed-minded.<br/><br/>Here is some questions that you in 2001 (and beyond) may ask of this movie:<br/><br/>1) Is this movie is funny?<br/><br/>Yes it is, I agree that if you liked A Hard Day's Night you will enjoy Spice World also. It is funny in the very same nature. A pop sensation gets into all sorts of trouble when they have to be both a pop-group and true to themselves. It leads to some hilarious sequences, some in a dream state.<br/><br/>2) Do I have to like the Spice Girls to enjoy Spice World?<br/><br/>It helps, looking back now on the ""Spice phenomenon"" of 1997-1998 I can think of no real reason why I disliked them, they are decent singers and each had their own distinctive style to them. It is funny in retrospect how much this group DID NOT share in the same style as the Backstreet Boys and N*Sync. The Spice Girls were separate entities, while today's boy bands aren't. The movie revels in this, each bit of dialog having wit and coming exactly from the lips of the characters that say them. Everything fits together beautifully and is seamless. Anyone with a sense of fun can enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>3) Does the movie have camp appeal?<br/><br/>Absolutely. You have many many fun and campy scenes. Hear Roger Moore say ""A chicken without a head can only know where it came from, but cant see where it's going. Don't be that chicken!"" or hear Victoria tell Geri how to help a sick boy out, ""Why don't you take your top off for him?--I know I was just joking."" To which Geri replies, ""I know. No real point in that though, his eyes are sealed shut--Oh look NOW there open!"" At it's very least Spice World has HUGE camp appeal and look for the hilarious Bob Hoskins cameo!<br/><br/>4) Is watching Spice World a religious experience?<br/><br/>No. But you will have a good time if you have any sense of humour, and that is what movies are all about. Check it out, I bet you will like it!<br/><br/>Peace out,<br/><br/>Shawn"

Well, Alan's role was not worthy of his enormous talent, but shockingly I found this movie, as a whole, entertaining. I was even more shocked to find that a couple of the girls actually had some talent (I won't name names to protect the worshipers) I've never paid attention to the Spice Girls -- their music is okay, but not something I would buy. There were some really lame parts to the movie (the flashes to the future, the whole baby thing, etc.), but overall it was somewhat amusing. It's too bad that it was all fabricated -- they should have taken a Madonna ""Truth or Dare"" approach -- maybe then the critics would have been more kind. However, I liked the cameo performances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins, etc. and I loved the takes on other movies and songs (e.g. Spice Girl Five aka Tarantino's Fox Force Five in Pulp Fiction, etc. and Meatloaf's line about ""I won't do that""). Anyway, I don't know who to recommend this movie to. After seeing the movie, those who hate them will only hate them more, and those who love them continue to do so.

The movie is not a film, it is the Spice Girls remaking a ""Hard Day's Night.""  But, you have to take that grain of salt in order to watch it.  Those that despise the Spice Girls will probably never be convinced of it's humor and wittines, but those with open minds may see that this movie really does have something to offer (especially to the college age indie rock fan, if you have the sense of humor typically associated with this crowd, you may piss yourself laughing.)"

However, my own reading of it is that it shows up the spice girls for what they really are; a group of talentless, uninteresting, stereotypes.  Remember that the film itself is an event, and so should be viewed not on a purely entertainment level, but also on a physical plane. Yes, the spice girls were selling out completely, and made an embarrassing spectacle of themselves by making this film, but then it is also a document of their final months as a band. Soon after the release of the film, splits within the band were noticeable and this lead - as I'm sure we all know - to the departure of geri halliwell, reducing the fiesty five down to a floppy four. The post-ginger spice viewing of this film is remarkable entertainment, and gives meaning to the in-band strain. Halfway through the film, the spice girls question the roles that they have been typecast into as to why they should be them. They try each others role for a photoshoot, but this is all swallowed down as fun and frolics, and just as long as ginger spice returns back to her normal bumptious and gory self, then that's fine. They are trapped in their glossy image, and they can't escape. There is no hope. The ending of the film, I believe, is not a happy one. They tried to resist the mould that had been set for them by their media image, and in the end they submit to it and have to carry on and perform for the fans that have paid premium prices to see the spice girls, and not five individuals."
"Bas-7","10","1","2","12 February 1999"," It converted me! Even anti-Spices can find humour and entertainment!
","I wasn't a Spice fan until after I'd seen the movie. Originally I went for a laugh (and boy, did I laugh!) but I've become a hard out Spice Girl fan! There are so many cameos, puns, inside jokes, and advanced jokes, it really is wasted on children (no matter how much they say they enjoyed it!). Me and my friend were guffawing along for almost the whole way. From the hilariously advanced one-liners to the stupidest dialogues - it will keep you in hysterics. The acting may be worse than on other movies, but the costuming, humour, action and music of these 5 (now 4) girls will catch your attention (and your heart). I now own both their cds, a few singles, dozens of posters and books, and of course the video! Spice up ya life and see it! See ya at Albert Hall!"

","People instantly dismiss this movie because the Spice Girls are the stars, but give it a chance.

"Corp Hix","Null","1","2","6 January 1999"," Good Fun Movie
","I'm British (and proud of it), and I think that Spice World the Movie is just good fun and shouldn't be taken seriously.  If you take it seriously, then you will think it's a piece of rubbish.  You should take it for what it is Â– A GOOD FUN MOVIE.<br/><br/>So they can't act too well, so what?  They can sing well and they are attractive woman (Particularly Victoria and Emma), which all makes for good viewing. Richard E. Grant is also very good, along with Richard O'Brien and Meatloaf.<br/><br/>
I think the American version has a few extra scenes. Which will be fun too see.<br/><br/>One of you guys said that it was hard to follow because of their `thick accents'.  Why is it that Americans have such trouble understanding us Brits?  It should be the other way round!!"
"VerhoHo","10","1","2","27 November 1998"," What were you expecting?
","Give this film some credit. Gimmick flicks like this are usually unwatchable trash. Sure the jokes were lame and not one of the Spices can act, but was it really any worse than any of Richard Lester's Beatles films? The homages were funny and I'm sure they were much appreciated by film-literate parents who were forced to sit through it. I am definItely not a fan, but watching the film on DVD was quite an experience. The musical sequences were so well done that I almost enjoyed the music. It's beautifully photographed candy for the eyes."
"pumpkin34","6","1","2","18 February 2002"," Possible cult status looming ?
","Now that the dust has settled and that the Spice Girls have stopped annoying everyone - replaced by weaker, duller, more stupid pap bands -, it's time to watch ""Spice World"" unprejudiced. And realize it's not as bad as you might fear (or everyone said when it was released). In fact, the Spice Girls vehicle is even enjoyable as shallow, but not so dumb entertainment, with a good camp quotient. The self deprecating humor is a good surprise, and the girls seemed to know where they were going - that is, nowhere fast as a ""band"" or musical talents. And the cameos are sometimes really hysterical - I dare you not to laugh at Sir Bob Geldof after his makeover. OK, ""A Hard Day's Night"" it may quite not be, but I wish every teen exploitation movie were as smart as this one. And I bet it will gain cult status over the years. Fear not and be among the first to jump on that particular nostalgia bandwagon !"

","People hate this film because it is fluffy and because it features a bubble-gum band. I am not really a fan (my kids are) but I think that musically The Spice Girls are as okay as any other bubble-gum band. However, what could have been really a stupid boring movie, actually WASN'T. It was really quite tight (proving that fluff can be tight). It was cute, funny, fast-moving and had several worthy gags. <br/><br/>Rather reminded me of ""Stop Making Sense"" (which of course featured a MUCH greater band)."

","OK, OK, OK - camp is a rather overused word these days - mainly by those wishing to damn with faint praise something they saw and liked in spite of themselves.  I too had reservations about this movie - pop stars and acting do not usually combine - however, that is not the point of SpiceWorld.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is a send up of the manufactured band and the industry that surrounds it.  We have all the key elements - five girls who have assigned 'characters' which are not how they see themselves, a megalomaniac manager who will stop at nothing to get the girls to perform, the tabloid editor who reviles the media monster he has created.<br/><br/>There is no plot to speak of - the girls are heading to the Royal Albert Hall for their first gig - and , erm, that's it.  Along the way they have some adventures, with both the actors and the girls sending themselves up outrageously.<br/><br/>Particularly funny is Richard E Grant as the manager and Roger Moore's one liners - 'when the speeding melon hits the wall etc' are priceless.<br/><br/>Ultimately, SpiceWorld is a fun piece of non threatening fluff that will make you smile.  It never set out to change the world and never will."

I would rather have my testicles surgically removed with a rusty steak knife than to ever watch it again.

","'Spice World' spends 92 minutes going no place fast. Its like a bubblegum wrapper it's colorful and utterly useless. The Spice Girls don't sing very well and in this movie they don't sing very much. But if there singing is bland, their acting . . . well they don't really act they just kind of spout bad puns and giggles a lot. I saw them on a talk show just before I saw this movie and I swear it took me almost the entire hour to figure out which one was which.<br/><br/>Apparently an homage to 'A Hard Day's Night', 'Spice World' shows us a day in the life of The Spice Girls, a flash-in-the-pan British singing group that have no discernible talent. Their merchandise line includes albums, dolls, T-shirts, coloring books, mousepads, posters, stickers, mugs, bookbags, lunchboxes and on top of the pile 'Spice World'. It is as useless as those items and can be passed over just as quickly.<br/><br/>They are cheerful, positive, wear each other's clothes, sleep in the same bus, urinate together and have the moniker 'Girl Power' without ever stopping (at least in this movie) to tell us what that means exactly. They don't have time because the movie is more interested in dumb skits, idiotic sight gags, wasted supporting players (Richard E. Grant, Bob Hoskins, Roger Moore) and their pregnant friend who goes into labor for reason I have yet to figure out.<br/><br/>'A Hard Day's Night' worked because the Beatles were so much fun to watch together. George, Paul, John and Ringo had individual personalities and when we weren't watching them having fun together we got to hear some of the greatest rock and roll songs ever written. The Spice Girls are so lacking in personality that I swear after 30 minutes, the screenplay desperately tries to find something for them to do.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about The Spice Girls before this movie, and when it was over I still had not idea why they were so popular. I just recently learned that Geri Halliwell dropped out of the group and became the U.N. Goodwill Ambassador. She apparently decided that there was only so much that one could do with platform boots and a plunging neckline. Now that's girl power."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","3","29 May 2013"," So What Do You Want? How About An Actual Story
","Spice World (1997) <br/><br/>1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>This here is pretty much a variation on A HARD DAY'S NIGHT but this time instead of John, Paul, George and Ringo we get Baby, Sporty, Ginger, Posh and Scary. Most movies made feature a credit that will read something to the effect of ""story by..."" but not this one. No, that credit is actually replaced by one that reads ""idea by..."" and that pretty much tells you everything you need to know. Really? The biggest pop female pop band that the world has ever seen and one that apparently made between $600-$800 million can only come up with a movie based on an idea? I guess it really doesn't matter that SPICE WORLD has been called one of the worst movies ever made because their fans ate it up when it was released and apparently they are still very fond of it. I guess if I was a die-hard fan of the group then I'd enjoy seeing them in anything no matter how bad it actually was. What makes this film so bad is that there really doesn't seem to be any idea of what this movie is supposed to be about. I'm sure it was an attempt to milk the success of the band and that's understandable. I just wish we had actually gotten a backstage look at the lives they were going through or at least gave us some sort of realistic look at the band. Instead we basically just get one long music video where the girls play their music and get to try on many different outfits. Nothing the five girls say are funny. Nothing they say is very interesting. In fact, nothing they do is all that entertaining. The movie actually reaches a level where it becomes painful to sit through it any longer. Heck, the girls can even lip-sync their songs and that well. SPICE WORLD doesn't quite earn a BOMB ranking thanks in large part to the girls being cute and wearing tight clothes but you can look at a magazine for this. The film itself is quite bad and sadly it never reaches a level to where you can just laugh at it."

","A trippy psychedelic color-collage during the opening credits is one of the few highlights in this slow-as-molasses story about a group of pretty young girls making the singing circuit.<br/><br/>It's quite obvious early on that the real star of the five-some is Emma Bunton (she's the cute blonde), though brunette Victoria Adams is a close second just because she's so hot.<br/><br/>So off the Spice Girls go across England on that dumb bus and flights from Milan to London on an Alaskan Airlines jet. If that doesn't sound confusing enough, try Roger Moore's corpse-like presence holding a piglet which is more interesting than he is or the girls making their concert fans wait so they can deliver an Asian chick's baby. Choppy direction doesn't help; this movie would be better with less talk and more colorful pillow fights.<br/><br/>Typically convoluted approach to contemporary pop-culture subject matter."

One thing about the Spice Girls was, they had a lot of control of what they did. They knew, that trying to make a serious movie would be a huge mistake. This movie is so enjoyable for anyone. Yes it is stupid, but in a really enjoyable way. The were a great group who knew what they were doing. Still enjoyable today. There are so many great appearances from great actors. They have Meat Loaf, Allan Cumming, Elton John, Elvis Costello, and the funny Roger Moore. With music and dance, and outrageous clothing, this movie is definitely a movie that will make the girls remembered for their enthusiasm, and their ability to make fun of themselves."

This movie made me laugh, I thought i would hate it but I found it really quite hilarious- It was ridiculous but in a funny and deliberate way. It wasn't like it was trying to get the thought provoking film award and failed, a cinematic masterpiece was not the agenda here- but a little bit of fun which I believe it definitely succeeded in doing. <br/><br/>The crew making the documentary on the spice girls, the two guys who are ""brain storming"" film ideas for the spice girls to star in, the spice girls manager and then his boss are all just hilarious. In fact the whole thing is hilarious- This movie is not made to be taken seriously! The whole thing is a deliberate joke! Do people not see this?<br/><br/>I don't know what people expected from this movie for it to fail so much in their expectations to warrant such a low rating. I am all for movies like ""Copper Mountain"" scoring hopefully VERY low ratings (I recommend you go see it just so you can boast you have seen the worst movie of all time) as it was a movie whose ABSOLUTE ridiculousness was not deliberate or entertaining- but the horror which is ""Copper Mountain"" has scored level with ""Spice World"", absolutely unfair.<br/><br/>""Spice World"" succeeded brilliantly in what it set out to do- be hilariously ridiculous."

I won't say that is a pretty lousy timekiller. It just isn't worth the appeal, even with five singing Barbie dolls who can dress. The movie is a lot of kidding around, but it actually has its heart in the right place in satirizing movie references and showing off its ""Girl Power"". There! You've got the formula, but you've got it all worn thin after (yup!) one single viewing, not 700!<br/><br/>But wait! A star-studded cast isn't complete without the delightful likes of Posh, Baby, Sporty, Scary, and Ginger (one of which is gone in reality), and they're getting an extra fifteen minutes of fame selling movie tickets. We'll see in the near future if they can start taking advantage of their acting more seriously. Paul, Ringo, John, and George can do MUCH better! Not only does this rip off The Beatles, but it wasn't even intended to! As you easily know, this movie was put out within a year following the Spice Girls' rapid rise to fame and fortune, and so you have here a rush job in the making. It all goes to show why promoting big name franchises pays off in these high-tech days, without a whole lot of ""movie"" to back it up (Are you paying attention, Sony?).<br/><br/>Sooner or later, you're gonna find SPICE WORLD sitting right next to those New Kids On The Block tapes in the thrift stores, and even the GARBAGE PAIL KIDS MOVIE on the dusty shelves of hidden stockrooms. I must call upon any current Spice Girls fan who loved this movie to hang on to what you got. Just like The Beatles proved, the next thirty years will compare to a glass of wine.

I tried, but unlike any other film, I could not find it funny that I wasted my time watching it.<br/><br/>It has NO plot. The acting was not just bad, it was so bad it made their singing ability look good... and they were playing themselves! Really, how hard can that be?

"jboothmillard","3","1","4","7 July 2005"," Spice World
","I have been a huge fan of the Spice Girls since I was nine years old, I have listened to their songs thousands of times, and I was lucky enough to see them live at Wembley Stadium when they reunited (without Victoria) in 2019, so obviously I saw this movie at the cinema when I was a kid. Basically the Spice Girls: Melanie ""Mel B"" Brown aka Scary Spice, Emma Bunton aka Baby Spice, Melanie ""Mel C"" Chisholm aka Sporty Spice, Geri Halliwell (now Horner) aka Ginger Spice, and Victoria Beckham (then Adams) aka Posh Spice (all deservedly winners of the Razzie for Worst Actress, they were also nominated Worst New Star) are the biggest girl band in the UK and across the world. They have performed their latest single, ""Too Much"" (wrongly nominated the Razzie for Worst Original Song), but they have become tired of the burdens of fame and fortune. The girls' uptight tour manager, Clifford (Richard E. Grant), is becoming frequently annoyed by their lack of commitment to their scheduled appointments, and he is often pressured with calls from the head of the girls' record label, the cryptic and eccentric ""Chief"" (Razzie nominated Sir Roger Moore). Meanwhile, sinister newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphries) wants to ruin the Spice Girls' reputation to sell more copies, so he dispatches photographer Damien (Richard O'Brien) to capture and record the girls' every move. Also stalking the girls is less threatening but more annoying documentary maker Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming), hoping to use them as subjects for his next project. Clifford, and his sympathetic assistant Deborah (Claire Rushbrook), are also trying to fend off over-eager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield (George Wendt) and Graydon (Mark McKinney), who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for a feature film for the Spice Girls. The Spice Girls are preparing for a performance at the Royal Albert Hall, and meanwhile stick to a schedule of practising songs and routines, travelling in the Union Jack painted Spice Bus, and making public appearances. This means less time to themselves, including spending time with their pregnant best friend, Nicola (Naoko Mori), who is due to give birth soon. The stress and overwork culminate in a huge argument between Clifford and the girls, they storm out on the evening before their gig at the Albert Hall. The girls think back on their humble beginnings and their struggle to the top, they reunite outside the now-abandoned cafÃ© where they practiced during their childhood years, they reconcile, and decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, Nicola goes into labour at the nightclub and is rushed to the hospital, giving birth to a healthy baby girl. The Spice Girls have a run in with Damien, disguised as a delivery doctor, but after hitting his head, he realises the error of his ways, and goes after McMaxford, who is fired in a ""Jacuzzi scandal"". The girls' bus driver Dennis (Meat Loaf) goes missing, so Victoria drives the bus, and it is race against time to reach the Royal Albert Hall in time. There are many obstacles on the way, including a jump across Tower Bridge over the open gap, and Emma discovering a bomb underneath the bus. The Spice Girls make it for their performance, with thousands of fans in the audience, and watching live on television, as they open with ""Spice Up Your Life"". As the credits roll, the Spice Girls are talking to members of the film crew, until Mel C breaks the fourth wall, the girls talk to us (the audience), and discuss their film, just minutes before the bomb explodes on the bus. Also starring Jason Flemyng as Brad, Steven O'Donnell as Jess, Michael Barrymore as Mr. Step, Richard Briers as Bishop, Jennifer Saunders as Fashionable Woman, Hugh Laurie as Poirot, Stephen Fry as Judge, Peter Sissons, Sir Elton John, Jonathan Ross, Jools Holland as Musical Director, Neil Mullarkey as Barnaby, Dominic West as Photographer, Bill Paterson as Brian, Elvis Costello as Bartender, Bob Geldof, Bob Hoskins and Kevin McNally as Policeman. Despite their lack of acting skills, Mel B, Geri, Emma, Mel C, and Victoria are likeable, and do their best to spoof their nickname personalities, obviously they make up for it with their catchy songs, it is also fun to spot recognisable cameo guest stars. Featuring the songs ""Wannabe"", ""Stop"", ""Spice Up Your Life"", ""Too Much"", ""Saturday Night Divas"", ""Never Give Up On The Good Times"", ""Do It"", ""Say You'll Be There"", ""2 Become 1"", ""Mama"", ""Who Do You Think You Are"" and ""Viva Forever"". This film was made for two reasons, to cash in on the worldwide success of the Spice Girls brand, and an attempt to capture the same vibe that The Beatles, and Sir Cliff Richard brought in their films, it did do well at the box office, but critics and fans were less than impressed, you can maybe laugh at how silly it is, apart from the songs, a disappointing musical comedy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple for any combination of two characters, body parts or fashion accessories, Worst Screenplay, and Worst 'Musical' of Our First 25 Years. The Spice Girls were number 32 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Adequate!"

","Undoubtedly one of the worst British films ever made, SPICE WORLD is nothing more than a lame, tacked-together vanity project for a girl group thankfully long forgotten. The film is nothing more than a series of filmed songs with a few supposedly comedic sketches linking the material. The Spice Girls share 'witty' banter and drive around London in their tour bus while various nefarious managers and media employees work against each other in a plot which has nothing to do with the main characters. The script is dumber than dumb and the Girls are no actresses, with their one-liner delivery quite embarrassing. Poor old Richard E. Grant chews up the scenery while Alan Cumming delivers the fakest accent ever. The rest seems to be an excuse for endless celebrity cameos, which at least takes your mind off the tedium a little."

It reminds me of ""Kevin and Perry go large"", another movie you are in love with as a teenager but when you reach your mid 20s watching it makes you cringe.<br/><br/>I don't feel this movie has any importance in this day and age. If you're at the age where you like this kind of movie then you are too young to remember the Spice Girls and if you're at the age you can remember them then you just hate this movie even if you used to like it..<br/><br/>It was only produced to generate a sugar rush of cash for the Spice World phenomenon of the late 1990s."

In this film, they rally to keep the band together, play gigs, keep an intrusive film-crew away and their manager — played by Richard E. Grant — calm. By the way, you have to laugh at people like Bob Hoskins, Elvis Costello, Jools Holland and Stephen Fry turning up to have a go. The film is a collection of ideas, all tossed together to make money off the Spice-phenomenon, all the while turning out great pop music to the girl power-beat.

","Either way the Spice Girls have proven that they can not only sing, write their own songs, and have an intellectual conversation, but they also prove that they can't act.  Not a big surprise from a bunch of air-heads endorsing their own line of shoes, bubble gum, and who knows what else.  See this movie only if you are a fan of the girls.  Everyone else should be warned."

","I am not going to get into any detail about the many reasons this movie sucks, but I will say it is so bad, I couldn't even watch all of it."

","The Spice Girls are fabulous, and this movie is only great if you have a large interest in the Girls. My friends tell me I am obsessed with them, which is probably why I love this movie."

","I am not going to be immature and say ""it sucks;"" but that's what I think. This movie has no plot whatsoever.  Just 5 girls going around and singing (and their music is not THAT great, people.  Where is the talent?  Even monkeys can put on fancy clothes and huge shoes and shake their rears around)  And then completely unrelated unlinked events occur....the aliens? Come on!  And the big climax is that they are going to be late for one of their concerts!  Oh no!  The only part that had any sort of humor was when they were with the army people and the fifth one comes out in heels and a tight dress, which was kind of ridiculous, and I did laugh.<br/><br/>
I am not surprised that someone wanted to put a bomb under their bus :)"

","Not a bad piece of crap to watch on a drizzly Sunday afternoon while ironing the clothes. The gags fly in at every chance they get with the help of a few surprise appearances from notable stars and musicians. What the Monkeys did in HEAD for the 60's is what this movie will do for the 90's. Not much!"

","I tried and I tried, but this movie is yet another example of why ""singers"" should never try to make movies. No offense to the Spice Girls, but they act even worse than they sing. This movie does have some decent comedic value, but you can't hear most of the lines because of the loud Spice Girls music playing in the background, and the ones you could hear were almost indecipherable because of the strong accents (some of which just HAD to be faked). If you are a Spice Girls fan, you will probably enjoy this movie. If not, you probably will have trouble sitting through it. The sole thing the movie seems designed to do is prove one of two things: a) Posh Spice has no place in the group; b) when Ginger Spice left, so did most of the talent."

","The Spice Girls are great but they need to stick to singing not acting.There was no plot but it had big shoes!"
