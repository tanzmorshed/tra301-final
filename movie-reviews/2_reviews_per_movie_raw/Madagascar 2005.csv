","A great story of friendship and survival where an animal escapes from the zoo and his friends go to pick it up but everything goes wrong. The plot and their misadventures are quite original and the whole thing is rendered very well and generates great fun"
"BraveHawk","Null","108","148","7 June 2005"," I've Seen Better And Worse. Overall, It Is A Decent Kids Movie That Can Hold Adults Attention As Well.
","Let's face it, it's hard to put out a good animation movie that is equal to Shrek, The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. Those are hard movies to follow but Madagascar is by no means a bad movie. In fact, I will still rate this pretty high, as I enjoyed it without watching the clock.<br/><br/>The plot was very easy for children to follow while not so simplistic that adults become bored in the middle. The simple plot was that 4 animals raised in a zoo venture out into the wild and quickly realize how easy they had it back home in the New York Zoo.<br/><br/>There was quite a few humorous scenes in Madagascar, but my favorite has to be the ""distinguished"" chimps who get offended that the thought of looking or smelling like a monkey is bad. An honorable mention is the penguins who also got more than they bargained for in Antarctica.<br/><br/>While some of the graphics are sub-par to other movies I've mentioned, like Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) for instance. At times they look sort of like clay-mation or something, and other they look positively life-like. The scenery and the lemurs stand out as the most beautifully rendered parts of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is great for getting the kids out of the house and not too bad if the normal adult wants to get away and enjoy something more suitable for the family as well."

","Lots of fun - I saw it with the grandkids and a theater full of families. a great time was had by all. technically speaking, one might say that the story was 'uneven' in places (can you say *that* about animated films? (-:) -- I mention this because there has been some needlessly negative feedback here at IMDb. On the whole, though, the presentation is quick-paced, bright, happy, and delightful to the eyes and ears. There are also some unique, quirky scenes (i.e. animals nonchalantly getting on a subway?) - I love to see stuff I haven't seen before. that's not easy to do, you know - by all accounts, ""everything has been done on film already.."" - (if you catch my drift). so, give credit when due! enjoy!(-:"
"bullseye_au","9","53","75","14 June 2005"," A nice surprise
","The mood you're in when you see a movie has a big impact on how much you enjoy it. I saw this in a cinema packed with young families and it went down well. I laughed a lot, so did my kids, and so did the cinema. I explained to my daughter that pansy meant softy, so I even felt useful.<br/><br/>Having young children means I have sat through quite a lot of this genre, and the use of computers in animation makes things a little over-refined. I seem to be the only person who finds Pixar movies too polished, faultless, and stale. This film can be abrupt and patchy, but in my opinion that makes it more spontaneous.<br/><br/>The movie looks great, the penguins are funny, the king is funny, and the pace and energy are good. About 90 minutes is also the correct length. The plot may be thin but the survival concepts that pepper the movie are good intellectual fodder for children."
"originalcrystaltm","8","132","208","30 May 2005"," It's no ""Shrek"" or ""Finding Nemo"" but it's worth the $8.25
","I could not disagree with those who are calling this movie boring more. Is it a perfect movie? No. But it is fun, fast-paced, and highly entertaining. A theater full of children laughed almost non-stop, and even my husband (who honestly wanted to see the latest ""Star Wars"" movie) grudgingly admitted it was pretty good.<br/><br/>The plot is basic: four animals must try to survive in the wild, and along the way learn more about themselves. But the visuals are hilarious, the music is fun, and the interludes with the psychotic penguins? Priceless.<br/><br/>The only part of this movie I disliked was the casting of David Schwimmer. Although he did a fine job, the entire time I felt distracted by his voice- I was reminded too much of his Ross character from ""Friends."" So, don't go expecting an Oscar-worthy film, or even the next ""Shrek."" Instead, go to enjoy a piece of indulgent yet funny animation that will keep you laughing."
"ArizWldcat","7","70","106","2 June 2005"," Fun movie for the family
","There are so few movies that you can enjoy as a family, so perhaps I've given this more stars than it deserves. I did laugh out loud several times. The jokes are mostly ""pop culture"" references; for example, (the zebra (Chris Rock) has a treadmill in his area (not a cage, really) at the zoo.<br/><br/>This is sort of a twist on the fish out of water movies, as the zoo animals, according to the local animal rights activists, don't belong in the zoo; they are shipped off to Africa. Hilarity ensues; the animals don't end up at the planned destination and find out that they don't necessarily belong in the wild either. What I found unique about this movie is that for once, the actual nature of the animal is acknowledged. Ben Stiller's lion character realizes that everyone looks like a steak and wants to eat everyone. Of course, he realizes that he's ""wrong"" (HUH??) and tries to change. The kids loved it, I wasn't totally bored out of my mind, and the animation was pretty good, I thought. The penguins were especially cute. Wish they'd had more screen time."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","43","65","25 January 2007"," Lived Up To Good Reputation - Funny, Colorful
","Here's another recently-made animated film that has two outstanding characteristics which make it a winner: 1 - consistently funny humor that adults can enjoy, and 2 - beautiful, bold colors.<br/><br/>When a movie is both fun to hear and to watch, I have very few complaints. This movie provides a lot of enjoyment with more jokes perhaps that adults would laugh at than the kids. I can't say that for sure, since I watched it by myself....but I sure got my share of laughs <br/><br/>This is a tale of four zoo animals that wind up in the wilds. To be more precise, they go from the big zoo in New York City to the wilds of Madagascar, an island near Africa. Wherever these ""guys"" are - the lion, zebra, hippo and giraffe - they are entertaining. <br/><br/>Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, voicing the lion (""Alex"") and zebra (""Marty""), respectively, are the two main characters. Jada Pinkett Smith's hippo (""Gloria"") and and David Schwimmer's hypochondriac giraffe (""Melman"") provide solid support. The main thing is that all the characters, including supporting ones, are likable and funny in their own way. Every character is quite different. The story movies exceptionally fast so the hour-and-a-half is easy to watch.<br/><br/>Maybe the best thing I can say is that I heard a lot of good things about this before watching it, and it lived up to its hype. That's not easy to do."
"larimeramy","8","58","94","13 June 2005"," Very funny
","I took my 8 yr old daughter and a friend of hers to see the movie last weekend. We had a blast. The humor is one of Dreamworks best. It was sutle enough on some of the jokes that the younger kids did not catch on but you could hear the adults chuckling.<br/><br/>My personal favorite was Melmen. He was very funny and I think that everyone can relate to knowing someone like that. (Sick all the time)<br/><br/>I would not recommend kids under the age of 6 to see it though. Their where quite a few little ones in the theater and all you heard was ""what are they doing now? Why are people laughing?"" etc.<br/><br/>A lot of fun and a lot of laughs. We will definitely own this when it comes out on DVD."
"T1Thousand","6","98","168","1 June 2005"," So Much Could Have Happened on This Island...
","Okay. Here we go. Before watching this film, if you read what it is going to be about, you will find something that could be promising. Four animals that are close friends in a zoo end up being stranded in the wild where one of them--the lion--finds out that it is his nature to hunt down the other three. Now that makes a good story! But the thing is that the story barely even touched on that. It seemed to go nowhere and throughout the time that I watched this, I felt as if it were still beginning and we were being introduced to the characters, including the ones that later come into play. I didn't feel as if the peak of the plot was ever reached because I started thinking: What is the plot? Where is this movie trying to go? Nothing really happens. This film is like a large introduction that never really goes anywhere. It barely touches the middle of the story when it suddenly ends. A big hole was certainly there when the credits came up. A lot could have been done with this story. We also never really connect with any of the characters. They are just there. The voices are done well and they really match with the characters, but that's mostly it. There is not a lot of character development. But the good news is that many kids will enjoy this. There is plenty of light humor, especially with the penguins who steal the show most of the time. There are cute parts and the visuals are all right. This is no Shrek and it is a little below Shark Tale in my opinion. Dreamworks could have had a much better film. So much more could have happened on this island, but alas we were only introduced to it and nothing else. No, this movie is not horribly bad, but it is not very good either. I give it an average at best. It is watchable but that is it for me. The story was handled too weakly. This movie really had potential. But hey, at least the kids most likely will enjoy it =)<br/><br/>5.8/10 Stars"
"Frogfisher","8","41","67","1 October 2005"," Wonderful...!
","A wonderful movie for all ages.<br/><br/>This films really follows in the footsteps of recent animated blockbusters as Finding Nemo,Shrek, Monster Inc., The Incredibles, Ice Age etc. The story works very well, and it is obvious that the team behind is people who knows their media. It stays on the same course all the way through, something that really is the essence of the success of the animated films these last years, something other writers can really learn from. And that's all the comparison I will do, because it really is its own movie.<br/><br/>A wonderful thing about it is the references to other movies like The Planet of the Apes and American Beauty. Very obvious references I might add. This also means that the filmmakers are aware that a growing number of gross comes from adult audiences as well, and you then have to assume that the story is written for them as well. <br/><br/>The style of the movie is like we are use to in normal cartoons, just put into a new media. And it works very well, you're always aware of it, and yet you sit and really is in awe of the texture of for instance Marty(Chris Rock). The technique is definitely as is to be expected. <br/><br/>Hanz Zimmer, who's becoming a very well known man within the animated world, does a moderate good job, the music is there and really gives the effects it needs, but is just background. Directing is good, and all the characters works in their own way on the screen but are best together. There's a huge deal of very well timed jokes and they all somehow seems to work.<br/><br/>The characters are very amu... sorry, highly amusing. Chris Rock is almost best as voice(like in Dr. Doolittle), where Ben Stiller although he comes through still is more enjoyable as live action. But both of them are easily identified. Jada Pinkett is a bit to anonymous, and David Schwimmer is just great, although his character wins in being a good background joke. Now for the minor characters, as often with these films, the minor characters gets a way with so much attention they deserve a little more attention. The three penguins are awesome, and is the ideal kick starters for this movie. They deliver almost nothing but laughs. The king of the wild Julien(Mr. Ali G) is fun, although without his sidekick Maurice(Cedric) he would be nothing. And then there's the two monkeys also very enjoyable. One minor thing is to me that in seems that the Sabletooth tigers from Ice Age seems to have been copy-pasted into this movie for action, a bit sad but nothing that the movie itself doesn't salvage. <br/><br/>I would rank it among the top ten movies of this year, it is very fun and works very well in most ways. 8/10"

","I have to admit, I was sick of the over advertising, but I decided to give Madagascar a chance. Lately, I've actually been getting more into the computer animation flicks and wanted to see what Madagascar was all about. I don't get why there are a lot of users here on IMDb that absolutely hate this film or didn't really get into it, because I thought it was a very cute and enjoyable film for the kids and adults.<br/><br/>Marty, Meldman, Alex, and Gloria are all zoo kept animals who are pampered all day and entertain humans on a constant schedule. Marty wants more though, he wonders where he comes from and what it would be like to be in the wild. Alex, the lion, is truly against this and will have no part of it, but tries to find Marty after he escapes. The rest of the gang follows, but they are caught by the animal catchers and are sent back, but accidentally fall of the boat shipping them home and they end up on an island called Madagascar. They are ""welcomed"", if that's the right word, by other animals and must learn how to survive, but it's going to be hard when Alex is starving for meat! <br/><br/>I loved the American Beauty and Chariot of Fire references, I thought they were just so funny! There are more than a few good laughs in this film and I felt like it was being unfairly rated here on IMDb, yes, it's not as great as The Incredables, but I really feel like anyone could love this film. I'm actually going to be on my way to buy it, I loved it that much, so please give this movie a fair chance. Believe me, it's worth your time.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Moderately funny movie. Decent lines, some funny moments. I have to admit I liked Ali G as the king lemur singing ""Move It"" as did my 7 and 4 year olds. Some funny visuals as well (won't spoil those here) but this movie is nowhere in the league of Shrek or the better Disney stuff, and certainly not as funny as the highlight reel that was the trailer being shown for the last couple of weeks on television. If you haven't gone yet, you might want to wait until it hits your local second-run discount theater, or just rent it because as another poster mentioned, it is in no way worth spending $50+ for a family of four. And the poster who gave it a 10-star review, along with his blathering drivel of a review (""reel"" indeed, ugh) is an obvious studio plant, pay it no mind."

","This is a children's' movie. I think people keep forgetting that when they review it. Kids would LOVE this movie. I am an adult and I went with my adult sister and we were just howling with laughter the whole time. There were a few science fiction movie jokes in there that almost killed me dead laughing. I think kids would love the animals. They were cute but not cutesey. Ben Stiller's voice was perfect for the silly lion character. Chris Rock didn't say anything too shocking. The animated scenery was beautiful. The characters were all good. It was jam packed full of humor and grooviness. A lot of the imagery reminded me of groovy retro stuff.

"bob the moo","Null","5","6","11 December 2005"," Very funny at points but it lacks heart and the main characters pale beside the support
","Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria all live in the New York zoo, where they are good draws and get regular meals. However Marty dreams of the wild and freedom and, when a crack group of penquins seem to offer him a way out, he takes it. His friends find he is missing and set out to convince him to return, catching him at Grand Central Station, only to get caught by the police. With the people convinced that the animals cannot return to the zoo, the four are shipped out to the wild but a shipping accident sees them washed up in a wilderness that their city live has not prepared them for.<br/><br/>Looking a lot more cartoony than similar film, I decided to give Madagascar a miss until I saw the short film from the penguins and decided to give it a try. The plot is a worthy try to repeat the fun and heart of films such as Toy Story but, although it delivers the former, the latter is lacking. It tries to have some sort of moral by the end but it doesn't really come off and it would have been better not to try at all. However this is a minor problem because mostly it is very funny, producing some big laughs as well as being consistently funny. The biggest laughs come from the side characters such as the penguins, the lemurs and the two monkeys which is great but it means that the main characters are almost begrudgingly returned to the screen at times while the actual plot is where the sags come in.<br/><br/>This is a bit of a problem and again robs the material of its heart but I didn't really care that much because I was laughing consistently across the whole film. The star cast work well. Stiller was actually pretty good while both Rock and Schwimmer were really well-suited to their characters and the humour. Smith was more ""there"" than she was doing anything, but she was alright if unimpressive. However all four of them are put in the shade by the support cast  a fact not helped that the support have the best material to work with. Cohen naturally steals the show with an outrageously funny performance that had me in stitches and he was well supported by an unusually restrained Cedric the Entertainer. The penguins also combined to produce a wonderful subplot to the film and their planning and scheming was hilarious; likewise, although in a smaller role, the posh monkey was very funny.<br/><br/>Overall this is a consistently funny film that survives despite the fact that the narrative and the four main characters are actually not its strengths while those looking for the heart of Toy Story will be disappointed. However it has more than enough laughs to be worthwhile and the supporting cast and characters are really where the film is at."
"ilikepuppies","2","21","36","15 January 2006"," Kids beware.
","I take a vested interest in what we feed our children's minds. They deserve to be challenged to think. They need abstraction. Levels of thought. Something to exercise their brains and help cultivate their own senses of creativity. That said, Dreamworks should be ashamed of marketing this dreck to children.<br/><br/>The whole world knows by now that if one has the 80 million dollars worth of backing, he can produce any half-presentable CGI animated feature, aim it at children and produce a profit of at least 5 times the investment, apparently even if the film is laced with primarily adult content, as displayed in this film. (How many 8-year-olds had a clue what the 'American Beauty' sequence was all about?)<br/><br/>The Dreamworks formula is a simple, 2-faceted approach. First (and foremost), adults first. More energy is spent in attempt to entertain the 30-something demographic than any other. That way, parents are more willing to accompany the kids into the theater, doubling ticket sales. After all, the ultimate choice whether anyone will see the film lies with the parents. That's why these things are packed with campy disco hits and references to old films and TV shows, none of which the kids have a clue about.<br/><br/>Second, inject just enough vacuous slapstick and physical comedy to appease the kids. It only takes a few laughs to make a child expect the DVD upon release.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you have time, slap in any old excuse for a moral, in this case the thin statement about not giving up on friends.<br/><br/>That's all there is to this, folks. Another Shrek, just a lazier version. Downright insulting to a child.<br/><br/>Look no further than this observation: There is a scene in which the film's main characters gaze at the heavens, aghast of the universe's limitless possibilities. Oddly, this very film seems oblivious to that notion.<br/><br/>Dreamworks can't escape from their zoo."
"scotts863","Null","34","63","27 May 2005"," Dull Stuff We've All Seen Too Many Times.
","If there was ever a film that made you nostalgic for old school animated movies, it is Madagascar.<br/><br/>It's not only that this computer-generated comedy would have been more visually appealing had it been hand-drawn. Madagascar makes you long for a time when story was more important than cleverness; before having celebrities voicing the characters was a marketing requisite; before you needed to be thoroughly immersed in pop culture to get the gags.<br/><br/>Madagascar gets as lost in the jungle as its hapless heroes, none of whom are developed as characters. They're simply the public personalities of Rock (quick-witted); Stiller (whiny) and Schwimmer (fussy) in animal skins. Pickett-Smith, meanwhile, is such an afterthought that she seems to be there only to meet a perceived diversity requirement.<br/><br/>This one was a waste of time for ALL ages."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","5","11","17","23 October 2006"," A DreamWorks Lesson about the Food Chain
","Wow, they just keep peppering us mainstreamers with animated comedies, don't they? In any case, this is a lesson you will want to skip or at least drift off into thought or scribble in your notebook during. I think the makers have got the basic idea right: take wild animals  a Zebra, a Lion, a Giraffe and a Hippo  raise them domesticated in the glossy captivity of a New York zoo, then ship them off to Africa and see how well they do out in the wild. The film is an ecological/social experiment of sorts in which you essentially extract the average Joe from his comfortable life and plug him into hell. There is a wealth of potential in a premise like this, but DreamWorks suffers far more hits than misses in 'Madagascar'.<br/><br/>The characters of the 'experiment' are Marty the lively Zebra, Alex the emo Lion, Gloria the street-sassed ghetto Hippo and Melman the neurotic giraffe. So as you can tell, the cast have their assigned quirks instilled from scene 01. Many people have remarked how they loved Chris Rock as Marty but didn't care for Ben Stiller as Alex  I feel the opposite way and it is important that I debunk the myth that Rock does a good voicework here; his screamy pitch makes me ears bleed. Stiller, on the other hand, keeps the reality-based subtlety in his role by using a very vanilla voice. DreamWorks regrettably neglects the paramount aspect of a good film: layered, interesting characters. None of these are remotely interesting.<br/><br/>Although characters aside, Madagascar is not a total loss as it generously offers comedy. In the front row for the humour part is the sedative-induced euphoria that Alex experiences as he is shot with tranquilizers by the Zoo-staff. In the second row is the hard-boiled escapist quartet of penguins that botch their way through zoo-breaks. In the third row is the inexplicably hilarious gecko on King Julian's (of the lemurs) crown. In the fourth row is the clever American Beauty spoof, down to the very incongruous Thomas Newman music. The bad news is that evenly spread throughout the rows is goofball, madcap nonsense (usually not the good kind), pratfalls and fart-jokes for the kids. <br/><br/>Adversely, the good news is that in the time of animated comedies copying so much from each other and recycling riffs from their own libraries, Madagascar remains surprisingly original  generic, yes, but crisply original in characters and story. The animation is less crisp and appears to be abandoning the meticulous nature frames of Shrek and Nemo, moving back to the clunky and crude animated effects that we got a taste of in Blue Sky Studios' babies Robots and Ice Age (yet the crudeness worked wonderfully in the latter). Here it works to a point, but never offers the film a solid base onto which to fall back on when the plot fails, and it often does...<br/><br/>In fact, one of Madagascar's biggest problems is that there is not a clear-cut plot outline. Once the animals have made out of their way from the crates onboard the ship, been thrown off-board and floated ashore onto the wild of Madagascar, the story completely falls apart because no one can figure out quite what to do with these characters. Let them explore, let them get back in touch with their animalistic instincts that have been permanently quenched in the latte-sipping, steak-dining, humane life of the Zoo. Let them face the harshness of the food chain. This is why I propose viewing the film as a social/ecological experiment and not a story.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"
"Benjamin_Cox","6","11","17","7 January 2006"," More fun than a barrel full of monkeys - 68%
","I have to admit that ""Madagascar"", the latest film from the makers of ""Shrek"", didn't really appeal to me. From the trailers I'd seen, I thought it looked too kiddie-friendly to me but as my Better Half wanted to watch it, I found myself renting the DVD along with ""Team America: World Police"". I had already seen the short Christmas film with the penguins and that was very funny and that had made me change my mind a little. But I was pleasantly surprised to find this an unexpectedly witty and genuinely funny family film, although one which doesn't really seem to go anywhere plot-wise.<br/><br/>""Madagascar"" begins in New York's Central Zoo where the star attraction is the lion Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller). His best friend is Marty (Chris Rock), a zebra who dreams of one day going back to the wild - much to the chagrin of Alex. So when the pair are apprehended after a daring escape plan, along with Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and a hypochondriac giraffe named Melman (David Schwimmer), the four are soon shipped off on a transfer. But they are accidentally washed overboard and find themselves in a tropical jungle populated by dancing lemurs. But is this a blessing in disguise or will they realise that there is no place like home? <br/><br/>It has to be said that, technically, this is the best looking film that Dreamworks Animation have produced so far. The ocean effects are particularly realistic but the characters maintain a traditional cartoon feel - eyes bulge and necks stretch in typical Tom & Jerry fashion. And despite Schwimmer struggling to escape Ross, the voices are also perfectly cast with Stiller taking top honours. My initial opinion that it was too kiddie-friendly isn't too wide of the mark, however, with a lot of the comedy being slapstick in nature. But there are laughs to be had, such as the wonderfully funny penguins hijacking the ship and trying to reach Antartica. If anything, the ships aren't the only thing the penguins hijack - they are just brilliant and thoroughly deserved their own short film.<br/><br/>Although ""Madagascar"" is a wonderfully bright colourful family film, I can't honestly say that I'm raving about it. Schwimmer is very disappointing as Melman and I wonder if he will ever escape ""Friends"" during the rest of his career. The plot itself, although it starts promisingly enough, quickly runs out of steam once they arrive in Madagascar and the lemurs get involved. But there is still plenty to enjoy in this film and it is much better than I was expecting. It won't change the world and it certainly isn't as much fun as ""The Incredibles"" but ""Madagascar"" is yet another worthy winner from Dreamworks and another blow to Disney, who will be ruing the day that Pixar went their own way."

","There is a conceptual flaw baked into the fabric of *Madagascar* that ruins all its enjoyable moments and good intentions.<br/><br/>The action is loud, slapstick, colorful and  unless you are eight  generally unfunny. But the lemurs are hilarious and the penguins are priceless.<br/><br/>A lion, a zebra, a hippopotamus and a giraffe are best friends at the Manhattan Zoo. The zebra dreams of frolicking free in Africa, the others revel in their star status at the Zoo (except the hypochondriac giraffe, who, being a hypochondriac, doesn't enjoy much, but is nonetheless more fulfilled being a hypochondriac IN the zoo than OUT of it).<br/><br/>Once again in a 3D cartoon, *real* voice-over talent is slighted in favor of marquee stars (Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith and David Schwimmer as the above animals), who provide the necessary box office clout to divert the audience's attention from this movie's ignorant evolutionary gaffes.<br/><br/>Through events that can only be described in these vapid kiddie vehicles as ""wacky,"" the four friends soon find themselves crated on a barge to Africa. They fall overboard and wash ashore in Madagascar (which they refer to as The Wild  a dig at Disney's upcoming film of the same name? - featuring both a lion and giraffe in lead roles as well). Missing his regular Zoo steaks, the lion reverts to his instinctual carnivorous state, regarding his best pal, the zebra, as lunch.<br/><br/>THIS - my dear puritans and fundamentalists, concerned parents and animal activists - is called Nature.<br/><br/>THIS - is the movie's baked-in flaw, for the zebra was fantasizing ""freedom,"" but upon his friend the lion attaining that freedom, the film missteps in the other direction entirely, treating the lion's carnivorism as a *regress*, a relapse, rather than a reversion (or uplifting) to a natural state; an undesirable condition, like alcoholism or mental incapacitation, rather than his genetic heritage. The lion even refers to himself as a ""monster"" for wanting to eat the zebra.<br/><br/>But he would be a ""monster"" in the true evolutionary sense (i.e. a deviant) if he did NOT want to eat the zebra.<br/><br/>The zebra consoles, ""You're NOT a monster!"" But his consolation is for the wrong reasons! The zebra believes that the lion's friendship towards him will win out over the somehow UN-natural state of regarding him as prey.<br/><br/>So even though the lion is now complying with his niche in nature more so than he ever did when friendly with the ungulate, we are force-fed the attitude that killing live prey and eating meat is tantamount to eating your friends.<br/><br/>Of course, kids watching this herbivorist bigotry readily accept its validity because they do not equate those plastic-wrapped, square-shaped steaks from the grocery store as murdered animals. Disguised behind industry and packaging, our society conveniently forgets what we ourselves consume for sustenance. Meat: dead animal flesh! And the hypocrisy of this cartoon is perpetuated without any irony at all. And without any realization that it's hypocrisy.<br/><br/>This movie's obnoxious message against the life and death relationship we all share with every other creature on earth has become acceptable simply because of its ubiquity, not through any logic or common sense. The lion needs the nutrients supplied by the zebra's flesh to live  if he does not eat what his metabolism has evolved to process for energy, he is going to die. And his species would not have made it this far if they were all this genetically attuned against the Circle of Life.<br/><br/>Yes, I hear the peanut gallery, with hands over their children's ears, yelling, ""Lighten up! This bollacks is merely entertainment!"" Granted there are entertaining vignettes: head penguin, Skipper (voiced by co-director, Tom McGrath, sounding uncannily like Billy West doing *Futurama*'s Zapp Brannigan doing Phil Hartman) is a scream orchestrating his military maneuvers; Sasha Baron Cohen steals the movie voicing king lemur, Julian (sounding uncannily like Robin Williams doing Peter Sellers doing an Indian) and offering a tiny supercute lemur up as constant scapegoat. But the hypocrisy and paradox in this movie are at odds with its own story and plot.<br/><br/>Either the lion knew all along that he was suppressing his urges to dine on the zebra through friendship, or he should never realize it. His succumbing to instinct and then being regarded as a deviant displays the highest form of ignorance in the film-makers (writers Mark Burton, Billy Frolick, Eric Darnell, Tom McGrath; directed by Darnell and McGrath).<br/><br/>A few stupid men annul this four-billion-year-old planet's circle of life, and those who purport to love the Earth (especially in this faddish new *zeitgeist* of politically-motivated faux-concern over global warming) reveal their intrinsic contempt for the planet in blindly accepting the twisted message in this movie.<br/><br/>In a final act of turning carnivores into pansies, the penguins solve the lion's lunch problem by preparing sushi for him. Whereas in *Finding Nemo* (2003) all the fish were as cognizant and sentient as the mammals in *Madagascar*, in Madagascar, apparently - they're just sushi."

I understand that the creators were trying for a specific style, but they failed.

","We had bought the DVD for this disaster of a film for our son on Christmas and we finally got around to watching it. We planned a whole family fun night around this movie thinking it would be the perfect ending to a nice dinner out. Holy cow, were we wrong!!! This has got to be the WORST animated movie to come out in the past 10 years. There was an absolutely horrible script driving the lousy computer generated animation (by the way, computer animated films are becoming very very bad lately) along with the horrible voice over work by these talentless actors. It's funny how whenever there is an animated movie in the works, the studios always seem to find one or two actors who are hot at the time: Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, and one or two actors who are basically begging for work: David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett. Dreamworks needs to stop delving into the animated world for a while and give the movie going public something to look forward to that is actually worth their time."

","I tend to go one of two ways, with the endless crop of animated films we get each year: either loving them or hating them. But even by the standards of the ones I've previously disliked Madagascar was truly awful. So much so, I cannot think of a single redeeming quality it had to offer anyone over the age of three.<br/><br/>The initial scenes in the zoo offered a possibility of a slightly interesting concept but from the second the plot veered towards finding the wild via Connecticut (another instance of where we're all supposed to know the location of a minor U.S state despite living 4,000 miles away) what plot there was, was painful.<br/><br/>This was the first animated film I've seen that did not further the genre one iota. The characters had nothing about them to like, did not develop in the slightest throughout the film. The film got stuck in a real mess for the middle 30 minutes or so and was nothing more than filler. The characters in the wild couldn't hold any interest at all, the central animals seemed to alter their personalities at will with once Alex & Marty - I had to check those names as they was amazingly forgettable - going from loving to hating each other during one snippet of Chariots of Fire on the beach. Giraffes have never worked in any concept least of all a film like this. Most of the intended laughs here were presumably through the smut.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem Madagascar had was trying to work out where the laughs were. I've no idea, I never came close to even a snigger. What few grunts there were in my cinema were from the usual sources: attempts at disco dancing, falling over, things hitting them on the head or crashing into trees. As I said, nothing that hasn't been flogged to death a million times before and it must have taken all of three seconds to come up with the entire list of jokes in this.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but as many critics here have said, this is by some margin the worst film of this genre you will see in a long time, and I cannot think of one thing it offers anyone of any age. The writers need to watch Toy Story or Chicken Run to see how you write a film to appeal to all ages, even children."

It would have been a ""O"" but that wasn't possible. The backgrounds were nice...<br/><br/>What appeared as one of the most delightful previews in history somehow turned into a myriad of horrific set pieces that felt forced and in sore need of some adept direction. For starters, the ""dialogue"" between different characters appeared to be a pastiche of solo routines from each of the characters. Only Jada Pinkett Smith had a smidge of personality as she tried to fix the misunderstandings between the two main characters. Thank God for the psychotic penguins whose characterization relied more on visuals than the atrocious dialogue given to the other members of these mess.<br/><br/>While I waited for this film to end, I couldn't help looking at the rest of the audience (70% of which were children), and noticed they look equally displeased and disappointed. Hollywood, it's time to take more time developing a good screenplay than wasting huge amounts of dollars on the use of celebrities. How about using real talent next time?"

Because after seeing this, coming back to your Madagascar-decorated house is sort of an embarrassment ... Most of the performances seemed under what the visual outrageousness of the characters demanded, and, I'll just say it, Ben Stiller was a big disappointment.

The characters are unoriginal, idiotic and offensive. This piece of crap would probably have no problem in keeping a naive 5 year old entertained for about 2 hours but any one with a shred of intelligence and some experience with such movies would be far from impressed.

","I went to see this with some friends, and they brought their younger brothers and sisters along. We were all impressed by the outcome. We all loved it, and I recommend it to anyone! It has turned into one of my favourites!<br/><br/>The story is interesting. It starts off with 4 thoroughly pampered animals, who live in New York Zoo, who, by the nagging and mistake of the escapist zebra, Marty, end up on a ship bound to Africa! With the help of some meddly penguins, the ship turns to an island instead: Madagascar, where the animals are reunited. The story then shows us how the foursome deal with the sudden change to their lives.<br/><br/>In a way, the plot reminded me of an old book I read as a kid: Lord Of The Flies. The way that their personalities change just drifted back to that like a bullet.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent. Its very colourful, bright and vibrant, and looks very fresh. It all looks real in a way, though also, manages to stay animated and different, which is impressive. It is not ""King Kong"" style animation though. The animation stays child-like. Music and effects are also very good.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller as Alex was brilliant. His voice suited the role as the spoilt, arrogant, leader of a lion so incredibly well. However, I prefer Stiller in live action than in animated, though he does a good job. Chris Rock as Marty was interesting, he does justice to the role. His voice matched with Marty well, and it was very amusing. Jada Pinkett-Smith does an average job, I personally would have preferred someone like Beyonce to do a role like this, but she did a moderately good job of it. My personal favourite is David Schwimmer as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, he had me in stitches, and although the part wasn't as big as Alex or Marty, he does an amazing job of Melman. There is no one else to do this but David Schwimmer alone. He was fabulous.<br/><br/>The penguins add great humour to Madagascar. Sacha Baron Cohen as King Julien was hilarious, you cannot deny laughing at his portrayal of the monkey king. The sweetie, Mort (I don't know what animal he is) has you ""Aww""-ing. And the fossas were good.<br/><br/>There is some crude humour, but that disappears after a while. In short, Madagascar is an amazing film, for all the family. I will definitely be watching it again!"

I went with no expectations to the movie theater (because I've seen Shrek, The Incredibles and Monster's Inc), but the movie did not disappoint me at all and surprisingly, was a lot of fun. <br/><br/>Concluding: I enjoyed this movie a lot, laughed a lot and commented all the gags with my friends once I got out of the theater (laughing again of course) and for me, it was a wonderful ""de-stressing"" moment in the evening and I went to bed with a smile.

The voices and speech inflections really don't flow with the characters. I suppose Chris Rock's voice was okay as Marty the Zebra but nobody else really brought anything to the role.<br/><br/>I'd agree with other posts. The only time I really chuckled was during any scene with the penguins. They should have done a movie about them and had the four lost zoo characters as the sub-plot.<br/><br/>Fortunately for us the motor on the projector went bad right after intermission. Watching the film slow down and then stop, and then melt repeatedly was the best part of the show. (first time I've ever actually seen that happen and it looked just like they portray it in movies) It also means that since we got a free pass to another movie I didn't really have to waste good money on Madagascar. <br/><br/>Sorry if any DreamWorks execs are reading these posts as research, but Madagascar really failed.

","Madagascar is pretty much a failure of a movie. It was boring, unfunny and provided almost no interest except perhaps musically (there was good use of popular music). Some of the gags are 50 years old, and seemed that stale. Maybe if you have never seen an original Bugs Bunny or Woody Woodpecker or Chilly Willy it might be a bit more interesting. I agree with others out there, the penguins are the best part, but still fit with the rest of the picture - uninspired. The animation is nice - and they nail the Central Park Zoo, but it just never clicked for me. And, as an aside review, the part of the movie that my 3.5-year-old thought was best was actually in the credits at the end.<br/><br/>Last comment - listen for the character who in an off moment yells ""Sugar, Honey, Iced - Tea!"" This went over most of the viewer's heads (good thing, since the first letter of each word spells a S-starting four-letter word).

","From the makers of shark tale and Shrek films, we have another laugh riot in MADAGASCAR. Well developed characters, a huge dose of scathing wit and infectious fun. <br/><br/>This tale is about a bunch of animals at the central park zoo in new york who are suddenly hit by 'freedom fever' spread by the crazy penguins. Alex the lion (voice of Ben Stiller) and zebra named Marty<br/><br/>( voice of Chris Rock ) are the best of friends who are also the star attractions at the zoo. Alex loves to impress the crowds with his antics every day and for that, he is rewarded with chunks of steaks, his favorite food. At night, he hangs out with Marty, Gloria the hippo ( Jada Pinkett Smith )and Melman the hypochondriac giraffe ( David Schimmer ). The four friends lead a relatively carefree life as celebrities, having no idea what life is like outside the zoo or in the wild. Things change when Marty turns 10 and encounters a group militant penguins trying to dig their way out to the Antartica. This sets Marty pondering about his lot in life....like, how he would have fared in the wild, and whether he is white with black stripes or black with white stripes. These thoughts egg him so much that he breaks out and heads for Grand Central Station where he plans to go to Connecticut--the only area with wide spaces that he knows of ! His worried pals takes off after him and after being caught and put in a ship, they end up........you guess it : MADAGASCAR !!<br/><br/>It is here that the tone of the movie gets even wilder and wackier. The four 'zoosters' find themselves in the land of the lemurs who love techno dancing and partying---sounds familiar eh?... The lemurs biggest problem is that the coyote like 'fossas' would gate-crash their party and threaten their lives.<br/><br/>Now, there is a new king in this jungle--and Alex is invited to be their protector. However, as the new 'predator', Alex starts seeing his friends as potential food....<br/><br/>All in a good animation movie. It is fresh and inventive and the the graphics well detailed. Directors Eric DArnell and TOm Mcgrath keep the going as lighthearted as possible without being preachy. It is also about friendship triumphing over rudimentary instincts---and any child would understand easily. All of the voice cast intelligently bringing these characters alive. <br/><br/>Check this one out guys !!!"
"sctt03","2","28","63","9 May 2005"," Not much better than Shark Tale
","Since virtually everyone agrees that SharkTale was an embarrassing mess, I'd like to report that Dreamworks has moved forward and created a film BETTER than that. But only by a little. The tired pop-culture references that mire the paper thin ""screenplay"" really do continue to get in the way of any real character development or audience connection. It's another example of Dreamworks not really knowing who their audience is. It's too smarmy for adults, and it's too vulgar for kids. And after all that, there's only half a movie here. It suffers from the same problem as that other dreamworks flop, Road to ElDorado, in that once the characters get to where they are going, there's not a whole lot for them to do. <br/><br/>Some of the designs are OK, but never do the characters feel as if they belong to the same universe as the settings, either in New York or in Madagascar. Design for design's sake makes this a bit of a mess--confusing to watch and often jarring. The animation is smooth, but with not much to say, who cares?<br/><br/>With Pixar continuing to raise the bar on both artistry and content (in particular, the very mature content of both ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Incredibles""), it's a real shame to see that Dreamworks settles for looking backwards and repeating itself with such juvenile fare."
"film-critic","1","9","17","19 June 2005"," Remember, cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly.
","I would have to disagree with most critics about this film. This was not a boring film at all  it was pointless. I literally walked out of this viewing trying to think about what this film was all about. It wasn't that it was confusing in any way (honestly, overly simple), it was just that NOTHING HAPPENED. Normally, in cinema, you have an introduction, something happens, it tries to get resolved, then you have that climactic ending that everyone talks about for weeks. None of this happened in Madagascar. For an hour and twenty minutes I sat, nearly falling asleep, as decently animated creatures used horrid voices and clichéd references to move the plot of the story. Throw in an overused song and some semi-racist moments, and you have the film called Madagascar. Pointless indeed.<br/><br/>In contrast to what everyone else seems to think about the animation of this film, I was impressed. It was a different style than what was used in Dreamworks other works like Shark Tales and Shrek. Instead, the animation on this film seemed more comic, as if I was reading the story that was taking place directly from my morning newspaper. It seemed flat, and to me, it worked. I really liked the way that Alex the lion looked, and the way that the animators drew him. In a world so infused with CGI and computer animation, this seemed and felt like it was a step backwards. It felt more like the animation of what Disney used to create, which appealed to me. Sadly, that was all that appealed to me about the film. Visually I was on board allowing my eyes to enjoy the moments, but with everything else it seemed overdone, clichéd, and pointless.<br/><br/>Sadly, unlike most films, the bad outweighs the good in this film. Outside of the plot being completely pointless, the actors who voiced our characters did not give us anything worth remembering. Ben Stiller is overused, and with his current influx in the film market, I only see his stock going bottom-up in the near future. Chris Rock managed to squeak out his worst performance in years as a one-dimensional character that focus' solely on himself. With no emotion or care, it seemed like every word out of his mouth embodied some racial stereotype that was toned down for a PG or kid-friendly audience. To add to more of the pointless nature of the film was Jada Pinkett Smith, who proved that Will is the breadwinner for the family. Her character was so underdeveloped that I nearly forgot that she was in the film after the opening credit sequence. Everyone was shallow, unsubstantial, and just your seemingly overused technique in the film industry. I was surprised that anyone was able to take these actors for any more then ten minutes, much less an hour and a half.<br/><br/>I am getting tired of the Pro-American; New York City has so much tragedy, moments in movies. While I will agree that what happened on September 11th was horrid in nature, there is no reason to announce that New York is the best city in the world. I live in a wonderful city, that has a zoo, and probably has animals that would have acted just like these in Madagascar, but instead I had to watch as pro-New York actors did whatever they could to promote a city that needs no more screen time. I am just so tired of this in movies and Madagascar seemed to drill it in even more. I think it had to do with the fact that there was no story present to overwhelm these slight discomforting moments. In most films you have an engrossing story that sometimes patches these slow moments where jokes becomes drills and instead of laughing you get headaches. With Madagascar there was no story, so we were forced for an hour and a half to listen to jokes that were not funny. How old is the film Castaway? Did we need to use this joke in this film? Oh, and if that joke didn't work, how about the overuse of words like ""crack-a-lackin"" which sent a shiver down my spine every time that zebra said it. Poor writing lead to a non-existent story, which ultimately lead to me nearly falling asleep in this film.<br/><br/>Finally, the penguins were the life of this film, and we could have used more screen time with them. In fact, if the entire film were to be made on just these little tuxedoed creatures, I would be the first in line to see it. They were cute, actually had funny lines, and highlighted some of the more creative scenes of the film. The same could be said for the monkey's that somehow were forgotten about. There were some really creative moments to this film that were just overshadowed by the horrid rank of the rest of the film. For example, one of my favorite moments (and only moment) was when Alex picked up the phone to call for help, and all the humans heard were growls. That was an interesting concept that could have been built up a bit more, but instead, we were forced to witness growing scenes with ""We like to move it, move it"" being overplayed in the background. That song was just another hole in this already sinking ship.<br/><br/>Overall, I was not impressed and thought this was one of the worst children's films released in years. From the poorly valued voices to the completely missing plot, this film gave kids the impression that if you go against who you are truly meant to be, to want to be out in the wild and be yourself, wellbe prepared to loose friends. This film was a disgrace to children and vegetarians everywhere! <br/><br/>Grade: * out of *****"

","I'd like my money back - I wish I'd waited for the DVD to rent.<br/><br/>Say what you will about the script and story to the movie, which was always going to be formulaic. My two gripes, however are aimed specifically at the voice overs and the music.<br/><br/>Firstly, regarding the actors and actresses chosen to play each of the creatures, it appears that it is more important to choose them based on their celebrity status as opposed to choosing those who have distinctive voices and/or focus on the voice as part of their skills.<br/><br/>Look back at traditional Disney movies or other animated classics and you'll see what I mean. A poor script combined with a mediocre set of voice actors results in a poor film. This is what we have here, folks. Save your money and wait for Shrek III.<br/><br/>Secondly, the soundtrack is also very weak. We have a classic rave dance track- ""I like to Move it"" and a few joke tunes such as the theme from Hawaii 5-0, Chariots of Fire and Born Free, but these are clumsily selected and stereotypical of a thrown together movie. With regards to the forest dance scene to ""I like to Move It"", I fear that the studio was trying to recreate a scene from The Jungle Book. If you're going to add this much music to a movie, at least make some of it original and make sure the rest is in context with the story and theme."

Good animations, good music and excellent voice work makes this a movie recommended for both young and old."

","'Madagascar' is by no means the worst CGI animated flick but it's far from the great movies Pixar has given us over the last 10 years. Storywise, it is simple enough for kids to enjoy but there are too many plot holes so forget about educating them about animals. The pacing is quite bad as it really slows down in the middle. Some of the gags are overdone and as a result, they fall flat. The dialogues are mostly okay.<br/><br/>The CGI is far from terrific but the vivid colours somehow make up for it. The virtual Madagascar is colourful and spectacular to look at. There is plenty of energy (sometimes a bit too much) to keep the audience tuned.<br/><br/>The characters are a tad over the top. Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are alright. Ben Stiller tends to be a little irritating. McGrath, Knights and Miller totally rock as the three penguins. For me, the penguins were the best and funniest parts.<br/><br/>'Madagascar' may not be the best example of entertaining CGI flicks but it makes for a decent one time watch as long as the viewer is willing to suspend their beliefs to a certain extent."

","""Cute and cuddly, boys, cute and cuddly."" Need I say more? Hilarious! The psycho penguins were my favorite. Like when they were about to go on the boat back to civilization. This is what they said. ""Should we tell them the boat is out of gas, boss?"" asked one penguin. ""No... just smile and wave, boys, smile and wave."" I also liked the part when after they landed on Madagascar, they were so surprised to see each other, but Alex is, well, less then pleased to see Marty. So when they finally saw each other, the song from ""Chariots Of Fire"" started playing. They were saying each other's names in slow motion, running towards each other. But Alex's voice changes from happiness to rage. ""MARTY!"" says Alex. ""Oh, Sugar Honey Ice Tea!"" says Marty. I love the song the lemurs sing. Funny without a doubt. Worth $10.00. Penguins now, penguins forever!"

","For me, Pixar will always hold the crown when it comes to superb animation. Nearly every one of their films has been a joy. None of the other production companies come close. Pixar films are effortless the way they combine laughs with a good story, as well as crafting tremendously endearing characters.<br/><br/>But DreamWorks' animated fare is much more erratic in quality. They have produced gems such as Antz and Shrek 2. But for every good film, they create an equally bad one. Shark Tale springs to mind. It was a neverending roller-coaster ride of product placement and film references. And the plot was pushed way into the background.<br/><br/>And now we have Madagascar. Madagascar is by no means a terrible film. But I wouldn't say its a great one either. As I was watching it, words kept coming to mind. Likable. Serviceable. Adequate. That's about it. It was difficult for me to work up much enthusiasm for this film. Because there isn't much of a story to it. It wanders around aimlessly. And it runs out of steam well before the credits roll.<br/><br/>Before we even get to the tropical island of Madagascar, it begins in New York. Central Park Zoo to be precise. The story centres on four animals, Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (voiced by Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the giraffe (voiced by David Schwimmer).<br/><br/>Alex is the star attraction at the zoo. And because of that he gets steaks on demand, and catered to constantly. Three of the animals are quite content where they are. But Marty yearns for life beyond the zoo walls. And when he learns a commando unit of penguins are planning an escape, he joins their jail break.<br/><br/>He gets as far as Grand Central Station before the others catch up to him. And when they're cornered by animal control, it causes an uproar with animal rights activists. The four of them end up being shipped to Kenya, to be released into the wild.<br/><br/>But they never get to Kenya. The penguins were captured also, and while on board, hijack the ship. Alex and Marty get into a fight while in their crates, and accidentally knock the four of them overboard, where they're washed up on the shores of Madagascar.<br/><br/>Now in the wild for the first time, our foursome are completely unprepared for surviving on their own. But they're not alone. The island population is made up of partying lemurs. But its not all fun and games. The lemurs are preyed on by the fossa, and they hope that Alex, being a lion and all can protect them. But Alex has problems of his own.<br/><br/>Now that they're no longer in the zoo, and he's not being fed daily, Alex's natural instincts as a predator have begun to emerge. And he now views his former friends as appetisers. Will Alex turn on them all and become king of the jungle? Or will it all end happily ever after? What do you think?!<br/><br/>When it all comes down to it, Madagascar is a fairly average film at best. Pretty forgettable characters. Standard animation. Hum-drum story. Nothing more. This being a DreamWorks film, there are the customary film references and pop-culture in-jokes. Some of them are OK. Others are monotonous like the song ""I Like To Move It Move It"" because it gets done too many times.<br/><br/>The voice-work was not bad. I was disappointed to see Ben Stiller in this film. I'd like to see his talents put to use in a Pixar film some day. He does occasionally inject pathos into Alex's character. But not enough to make me really care. The most interesting aspect to Alex is his carnivorous nature flaring up.<br/><br/>It does provide some occasionally disturbing moments, with some very surreal and trippy dream sequences where everyone on the island look like walking steaks to him. Pixar could have made that plot line work, but here its all tied up in a neat and tidy way. So neat and tidy its unrealistic.<br/><br/>The animation is well below the par of other animated films. Even DreamWorks own Shrek. It has a cartoonish look that doesn't quite have the realism we've come to expect nowadays. Its really all quite a wet affair. It reminded me of Six Days, Seven Nights. Once they're marooned on the island, the writers haven't got a clue where to take the story next. Cast Away is still the best film in that particular field. Madagascar chooses to parody it at one point, even though its a much better film. Which is pretty bizarre if you ask me.<br/><br/>A surprise box office hit, I believe there's also a sequel in the pipeline. I can't really see the point since the story was so thin here, and because it didn't really go anywhere, I can only imagine how monstrous Madagascar 2 will be. I suppose it could be a pleasant surprise, but something tells me it won't be."
"bgledhil","5","3","4","18 August 2006"," Madagascar's plot is lost in the wilderness
","Madagascar simply lacks in strong story-telling, and drags throughout the movie, as though the writers were trying to squeeze 90 minutes out of a half-hearted premise. It relies on too many clichés and tired sight gags, that in the hands of other film-makers might have been cleverly delivered, but in Madagascar they are merely annoying. Smaller kids may find the visuals appealing, however older viewers beyond the toddler demographic, and certainly adults, will feel trapped by a meandering, tedious plot. Dreamworks' efforts on this and its other animated features are unquestionable inferior to the high quality and charm of Pixar's films. Perhaps they can steal away some of Pixar's talent."
"Dr-RJP","8","3","4","11 February 2006"," Mad about Madagascar
","I am writing this review after having watched ""Madagascar"" for the third time. for the sake of the movie, this is a good thing since I really did not like it when I first viewed it, which was in the theaters. I am a big 'toon fan and like many other ""toonheads"" and movie reviewers, I felt that ""Shrek"" and ""Ice Age"" set the standard for adult cartoons that are as entertaining as they are side-splitting funny. It is no coincidence that these type of cartoons are intentionally designed to get more laughs from adults than kids.<br/><br/>Even though there are countless references to other cartoons, I feel that this deserves to be seen without looking through the prisms of other works. It really does not matter how Madagascar stacks up to Shrek anymore than trying to compare Brokeback Mountain to Cinderella Man. View it as if it were the only adult cartoon ever made.<br/><br/>I initially went into ""Madagascar"" thinking that I would be seeing another ""Shrek,"" since that is how it was promoted and that is primarily the reason why I left the theater feeling cheated. They say that some movies need to be seen more than once to be appreciated, and after watching this two more time on video, I can say, unequivocally, that this one gets better with each sitting.<br/><br/>At first, I did not like the voice characterizations for a few reasons. First of all, I do not like Ben Stiller at all, who does the voice of ""Alex, the Lion"". Secondly, I thought that giving the role of ""Marty, the Zebra,"" to Chris Rock, was being blatantly derivative of ""Donkey"" in Shrek both from a character standpoint, and because, like Eddie Murphy, Rock was another black alumnus from ""Saturday Night Live"". Now, don't get me wrong: I think that Chris Rock is a great comic actor, although nowhere close to a seasoned Eddie Murphy, but he has one of the most grating voices in showbiz since Louie Anderson.<br/><br/>One the other hand, the choice of Jada Pinkett Smith to play Gloria, the ""Hip-Hop"", Hippo, and David Schwimmer to play Melman, the Narcoleptic Giraffe were casting gems.<br/><br/>All of the criticisms that I initially had about Madagascar faded away during the second. Upon final review, Madagascar is one, really funny cartoon that I recommend be seen more than once.<br/><br/>Madagascar is actually two stories in one about two sets of four animal friends that reside in New York's Central Park Zoo. The main story centers around the longings of Marty to be back in the wild and wide-open spaces of Africa rather than couped up in a technologically-controlled synthetic jungle ""environment."" His best friend, Alex, is a ham at heart who loves to be the center of human attention at the daily zoo shows. Gloria is the stabilizing force between these two opposites and frequently acts as mediator between them. Melman seems perfectly happy just to have a life that has some constancy.<br/><br/>As you have read in other reviews, the four wind up getting accidentally shipped (dumped) to Madagascar where they meet the wackiest bunch of lemurs you will ever see.<br/><br/>The second group of animal friends in the movie are four commando-like penguins who are more intent on getting out of the Big Apple, and do so by breaking out of the zoo, commandeering a huge cargo ship, and hijacking it to Antartica! The penguins are a needed comic-relief to a few, overly serious moments in Madagascar.<br/><br/>Like Shrek 2, there are plenty of inside jokes and send-ups of other films (such as Planet of the Apes, American Beauty, and From Here to Eternity). More funny, however, are the more subtle gags which I will not reveal here lest they lose their desired impact.<br/><br/>What makes Madagascar work, in the final analysis, is that it stays true to its storyline, and never forgets the importance of friendship in all relationships."

","Madagascar follows the story of a pair of buddies in the NYC zoo, Alex, a lion (Ben Stiller) and Marty, a zebra (Chris Rock). Marty dreams of something more, while Alex is happy being the big attraction. When events take a turn for the worse, the two of them  along with a hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer) and a saucy hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith)  find themselves accidentally shipped to  you guessed it  Madagascar.<br/><br/>Though the movie largely concerns itself with the Alex/Marty buddy plot, the real humor is not in the main characters at all but in the goofy menagerie that inhabits the rest of the film. Chief among them are four semi-psychotic penguins who operate like a Navy Seals team; they're hysterical, goofy looking commandoes who can go ""cute and cuddly"" on command. Even funnier than them, however, is the oddball narcissist king of the lemurs, Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen  aka Ali G), who is so self-absorbed and so warped he steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Madagascar is okay. It's probably in the second run theaters by now, and that's a perfect place to see it. It's not bad, but the leads never really engage you; good thing the penguins and Julien are in it a fair amount. There are a few funny gags (one continuing one involving spitting out seawater actually gets funnier the more they do it), and overall the movie is light entertainment, but nothing more. Those curious could easily wait for the DVD."

The plot was terrible (wow, a bunch of animals trying to escape captivity... every read of Animal Farm? If you had you would see how much this movie fails), and the cast of ""leading actors"" seemed to do nothing to enhance the film. The animation was annoyingly cartoon-ish, and even with the reference to American Beauty, one of my top ten films of all time, the movie can't help but fail. Worst movie of all time.

","Computer-mated films have become quite a medium in the entertainment business over the last decade. In fact, just over the last two years (not counting this New Year's Day), we have been offered at least five of these films, among them Shark Tale, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Chicken Little, and today's feature film: Madagascar.<br/><br/>Like Dreamworks' other computer-mated films, Madagascar inherits great character design, quirky pop culture references, Grade-A comedy, a list of vocally-gifted celebrities, an innovative storyline, and great multi-generational comedy. In short, if you've seen Shrek, you can gauge how much you'll like this movie.<br/><br/>This does not mean in any way that Madagascar is formulated, even though the characteristics they do share with Shrek and Shark Tale are lackluster in comparison. The main characters, for example, are not as well-developed, memorable, or hilarious as Puss in Boots or Donkey in the Shrek series of movies. The plot is also not as well-written as the one in Shark Tale. The movie's soundtrack isn't as great as the ones for either of the above-mentioned movies, and definitely doesn't use a song as powerfully as ""Hallelujah"" in Shrek. In all of these areas, Madagascer is simply mediocre.<br/><br/>However, this movie has a few major and minor distinctive characteristics which make Madagascer its own movie, and they are all help it immensely. Among the minor things are its few song triumphs. ""I Like to Move It"" was a great song, and the version featured in the movie is a LOT better than the karaoke ending numbers in both Shreks and Shark Tale. Plus, there is no ending number in Madagascar, which turns out to also be a good thing.<br/><br/>Among the major characteristics of the movie, the plot is a gold mine of opportunities: What would happen if four zoo animal pals were stranded on a deserted island? The script does this idea comedic justice, from the choice of animals, to the settings the animals interact in, etc., etc.<br/><br/>The other saving grace is the cast of excellent minor characters. They will make you howl in laughter, more than our main protagonists. Is there anything funnier than a group of penguins pulling an escape plan, military style? Or an English monkey that commands his silent buddy on the ordeal of flinging poop? And the lemurs. You gotta love the lemurs! Every time one of these characters appears signifies a stand-out part of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Madagascar does its job successfully: be a hilarious comedy everyone can enjoy. In a 1-10 scale, I give it an 8. Great movie, it is; but there have been a lot better in this genre."

My interest in the story lessened considerably when the animals left New York and arrived in Madagascar. I think the film would have been better if the animals had decided to make a break for Connecticut or Montana rather than having them be shipped off to Africa. The scene-stealers were the penguins, who were quite amusing, and the best sequence in the entire movie was the opening shot of a chorus of penguins singing ""Born Free."" While watching the film, I kept hoping the main characters would leave and the penguins would return.

I have yet to see anything so far that is remotely original and instead we are overwhelmed with tired scripts and remakes of movie classics or brainless t.v. shows (ie.

"DICK STEEL","6","7","14","25 May 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Madagascar
","Dreamworks Animation SKG has set high standards with its Shrek series, and follow ups like Shark Tale. Somehow this film falls short of expectations, and the best bits seemed to have been featured in the trailers.<br/><br/>Without going into the story details which you can piece together from promotions - this one has neither the zaniness nor a level of adult sophistication which we are spoilt with, and it seemed pretty back to basics.<br/><br/>Sure the spoofs are there - but not as rampant as the other animations (See? I'm comparing here! It's the standards that are set! I can't help it!). I've only managed to spot Zoolander, American Beauty, Cast Away, and given the premise, how can anyone not spoof the reality TV series Survivor? The lack of spoofs might not mean much, but dialogue without much wit doesn't cut out for me. Louis Armstrong's Born Free being played ad nausem also got to me.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, the animation is still top notch. The animals are beautifully drawn, and as always, contain that hint of their real life actors in them, like caricatures. In the zebra, you see Chris Rock, the Lion, the cockiness and self-importance of most Ben Stiller's reel life characters, and David Schwimmer's prominent neck resulted in him being handed the role of the giraffe. Jada Pinkett Smith as the hippopotamus? Now that's something different! Some of you might fall in love with the potential of the supporting characters, and at times, it seemed that they upstage the main leads. The pair of monkeys (one can read but can't speak, the other can't read but speaks with a stiff upper lip), the gang of penguins (they steal the show each scene they're in), a squirrel with rip-off Shrek's-puss-in-boots eyes (awww...), and my personal favourite - the crazed Lemur King, who speaks like an Indian chief (he sounds like one anyway!).<br/><br/>Perhaps with a little bit of direction and a more focused script (for kids? Or for adults? Or having elements of both to entertain adults and kids alike? Kids were falling asleep in this film - a sin for animation!) this could turn out into a hit. Alas the Dark Side of the Force is strong, and I really don't see this scaling to the peak of the (US) movie charts and dethroning the Sith.<br/><br/>The saving grace for me - the madcap jungle banghra rave party! WOOHOO! Repeated again as the end credits roll, but nothing at the end except for a hippo who thinks its a Tinkerbell."

I am not one of those people who automatically bash anything that's not produced by Pixar (and there seem to be a *lot* of those people out there), but you have to wonder when Dreamworks is going to realize that the story should carry more importance than signing big name stars to voice characters.<br/><br/>All that being said, however, the movie was truly funny and enjoyable. My parents and my cousins loved it, I enjoyed it well enough. One thing that I don't think many people are mentioning is that the movie is *absolutely* visually stunning. The color palette that's used, especially once the characters reach the island, is phenomenal! The character animation in this film is some of the best computer animation I've ever seen - the film's look and feel is an awesome mix of photo realism applied selectively to things such as water and plants, combined with animation that incorporates elements of the old Warner Bros. 'bend and stretch' style that's not really been seen much in CGI films. I thought that aspect of the movie was amazing, and I think that it's great that the studios are finally starting to apply some 'old-school' animation styles to CGI films and actually try something different. This movie is a lot like an old-school cartoon - it gets in, makes you laugh by making th impossible happen, and gets out. I think many reviewers missed the whole vibe the directors were going for with the 'bend-and-strecth' animation and the characters doing impossible things - that's how cartoons used to be, and that's how this one tried to be. Maybe the directors didn't do a good enough job of getting that across, but that's how it seemed to me.<br/><br/>There are a lot of moments in this movie that are laugh-out-loud funny. As other reviews have mentioned, the penguins and Ali G as the Lemur King absolutely *steal* every part of the movie they're in. I would love to see Ali G do more voice-overs, he was unreal. I thought that the voices (other than the obvious stand-outs I just mentioned) were pretty decent. Ben Stiller was OK - not great, but not bad, either. Chris Rock was good, not great, and David Schwimmer was really good as the giraffe. Jada Pinkett-Smith was OK when she was used (which was not much). Still - you have to wonder, how much money did Dreamowrks spend on getting those big-name voices that were just 'good' (not great), that could have been spent on making this an *amazing* movie, instead of just an entertaining one? <br/><br/>I guess it's hard for me to listen to all the people on this board who say that anyone who posted a good rating of this movie must be a 'studio plant', when I watched this movie in a packed theater, and the place was booming with laughter. It's not going to win any Oscars, that's for sure, but it's a fun movie that looks great, and I think it's a great movie for kids that won't bore their parents, either. The last time I had accompany small children to the theater, it was to see 'Home on the Range', so I can't even begin to tell you how big of a step up this seemed to me... =)"

","Madagascar was a very good movie. it covered all the basics for a comedy for the whole family. It is a good movie to laugh and enjoy for all ages. This movie was funny, and was just put together very well. NO ONE should not like this movie unless they just don't like comedies. The penguins and King Julius added just the right amount of laughter to the movie. There is Absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>I took my 7 year old son and my 13 year old daughter to see this movie and they loved it. They want to go see it next weekend. My parents also went to see the movie. They are in their 60's and they even said the movie was great. I recommend this movie to everyone."

","I took my six year old son to see this movie tonight and was very disappointed. He got sucked in by the hype and promotion that has been out there for so long; however, there was no excited banter on the way home with comments like, ""Didn't you love it when....."" I wish we had waited for the video on this one, as I would have rather cleaned house than sat through it. The animation was sub par. It has the quality of a made for TV cartoon. I have been spoiled by the outstanding work of Disney / Pixar. The voice acting seemed forced and the timing was off. I couldn't help but visualize Ross when the giraffe spoke. Ben Stiller did not fit the lion. I usually love anything from Chris Rock, but I didn't feel any chemistry between him and the others. The plot was boring and unimaginative and the ending was anticlimactic. AND the lemurs were lame! The penguins stole the show which is a shame since they didn't get much time."

","This movie was seriously overrated by the majority of the critics. In fact, Entertainment Weekly, which is the one magazine that has the same opinions of mine 77% of the time, gave this movie an A-. Well, let me tell you: Boy, were they doing that movie a favor when they gave it an A-. First off, the movie was absolutely BBOORRRRIIINNNNGGGG and seemed to go forever even though it was a short 85 min. long. Second, where was the freaking' plot? The plot was extremely weak. Also, I swear, most of the sickly giraffe's humor was GROSS(Ex.: He gives Marty the Zebra his 1st rectal thermometer); he needs to be put to sleep if he gets sick that often. That song (Move it, which is like, 15 years old)which the lemurs sang wasn't even fun the 1st time, and by the end of the movie, I wished they were extinct(They played it over & over again...UGH!). Even though it was a ""family comedy"" (they have Sammy Davis, Jr.'s song ""Candyman"" playing at one point), my mom & everyone else in my family watching this only laughed about twice. While the little kids seemed to like it, it was not worth the $7 it cost me to get in. The art style also gave me nightmares; the animals were so blocky!If you want to see a 3D movie, rent either any of the Pixar movies or Shrek and avoid this. Because the penguins saved this movie from getting a one (you know a movie's bad when the only funny part is when penguins say ""Well, this sucks!""), this movie gets a 2/10."

"Paul-271","2","6","13","4 June 2005"," A dreary formula
","Given that this is the same studio which gave us the Shreks, I expected more, but got less. This is a boring movie mostly remarkable for its lack of imagination or use of what could be an interesting plot. The setup is that there is a society of animals which operates at its own level. Animals can all talk to each other, but humans hear them grunt and roar or do whatever animal noises we expect them to make.<br/><br/>So here we have the fish out of water played out as a buddy version of the animal out of cage instead. The humor is sometimes toilet, sometimes the ""can't we see the end of this joke"" crotch hit, but mostly shouting. So a character will, when the director calls for humor in a non-humorous spot, will shout which is supposed to evoke laughter. It didn't work even for the three year old. The best part of this movie were the coming attractions which, for the most part, didn't even make it into the movie itself. Faked coming attractions? <br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing fresh, interesting or creative in this entire show aside from the animation of a lion's mane. It's probably all right to distract the kiddies for a few minutes, but for gosh sakes, there are parents too. Lately the studios have gotten it and provided movies for parents and children both. Prime examples are Mulan, the Shreks, the Toy Storys and Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie is a high production value equivalent to Plan 9 where those others are equivalent to The Godfather. Avoid if you can."

","This has quickly and surely become my favorite animation movie ever. I love how rich and detailed all the characters are, and the storyline is gripping and side-splitting. The best comedic moments come when you least expect them.<br/><br/>Though the main focus in the movie is of the characters from the Central Park Zoo, for me, the limelight is really stolen by Julian, the king of the lemurs. He is just one of the most amazing animated characters I have ever seen and it is my hope that the sequel to the movie will focus a bit more on him than it did in this movie. Julian has a lot of contribution in the story. And after all, who can forget the ""I Like to Move It"" song that has literally become the theme-song of the movie and is just the most entertaining thing ever!"

I thought it was hilarious and I have nothing bad to say about it whatsoever! <br/><br/>I think it is great for kids and adults alike without having inappropriate jokes that are totally over kids' heads (like in Shrek 1).

","This movie sucked. <br/><br/>It has its funny moments, but they're buried in a sea of boringness and jokes that fall flat. <br/><br/>We had been looking forward to this movie for a long time, but I was sooooooo disappointed. <br/><br/>I give it points for the characters and animation. The artists are obviously gifted and you can tell that hundreds of hours were spent creating the characters and doing the animation. But that's no excuse for forgetting about making the movie funny and interesting. At best, it has some decent slapstick comedy, but that's about it.<br/><br/>My 5-year old seemed to get a kick out of it, but if you're looking for an animated movie that captures the imagination of grown-ups and kids alike, stay away from this one. This is no ""Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"" by any stretch. <br/><br/>Rent ""Ice Age"" instead. Very funny with a ""feel-good"" ending."

","Very fast, funny, heart warming, and honest. Pop culture references abound. From the previews I thought it was going to be like Ice Age -- one funny bit (in the case of Ice Age, Scrat, in the case of Madagascar, the penguins). But actually this is consistently funny, with a lot of scenes I did not expect to see in a family picture. I especially liked the bit with the cute little yellow duckie. I don't want to praise it too highly -- I think part of my pleasure was going into it not expecting anything much, and being surprised. But it is definitely a movie I'm going to see again and buy on DVD when it comes out."

"alex20850","3","4","8","31 May 2005"," An Embarrassment ... and not of Riches
","Charlie Chaplin best described what was funny. ""You take a woman walking down the sidewalk. Show the audience a banana peel in front of her. Everyone knows that she is going to step on the banana peel and do a pratfall. At the last instant, she sees the banana peel, steps over it and falls into an open manhole that neither she nor the audience knew was there."" <br/><br/>Starting from that, if the movie makers of Madagascar were to handle that situation they would have the characters run up to the banana peel, stare at it, look at the audience, look up and down the road, run back and forth, look at the banana peel again, and slip on it four or five times and completely miss the open manhole. This movie is a very strange and often unpleasant mix of throwing poo and Tom Wolfe, being friends and being food, being clever and being unpleasant. If not for the penguins, I would have to give this movie only one or two stars. The audience who laughs at throwing poo is probably not going to know who Tom Wolfe is and the audience who knows who Tom Wolfe is will probably cringe at the idea of throwing poo. <br/><br/>Gawd! what were some of these reviewers thinking when they called it ""Brilliantly written, animated and performed, it not only bridges the child-adult divide, but also makes its kid-friendly humor smart in its own way."" -- Bruce Westbrook, HOUSTON CHRONICLE<br/><br/>I much more agree with: ""The movie is like a doughnut, with frosting on the edges and a big hole in the middle.""

","This movie was OK. It didn't live up to my expectations. I thought it would be considerably more funny. <br/><br/>It starts off well. Some nice wee gags, but it lacks plot. It seems to be very similar most of the time.<br/><br/>It is definitely not as funny as some of the other digitally animated movies. I know these types of movies are aimed at little kids, but normally they have some quite funny jokes in them. But this one didn't have many good jokes. They were all very childish. Most of the best jokes were on the trailer, but there were a few good ones. Really, my friends and I got more laughs out of mocking it than we did watching it.<br/><br/>Another poor thing is the animation. It is awful compared to Shrek, Finding Nemo, Shark Tale etc. That really surprised me. They didn't look very real. They looked more like cartoons. Although some lemurs were done well, I remember that Alex the lion didn't look very good.<br/><br/>One thing that is very good is the voice acting. Especially Ben Stiller. He always does well.<br/><br/>Overally I thought it was reasonably entertaining. Younger children will probably enjoy it but I wouldn't fork out large sums of money to see it."

""The Penguin Plot"" and ""The Lemur King"" and forget the four 'leads'<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>Such wasted potential. Sending animals into the ""wild"" without even touching on learning to survive there? If Tom Hanks can't build a shelter, how can a Zebra do it in 5 minutes complete with wet bar? The only danger was the lion biting the Zebra in the butt...<br/><br/>There was so much room for exploring what it means to be wild, and thus what it means to be a human, and they missed it all. Shallow, no character development, and at the end, you couldn't root for anyone because A. you didn't care about anyone, and B. there wasn't much jeopardy.<br/><br/>If you create a film where you are supposed to emotionally connect with characters (and they try to make you in this film), don't cast Chris Rock and Ben Stiller as your emotional leads! They aren't actors, they are comedians. You want acting, get some actors.<br/><br/>Honestly, it's sad the state of animation at Dreamworks.<br/><br/>The jokes are all rehashed from Family Guy, Simpsons and Futurama, and thus, usually not really fit for little kids. No original music, no original thought, just a money making formula that includes a dance number and fart jokes.<br/><br/>PS - there are some early ""reviews"" on this page that are clearly written by Dreamworks plants, most obviously the 10 out of 10 one with the ""reel"" pun who begs of you to wait to the end of the credits for a surprise of some kind.<br/><br/>NOTE: THERE IS NO REASON TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS!

Thirteen years later, I still love it and has become one of my favorite animated movies. Dream Works always does an awesome job on their movies although Disney is my ""go to"" for animation. Speaking of Disney, they released a similar film called The Wild I think two years after but I still think Madagascar is the best."
"bellino-angelo2014","8","2","3","2 July 2018"," Nice animated movie for all ages
","I saw this movie for the first time when it came out in theaters in 2005, and I loved it, along with my parents, then I saw it various times in these years, and today I still love it. And it deserves a higher rating than 6.9.<br/><br/>Considering the period this movie came out (practically when theaters were bombarded by great CGI animated movies such as SHREK, FINDING NEMO and ICE AGE), it has an original storyline, with four animals (a lion, a zebra, a hippopotamus and a giraffe) that live as friends in the Central Park zoo. But when Marty the zebra wants to escape, his friends also escape coming to his rescue, only to get captured (along with four penguins and two chimpanzees) and loaded on a ship direct to Kenya. Soon the four penguins sabotage the ship, and the quartet ends in Madagascar, and... well see the movie by yourself.<br/><br/>I'll talk about the qualities of this movie: (1) The animation is good, and especially the jungle backgrounds are charming to look at (2) The cast is awfully good, especially Ben Stiller and Chris Rock are perfect as Alex and Marty using their tipical jokes from their previous movies, and Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer and Andy Ricther are a hoot as the three main lemur characters (King Julien, Maurice and Mort) (3) The soundtrack is amazing, with the recurring theme of BORN FREE, that is perfectly suited for Marty's spirit, and I LIKE TO MOVE IT, MOVE IT, a popular disco song from the 1990s that regained popularity after this movie came out.<br/><br/>I want to talk about the penguins, my favourite characters of the movie. They are only supporting characters, but when they appear they steal the show! Skipper does also a nice Robert Stack impersonation, and it's very convincing as the penguin commander. <br/><br/>The story line has not only comedy moments, but even his drama moments, especially when Alex returns with his carnivorous instincts after a period in the wild and wants to eat his best friend Marty, and then they reconcile. People should learn this from Madagscar: true friendship reigns over everything, and even when dark sides emerge, they stop with true friends' helping.<br/><br/>The scene that scared me was when a hummingbird was killed by a carnivorous plant and a duckling killed by a crocodile, but the best scene was the lemur dance and song scene.<br/><br/>I also saw on the DVD the featurette about the making process of the movie and even a short documentary about the Madagascar island.<br/><br/>It's one of the greatest animated movies in recent memory, and if you never saw it, what are you waiting for? It's a must-see!"

","I did find Madagascar fun, entertaining and enjoyable. I do agree, that the script was a tad weak at times. While very funny in places, it was not so funny in others, probably to do with the pop culture references, that children won't understand. I liked the idea of the plot, but it is fair to say, that it isn't exactly what I can call action-packed; it does start off a little slow. But the last half once we are introduced to the jungle creatures picks up the pace. However, there are many redeeming qualities, the animation is lovely with colourful backgrounds and good character animation. The soundtrack is very good too, and so is the voice acting, who made the most of the questionable material they were given. Jada Pinkett Smith is given little to do, but Chris Rock and Ben Stiller seem to be having great fun as Marty and Alex. David Schimmer has his moments as Melmann. Though my favourite characters were the four penguins, they were so cute and funny. And the jungle creatures, voiced by Cedric the Entertainer and Sacha Boren Cohen were a hoot. All in all, above average, could have done with a more tightly structured story and a (little) funnier script, but it is likable and entertaining. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Unlike The Cat in the Hat, the jokes that had adult references were very well hidden (not just a dirty joke with clean words).

While picture quality is still getting better, also the music has been very, very entertaining, from Techno to Classic. Of course, you could say Shrek has been more amusing and original, but the story about Alex and his friends had some freshening aspect. The new characters have been well done, and lots of those magic scenes from various other movies, have found their equivalent in this picture. Its just funny to see how Alex interprets ""American Beautiness"", or what a real Jungle party does look like. So much little ideas have been brought into this single movie, it isn't possible to remember them all after the first time seeing Madagascar. My resume: Thumbs up!! Pleeeze, we all deserve MORE."

Ben Stiller was hilarious as Alex the Lion but David Schwimmer as Melman the Giraffe stole the show with all the physical comedy in the background of the scenes (look what is on his feet when they are on the subway).<br/><br/>The Penguins and Monkeys also steal some scenes with their crazed antics away from the main characters.

The ""Move It"" dance scene with King Julian was a big hit with the little ones.<br/><br/>While not as polished as Nemo, it is still a keeper. Your little ones should come away happy which is all you ask for with the cost of tickets these days!"

Personally they should all be in a sitcom together. <br/><br/>Back to the flick Madagascar, what can i say? I enjoyed it, it was similar to what if the Lion King was raised in captivity and all the hilarious antics that went with it. It's your usual buddy animated comedy, it lacked the X-factor that all of Dreamworks pictures is worth. But still I felt like dancing after hearing King Julian sing a song I haven't heard since the nineties.<br/><br/>It's not Dreamworks' best animated feature, I guess their only real moneymaker is Shrek 1 + 2, which I believe is being milked for all its worth, what with Shrek 3 + 4 to be released in some years to come.<br/><br/>Word on the digital media scene is that Pixar also has a zoo animal animated comedy in production aptly titled 'The Wild'.

","This movie was HILARIOUS!!! Like i thought it'd be funny, but really not that funny. I really think this movie has been overlooked and underrated by many people. If you're into movies such as Finding Nemo, Shrek and the Incredibles you should most definitely see it. If you're feeling down and need a good laugh, Madagasgar is the perfect formula for that. Sure it's children appropriate as well, but it well definitely gives adults a chuckle as well. Actors such as Chris Rock, Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer make it such a fun watch. It gives you a look of life from a comedic view of how animals trapped in captivity feel. The things that came out of the animals lines are beyond belief witty! GO SEE IT!"

"alecsaved","8","2","3","31 May 2005"," All Hail King Julian
","I'd like to first suggest to those who pointed out some logical weaknesses in the movie that this is an animated movie about talking animals. Some reviewers had trouble with certain plot points such as them getting on a subway or building a cabana on the beach. There's not 5 minutes of this movie that could possibly be even remotely plausible! Hello! That being said, it was a relatively entertaining movie that if made into a sequel should have as it's main character the King of the Lemers, and perhaps his sidekick, the Gizmo-looking Cedric guy. I thought I was going to die when the King starts doing the Robot. The 2 lesser characters (the hippo, giraffe) were expendable and I have no idea why the hypochondriac giraffe was scripted at all, unless it was to make the other three look more interesting and less annoying. The animation is incredible, lots of eye-candy, great music, lots of slapstick (fool-proof with kids under 10), quick-paced story-line, some agreeable morality, and a thoroughly pleasant ending. Oh, and the penguins; more, more, more! I had no problem with them casting the 'big names' as the voice cast, I'm not a huge fan of any of them so I was not distracted. It's not Shrek, and not Miyazaki, but's it got enough to be entertaining throughout (provided you're not expecting anything cerebral). My kids are 8 and 6, and they were talking and laughing about it most of the night and again in the morning. Which brings me to another concern others had; for those whining about the money; go to the MatinÃ©e next time! Spending $10-12 on your kid so they can laugh for a couple of hours is a no-brainer. The movie's target audience are pre-teen children, especially those under 10, and chances are they will love the movie, whether you do or not.<br/><br/>I rated this based upon how well my children enjoyed it."

","This film tells the story of a group of animals from the Central Park Zoo that arranges a way to be returned to Africa. They are Alex, the lion (zoo's main attraction), Gloria, a hippopotamus, Melman, a hypochondriac giraffe and Marty, a zebra who, by the way, was the only one truly anxious to return to Africa. Who takes advantage of this is a pair of monkeys and a group of penguins with navy seals ticks. In Africa, they end up repenting and try to return to civilization, relying on the help of a joyful tribe of lemurs led by eccentric King Julian. The film is a lot of fun and some scenes are worthy of anthology, like the dance of King Julian, the main (the only) musical moment of the film. The voice cast have some well-known actors like Ben Stiller, Sacha Baron Cohen or Chris Rock, and they did their work very well. Unfortunately, although the film is good and very funny and the majority of the characters were well imagined, the secondary characters are funnier than the main characters, and everything they do ends up having more interest than the four central animals. This is serious and shows that the main characters have been poorly developed."

I also liked the scene where the four main animals were shown inside their boxes whilst being shipped to Madagascar - it was cleverly executed and had a similar style to split screen mode. The ""Who's the cat?"" Chase scene between Alex and Marty is hilarious and uses the principle of follow through and overlapping action perfectly. The voice cast is well known as well. While this film is mostly aimed at children, there are parts of it that may go over their heads such as the psychedelic hallucination sequence when Alex is tranquillised and the 'American Beauty' reference.

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","8","1","1","5 January 2013"," An above average animated film with solid entertainment, but also pretty flawed in it's story
","The first time I saw this in theaters was in the late summer of that year almost 8 years ago, hoping that it would've disappoint me the same way Dreamworks Animation's Shark Tale did (it was far from being the worst, but it was pretty disappointing). Later, I think that it got me a smile on my face and I liked it as a kid, but as a young adult, I think this is a decent film with solid entertainment, but also pretty flawed. It isn't as strong as the later films like ""Kung Fu Panda"" and ""How To Train Your Dragon"", but trust me, I've seen much worse animated films (The Magic Voyage & Secret of NIMH 2).<br/><br/>I liked the idea of the four zoo animals getting stranded in Madagascar and the first 30 minutes was very promising, but the middle & third acts were a huge disappointment with a Foosa subplot. It was also short; could've been a little bit longer and the script is completely weak at times.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, everything still holds up. The animation is bright and colorful with excellent detail on New York and Madagascar (my favorite part of the animation in the movie being the jungle) and the character animation is pretty decent. The characters, on the whole, are likable especially Alex, Marty, Gloria, & Melman, but the best characters goes to the penguins (Skipper, Private, Kowalski, and Rico) King Julian who makes me laugh every time he's on screen while the other lemurs are kind of cute (especially Mort). The voice acting is excellent and it was surprisingly to see Ben Stiller (Night at the Museum), Chris Rock (Osmosis Jones) , Jada Pinkett-Smith, and David Schwimmer (Friends) in it. Sacha Baron Cohen & Cedric The Entertainer also did a great job as the lemurs King Julian and Maurice as did Andy Richter as Mort. The music from Hans Zimmer may be generic, but it does have a nice track (Born Free).<br/><br/>Overall, Madagascar may not match up to some of Dreamworks Animation's strongest works, but it's a lot better than their weakest films (Shark Tale, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas and Bee Movie). It might be worth-watching for kids, but for the adults, it would've been a little bit better."

(I think.)<br/><br/>Whoever, whether Sunny Park or someone in in a Zimmercube, we are treated to possibly three dozen themes from old movies. All of them are quoted in a more pure fashion than the original, all with great respect and all adding substance to the film that it otherwise lacks.

The settings, New York City, Madagasgar and the middle of the ocean also do well in the story. I think the thing I liked most about this film was the portrayal of New York City, it gave a very good atmosphere and impression on the city and (having been there) looks very much like NYC. <br/><br/>The flaws I felt were the rudeness of some of the jokes - I would not recommend any children between three and six to watch this as they may take on some of the rude jokes. Also, the songs they picked for background were good - but why did they not include some new songs!? This drives me crazy, in my memory I have not seen a single CGI feature film with its own written songs.<br/><br/>Anyway, a film well-worth watching. It is about four animals in Central New York zoo (a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippo) who find themselves escaping and off to the wild. It includes quite a few plot turns, a great deal of them amusing, but they are all exciting.<br/><br/>I recommend this to all adults who love CGI films with good humour and to children who like watching anything funny.

","I like this movie because it is humorous, and it generally is upbeat. It is a creative film. Both children and adults enjoy it. The humor is more for adults than for children. My favorite parts are when the lemurs sing and dance. Since I watched this at home, I got up and danced. My 11 year old and 7 year old nieces joined in.<br/><br/>I wish that there was a video with just these lemurs singing and dancing for a few hours, but I can always buy the DVD or tape and rewind. Dancing along is good exercise. This would be so much better than using an exercise video.<br/><br/>The penguins and the giraffe are entertaining to watch too.<br/><br/>It seems silly that a zebra considers riding the subway, but in a cartoon full of talking animals, I expect things like this. I find it odd that escaped zoo animals are trying to find people because my experience with escaped wild animals is that they put more value on their freedom than on their liking or need for humans.<br/><br/>One of the animals looks similar to the Puss and Boots in one of the Shrek films and has that same adorable look."

There is hidden humor in the movie that you don't realize until you've seen it at least twice. You completely bond with the animals in the movie. The animals have personalities that you will never forget. They put a new perspective on zoo animals and how they live. Overall, 'Madagascar' is a great family comedy!"

","MADAGASCAR <br/><br/>I know people were really hoping this movie wouldn't make it into the 2006 shortlist for Best Animated Feature... and the nominations went to CORPSE BRIDE, W&G, and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE. Well I won't argue that this film was robbed of a nomination, but it certainly wouldn't have been a travesty if MADAGASCAR had made the list.<br/><br/>While not a remarkable, landmark achievement, MADAGASCAR is still an entertaining animated film. Featuring some wonderfully stylized animation and some perfect marriages of voice-actors with their characters, the film is constantly entertaining and humorous.<br/><br/>What MADAGASCAR does lack is any significant depth. Any layer to the characters is utilized for comedy instead of played for sincerity. That is until the very end when Alex the Lion has a change of heart. But everything that precedes that treats the animal's personalities as shamelessly shallow comedic creations.<br/><br/>Now, that doesn't do much for the film's artistic merit... but it does make for a good time. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith, David Schwimmer, and the rest of the cast are obviously having a good time voicing these characters and the fun permeates through the screen. Their performances mixed with the stylized animation is really what keeps the film alive.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Alex the Lion (Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Pinkett-Smith) and Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) as they are shipped back to the wild despite their affection for the Central Park Zoo. They've been zoo animals for years and aren't ready for the sudden shift to embrace their wild instincts. However, somehow they adjust and remain friends.<br/><br/>It's a predictable story arch and it definitely starts to lag when the film tries to switch gears into more dramatic territory at the very end. The comedic addition of the Lemurs in MADAGASCAR was obviously done to appeal to young kids and get even more laughs... however, for me the Lemurs were unnecessary superfluous distractions that only made the film drag.<br/><br/>Still, the 4 central characters are very appealing and well-voiced by the respective actors. MADAGASCAR isn't perfect, it's a movie I would never praise with love... but I also don't really have anything too negative to say. I will say that I found it better then Dreamworks' more critically acclaimed SHREK.<br/><br/>MADAGASCAR can't be deemed any revelation... but in terms of harmless children/family entertainment this is an entertaining ride that earned the box-office success it received.<br/><br/>...

","This is a better movie than some of the critics and so-called seasoned movie reviewers think it is. Sure, it is not great and the animation is almost as mediocre as Shark Tales, but it does do a fine job of providing consistent laughs for the evening and has one catchy song: ""I like to move it, move it (although the soundtrack version is p***-poor)."" The plot, which starts off in a zoo, centres around Alex, a 'lion-hearted' lion, Melmar, a hypochondriac giraffe, a strong-willed hippo and Marty , an open-minded zebra who envisions life in the wild. After Marty escapes, Alex and friends rescue him, only to be shot by tranquiliser darts and sent on a ship to another place. Mayhem ensues and they end up in Madagascar, where they meet a crazed animal 'king' and his ilk.<br/><br/>Some of the one-liners here are actually quite hilarious. For instance, the monkey's: ""Oh, of course we're going to throw poo at him!"" and Melmar's: ""Hey look, I've got a breath mint!"" (it's actually a urinal cake). There are quite a few other funny scenes, like Alex's tranquilised delusions and 'King' Julian's impromptu signing of ""I like to move it, move it"". Melmar's antics also inspire a few laughs, especially when it becomes clear that he is not suffering from any ailments. Alex is less funny, which is surprising, given Ben Stiller does his voice, but seeing him rip a phone out and chuck it away for no reason is amusing. There's a lot of other funny stuff too, like when Alex's 'Statue of Liberty' collapses 9/11 style. King Julian's mistreatment of his assistant is also funny to watch.<br/><br/>To be concise, this is worth seeing. It is not a masterpiece; in fact, technically it is quite poor, considering it's state of animation when placed next to say, 'A Bug's Life', one of Pixar's older yet best-animated pictures. Still, it is consistently funny, even hilarious in parts and most people, especially younger kids, will warm to this film sooner or later.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars"

","Madagascar is from the same creators as Shrek and Shark Tale. The story starts in Central Park Zoo, New York, the home of Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, Gloria the hippo, Alex the lion, a bunch of crazy penguins and some monkeys. The penguins are digging their way to 'the wild', but find Marty instead, and Marty instantly starts dreaming of going into the wild too. Followed by his friends, Marty escapes, but they get caught again, and this means a new beginning for all of them: they are shipped off, to be put in a natural habitat in a wild-life reserve. Because of the penguins hijacking the boat, Marty and friends strand in the real 'wild': Madagascar. A whole new world opens up for the animals, who have been living in the city zoo their entire life.<br/><br/>This is a very fun movie. It isn't well constructed and it doesn't even make much sense, but it's just crazy fun like Shrek II and Shark Tale. The voice-casting is very well done, especially Chris Rock as hyperactive zebra Marty, David Schwimmer as Melman, the neurotic giraffe, and last but definitely not least: Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) as King Julien, the lemur leader. Their voices sound like the characters really are.<br/><br/>I don't believe this movie was meant to be taken seriously, and it is best you don't. Once in a while you get references to other movies, American Beauty being the most obvious. Every single animal is slightly (or completely) nuts: e.g. Melman the giraffe is addicted to doctors and medication, and the penguins are psychotic. Speaking of which, the penguins are simply hilarious. Best to pull up one eyebrow before starting to watch the movie  just to be prepared, and you can be sure to leave the theater with a beat and 'I like to move it, move it' in your head."

I liked especially the city and ship scene but I don't tell you more. These kind of movies are in my opinion better than the SHREK series where I cannot imagine something concrete.

In some places you do wonder if the plot is going to develop a bit more, and often it doesn't. however the characters personalities keep the plot going and the character of Melman the giraffe is very funny in places. this films is highly recommended for children and adults alike!!"

","I went into this movie with some very low expectations. After hating Shark Tale last year I was sure this would be along the same vein. Surprisingly the movie is FUN! Kids will love it, adults will laugh, and the creatures are likable to all. If you are a fan of Ben Stiller's comedies you'll probably enjoy this movie. Chris Rock is more subdued than previous films and didn't distract me as much as I thought he would. I giggled with delight the entire film and the songs stuck in my head for days afterwords. The animation is simpler than a Pixar film but the colors are extremely bright and rivet the eyes to the screen. Best of all, there isn't any bad romantic story to watch - it's all about the animals goofing off! If you want some clean humor and a good times at the movies this is the summer movie to see!"
"diac228","8","1","1","11 June 2005"," Surprisingly good, not the typical pop-culture filled Dreamworks film
","Dreamworks I feared was losing it after back-to-back disappointments Shrek 2 and Shark Tale. Then came the trailer of the movie Madagascar and I was even more afraid. I was so sure that this one was going to just be another pop-culture filled borefest. Apparently, Dreamworks proved me totally wrong. Madagascar, no joke, is the best Dreamworks animated film since the instant classic Shrek. This movie did something that not Shrek 2, Shark Tale, and not even The Incredibles pulled off, which was a great mix of drama, pop culture references, and sight gags. As a matter of fact, Madagascar is run by sight gags and visual jokes, which is a good thing. The end result is a movie that will entertain both kids and adults, and more the kids but the adults will get a kick out of this anyway.<br/><br/>Madagascar is about a zebra, a giraffe, a lion, and a hippo being transferred to the wild after an escape from the New York Central Zoo, which was started by a zebra that wanted nothing more than to experience the wild and do something different. But, because of a couple of penguins who look like have seen way too many criminal/heist films and also because of an argument, the animals were instead moved to a remote island full of little furry creatures that are constantly threatened by meat-eaters. Throughout the movie, the animals struggle to adapt to the wild as the animals in the island have other plans for them. Ben Stiller voices the lion, Alex, and actually does a superb job as well. Unlike his previous film Meet the Fockers, he does not depend on the other characters surrounding him to become funny, his performance as the lion is funny by itself.<br/><br/>Sorry you Chris Rock fans, but I find this comedian rather overrated. That being said, Chris Rock was very funny as Marty the zebra, he delivers some of the better one-liners in the film. David Schwimmer is my favorite of the Friends actors and actresses and this is just another reason why he can have a decent career outside of the hit sitcom. His performance is the best, as the very paranoid and unhealthy giraffe Melman. Last but not least of the main characters, Jada Pinkeet Smith (who hasn't done much lately) does a swell job as the hippo, Gloria. Of course, I have to give credit to Cedric the Entertainer and Sacha Baron Cohen (better known as Ali G) for their funny performances as well. But it is not the dialogue that runs this film, it is the penguins, the sight gags, and the cute critters from the island of Madagascar that make this film worth watching more than one time. The penguins have the best lines in the film, and they barely say anything. They are four very determined and intelligent penguins simply trying to go to Antarctica. As for the cute critters, you just have to see them; they are simply a wild bunch.<br/><br/>Like most Dreamworks animated films, Madagascar also relies on the pop culture references, but not even close as much as their previous movies, and that is a good thing. What is even better is that they are actually funny. Ranging from American Beauty, Planet of the Apes, The Twilight Zone, to even a 1960s drug reference, the allusions come very fast, and if you catch them, the payoff is great. Like Robots, the movie is mostly visually appealing, but for a different reason than Robots. The visual entertainment in Robots is just jaw dropping, not really entertaining, just amazing to look at. Madagascar is uproarious with the amount of visual humor it has to offer, at times, you just sit back and marvel at the effort they put in order to make you laugh without using a single line of dialogue (once again, I am referring to the penguins).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Unlike the Pixar films, Madagascar does not dig very deep into sentimental value, it is just the typical kids film, with plenty to look and laugh at. I find this film much better than Shrek 2, Shark Tale, and even Antz, the movie that put Dreamworks computer animation on the map. As a matter of fact, aside from Kung Fu Hustle, this is my favorite film of the year, and yes, it is much better than the disappointing and plot hole-filled fiasco Star Wars: Episode 3 (but no, I am not including Sin City because I have not seen it yet). Better than A Bug's Life but, still far off of the quality of Pixar films, but then again, few movies can top Pixar films. Full of decent performances from the well-known actors and actress, which is a rarity nowadays in animation, Madagascar just proved to us why companies pay good money to hire famous actors to lend their voices. Good voice acting, plenty of funny jokes, and endless physical humor make this film a must-see for the entire family, for those especially sick of all the hype for that other film. Have fun at Madagascar; you'll be surprised at just how pleasant it is.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10"

","Animals from New York's Central Park are shipwrecked at the titled location after they unwittingly make people think they want to go back to the wild. Simplistic story-telling with neat animation and admittedly interesting characters across the board. ""Madagascar"" is a highly innovative animated feature that nearly goes to a dark place as the four friends must adapt and learn to take care of themselves in a totally foreign environment for each. However, this is meant to be entertainment for the youngest of age groups as the jokes are tongue-in-cheek all the way. The voice characterizations are adequate, but far from excellent. In the end, the production was a slight winner with me but it may pale to other recent movies of the same kind for more critical viewers. 4 stars out of 5."

I am still not quite over the frustration of losing money to this movie.<br/><br/>The first 20-30 minutes of it are just plain stupid. A lion and a zebra (who are best friends go figure) live next to each other in a zoo with a barrier between them my 4 year old could jump over. Their neighbors are a hippo and a giraffe (who by the way is the funniest character). The Zebra wants to go explore thus creating the journey of the picture.<br/><br/>The dialog is slow... the plot is weak.... and the comedy is mostly physical comedy on the giraffes part and a little attitude from Gloria/Jada the Hippo whom I often wondered why she was there at all. Absolutely NO character development for her.<br/><br/>My children were bored and looking around before they even left the zoo. My son begged to get a drink of water... My 4 year old was falling asleep on my lap...kids were playing... walking around... talking. We went to a Saturday matinée so there were tons of kids and moms.

","Ho hum...another kiddie-flick serving as a vehicle to show off how far CGI has progressed since the last kiddie-flick. OK yes, the CGI is, as you'd expect these days, stunning, and the film is probably worth watching for that aspect alone if you're into that sort of stuff. As to the non-CGI aspects of the film, it's a rather tedious affair with predictable humour and uninspired dialogue. Not even close to the wit and originality of your average Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon (of course, those were brilliant so I suppose that's an unfair comparison, since no one these days seems able to write with that level of flair or originality). I find when viewing these sorts of films that it helps to imagine what they would be like if the images were all hand-drawn as in the pre-computer days. Would the film still hold your interest? In most cases, no. Still, Madagascar is probably a good way to entertain the kids for an hour and a bit, but you should probably bring along some mental baggage of your own to keep your mind occupied, since this film won't do it for you."

Of course, I wasn't expecting much, but when you don't expect much, you usually are pleasantly surprised. Not here. This was sooo horrible! It was completely lacking in good writing. I think that I could have probably done a better job at creating a plot. Half the movie was about the lion complaining about the fact that he was stuck on the island. Now, there are times when complaining from characters is okay, like Shrek being all sad because of Fiona's dad. However, we tolerate it because we have established some kind of affinity for the character. In Madagascar, however, Alex the Lion is not really a very likable character. So, his complaining is actually really annoying. The only good parts, I think, are the monkeys and the penguins. The movie should have been about them. I am writing this review because I want to spread the word that this movie is bad, not worth any money or any time unless you are under the age of 12. The key to movies is their writing, their plots. However, this plot is weak if anything. Also, I just wanted to make a side comment about the lemurs. It might seem silly, but it is one of those things that kinda irks people. Now, I know that lots about the film is unrealistic, but, there are certain things that should be accurate. So, why in the world does the king of the lemurs have an Indian accent when he is in Africa? It just doesn't make sense.

","DreamWorks Animation division is not exactly the best when it comes to animated motion pictures - from their early days of CGI productions they have repeatedly tried to mimic the success of Pixar. Of course, sometimes it was entirely coincidental (""Antz"" was already gearing up for production when ""A Bug's Life"" was in its early stages) - but there's no doubting that they have tried to replicate the adult-humor of features such as ""Toy Story."" It's worked once or twice. The edge of ""Shrek"" - and especially its pop-culture-reference-laden sequel - turned out to be entertaining and witty. But for every ""Shrek"" there's a ""Shark Tale"" (still one of the most painful animated films I've ever had to sit through).<br/><br/>""Madagascar"" follows suit of ""Shark Tale,"" similarly featuring terrible animation that looks cheap and unappealing - but it's a lot better than ""Shark Tale"" because it's at least reasonably entertaining.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith voice four animals living in a New York City zoo. Stiller is a proud but timid lion, Rock is a curious zebra, Schwimmer is a hypochondriac giraffe who wears tissue boxes on his hooves (a reference to Howard Hughes in his later life, of course), and Smith is a street-wise hippo.<br/><br/>Marty the zebra dares to venture outside the zoo one day by escaping rather carelessly, and ends up getting himself and his pals transported to a new zoo after their journey through New York City scares a few people. Marty just wants to see his home land, but soon they're being shipped in crates barely small enough to fit their bodies.<br/><br/>However, due to a series of strange circumstances involving scheming penguins, the ocean liner's path is diverted and the four animals find themselves stranded on the island of Madagascar, where they are faced with a wild environment in which they must defend for themselves against other animals and a weird pack of natives who worship them as gods.<br/><br/>The movie's animation, as I mentioned above, is slipshod and amateurish. It looks as if Dreamworks had no care at all to spend time on the quality of their work here. The vocal talents are a bit self-conscious, too. Stiller - as much as I like him in regular comedies like ""Starsky and Hutch"" - is a bit too self-aware and I never felt like any of the characters were really characters - the entire time I just kept imagining Stiller and Rock in a studio recording their parts.<br/><br/>Schwimmer and Smith both fail to leave an impression due to the restrictions of the script - Schwimmer's giraffe is just an ultra-nervous weirdo who's, quite frankly, rather annoying - and Smith doesn't really do much of anything except pop up now and again. It's really Stiller and Rock who are the two main vocal talents here - their characters are given the most room to grow in the script - but they're just average at best.<br/><br/>Overall this really is just an ""average"" movie - it's not outstanding but it serves its purpose as amiable family entertainment. It doesn't contain the clever satirical wit of a Pixar film and neither does it appeal to adults and children equally in the same way most Pixar features do - but it's a lot, lot better than ""Shark Tale."""

","It's easy to dismiss the work of DreamWorks' animation division when held up against the heftier, instantly classic works of Pixar. But DreamWorks has found a nice niche creating solid family movies that focus more on being funny than tugging at the old heartstrings. Both Shrek movies have been laugh riots, and if they're eclipsed by work like The Incredibles it isn't because they aren't great in their own way. There's nothing wrong with a big laugh, and DreamWorks Animation is better at delivering them than anyone. They've proved it, by finally doing something worthwhile outside of Shrek. Madagascar is their funniest endeavor yet, on par with Disney's accidental, wacky success The Emperor's New Groove. <br/><br/>It starts with the Central Park Zoo and the animals therein. The zoo's star attraction is Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller), a happily captive lion. By day he wows massive crowds with his antics, at night he hangs out with his zoo friends: a zebra named Marty (voiced by Chris Rock), a hippo named Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) a severely hypochondriac Giraffe. Alex loves captivity and has no idea about what's outside his zoo. In fact, he doesn't want to know. But Marty, facing his 10th birthday and middle age, starts thinking about what it might be like in the wild. Determined to find out, Marty escapes the zoo to head for the widest open spaces he can think of: Connecticut. Shocked, his zoo friends take off after him, planning an intervention to bring him to his senses and get him back in his pen. Naturally, the citizens of New York react poorly to hippos, monkeys, and penguins on the subway and things snowball until the whole lot of them ends up in the wild, specifically Madagascar. <br/><br/>What sells it is the script's sharp and lively wit, as in a scene that finds two well-educated British monkeys discussing an escape to attend a Thomas Wolfe reading. As Wolfe fans they decide to go, but of course they'll throw poop. In fact, it's the film's supporting characters that get the biggest laughs, not the four animals in the thick of the story. For the most part they play it straight as Madagascar's secondary cast of commando penguins, literature loving monkeys, and techno-dancing lemurs play off them to perfect effect. It's there that Madagascar scores the best voice casting too, with Any Richter as one of the militant penguins, Sacha Baron Cohen as the king of the lemurs, and Cedric the Entertainer as the fuzzy lemur king's cranky assistant. <br/><br/>Screenwriter's Mark Burton and Billy Frolick deserve a lot of credit for getting so much out of what might have been a throwaway kid's movie. The movie takes risks by avoiding obvious gags in favour of going places you might not expect. Absent is the obligatory moral lesson so often unnaturally shoehorned in to family films. If there's any lesson to be learned here it's probably that even the best natured lion gets hungry. Not the sort of thing you'll find much application for in every day life. Instead, Madagascar just wants to make its audience laugh, and does that admirably. <br/><br/>If there's any criticism to be level-ed here, it's that the plot is a little thin. To directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath's credit though, it doesn't try to stretch it. Madagascar gets in, throws its comedic punches and gets the heck out. There's no real substantive adversity for the characters to overcome, no well developed villain for them to be pitted against. Had the movie gone on any longer, that might have killed it but clocking in at a meager 80 minutes the thing works. <br/><br/>There's plenty here for everyone to enjoy, maybe even enough to redeem DreamWorks for Shark Tale. The lovable penguins you've no doubt already seen in the trailers absolutely run away with the movie, and if DreamWorks has any sense they'll already be hard at work on an all penguin spin-off. The big named voice talent dragged in to give them advertising fodder does their job too, Stiller's usual shtick disappears inside Alex and Chris Rock is much better as a voice actor than he is in live action. Madagascar is a gut busting little adventure that's an easy view for parents afraid of a serious time commitment. It's a prodigious comedic mix of smart gags on both adult and kiddie levels."
"karmela","10","3","7","3 June 2005"," Not a New Yorker? Well, you won't quite get it.
","What can I say? I had a great,great time at the movies! ""Madagascar"" is a well done, smartly written piece of animation. Cleverly stylized and and excellently executed on the formal level, it is also one of the smartest animated things around. Still, as much as I enjoyed it - I don't blame people from outside the Big Apple who don't quite get it. The humor in this movie is very precisely targeted towards relatively small, but very influential piece of population: those of us who have ever lived, live now or are planing to live in The Greatest City on the Planet (does the phrase 'you're on the Jersey side!' sound funny to you? Well, you get the picture.) Never heard of New York minute? Never had a bagel and a cup o'Joe to go in the morning? Never rode the #6 train uptown on the rush hour? Fugheddaboudit! But if you are in love in the Naked City as much as I am, you're going to love this movie. The characters are very much an animated version of Woody Allen's characters; the settings are as beautiful as New York can be when you see them through loving eyes... and Hans Zimmer's variation on ""Rhapsody in Blue"" will make your spirit soar. However, for those of you who have kids you want to entertain, or those who think the whole New York thing is just a bunch of rubbish - take my advice: go watch ""Robots"" or the like."

The biggest failing is this - only traces of the charm, humour, parody and magic that made the aforementioned films so good, still remain here, and it ends up as an OK kids film, that adults can watch without being bored to death; but nothing more.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I watched this movie with my niece this last year and expected a children's film, but this one definitely has witty dialog for adults! Even the lemurs' techno song is great! The voice actors all did a fabulous job and surprised me since not all of them are known for being comedians. Also, the animation was stunning and very crisp. Most of all, I loved the script - lots of funny things, and if you're laughing too hard, you might miss a couple more funny lines of dialog along the way! And who knew that Sacha Baron Cohen was Ali G? I'd seen Ali G on TV before, but never knew what his real name was. Just now when I looked up the voice actor for Julien and realized it was him, I was shocked! I didn't realize that he was so versatile. If you want a funny family film to watch or just want to watch an amusing film for yourself, I highly recommend this one."
"bfried5","3","2","4","26 December 2005"," String of Old School Pop and Parodies of other movies
","""Madagascar"" gets a three based on the artwork and saving effect of the penguins. The movie is a string of Old School Pop mixed with parodies of Jungle Book, The Lion King, and even Dream Work's Shreck movies.<br/><br/>Alex's personal conflict will be analyzed on levels--Aristotlilian and Freudian. He seeks to be virtuous through deep personal reflection, while knowing at the same time his appetitive maintains control (hence the self-imprisonment by the sharpened sticks). The reasonable overcomes the extreme of eating his friends, and the Golden Mean is achieved through the eating of fish (which the savvy viewer can assert from the evidence. The Freudian is played out as his Id wants to devour Marty. The Super-Ego erects the fence of sharpened sticks to enclose the Id. Deep personal struggle ensues, even to the point of telling Marty not to come inside his self-imposed stockade. In the end, the Ego emerges and finds satisfaction through eating of fish. (We end up at the same place with Aristotle and Frued, don't we?)<br/><br/>Most of the animals are copies of characters from other movies. Marty is a direct knock of the Ol' Rock from Donkey Eddie Murphy in Shreck (which I am sure Chris Rock would consider a compliment). Melman is straight from the Wimpy T-Rex in Toy Story. Julian and Company are right off of King Louie and the Shrine Gang from Jungle Book--and the Bush Babies bear a striking resemblance to the pre-water Mogwies from Gremlins. The Hyenas are the bad guys, just like in Lion King.<br/><br/>Once the gang gets to Madagascar, the scenes look remarkably similar to those found in Lion King--Not Selling Enough Merchandise--(you know, ""Special Edition"" starring Timon and Puhmba) including an Edenesque waterfall. <br/><br/>One other comment about the scenes on the island--which add somewhat to an authenticity that only linguists would care about. Julian speaks with an Indian Accent (that's East Indian, or Dravidian) which reflects the fact that Madagascar is an African nation with strong Pacific and Indian cultural and language ties (Malayan and the aforementioned Dravidian).<br/><br/>The lack of a plot is resolved by characters outside of the main plot family, the Penguins. They come to the rescue as the stolen freighter comes to rest--by pure dumb luck-- on Madagascar. But it's out of gas! Thus leaving our heroes stranded and making scene one for the sequel, when the animals somehow find their way off of the island. Thus, assuring the continued sale of plush toys and trinkets for years to come.<br/><br/>Bruce"
"steven_g25","10","2","4","16 December 2005"," Return to the Wild
","In the animated movie Madagascar, the wild is a symbol of freedom. Different characters have different prospective on this because for Marty it is very much wanted, and because Alex, Melmen, and Gloria on the other hand like the city life. Furthermore, the penguins feel that the animals do not belong in a zoo but in the wild where they came from.<br/><br/>I watched this movie because I enjoy seeing computer animated movies. My little brother just got it so I thought what a great opportunity.<br/><br/>Marty really wants to go to the wild to run free. He feels his life will always be the same if the stays at the zoo. ""I just eat here, then there, then stand over here, and then over there!"" Marty told Alex. He is always daydreaming while running on his treadmill inside his exhibit while he stares at the mural on the wall by his exhibit. During his birthday he wishes that he could one day be free to run in the wild. The rest of the gang thought he was crazy.<br/><br/>Alex, Melmen, and Gloria do not want to go to the wild for a number of reasons. Alex, for example, is the main attraction at the zoo, and if he went to the wild nobody would care about him, see, or admire him. Melmen is a hypochondriac and in the wild he would not be able to get all his special medication he would get if he stayed at the zoo. Gloria is a hippopotamus so she just likes to relax and eat all day, and what better place to do that in than in a zoo where everyone takes care of you. There are some other animals in the zoo that have a whole different idea, like the penguins.<br/><br/>The penguins have this crazy military mentality. They think that the zoo and everyone else in the world is against them. They are always trying to escape. They think that animals do not belong locked up in cages but free to roam the wild where they came from. Their main objective in the movie is to return to Antarctica and be free.<br/><br/>Madagascar is a fun, must see movie."

This movie is an excellent example of a animated movie that can appeal to adults as well as children. The jokes are simple yet well timed and the animals are a laugh a minute. My favorite was King Julian, voiced excellently by Ali G. His accent and mannerisms were so hilarious i was falling on the floor laughing. The other animals also are good especially Alex and Marty.

"audacious4u","10","2","4","21 November 2005"," A Breath of Fresh Air
","Some of you are taking this whole animated thing way tooooo serious. This is one of the few animated movies that have been made that keep it clean and simple so that children young & old can enjoy. We went to see this film after it came highly, highly recommended from many friends and co-workers. In a day & time when animated films are being bogged down with heavy drama & long plots with a little humor thrown in, this film kept it light and funny the entire time. My kids love those other movies but at times I know they get lost & confused in the seriousness of the plots. This film reminds me of the old good natured simple have a good laugh cartoons that many of us watched and enjoyed growing up that they don't even make anymore (except maybe the Animaniacs which we love and are hilarious). Cartoons back then were lighthearted, fun and guess what... no heavy plots. We now have Madagascar on DVD and my kids watch it at least 3 times a week. That's more than they have watched any of the other animated films I have and trust me, I have them all from Nemo, Shrek 1 & 2, Monster's Inc., Bug's Life, Shark Tale, the Lion Kings, The Incredibles... if it's animated, we have it and I'm a huge fan of many of the others but I'm here to tell you that my 3 kids from the youngest to the oldest, my husband and myself love this movie. They laughed, laughed and laughed all the way through this film and there is no other animated film that has been made in a long, long time that can claim that one. So for those of you looking for the ""serious animated movie"" with the deep plot that you will have to break down and explain to your younger kids, this may not be the film for you. I for one am tired of the ""downers"" and sad moments in these animated films, the unnecessary and at times ""too grown up"" romantic scenes... Hello, it's animated, not a drama or a soap opera!! So for those that for once would just like to sit down and enjoy a good, have some great laughs with the family without being burdened with an ongoing heavy plot, then get this movie and have some fun. Good for young & old alike and the kids can really get into it being that it's about animals they'll love to see. This movie isn't coming so highly recommended for no reason. Obviously, many of us parents were very pleased to finally see a animated film that we could just sit down with the kids and enjoy without having to explain a plot, wipe away tears, sit through the romantic moments and wait for the film to become fun again. Let's be real, if not for Dory, Finding Nemo would've been a real drag. But this movie has so many fun and funny characters and for us, King Julien and The Penguins stole the show!!! This movie was a breath of fresh air. Kudos to Dreamworks for finally making a film that is completely & totally suitable for children of ""ALL AGES"" old & young alike... adults will love it too"

It was a idea that probably sounded good, but nobody seemed to develop. Voices: mediocre at best, but they also are depended on a good script. Jokes: few. Only the four penguins were funny.

It is supposed to be drawn with crazy angles and things out of proportion. It is exactly what it is supposed to be. My wife and I laughed out loud and my three year old was spellbound. We even laughed and enjoyed it when we saw it two days later. (Yes, I've already see it twice.) The side characters are funny. The word is the movie was supposed to be out the penguins. I could stand to see a movie with just the penguins, they were that good. Sacha Baron Cohen was fantastic as the voice of King Julian, the self-proclaimed king of the lemurs.

Upon re-watching this, It felt like a movie I have never watched before since I haven't seen it in so long and I come to the realization that I don't like it as much as I used to.<br/><br/>What I still liked about the movie was that it has a great idea of how animals in the zoo actually feel about being locked up in captivity, the animation still holds up today even for a 2005 film, the voice acting is great, the characters are very interesting, the special effects are great, the story/plot is enticing, the song choice is interesting, it has good character development and while this film does have villains (the Foosas) it somehow manages to get away with not having a proper main antagonist which is one of the things that help make the film stand out from the rest of them.<br/><br/>However, I dislike some parts of it, which include a lot of product placement being thrown in during one of the scenes, there are a few clichÃ©s, they sometimes repeat certain words or phrases too many times in a row, they sometimes include unneeded toilet humor, the Foosas are annoying and some of the jokes come across as stale.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that this is a great movie even though it has it's problems, like most movies. This movie has a lot of charm in regards to the story, its characters, its plentiful ideas and more.

Some of the biggest names in Hollywood can be heard in this movie, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer just to name a few. The directors and voice actors have created a memorable film that is family friendly, and one the kids will want to watch over and over.<br/><br/>Eager to roam free in the open plains of Africa, Marty the bored Zebra of the famous Central Park Zoo, he escapes his prison the night of his 10th birthday. Soon enough his companions Alex, the conceded Lion, Melman, the worrisome Giraffe and Gloria, the tenacious Hippo realize he has attempted an escape and set off to find him.<br/><br/>After an attempted rescue, the foursome find themselves crated up and being shipped off to a Wild Life preserve. Only to end up on the sandy beach of Madagascar. Marty's dream had finally come true he was in the wild, much to the disgrace of his friends. The 4 of them hope to find a way off this dreaded island and make their way back to their beloved New York City.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with amazing animated shots and some of the settings would have taken days to perfect, and they animators take you around the whole world you're in New York, the open ocean, Madagascar and Antarctica but one of my favourite scenes is when King Julian shows them Madagascar and you get a scenic view of a lake and palm trees, this shot itself would have taken god knows how long.<br/><br/>One of the issues with the movie I had was with Alex the Lion, more specifically when Alex turns savage and sees everyone as meat. For me, he just wasn't frightening enough and I could tell they were trying to make him a little scaring but I feel that to make him look like he really had gone savage he need to be portrayed a different way.<br/><br/>The amount of memorable characters in this film is crazy, you get a bit of everything. There's the skittish Giraffe Melman, the Cool, Calm hippo in Gloria, Alex the Lion, the King of New York, Marty the energetic Zebra and Fan favourite King Julian, self-proclaimed King of the Lemurs.
The voice actors in this film tie it all together, you have the hilarious comedian Chris Rock who voices Marty, Ben Stiller, Star of Zoolander, voice of Alex, Friends Star, David Schwimmer voice of Melman, Jada Pinkett Smith the voice of Gloria.<br/><br/>The edited final product of this movie is immaculate and it took animated movies to a whole new level, there are no known hiccups in the movies like missing pixel or an Easter egg of some kind.<br/><br/>The lighting and shadow effects are used to perfection, the shadow movement follows the character and from deeper observation I did notice a miner hiccup, the scene when Marty tells his friends his birthday wish is to go to the wild and he is stood on his lawn, the light is shining at him but his shadow is in front of him when it should really be behind him.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for this movie is goes somewhat unnoticed, there is some really well known songs such What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong, The chariots of Fire theme song, Staying Alive by the Bee Gees and many more.<br/><br/>In the end this film is a family favourite that so many people still enjoy watching, so many memorable and hilarious lines, and a gripping storyline that keeps you watching right through to the end without checking how much time is left. With a star studded cast and a great team of writers they all together create an animated masterpiece that will be funny and a good watch for years to come."

","Pretty bog standard Dreamworks 'kooky anthropomorphic animals have a wacky adventure' fare. The animation is mixed - some beautiful moments, but some rather basic looking character design. Good enough to get by, but doesn't win any prizes, especially watched now. The fast pace means one doesn't get bored, but it means the conflicts and adversities which are supposed to add depth to the plot are left at a rather playground level. The film depends on the reasonably slick interplay between the four main characters for its impetus, but it doesn't have much more than that going for it, other than an enjoyable cameo from Sacha Baron Cohen as King Julien. Probably one of those kids films which really is more for the kids. Overall, some memorable lines, a few smiles, but not much more than that. Not one you'd regret watching, but not worth a return visit."

","Honestly, I'm not really sure why I actually watched this movie, though it probably has something to do with having access to it, being bored one night, and having been on the ride at Universal Studios in Singapore. To be blunt I found this film rather dull and pointless. Okay, the opening part of the film which was set in New York was fun but once they arrived at Madagascar the film suddenly went downhill. Also, I was expecting to see a lot more of the penguins than I actually did because as it turned out they were only playing bit parts, but were far and away the best characters in the movie (maybe because they were, as one of the animals described, psychotic).<br/><br/>The film is about a Zebra who has turned 10 and lives in the New York Zoo, but spends his days staring at a mural of the wilderness. His best friends are a lion, a hippo, and a giraffe. For the lion life is pretty good because he gets fed steak everyday and is the centre of attention, however the Zebra is pining for better things. So, one day he escapes, and all hell breaks loose, and the authorities decide to send them home. Unfortunately, due to the ship being hijacked by penguins, the crates holding the animals are washed overboard and they land up on the shores of Madagascar.<br/><br/>And that is about it. Basically there really is no plot. Okay, there is that Lord of the Flies concept where the animals are trying to fight off their savage nature, or at least the lion is trying to do so, however I'm not really sure if I could consider this to be the central plot. In another sense it is about how sometimes the grass isn't always greener on the otherside of the river, and that we should be content with where we are and what we have. Well, at this all well and good, but society seems to be suggesting something else, especially since the rich and the famous seem to flaunt their wealth (or at least some of them do). I could even suggest that friendship somehow transcends race, but I'm not really sure if I can say that either. In the end it is basically about a bunch of animals trapped on an island – I won't call it a desert island because Madagascar is pretty large for an island.<br/><br/>Yet there is another interesting thing that comes up, and that is how animals in captivity generally can't be returned to the wild. Well, the Lion did, but being born and bred in a zoo sort of indicated that there were things he couldn't do and wasn't used to. In a way we find he constantly trying to fight that savage nature that regularly rises up inside of him – in the zoo he was given meat but out in the wild he had to go and find it himself. However a part of me doesn't really want to think about this movie all too deeply because, well, it didn't really thrill me all that much, though I had to admit that there are two more waiting to be watched, but whether I will watch them or not is another story."

"ElMaruecan82","6","0","0","21 August 2016"," A silly forgettable plot, but one of the most endearing friendship of animation's history...
","Well, we get it from the characters' designs that ""Madagascar"" is no ""Lion King"" and from the casting of the voice actors: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith and Sacha Baron Cohen, that we'll be heading toward a 'jungle' version of ""A Shark Tale"": so many pop-culture references in the soundtrack that we'll lose the track, and the first minutes to play the distracting 'spot-that-star's voice' game.<br/><br/>Am I complaining? Not exactly: ever since the battle between Pixar and DreamWorks started with the face-to-face between ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life"", the rivalry allowed each team to fully express where they stood for on the field of imagination. Pixar made family friendly stories while DreamWorks was more focused on adult humor and references that even teenagers wouldn't necessarily get. On that level, ""Madagascar"" is pretty consistent with DreamWorks' tone, although it seems that this time, the enjoyment of children wasn't seen as a top priority at all.<br/><br/>I had the same complaint about ""A Shark Tale"", but I want to withdraw my judgment after ""Madagascar"". Now, this is movie totally made for adults and teenagers, with references to ""New York, New York"", to San Diego, to ""American Beauty"" during a feeding frenzy hallucinatory sequence and the ambiguous relationship between the two main characters, not to mention the identity crisis plot, only the penguins added the little touch of slapstick and fun the film needed for the little ones. So, I can't put exactly why I didn't enjoy the film as I thought I would, there's just something very confusing about it, and maybe the writing has something to do with it.<br/><br/>The opening starts with a fun little nod to ""The Lion King"" with Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) playing Tarzan with the sunrise in the background I was wondering where the creepers were hanging down from when he just woke up, his best friend Alex the Lion (which name did you expect? Leo?) wishes him a happy birthday. There have been friends in animated movies but I think I would put Marty and Alex in the Top 3, the two characters are co-leads and together they exchange advice, concerns and views about life like true bros would do. I liked that a lot, it was a genuinely appealing relationship. Now, Marty is 10, which in human years equals 38, he wishes he wouldn't spend the rest of his life in New York Central zoo, but Alex is more of a full-glass type of guy and tries to convince him to seize the day.<br/><br/>To complete the picture, there's a sensual and assertive female hippo (size helps) she's named Gloria and it's kind of ironic that she's voiced by the petite Jada Pickett Smith, and a hypochondriac whining giraffe named Melman, voiced by David Schwimmer, the size and the voice fits. Then you get a sort of bestial version of Friends with the zoo as Central Perk and if you still had doubt about these animals' humanity, you get the zebra walking in New York (""Staying Alive"" in the background) and the three other animals who know exactly the directions to take in the subway. And if you still had doubts, there's the scene with Alex before he gets the dart, when a lion doesn't understand why he scare humans, that means he can't picture himself as a lion, he's a zoo attraction, he's a star, but not a wild animal, talk about some serious existential issues.<br/><br/>A chain of events involving boxes, a ship bound to Kenya and the gang of penguins with remarkable sailing abilities lead our four protagonists to a remote island in Africa. The roles are reversed, Marty is ecstatically surfing with dolphins and enjoying lif, Alex is devastated, put out of his zone of comfort, he's more desperate than any human in a desert island. At this point of the movie, nothing can ever match the comedic originality of the first act when the four animals ventured in the city, but there have been enough animals in the city movies so that the writers wouldn't get further than that. The problem is that there's no much of a plot happening after that, the whole story is about the identity crisis of Alex, and a weird group of lemurs (singing ""I like to move it"") and with Sacha Baron Cohen voicing the leader with an Indian accent.<br/><br/>The lemurs want Alex to scare their predators, the fossa, but Alex is totally disoriented and tries to repress the resurgence of his savage instincts. What can he do? This is where the film gets tricky, at many points; Marty catches Alex in awkward positions, mostly near his behind. Alex is hungry and starts seeing juicy steaks everywhere. Now, I hate to read gay subtexts everywhere but for the first time, I thought it was pretty obvious although not intended, the food thing is nothing, there's something going on between Alex and Marty. He loves him, he doesn't want to hurt him so he goes away and lives hidden for a short period.<br/><br/>There's no way the film could have gone further than that, except if it tried to be ""Fritz the Cat"" but the relationship between Alex and Marty was so complex and weird that it totally overshadowed the main plot, which was rather forgettable and whose solution was contrived to the limits of a plot hole. I mean, if you accept that in ""Madagascar"" universe, eating living animals is wrong, then the ending doesn't make sense. Maybe that fish was a talking one with Steve Carrel or Matthew Perry's voice, have the writers thought about that? The food was just an excuse to make a film about two complex guys (not animals) with a very 'friendship' (yeah, right) so I only accept ""Madagascar"" as an exposition, and I'm looking forward to seeing things evolve in the sequel."

","A group of lifelong zoo captives, buddies despite their hunter-vs-hunted natural relationship, arrange a prison break and try to find themselves, for better or worse, in the wild. Madagascar is a rough early effort from DreamWorks animation and, for the most part, it's a waste of vocal talent. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock and Sacha Baron Cohen all chip in on a ho-hum plot that fails to hit either heartstrings or funnybones. The characters themselves are strong, a well-developed mix of distinct shapes and colorful personalities that would go on to blossom in later installments, but here they're mere saplings at the mercy of a flat, played-out storyline. Even the animation has aged poorly, playing more like a student's demo reel than a multi-million dollar major studio production. It's tempting to give that a pass, given how far technology has come in the ten years since, but Pixar had already released Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo and The Incredibles by this time, and those all hold up wonderfully. An also-ran in all respects, it's got missed potential by the boatloads, but not much more."

","I watched this film with my sister as a part of our Dreamworks Movie Marathon. This is a very middle-of-the road film. It wasn't very funny, it wasn't very engaging, and the characters weren't too interesting. Some laughs here and there, though they were few and far between. The Penguins were more interesting than the main characters. Two things I enjoyed were the art style and the main conflict of the film. The animation felt very angular, which isn't a complaint. The character designs, when paired with the choice of soundtrack (popular songs from the 80s and Louis Armstrong's Wonderful World) gave the movie a character. I also appreciated how the main conflict was between Alex and Marty, and how they maintained their friendship in the midst of change and savagery. Not having a ""bad guy"" in the movie was a great choice. That all being said, this movie is passable at best."

The penguins want to go to the wild and Marty finds he wants to as well. So, thus begins the crazy adventure to the wild.<br/><br/>The film is very memorable in that the story revolves around Alex's and Marty's friendship and how they try to stay friends in hard times.

Its ensemble of recognisable voices add brilliant realism to their characters and makes this film a joy from start to finish.<br/><br/>Madagascar centres on animals living in New York Central Zoo, most of which are striving to something greater than being attractions in a zoo. The animals are Ben Stiller's Alex the lion, who likes his status as king of the zoo, Chris Rock's Marty the zebra, who strives to visit the wild, David Schwimmer's Melman the giraffe, who doesn't really care who he is, Jada Pinkett Smith's Gloria the hippopotamus, who is the mummy of the group, a group of secret agent-like penguins who have been trying to escape the zoo for years and two posh monkeys who enjoy reading newspapers and drinking cups of tea. All these characters have clearly defined characteristics, which, for a kid's animation, is exactly what you want. The penguins are particularly funny. They speak in mafia-like voices, make slick movements and a cool piece of music is played whenever they come on screen. <br/><br/>After escaping from the zoo, the animals are caught by an angry and violent granny in a wonderfully animated Grand Central Station and then put on a boat to be deported. Not wanting to give up hopes, the secret agent penguins begin a brilliant operation to hijack the boat but after a lot of confusion and animals overboard, everyone ends up on the island of Madagascar. Here they encounter over the top and eccentric King Julien of the Lemurs who is suitably voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen. After gaining the lemurs friendship, the animals have to come to terms with their ordeal and try to escape Madagascar.<br/><br/>The film is bursting with unusual and original characters and the animation is both fun and colourful. It is incredibly silly and actually too short (usually today films are too long) as there were definitely more sub-plots the film could have gone into. But Madagascar endless sense of fun will capture children's minds in what is probably the animated film of 2005."

","At Central Park Zoo in New York, Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) hears about the 'wild' from some tunnelling penguins whilst celebrating his tenth birthday. Longing to see the world outside the zoo, Marty runs off to see the sights of the city. Thinking he has escaped for good, Marty's friends Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer), and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) go after him to bring him back. Mistaking their escape for a desperate plea for freedom, the humans at the zoo ship them off to Africa where a series of mishaps sees them washed up on the shore of Madagascar. The island is ran by lemur Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), who labels the newcomers as their saviours after Alex unwittingly chases off a pack of hyenas. Yet with no-one there to feed him his daily steaks, Alex finds his primal instincts begin to take over.<br/><br/>Running at around 82 minutes, I only really watched this film as I was tired and fancied something quick, breezy and amusing to see me off the sleep. Well, it was certainly quick and breezy. Like many other Dreamworks animation films, Madagascar finds its comedy in uninspired slapstick and pop culture references, and here is its biggest problem. While the superior Pixar produces films regularly that both children and adults can thoroughly enjoy (and includes some inspired comedy to boot), I tend not to find Dreamworks output actually funny. Here, films references include the likes of American Beauty (1999), Planet of the Apes (1968) and Chariots of Fire (1981) and come across as a lazy way of not actually writing something intelligent (all the jokes have been done before, and better).<br/><br/>One thing that is always up to scratch with Dreamworks is the animation. It perhaps may not be as beautiful as, say, WALL-E (2008), but Shrek (2001) was a charming mix of fairy-tale and the old-fashioned, while the big, bright colours of Kung Fu Panda (2008) evolved into something far more impressive in its sequel. But in Madagascar, the characters are blocky and charmless, and the backgrounds are often still and empty. The story of a bunch of city-animals trying to make it in the wild is ripe with possibilities, but the film remains relatively un-eventful and builds up to a blink-it-or-you'll-miss-it climax. A major disappointment given the voice talent involved, and is only worth watching for Baron Cohen's semi-improvised, self-worshipping King Julien.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"StevePulaski","7","0","0","8 June 2012"," Has meat, but not in the story
","It is pretty clear to even the most unaware film consumer that there are two different types of animation and they aren't hand drawn and CGI. They are Dreamworks and Pixar, one who makes cute, yet sort of flat animated pictures, and the other who makes essential animated films that are deep and very moving. Madagascar falls in the latter category of being kind and positive in its spirits, but a tad too slapsticky to provide efficient and quality entertainment. It's a feast for the eyes, not the heart.<br/><br/>Yet there truly is nothing wrong with that. Our story takes place at the Central Park Zoo where Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is guaranteed to put on a great show for his audience. He is boisterous, cocky, and determined to keep his high status with the people with his line of trinkets and accessories for sale there. Alex's friends are a zebra, Marty (Chris Rock), a hippo, Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and a giraffe, Melmen (David Schwimmer).<br/><br/>When Marty begins to hunger for life outside of the mundane four cage walls, he escapes to Grand Central Station, only to be followed by his three friends. Once they're apprehended at the station they are taken, crated up, and shipped off to a Kenyan Wildlife preserve. It just so happens that four maniacal penguins escaped from the zoo as well, and take command on the ship hoping to cruise to Antarctica, and during all this camaraderie, the four crates with Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melmen fall off the ship and are washed up onto Madagascar.<br/><br/>That was a mouthful. The only one truly satisfied at this colossal misunderstanding is Marty, who is glad to be in the wild, where he can live free and become a new zebra. The four wind up meeting a colony of furry little critters, all governed by King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) who sings the infectious anthem ""I Like to Move It"" twice in the entire picture.<br/><br/>There is a lot of manic situations in Madagascar, a film that occupies a meager runtime of just seventy-nine minutes, yet in that time a conflict is introduced, characters rapidly appear, havoc occurs, a conclusion is tacked on, and boom, the credits roll. Everything moves in such a rushed pace it's a wonder why the film can't take time to stop and catch its breath. It appears to run out of steam when the animals wash up on the island.<br/><br/>Now here is where we can definitely tell that there are two different animation classes in the mix. If this was a Pixar film, its star power wouldn't be used as a gimmick. Oh, Pixar uses celebrities in their pictures, but ever notice how they don't really boast them? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen lend their voices in all three Toy Story pictures, but they're so natural and unobtrusive that they are never a distracting element. The problem with Madagascar is never do we feel that these characters are themselves. We feel they are Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, and Sacha Baron Cohen, respectively.<br/><br/>Another sign of the two animation teams among us is when we see an animated picture become too reliant on bathroom humor and contrived wittiness rather than sentimentality and storytelling. Madagascar has a nice retro look to it, but that can't disguise its elementary storytelling and the thin effect it has on audience members. Kids will embrace it helpfully, and there parents will too seeing as many more viewings will become inevitable, but with such quality works out there such as Lilo and Stitch, Shrek, and Toy Story why waste time on the inessential?

","This Dreamworks animation isn't a classic of the type their rivals at Pixar seem to churn out however it is entertaining enough and I'm sure children will have a good laugh even if many of the film references will pass them by. The film follows the adventures of four animals from Central Park Zoo; Marty, the zebra, Alex the Lion, Gloria the hippo and Melman the hypochondriac giraffe. As Marty celebrates his tenth birthday he starts to wonder what life in the wild would be like so one day he escapes from the zoo with the intention of going to Connecticut, which has heard is 'the wild'. Upon realising he is gone his three friends leave the zoo with the intention of bringing him back but when they are caught in Grand Central station people assume they all left because they felt they didn't belong in a zoo; in order to give them the freedom it is thought they desire the animals are all put on a ship to Kenya. They don't end up there though as a group of penguins hijack the ship to go to Antarctica; during the hijack our protagonists get washed overboard and find themselves on the island of Madagascar. Here they learn what the wild really means; especially Alex who starts seeing the other animals as tender steaks as he gets hungry. Terrified he might kill one of his friends he heads over to another part of the island... he never wonders where the tender steaks he ate at the zoo came from though! On the island they get to know the native lemurs and come across the lemurs' enemy; the carnivorous fossa.<br/><br/>While I didn't think this was a classic it passed the time well enough and had some funny moments; although unfortunately the best laughs weren't provided by the protagonists but by two chimpanzees and a group of penguins. The story didn't have the depth one finds in Pixar's films but it does have more gags which should keep the children laughing; there are also a few references to classic films for the older viewer to enjoy. For the most part the jokes are of the type one would expect in a film aimed at children however some parents might not appreciate a reference to a rectal thermometer or jokes about 'throwing poo'. Over all I'd say this is a fun film that doesn't outstay its welcome but isn't really a must see."

Ably supported by Ben Stiller (Lion), David Schwimmer (Giraffe) and Jada Pinkett Smith (Hippo) along with Sacha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer, this disparate group of animals at New York Central zoo decide to escape, having no idea what being wild is like, having been cosseted and looked after all their lives.<br/><br/>Their escapade sees them encountering NY's Grand Central station and such and then they (magically) get a ship to Madagascar. Younger kids will love the dancing lemurs and will have them bopping to it enthusiastically. Once in the 'wild', they then only want to escape their 'desert' island and we see them making beacons and rafts, a good nod to many other films. There's also a sideline group of penguins that try to get to the Antarctica, but when they finally get there....For us Brits, rather like the two commentating old gents in the Muppet Show, we have a pair of posh, literary, tea-drinking British monkeys. Alex, the lion's almost permanent fixation with steaks that has him dreaming of, and seeing juicy T-bones in everything he sees, provides good mileage, too.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen as King of the Lemurs doesn't quite work as well, for me, being slightly too OTT.<br/><br/>You can watch Madagascar over and again, the sight gags and one-liners always surprising us. Though I don't have it on DVD, whenever it's on TV, I'll watch it and once seen, you can just dip into it at any point.<br/><br/>Though Madagascar isn't as visually rich and fluent as some other Dreamworks animations the script is a bristling gem, making this a film for all ages."

","Really,this is majestic and very good.This is explaining about friend and affection. At New York's Central Park Zoo, a lion, a zebra, a giraffe, and a hippo are best friends and stars of the show. But when zebra went back to their natural life , the other three break free to look for him, only to find themselves reunited ... on a ship route to Africa. And story started.A lion is Alex, a giraffe is Melman,a zebra is Marty,a hippo is Gloria. When I watched this film ,I liked very much.And rerun rerun,I watched this.The story is interesting. It starts off with 4 thoroughly pampered animals, who live in New York Zoo, who, by the nagging and mistake of the escapist zebra, Marty, end up on a ship bound to Africa! With the help of some meddle penguins, the ship turns to an island instead: Madagascar, where the animals are reunited. The story then shows us how the foursome deal with the sudden change to their lives. Dreamworks could have had a much better film."

","Above all else, Madagascar is just a misfire; something which is surprising given the genre within which it falls into and the company whom produced it. On the heels of 1995's Toy Story, the most influential English-language American film of the last twenty years in both a commercial and technological sense, an array of digitally animated films clocking in at about 85 or-so minutes found their way into cinemas and pretty much across the board ticked enough boxes to keep audiences coming back for more and more. The audience cross-pollination sagged here and there with the likes of the first Shrek, whilst narratively floundering on the odd occasion with the first Ice Age, but were on the whole energised and uplifting films telling simplistic tales and done so with the right politics in mind. 2005 saw the release of Madagascar, a foray into this territory which is tiresome and discentered; clocking in with one of those aforementioned short run-times but feeling longer; a piece unsure as to whether it's got an animal rights message at the core of it or not and not entirely certain as to whether it's a prison 'breakout' movie; a 'castaway' movie or something along the lines of The Wizard of Oz wherein the overlying theme reads something like: ""There's no place like home"".<br/><br/>A common criticism in regards to films such as these often lie with where they actually go in a thematic sense when squared up against where its characters go in a physical one. In this regard, the first two Toy Story films (and the third, years later) barely got beyond that of a neighbourhood block located within the digified universe those films were set, and yet that sense of adventure and character progression was omnipresent. Madagasacar lurches from New York City to the open seas to unpopulated-by-humankind tropical islands run by lemurs; extravagant recreations of the streets of the Big Apple arriving in tow with that of impressive, expansive compositions of waves and the wilds of the ocean roaring around a large container ship. Yet, the film is essentially a lot of running around and shouting by that of voice over talent we feel have been cast based on who they are moreover whether their voices suit the characters they're brining to life.<br/><br/>The film covers an array of animals more commonly associated with the wilds of Africa than that of New York City, and their adventures are here depicted. Initially based at an open plan Central Park zoo, we are quick to associate the supporting acts with an array of what might be perceived as clichéd New Yorker archetypes. There is the David Schwimmer voiced Giraffe Melman, who's paranoid about germs and mental health and strikes us as an anthropomorphic representation of those unshaven, long haired trench-coat wearing middle aged men we often picture babbling to themselves and anyone who'll listen as they shuffle down a public street. There is Jada Pinkett Smith's Hippopotamus Gloria, a larger than life black woman setting (along with Beyoncé Knowles's Foxxy Cleopatra from 2002's second Austin Powers sequel) African-American stereotypes back about twenty years with her hearty, exuberant, jive-talking' cander. On top of these two, there are a handful of monkeys whom best try to capture your more standardised city-set commuters whom intermingle onto subways and such in their coats; hats and with their newspapers sipping coffee from beverages cups and downing donuts since they missed breakfast.<br/><br/>At the core of all of this is that of a friendship between a Lion and a Zebra, Ben Stiller's king of the jungle in Alex and Chris Rock's striped prey-of-said-beast named Marty – only they don't initially know that one is one and the other is indeed t'other. Things kick off with a dream sequence wherein Marty wishes to be out and free and bounding over Savannas away from the pen and public ogling. Where one feels suppressed, the other feels the opposite; Alex is a guy who loves the attention and the praise paying customers heap onto him as he roars and struts and acts out to his audience. Through some events involving the zoo's penguin population, of whom are already concocting their own plan to escape to their indigenous home of Antartica and of whom are the best thing about the film, Marty, with most of the rest of the animals, breakout and land in heaps of trouble following brief integration with the outside world. Events have them shipped back to their natural habitat, but they end up shipwrecked elsewhere in a place which is never sure as to whether it's a Utopian paradise and represents everything Marty wants nor an unnerving Dystopia wherein true colours are brought out in people.<br/><br/>In essence, the central pairing of Marty and Alex grows tiresome; Sacha Baron Cohen pops up as an energetic leader of a group of those previously mentioned lemurs, but sports a misplaced mock-Indian accent and merely sings and dances a lot as everybody else avoids the native hyenas. The film is a confused effort, a film at one point exclusively about a three-way power exchange; at others a cast away movie, yet ultimately a piece which looses sight of its depicting of Marty's lessons on the wider world being a larger, scarier thing not as glamorous as he initially thought. There rears up this tract about realising life always finds a way, and that existence demands thins thing called the 'food chain' in constant operation; a sad, downer tone applied to the harsh realities of life then blown apart by newfound instances of cheating nature by wrapping everything up with a nice, happy ending wherein everyone can co-exist and the hyenas are the villains. It is mostly nonsense, colourful and exuberant nonsense, but nonsense none-the-less."

","Animated movies like this one has supplied both quality for families and audiences alike. The story of a few animals at the Central Park Zoo in New York City takes an interesting turn when they are shipped off to a preserve in Kenya but things don't go according to plan. David Schwimmer's voice as Melman reminds you of his character of Ross on Friends. Melman the Giraffe is neurotic and hypochondriac. Jada Pinket Smith's voice is the hippo. Chris Rock's voice is the Zebra who makes a daring escape in Grand Central Station. Ben Stiller's voice is Alex the Lion who is surprisingly dramatic at the right moments in the film. The animation is first rate with almost realistic looking scenes of the city and the island. The story has some weaknesses but the characters are delightful and the kids will love it."

","No one who has not lived through the oddly un-nuanced 70s and 80s can appreciate exactly how revolutionary ""Madagscar"" truly is. I realized when watching the film with young students how it clashes with the gospel of former decades, according to which nature is good and benevolent and peaceful, (i.e. not unlike communism), whereas civilization is bad and nauseatingly right-wing. And along comes ""Madagascar"". Four animals of wild species - a zebra, a lion, a hippo and a giraffe - escape from a New York Zoo, lured by the romanticized version of a free existence in nature, only to find that nature stinks, that freedom means trying to murder former friends, and, to top it all, the day is saved by some penguins who resemble the US Marines, or, at least, a well-oiled SWAT team. To drive home its point, ""Madagscar"" features a montage of wild-life animals attacking, killing and devouring each other, ironically underscored by Louis Armstrong's ""It's a Wonderful World.""<br/><br/>Nature is violent and relentless, or downright silly (the lemurs).<br/><br/>Goodbye, 68. Hello, reality.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film is wonderfully funny all the way through."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","0","6 July 2010"," For me, it improved at least a bit with a second viewing
","The first time I saw this 2005 DreamWorks Animation effort was in September 2008. I had seen ""The Wild"", a 2006 CGI film from Disney earlier that month, and wasn't that impressed. Knowing it was widely considered a ripoff of ""Madagascar"", I decided I had to see this film, and knowing that it was more popular than its successor, I had higher expectations for it, which were not exactly met. From what I remember, I thought it was only very slightly better than ""The Wild"", and I was hoping it would be higher above the 2006 Disney flick than that. Nearly two years later, I've deleted by previous review of the movie and watched it again. While it still certainly isn't a masterpiece in my book, it definitely was better with a second viewing.<br/><br/>A zebra named Marty, a lion named Alex, a hippopotamus named Gloria, and a giraffe named Melman are four friends who live at the Central Park Zoo in New York City. However, it's Marty's tenth birthday, and he dreams of seeing the wild. After he learns that the zoo's penguins are planning their escape, the zebra decides to leave as well. When his three friends find that he's missing, they leave the zoo and head out to Grand Central Station to catch up with Marty and convince him to return. They make it to their destination and catch up with their friend, but all four of them are soon shot with tranquilizer darts and later wake up to find themselves in wooden crates, not knowing that they are now on a boat, being taken back to the wild! On the voyage, the four animals accidentally fall overboard and are separated, but all of them wash up on the same mysterious shore in their crates! They don't know this at first, but they haven't been sent to another zoo. They are on the island of Madagascar, near the continent of Africa, and life here is more difficult than what they're used to! <br/><br/>The voices of the four lead characters are provided by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and David Schwimmer, and these cast members all do a decent job with the voice-overs. The voice acting in general is very impressive, with comedian Sacha Baron Cohen as King Julien (a lemur in Madagascar), the voices for the military penguins (provided by Tom McGrath, Christopher Knights, Chris Miller, and John Di Maggio), etc. The characters generally may not be the most outstanding ones in the history of animated films, but they can be interesting and provide a lot of humour. The leads can be funny with their conflict and Alex finding himself really craving steak, and so can the penguins on their separate adventure and King Julien, who is entertaining with his really funny lines and his version of ""I Like to Move It"", the hit song by Reel 2 Real. Cohen's talent probably helps. The humour isn't always great, as there are maybe too many sight gags at times, but there are still many funny parts, with not just sight gags but also some very humorous dialogue. As usual, the animation here is outstanding, with the characters and the backgrounds, starting with a very urban setting and then moving to the jungle, with some gorgeous CGI scenery! The plot may be a bit bland, but isn't exactly bad, and several other aspects really help to carry the movie.<br/><br/>When I first watched this movie from DreamWorks Animation, I could certainly understand many would consider ""The Wild"" a ripoff of it. Both films are about animals from a New York zoo going across the ocean to a jungle, where life turns out to be different and more dangerous than what they're used to. They're obviously not EXACTLY the same, but the major similarities are very noticeable. I haven't seen the second of the two since the first time I watched it, but have now seen this one twice, and like I said, my second viewing was definitely better. Since it's been nearly two years since I first and last saw the 2006 Disney film, it's not as easy to compare them, but I think I can understand why this DreamWorks one has wider appeal. I still can't imagine ever being blown away by this one, no matter how many times I watch it, but overall, it's still pretty good, and I recommend it for fans of these CGI family adventures, as long as they don't have a problem with it not being 100% clean."

","Some readers probably (and understandably) grow tired of the Pixar/Dreamworks comparisons that surface alongside a new release from either studio or in a review of one of their films, but I'm sorry to say that I just can't help mentioning it; because to me, Madagascar illustrates perfectly how Dreamworks films can be thoroughly entertaining despite the lack of artistic quality that Pixar gain critical recognition for.<br/><br/>Madagascar is far from being a cinematic masterpiece and it could be argued that the film is nothing short of an exercise in unrealistic, over-the-top slapstick humour; however, in my opinion it's darn funny. The comedy stems from the characters themselves AND the situations they find themselves in, with the result being a feature that rarely takes a break from quick-fire gags throughout its running time. That said, the jokes won't be right up everyone's alley but if you're a fan of pop culture references, sexual innuendo and toilet humour, you'll throughly enjoy it (or the kids will). The voice cast is fantastic, accentuating the laughs and often providing them when their characters simply open their mouths (see Sacha Baron Cohen's 'Julien', who very nearly steals the show as the fun-loving leader of a pack of lemurs). Dreamworks have conceived some fantastic characters here, most notably the penguins who could definitely carry a spin-off. While I am certainly no qualified animation critic, Madagascar is also definitely a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>Critics of Dreamworks may not find anything that will force them to ease off, but those looking for a simple-minded giggle will love it.<br/><br/>9/10"

I actually found the film to be a bit disturbing at times.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer star as Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman, three zoo animals who have no clue what it's like in the real world. So when Marty escapes from the zoo, they go looking for him and are soon locked up in crates. Eventually, they find themselves in Madagascar. Where they release their inner selves. Sort of. <br/><br/>Ill admit that it's not a great film. There are definitely better animated films(Bee movie, Shrek). Trust me, this film ain't no Shrek. Shrek is the best work that Dreamworks has ever done. I can't believe I found Bee movie more amusing than this. But I liked this film. I didn't like when Ben Stiller's character goes on rampage and tries to hunt down other animals because he's obsessed with steaks. I thought it was kind of disturbing.

","Madagascar, another attempt to top Pixar in any way that is possible. And out of all the mediocre animated comedies Dreamworks has handed us...this is the one with the most potential. Aside from the first two ""Shrek"" movies (which actually succeeded in this), Madagascar is the one that didn't quite make it but had the most potential too. Good storyline, lovable characters, good animation, but containing the flaws that other animated films by the company has. Unlike the trailers tell you (explaning the wonder half a million dollar box office world-wide), this film takes a turn for not the better when the last fifty minutes milks the ""Move it, Move it"" tune and carries out the rest of the film using that. But all in all, it is cute movie and worthy of a spot on your shelf."

","Now that the sequel has been out for quite some time, I thought I should see this one just to compare. When this was first released I couldn't have cared less. Talking animals - done a million times, right? Yes, but it is done with smart voice-over work from all involved and great animation that has come a long way from the first PDI/Dreamworks collaboration, Antz.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller scores with a perfect character in line with most of his other screen performances. Alex, the urbanised lion who is comfortable in his sheltered life and think he is pretty hot stuff. He gets a serious wake up call, though when the plot kicks in and he discovers that the world doesn't necessarily revolve around his needs.<br/><br/>Chris Rock is the real revelation, though. His voice works beautifully with the zebra with a yearning for adventure and he proves that he doesn't have to resort to four-letter words to be funny. Big improvement from basically the same restriction he had when hosting the Oscars.<br/><br/>Jada Pinkett Smith is lost in basically doing schtick that wasn't really funny 20 years ago but she is also not served that well of not having a story of her own, as she did in the sequel. And as for David Schwimmer, dead on casting of a neurotic, kind of dopey hypochondriac. He almost out-Woodies, Woody Allen. Not that I am much of a fan of both of them.<br/><br/>Other than the voice talent, the basic premise of tamed animals released in the wild is pretty neat, although once they are there, the movie runs out of steam. The jungle creatures voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer are good for a few chuckles but you wish that the filmmakers had done more than having them be cowardly and manipulative. As for the penguins, they are there merely there to look cute and quote not too clever pop references.<br/><br/>Alex almost giving in to his primal instincts is a pretty clever. If you don't know, lions do eat zebras. Moral dilemma at its most ironic. But you somehow know that it can't lead to anything. After all, this is a PG-rated movie.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Dreamworks/PDI is one of the best in bringing these stories to life but what you are basically left with is an animated movie that doesn't really impress other than die hard movie buffs who think all animation is great."

","There really aren't a lot of movies that can pull off the trick of entertaining both children and their parents, but ""Madagascar"" qualifies as one of them. This story of four Central Park Zoo animals (Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe and Gloria the hippo) who get accidentally stranded in the wild is an absolute delight. Marty, celebrating his 10th birthday at the zoo, dreams of life in the wild, whereas the other three are content with their spoiled existence as the centre of attention for the people who visit the zoo. All four get caught up in an outrageous scheme by the psychotic penguins to escape, and their adventure begins. They all discover that life in the wild has its ups and downs. The group are adopted by the local lemur community, led by the outrageous King Julian - as protectors against the ""foosa"" - who appear to be hyenas. Things begin to go awry when Alex gets hungry and has very limited options to turn to to replace the steaks he loved in Central Park. It's a great deal of fun, offering some pokes at everything from ""Wild Kingdom"" to ""Born Free"" to ""Planet of the Apes"" and several others. A lot of the story I think is over the heads of younger children, who also likely wouldn't recognize most of the stars who offer their voices to the various characters, but that didn't seem to bother my four year old daughter, who found the whole thing hilarious all the way through. 9/10"

","I'd heard some lacklustre reviews and seen the equally so-so ratings here on IMDb (currently only 6.6 out of 10), so I started watching Madagascar with a sense of guilt about my cinematic masochism -- ""I'll probably complain afterwards that this movie was a complete waste of my time, and spend another half hour writing a scathing review on IMDb"". To my delight I found out that I was not driven by masochism but by my keen instinct for good movies, which had lead me directly to the perfect feature-length cartoon! The humour is fresh and surprisingly edgy (though not vulgar), less along the lines of Disney and leaning more towards Tex Avery and Chuck Jones. The animations are amazing. The voicework is also ... amazing (sorry if I'm repeating myself here).<br/><br/>Kids are going to enjoy this one because it's a brightly coloured buddy movie with cuddly animals, but their accompanying adults will love it. The film is brimming with cultural references and doesn't mind taking a little risk for a good joke. For example, there is a couple of suave monkeys, whose intellectual musings invariably lead to the conclusion that they are going to fling poo at people.<br/><br/>Like I said, the voicework is amazing. Chris Rock as Marty the zebra is so good, you kind of start seeing Marty before your mental eye even without the animation. Jada Pinkett Smith as Gloria the hippo is a gem. It's ironic that the actress herself is thin as a stick but succeeds in sounding like the ""ought to watch her weight a little"" Gloria. Gloria is at the same time sexy and motherly and in charge -- she's a whole lotta woman. Why don't I ever get to date hippopotami like that?<br/><br/>OK, towards the end, for about ten minutes, the movie gets a bit sickly-sweet and heavy on morality. Alex the lion discovers that he is really a lion and that life consists of eating other animal which are also cute and furry. He solves this by discovering ... sushi. So maybe you should refrain from informing your children that sushi consists of fish such as Nemo, eaten raw on a bed of soured rice.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you like cartoons, Madagascar is a must-see.

However the whole ideology of going away from the zoo could have been developed better and when on the island, the use of the surroundings could have been used for extra comedy as the humour fades away towards the end, which is quite a big anticlimax and seems very rushed.<br/><br/>Nonetheless the humour is there, and is driven by the different personalities of the animals.

","This film, is not what I expected. In the trailer it looked fun and funny but when I saw the film I thought ""This was not worth the 8 bucks. There were almost no funny parts, and even the great Sacha Baron Cohen is short for laughs. This is the same feeling I got when I saw that film ""Over the Hedge"", it was almost as stupid as this. The only thing that saves this is the animation, because they got really creative with it. They need to learn from ""Shrek"", ""Shark Tale"", ""The Incredibles"" and every 90's Disney film that there are adults in the audience, not just 7 year old kids, and if you're a day over that age you won't find this movie funny at all. So, do yourself a favor, don't spend 8 dollars on a movie that sucks ass cheeks, watch something else."

","This has a lot to offer for ""children of all ages"". Small children will appreciate the animation, visual humour, and the basic story. Those a little older will note the many references to popular culture, art, film and literature which provide more subtle humour. That said, the main story itself is good, but not compelling (animals leave zoo and find it's harder to live in the wild than they thought). In many ways, the story is really about getting the four main characters (who are straight-""men"" for the most part) to points where they meet the really funny background characters. This movie would not have been anything much without the penguins and Julian the Lemur King. (Face it - David Schwimmer is not that funny.) That's what sells the DVD. I expect it will be the same for Madagascar 2. The four main characters are necessary for the story, but you watch it for the penguins, because they are worth the price of admission."

","The first time I heard about this movie was, as I found a trailer on the Shrek DVD. Unless that these Shrek DVD was for Europe, the trailer showed the time of first release (in USA!). So I waited, and waited, and waited - and then they announced Madagascar for Europe. I could see this movie, some weeks later I could buy the DVD, because you can enjoy the movie more than one time. It's funny. The style is a bit unusual, when I compare with Shrek, Jimmy Neutron, Monsters inc. etc. but it works and gives to the movie a special charm. I guess, the makers of ""Madagascar"" are a little inspired by the french cartoon series ""Wild instinct"", because some similarities. It's a movie I can recommend at all, it can impress in cinema and on DVD (and this is not always granted, some movies disappoint outside cinemas)."

It is a blatant sexual retort but one that children probably won't recognize as such. The statement adds nothing to the movie but a momentary chuckle from adults.

Although Stiller, Schwimmer, et al were singled out (naturally, they are the stars), I found that without that loony song and dance lemur the film was rather blah; notwithstanding the parodies and inside jokes. At first,I thought King Julian sounded as if he were imitating Peter Sellers doing the Indian gentleman in, was it ""The Party?"" And then just ran away with it. I also think the animators had a ball with that particular character. It was a wonderful blend of voice and animation.

","Movie review? No--I just want to say this: I LOVE the lemur leader, ""The Original King Julien""!!! For me he steals the show from the moment he appears on screen. I have already loaded his intro song ""I Like To Move It, Move It"" into my iPod and bounce to it on my way to work each morning. He is sooo funny--and cuddly looking too. I want him. OK, at least a collectible doll of him. OK--a little movie review: I saw the movie as a rental on Saturday--purchased the DVD on Sunday. I loved the animation art style--colorful and lively. Great choices in the character voices, and the animators were very effective in marrying the images and the personalities of the actors. Great timing, many LOL moments. And I think the penguins have sitcom potential. A fun family movie including intelligent humor for the grown-ups. Yeah, I'm just a big kid at heart, and ""Madagascar"" is a great place to go to entertain the crumb crusher in me."
"alexandra-25","Null","0","0","11 September 2005"," A cartoon with an emphasis on animation!
","From an artistic perspective the animation in this film is spot on! It especially exudes allot of colour, particularly the primary variety. This is markedly illustrated well in the scenes in Madagascar. It is by putting emphases on the colours of the animals' natural habitat, we as viewers suddenly are made aware of nature and all of its beauty and wonder! This not only serves as a means to prick our conscience over our denigration of the natural environment, but makes us want to live a less man-made lifestyle, so to speak! However, as exemplified by the formally captive animals inadvertent visit to Madagascar, it is very difficult to adapt back to nature,after the supposed pampered Western lifestyle. But of course the Western lifestyle, which by default we humans have been trapped into, is not that much of a pampered one,and has, if not the same, more stresses than those lived in an authentic natural environment. Indeed, the stress lies in the fact that we live in a man-made environment, as opposed to a natural one. Moreover, the natural environment has become almost alien to humans, which in this film have not managed to spoil Madagascar's natural beauty, due to their exclusion from the island. This is noted by the indigenous animals of the island, who it seams hold humans in contempt for their potential to denigrate their natural habitat, as has been illustrated all over the world!<br/><br/>It is fair to say that the writing in this animated film is adequate, but not enthralling! What we see here in this film is a tendency to dilute the story in favour of concentrating on the animation. In this respect the story and plot are secondary to the animation. Ironically, it is by applying the story to it, that undermines and weakens the strength of the animation. I think it would serve Dreamworks well to look at Disney for inspiration. Although the animation produced by Disney was and continues to be paramount,it is nevertheless applied to the plot as opposed to vise versa. A very good example, where the plot has been superbly applied to the animation, as opposed to vise versa is Disney's adaptation of Snow White (1937). In fact this particular adaptation of Snow White should serve as a blue-print for all good animated films.<br/><br/>As to the voice-over acting, it was good. I think David Schwimmer deliberately played the giraffe character as he would Ross in Friends, which it could be said made it work! <br/><br/>On the whole, this is a pleasant family film."

"jpschapira","6","0","0","1 September 2005"," Dreamworks' fall...
","A friend of mine told me she went into ""Madagascar"" expecting something like ""Shrek"". It comes from the same studio, Dreamworks, which has grown over the years. They had a solid start producing films as the beautiful ""Antz"" in computer animation, and excellent wonders as ""The Road to El Dorado"" in 2D. Then came ""Shrek"", their Oscar and it went all above their head over the last three years, where the best animated film they achieved was ""Spirit"".<br/><br/>I don't know exactly what it was, but their animated characters started looking like the stars who recorded their voices and those stars' names where all over the poster, kind of with ""Shark Tale"", or this film ""Madagascar"". It is a good opportunity for actors to display their voice talents (although some of them have them and others don't), but it is not as funny as ""Shrek 2"". It is not as original, and the irony and sarcasm that represented the other films is now gone.<br/><br/>There is not even a sign of the peculiar things; it is all very predictable and the quirkiest characters are penguins (very funny penguins though). When I first heard of the film in Dreamworks web site, it looked wild; now I know it only pretended to be that.<br/><br/>It is a shame one of the film's directors is the one who directed ""Antz"", and what's most shameful is that the main character is voiced by the least talented of the cast in the matter (comedian Ben Stiller). Chris Rock steals the show and seems to be the only one having fun. Jada Pinkett Smith proves, once more, she is very talented, and David Schwimmer delivers a charismatic voice style to the giraffe Melman.<br/><br/>The script is lame, as are the emotive sequences. However, there are some visual sceneries that show that there is still some creativity in the company. I hope the best for the company's next project, and I don't know just what more to say than: ""I like to move it move it, I like to move it move it, I like to move it move it, I like toMove it!"""

They do put in stuff that adults like and kids like (e.g. the ""move it move it"" song) which is the best part. This movie had about 30% adults stuff the kids won't get it. I don't know about your kids, but mine can't handle 2 minutes of movie where they don't get it. Nemo was the perfect balance.

Madagascar came into my hands by pure coincidence. <br/><br/>OK, just to let you know that I'm still new to this. I could place Madagascar as my favorite of those films, though I wasn't purely nuts about any of them (both Shreks were a bit of a disappointment). There are still a few unconvincing things to it like the humor for instance. It seemed slightly too familiar, predictable and boring at times, but at least the characters had some real life in them. <br/><br/>There were also a couple of parts that really didn't seem to fit all well together, especially towards the end with the lion. Oh yes the lion. Now I can kind of understand what some critics meant when they said that Shrek has a lot of adult humor in it.

So, I can't blame them for the content, BUT -- this was marketed as a kid's movie, but they didn't fight to get a G rating. Three things that stand out:<br/><br/>1) ""Well, this sucks!"" Great line, I laughed at it. But, some parents don't want their kids using that word just yet. Meh. 2) Spitting. There is a lot of spitting in this movie, particularly spitting what you drink.

Bad Dreamworks!<br/><br/>All in all, not a horrible flick. Ali G's ""Move It!"" song is very catchy, and my kid was dancing in the aisle.

","This film had it's good and bad parts. On one hand, the plot was predictable, the jokes not particularly funny and the speed of the characters movement gave me a headache (they constantly run around and jump and dance). I did like the characters, although they weren't anything new or interesting. David Schwimmer (as the giraffe) made me laugh, but mainly because I could compare the personality of the giraffe to that of Schwimmer's character Ross in the TV show Friends - both a bit paranoid and very cautious at all times. Ali G (as the lemur king) made me giggle as well when he danced, and I particularly liked the 'wackiness' of his character. The penguins were probably the most enjoyable characters on the film - they were ""psychotic"" (as the lion Alex liked to call them) and I found them very entertaining to watch. The animation in this film was very well done. I noticed in particular the perfection on the water effects (eg by the sea in Madagascar or in Gloria's swimming pool) and Alex's mane (how it moves when he does). I would say this film is enjoyable. It isn't anything new or fantastic, but it did have small moments where it made you smile or laugh. Otherwise it got a bit predictable really. My advice - see if you liked Shrek.

","Madagascar is a passably good cartoon for the little ones.<br/><br/>I found it much, much more entertaining than say the recent film Robots. And the hour and a half during which none of my children spoke, squirmed, wanted more stuff (popcorn or drinks), or needed to go to the bathroom, suggested to me that it succeeds very well at entertaining its target audience. It also had enough adult oriented humour so that I wasn't merely suffering through it (like I suffered through Robots, or Pokiemon the movie, or the Cat in the Hat).<br/><br/>I found some of the other reviewers comments rather amusing... One person suggested not to waste money or time on the movie ""unless you are under the age of 12."" Thats rather funny, because I'm pretty sure that the under 12 set is the intended audience. I get the feeling that some reviewers aren't able to appreciate the movie from the point of view of its target audience.<br/><br/>Many of the best scenes are near the beginning -- the escape by the subway. And the penguins are terrific.<br/><br/>The whole animals thinking and acting like people, was a bit tiresome. But animals acting like animals are rarely seen in movies. Its hard to believe that a lion would forget its predatory nature, just because it gets its fill of steaks.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the contrast between what one dreams about and what one really finds (""this suck"" says one of the penguins looking at the ice bound wastes of Antarica), but I think that could have been played up a bit more -- for example I would like to have seen the Zebra discover that life is not so good in the wild, not just because of a friend turned predator, but for all the other problems involved. I would like to have seen them portray New York more realistically (the crime, pollution, litter etc.). <br/><br/>Objections. There is a really pervasive anti-meat animal rights campaign going on in kids films these days. Sharks that have a 12ve step no-fish program; Vegitarian sharks Lions that eat bugs rather than talking warthogs or meercats the horrible monster ""sharp tooth"" in Land before time<br/><br/>And this conspiracy is certainly not new... Dalmatians that are too precious to be turned into something useful (coats). The tears we shed over the death of Bambi's mother death... etc.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed the movie, the anti meat message was rather annoying.<br/><br/>I suppose I agree with what Ebert said in reviewing the movie that seeing the lion picking his teeth while relaxing on a zebra skin rug would send some kids crying from the theatre.<br/><br/>Not my kids though (boys ages 6, 9 & 12), they would have loved to see that... <br/><br/>but other kids, normal ones (i.e., not my blood thirsty crew), might have been a little disturbed to see the environmentally natural predator / prey relationship explored in a movie.<br/><br/>I give the movie top marks for bringing up the touchy issue, and for the amusing animation of animals turning into steaks (which made me a little hungry), but would criticise them for not following it to its nature conclusion... and instead promoting once again some kind of semi-vegetarianism (I believe some types of vegetarians are allowed to eat fish) reminiscent of the Lion King where bugs were OK to eat."

I don't know, maybe I was just reminded of him too much whenever he spoke but it didn't fit at all and was well out of place.<br/><br/>Aside from that everything was great. We've pretty much seen all of this before in other films like Shrek and Finding Nemo, more of the same you could say, I guess, but you've got to ask yourself, what the hell is wrong with that? :)"

","This film is from the same studio that made the Shrek series. I expected something along those lines going in to see Madagascar. I was wrong. This film is very good. The voices for the four principal characters are all casted perfectly, (Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinckett Smith). One of the problems with the Shrek movies is that there are jokes oriented for younger viewers, and there are jokes oriented for older viewers, therefore, different parts of the audience are laughing at different times. In this movie, the jokes are understandable by everybody.<br/><br/>However, this is a movie that could have been more. The idea is great, but I'm sure different directors would have gone even further with it.<br/><br/>Over all, great."

","When i was first about to enter the theatre, i thought i was getting myself into a movie that will give me a good nap. The only reason i agreed to go see it was because of the high cast that was present in it. As the movie started, i would have to admit that it gave me some laughs, and as the movie went further on, i had even more laughs come upon my face. Then when the movie came to the end, i was sad because i wanted the movie to last longer so i could keep on laughing. The point is that this movie was a great movie for all ages including adults and seniors because the content is wide spread. There is some crude humor spread through the movie, but that is what Madagascar is all about. That is what makes Madagascar different and unique from the other animated movies. You don't really have to think twice about seeing this movie because the only excuse you could have for not seeing this movie is if you are just not interested in animated movies. So go have a good time with your family in Madagascar!"

","Commando-style Penguins, sarcastic monkeys and hilarious one-liners make up the onslaught of humor that come firing at you in Dreamwork's new animated movie, Madagascar.<br/><br/>Surprisingly a loose remake from a 1994 Spanish film of the same name; Madagascar has brought in over 61 million at the box office so far.<br/><br/>Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, Madagascar is a story about four animals that live in the New York City zoo. Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) decides that he has had enough of the repetitive ""Zoo-Life"" and decides to head out on his own to go and see the ""Wild."" His three friends, voiced by Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith search to find their wayward friend only to be captured, deported and shipwrecked on the tropical island of Madagascar.<br/><br/>A movie for all ages? A fun movie for the whole family? Yes, of course, but it is also a great date movie and has more jokes than the little kids will ever get. The group that I went with was all High School students and some of them were laughing so hard they started crying. (or maybe that was me).<br/><br/>Also, Madagascar makes reference to a slew of other films including: 10, Beautiful Mind, The Lion King, Twilight Zone, and The National Geographic Channel.<br/><br/>For me, the best parts were not even from the main characters, the Lemur King, played by Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G) and the lemur baby (Andy Richter) stole the movie hands down. Plus, if you're a Ben Stiller fan this is a great movie as Ben plays Alex the Lion very close to several of his best roles."

","I thought this movie was really great! I liked all the people playing the voices, and the penguins were especially funny. I wish they had more screen time though. Basically the story is about a zebra in a zoo who hears about the wild and naturally wants to check it out, although his animal friends like the zoo. When he escapes and roams the city, animal rights activists send him and his friends (a lion, giraffe, and hippo) along with two monkeys and the penguins to Africa. Their boxes fall off the ship and instead they land in Madagascar and try to survive the wild. This is a movie for the whole family, anyone can see it. I laughed through the whole thing and my kids enjoyed it a ton. I especially loved David Schwimmer as the hypochondriac giraffe. He was very enjoyable. Although I'm not to keen on Ben Stiller playing an animated character, it was a very good movie. Besides a few cheesy lines here and there and the few dull minutes towards the end, it was excellent."

"jeff_dickey","7","0","0","8 June 2005"," It's all about nostalgia
","I went into this film not having seen any of the trailers, only the newspaper ads. I wouldn't have gone into it at all if my longtime movie companion, an adult who seemingly *never* misses any animated children's film, hadn't spent the last two weeks (before 7 June) begging to go see it. Strike one; it has Ben Stiller and Chris Rock in it - celebrity/talent ratio is high. Strike two: the only seats left for the rest of the day (from 2 PM onwards) were in the very front row. Strike three (bearing in mind #2): I had a migraine. In short, I was prepared to spend the next month mercilessly extracting numerous apologies from my companion.<br/><br/>Attitude adjustment began with the theme from 'Born Free' playing past the credits. OK, I thought, this isn't going to be a particularly original film, but let's see how many references the film makes and whether or not any of them actually work.<br/><br/>Then we get introduced to the four 'lead' characters. I'll say this to the others who are (deservedly) panning the leads and praising the bit players: THESE 'LEADS' WERE *MEANT* TO BE UPSTAGED. It is simply inconceivable to me that these were the best/most appropriate actors to voice the characters. Opinions I previously had, mildly favouring Ms Pinkett-Smith and reconfirming my loathing of Mr Stiller, did not improve. I cautiously began to consider not running from the theatre when the name 'Chris Rock' flashes on screen again. David Schwimmer has been added to my list of ""when I want to see something more New York Orthodox than a New York Orthodox"" list. I expect to volunteer to see something of that variety perhaps half as regularly as I win six consecutive California Lotteries.<br/><br/>Nostalgia, my title says. Yep, that's what this film is. Nostalgia for all the movies, comedy routines, and other cultural flotsam that were the origin of nearly every frame of this movie. It was fun to watch at times - not for its own sake, generally, but rather because it brought back memories of the original source of whatever bit is being expropriated at any given time. I know I didn't get all the references; for example, many reviewers cite American Beauty, which I have not yet seen. However, even when I didn't understand the reference, it was almost always clear that SOMETHING was being referenced.<br/><br/>But then, what were the leads there for if not to be upstaged? I personally found King Julian XIII the Lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen/Ali G) to be frightfully overdone rather than over-the-top, he was *necessary*. Cedric the Entertainer as Maurice, the King's batsman/guardian from himself/primary contact with the 'real' world, was spot on - he'd seen it all before, what he hadn't seen, he could figure out, and what he couldn't figure out was a Red Flag that he communicated immediately, succinctly, and hilariously. The Lemurs in general hit the ""Awwwww....soooo *C*u*t*e"" button a little too hard - but you had hopes when their first contact with the ""New York Giants"" (who haven't even been in the Big Apple since the '57 season - talk about nostalgia!).<br/><br/>And, of course, let us not forget the penguins. Kowalski will be instantly familiar to veterans of any number of World War II military-adventure films. Tom McGrath as the Skipper has seen a few dozen too many reruns of The Great Escape (IMDB title tt0057115), and he's no Steve McQueen. But he's not supposed to be; he and his 'men' are here as yet another confirmation of the movie's true maim message: be careful what you wish for, because if you get it, it might well get you.<br/><br/>Would I see it again? Certainly not in the theatre, even on the half-price matinée. I know that there will shortly be a VCD or DVD copy kicking around the house; I'll be expected to watch it once or twice, and may even pop it in the drive myself if I'm feeling particularly bored and want to drive the other housemate (who doubtless would find my remarks here far too mild) completely up the wall.<br/><br/>Hey, that's not a bad idea. Up to 7 stars from the original 5, on its strength as a weapon of mass distraction."

Though as with the typical plushie, the animators continued the tradition of keeping the critters genderless.<br/><br/>The story is fun and has humor for all ages.

","Madagascar features a bunch of animals, a lion, a zebra, a hippo and a giraffe specifically who are well-fed and cared for in a city centre zoo in New York. By day, there are stars of the zoo, performing over-the-top stunts and attracting the crowd. That was until the 10th birthday of Marty the zebra when he decided to do something with his life by living his dream of being back in the wilderness. Inspired by a few escaping penguins, he too left for Central Park station and by some strange twist of fate, all of them landed on Madagascar.<br/><br/>Like Shark Tale, the story borders on being a shallow tale. Some of the scenes like the animals taking the city subway and roaming the streets are just simply incredulous. Dialogs are sometimes banal or slapstick, although I must say the star of the voice overs must be Chris Rock who brings his comedic persona into the character of Marty.<br/><br/>The scene where Marty and Alex meet on the beach after a near-shipwreck set against the Vangeli's Chariots of Fire is simply cheesy while the one with Alex mimicking the famous rose-dropping in American Beauty was top-notch.<br/><br/>In the end, I am not too sure if they are advocating that animals should be kept in captivity so that they don't have to face the adverse conditions of the wilderness or we should celebrate the camaraderie between different spiecesthough the thought of a carnivorous animal thinking twice before savouring its prey in the wild is rather unthinkable. Perhaps you have to decide for yourself.<br/><br/>Well, there's still good - the music in the feature, especially the Ali G remake of Reel to Real's I Like To Movie It, does bring Madagscar out of its doldrums at the right time."

Its all about being a good friend and all that peachy stuff. I even think that it would too kiddy like for a 10 year old. If I have any advice for you it's that if you go to this movie and you are an adult bring something to entertain yourself like a book with a book light. Or please do just wait till it comes out on video and rent it for the kids."
"Shalotka","2","2","5","6 April 2010"," Very unentertaining excuse for a family movie
","I really like animated adventures and comedies. I sometimes even go out them in a company of equally adult people and if not I just wait for the movies to be aired on TV. Since the adult people told me to see ""Madagascar"" because ""thre are lemurs who like to move it, move it"", I watched it.<br/><br/>The first thing that hit me was the general unfriendliness of the movie. It is obviously the fault of Disney that I've got used to really pretty and cuddly animal characters and subtle intelligent dialog and couldn't appreciate the sharp-edged caricatures of animals and forced unfunny slang. Of course I judge the language only by the Polish dubbed version, but I'm sure that if the original dialog were decent, the Polish producers wouldn't provide a translation that sounds neither smart nor polite. I may be speaking a bit too much like a teacher now, but I believe that even the funniest entertainment for children should have some intellectually stimulating element instead of pumping utterly dumb and not even funny ""humor"" into children's heads.<br/><br/>The second major disadvantage is the lack of the plot. The animals escape from the ZOO and arrive at Madagascar. End of the story. There are some obstacles on the way, the famous penguin sub-plot, dancing lemurs and the lion's moral conflict, but all of that together don't really form a story.<br/><br/>Let me analyze now the moral conflict of the lion and explain why I find this movie really disgusting.<br/><br/>Every child, unless brought up by vegans, experiences this moment when he/she fully understands that meat comes from animals and accepts it by the law of nature. Again, Disney brings back the memory of the Lion King's Circle of Life with its deep and almost philosophical message. There must be something meaningful in the movies and stories about talking animals. They can either present the laws of nature (animals act like animals) or serve as an allegory of human society (animals act like people) and a child's mind is perfectly able to work in these two worlds. But the conflict presented in ""Madagascar"" works in neither.<br/><br/>It shows the lion's natural instinct of eating animal flesh as something immoral and sick that can be overcome by friendship, forgiveness and some sort of therapy. Unless that instinct is an allegory of alcoholism or domestic violence, it is all totally wrong. Lions and other carnivores cannot stop eating meat using their good will and it is something children shouldn't be tricked into believing. Of course there are cartoons in which cats and aardvarks go to school and eat apple pie, but then they don't want to eat their neighbors and friends, just like it is common in the human society, excluding concentration camps and planes crashed on the iceberg.<br/><br/>If I were little when I watched ""Madagascar"" the image of a zebra and lemurs turning into steaks would have given me a reason not to sleep at night. And the scene with the lion biting the zebra's butt is not funny at all. I don't know how it was supposed to be humorous in any way, if what he wanted was to feed on his flesh, injure him and probably kill. Maybe some people find it funny just because it was the butt and nothing bad happened after all.<br/><br/>The solution to the lion's moral conflict is eating fish. ""Fish instead of meat"" is an unrealistic change of eating habits in animal world and doesn't represent any consistent ethics in the human society (apart of some religious fasting or some sort of unsaturated fat diet). It may be a sigh of relief for kids who cared about the characters in the movie, but it doesn't help them develop any useful attitude towards real life animals with this false belief that laws of nature can be changed. I can also hear with my mind's ear some vegans arguing that ""a fish has the same right to live as a zebra!"".<br/><br/>But that's all about meat and upbringing. But what people - adults and young ones - liked the most were the penguins and the song. The problem is that when the minor characters steal the show it means the movie wasn't very well constructed. And the song wasn't an original one, it's in fact a well known piece, which by being associated with ""Madagascar"" brought the movie extra popularity.<br/><br/>The swinging lemur, who likes to move it, move it, however, is something very special. Silly and powerful, vain and insane - I'm taking King Julien out of this movie with his bigger crown with a gecko on it to adore him in peace.<br/><br/>Apart from the penguins and King Julien there's absolutely nothing enjoyable in this movie and with its perverted ethics and poor dialog I rate is as unsuitable for the audiences of any age.<br/><br/>1/10 +1 for King Julien."
"bobsteimle","2","2","5","7 July 2005"," Where has all the humor gone?
","Among all the constant bickering between Chris Rock and Ben Stiller, there were two funny lines that actually got me to consider laughing, though I didn't actually do it. Unfortunately, I don't remember what those lines were. I know we're supposed to be impressed by how cute these little animals are with their fancy animation, but they were always either arguing about how hard they have it or singing praises about how great they are. As for being a role model for children, if any of my children acted the way these characters do, I would beat them soundly and send them to bed. And the moral of this story is . . . No matter how good your computer-generated animation is, a bad script will still make a bad movie, regardless of who does the voice-overs. This would be a good movie for children not yet old enough to talk, but I would wait for the DVD."

The responses are somewhat obvious, but not quite enough to make you groan. The humor is rarely rises above a good snicker. The biggest jokes are TV references that go over the heads of the kids. I like a good anachronism as much as the next guy, but it wears thin pretty quickly.<br/><br/>The ultimate conflict arises when one of the star animals has to deny his basic animal nature so as not to upset his anthropomorphic relationship with his animal friends who happen to be of different species.<br/><br/>I'm going to seriously over-intellectualize a kiddie movie here, but I find that treatment hard to follow. I don't have a problem with Sylvester and Tweety, because Sylvester is never asked to be anything but a sentient cat, and he's always fully a cat when he's around people. I can deal with Animal Farm because the animals are really humans in animal suits, and they're always that way. But I have trouble staying in the fantasy when the creator can't quite decide which way he wants to play it. Sentient, speaking animals sometimes behave in a civilized manner, but you can never tell when they are going lapse into being animals again."

Sacha Baren Cohen was hilarious in 'Ali G Indahouse' and should have been given the lead role in my opinion - if he'd have played some sort of similar Ali G character in this setting then the film could have been a great success I believe.

The dialog was out of place for a kids movie and the action sequences were plain old ODD! I took my 5 year old son and he was more than ready to leave before the movie was half over. I can see it's appeal to a bit older kids - silly things, animals getting bumped around, squished by boxes, burps, etc. However, the inappropriateness of the tiki-bar, the shock of skeletons and the almost drug-like detox that the lion experiences is way over most of the kid's head. This one needs to go back to the drawing board, the plot line scrapped and a more kid- friendly story told."

Now looking at the voice cast it seems like a funny film, and don't get me wrong there are some funny moments but they are barely memorable. You know just one-liners about animal antics really. I don't know whether it's just me but I had to force myself to watch the film with my sister who found it dull as well. In fact she had similar thoughts on how the characters were designed, and how ugly they looked. For me this is a great disappointment from Dreamworks Animation, I mean Shrek, Shark Tale, Flushed Away are funny and at the least decent. The jokes I felt were not satisfactory for a cast like that, and the studios who made this film.

","Although nothing innovative, this movie is a decent matinée ticket for an afternoon rental when you've got nothing better to do. It's yet another CGI animated animals' adventure, with the usual name stars doing manic voices for silly characters. It's been done many times before, but this movie does manage to find a few variations to the stock formula. This time out, a bunch of animals in a city zoo learn of a mystical place called ""The Wild,"" and try to escape their sheltered existence for this promised land. Through a series of odd mishaps, they're soon on their way to where the movie's title suggests. <br/><br/>The movie has a few workable sight gags, and the voice talents (especially Chris Rock and Cedrick the Entertainer) seem to be having a lot of fun with their roles. However, the movie's single joke premise does not bear the weight of the movie too well. Everything is predictable, and you find yourself guessing how long it'll be before certain obvious events take place. There are plenty of amusing characters; the penguins are probably the funniest, with the native king's ""Move It"" song a high point too. The animation seems hokey for the main character, but it's not clear if this was intentional as a joke or just lazy artistry. Several portions of the film are too slow for a family movie.<br/><br/>This is not to say the movie isn't fun, because it certainly has its moments, and is good for a fair number of laughs. As CGI films go, the movie runs about the middle of the pack, and serves for one viewing. It's nowhere near the league of a Shrek or Nemo, but, on the other hand, it's superior to some of the recent CGI films that have been churned off an assembly line."

It is a cliff-hanger.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a nice little film. Although I have seen much better computer-animated films, it is still a good film to watch with your family. There are funny moments and I smiled at the pop culture references, by that is it. But I did like the penguins. There were psychotic. They knocked out several humans, they tricked the other animals, and more. Anyway, this is a good little computer-animated film.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: The Wild, and the Lion King."

","A lot of the dialog and musical references will go over the head of the younger viewer. To me, that makes Madagascar a movie that the ENTIRE family can watch and enjoy without embarrassment. In fact, Madagascar isn't as much a ""kid's movie"" as it is a ""grown-up movie"" that kids can watch. The writing is excellent. The animation is spectacular. The facial expressions match the voice inflections perfectly. Madagascar is a cute, sweet, funny movie that is ""adult"" without being vulgar. (I'd rather see something like ""Madagascar"" than ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". I can't believe that I was the only adult who squirmed uncomfortably sitting through movies like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""A Prarie Home Companion"" in the movie theater.

","It's rare that the collective pinhead population of Hollywood can deliver a film that has such great entertainment value and appeal to all ages. This film wins all the way around. The story line, the script, the voice casting and most of all the execution of the animation is all spectacular. It resembles a Marx Brothers movie in that there may be 3 or 4 jokes that come in rapid succession, and you find yourself laughing at the first one so hard that you miss the next two, and only upon seeing the film a few times do you realize that you've missed a lot of great content the first time around. At $11.25 admission for an evening performance (plus sitting through 5 minutes of commercials which I will NOT do)I wait for the rental or DVD if I really want to watch something, 'cause truth be told, most of the Hollywood product just isn't worth it. This film is worth the price of admission, and with Madagascar 2 currently in pre production, can it stand up to the quality of the first? With the genius behind this film, it just may."

","The days of animated films being all sweetness and light have been over for some time, but with fluffy little animals I didn't expect this one to incorporate so much death and violence. Dead people hanging from trees, using a skeleton hand as a sceptre. The other movies lately (about corpse brides and Christmas being associated with dead things, etc.) which purport to be animations for children but which I consider straight out of hell are one thing. But this film is misleading in a lot of ways, seeming to be a cute film for the kiddies but having a lot of rough stuff in it (animals eating other animals, and skeletons, songs about ""ladies shaking it sweet"" or whatever. I would keep any child younger than at least 12 away from this thing.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, I am a New Yorker and the allusions to New York are great.

","Madagascar combines great animation and voice acting to produce one of Dreamworks' best films. It combines physical comedy with sly writing and cultural allusions. The main characters are very well developed and above all likable. We can all see much of ourselves in the attention-loving Alex the Lion or in the wander-lust of Marty the Zebra. David Schwimmer gives a surprisingly understated performance as Melman Menkowitz the seemingly Jewish giraffe (Jewraffe?) who is also a hypochondriac, terrified of germs and the outside world. The New York animals face a shock when they are thrust into the wild of Madagascar.<br/><br/>Other highlights include Ali G's charismatic performance as King Julien of the Lemurs (which includes a hilarious musical performance) as well as director Tom McGrath channeling Phil Hartman as the voice of Skipper the Penguin.<br/><br/>This movie also contains a powerful message about love and friendship allowing us to overcome our baser natures. It should be especially enjoyed by New Yorkers. Dreamworks Animation has consistently produced films which are enjoyable for every age group. I eagerly await Over the Hedge."

","I loved 'Toy Story', but I must confess to having been less than enamoured of most of the computer-animated movies released in its wake, in spite of the acclaim that many of them have gathered. To me, 'A Bugs Life' and 'Antz' were not funny enough, and were further limited by having classical hero-centric narratives; 'Ice Age' had the same problems (and addition, a carelessly assembled plot); 'The Incredibles' was smarter but somewhat right-wing in its underlying ideology. But 'Madagascar' is wonderful, a cartoon full of razor-sharp humour, with just the right degree of self-awareness and a loopily inspired idea at its heart: a lovable New York lion has his instincts reawakened on returning to the wild, and discovers to his horror that he needs to eat his friends! There's a lot of great humour here in the 'Toy Story' vein, in that although there's a fantastical premise (based on anthropomorphised beings), given that premise, everything that follows makes perfect sense. To give away just one of the jokes that demonstrates how clever the script is, the animals (while still in the zoo) turn off the background jungle ambiance in order to get a good night's sleep; and as the birdsong fades, we hear instead the real background ambiance of the big city (i.e police sirens!) Maybe the script is even a little too witty for kids. For this big kid, however, it was a treat."

","OK Here are my problems with this movie. Jada-Pinkett proves in this movie that not everyone is cut out for voice over work. Neither is David Schwimmer. Also, why was Cedric the Entertainer casted? Obviously the studio's mentality of thinking was corrupt when casting this movie, with the only good ones really being Sacha Cohen and Chris Rock, which have the only characters that can really be connected with. What they should have done was scrapped the whole 'animals going to Madagascar' thing, and just stuck with the penguins. So, if you're bored, and stuff like Antz and Shark Tale isn't BAD enough for you, head over to your local Lackluster store, rent this, and write your own review here, and let the rest of the world know how much this thing stinks; unless of course, your mind is like the rest of the people who 'praise' this movie, and have a child's mind trapped inside an adult body.

Marty gets out of the zoo and all 3 of his friends follow him into the streets of the city - and are caught by the humans in the main lobby of Grand Central Station (""It's grand, and it's central."" - yawn).<br/><br/>They eventually get there, have some adventures, and have to make a decision. 8/10<br/><br/>-Zafoid<br/><br/>PS: the characters they meet in the wild are far more interesting and I kept wanting to see one of them, King Julien (voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen (of ""Da' Ali G' Show - who is brilliant) dominate the entire movie.

"patrick_dunne","6","1","2","20 January 2006"," You seen one, and you've seen them all.
","You've probably seen many of DreamWorks films before, such as Shrek, Ice Age and Shark Tale. If you've seen those, than you have seen this. Even if you haven't watched it yet, you already have ""seen it."" Why? The answer is simple. Madagascar seems to be similar to just about every other DreamWorks film. I'll explain.<br/><br/>The film starts out loud, lively and colorful. That is the beginning of nearly every DreamWorks film. Then, we are introduced to the characters: Marty, Alex, Melman and Gloria. Alex is a loud, obnoxious and self-centered lion, and that seems to resemble Donkey from Shrek. Melman is a giraffe who is sick, just about all the time. Gloria is a hippo who seems like the stereotype of a character that Whoopi Goldberg always plays. Lastly, Marty is a zebra who wishes of escaping.<br/><br/>One day, something happens with the penguins trying to escape. Then, something else happens when the animals board a ship, and it crashes onto Madagascar. I think I forgot most of that segment, but whatever. Anyways, the four find themselves on an island with lemurs and other primates.<br/><br/>So, back to what I was saying. It's a film that starts out lively and colorful. The characters have celebrity voice talents. The film is an adventure film. Near the middle, two of the characters don't trust each other. The ending is predictable. The film has many, many references to other movies.<br/><br/>An adventure film with two characters who mistrust each other was an idea that has been used for Shrek, Ice Age and Shark Tale. (Except, Shark Tale isn't adventure.) So, Madagascar ends up looking like a forgettable DreamWorks film that was copied from the above three. Plus the moment of drama was used many times before this in other computer animated films, including ""Toy Story.""<br/><br/>Also, the jokes simply aren't too funny. Well, the film does have a couple decent laughs, but not too many to redeem itself.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>Good: Lively and (oftentimes) funny due to the animation and voices <br/><br/>Bad: Seems to be ripped-off of other DreamWorks films<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

","Cute, but slow. The interesting characters were the penguins and Julien the Lemur King. The main premise just wasn't that interesting. Picking Ben Stiller as a lead voice was a bad move. He's just not that funny as a voice. Chris Rock and Sacha Baron Cohen really come across as voice-overs, but the others not so much so. I think that Cedric the Entertainer was wasted on a minor part. He should have been the lion.<br/><br/>The three penguins stole the movie. I kept wishing for more songs with that East Indian Lemur funk and MORE penguins. They should have their own film as a sequel/spin off.<br/><br/>The digital animation was quite good, but the screenplay and the gags weren't on the level of ""Toy Story"" or other Pixar films.

","DreamWorks creates another animated feature that has very little story and ultimately very little resolution. I would place this movie well below Shrek, but significantly above the annoying ""Shark Tale."" The characters in this movie are very likable, although Chris Rock's zebra occasionally gets annoying. I found Ben Stiller's work to be very funny. The most unique and hilarious character is Julian, the king of the Lemurs. His off-the-wall strange comments add a lot to the movie. The penguins were also great additions.<br/><br/>The plot itself is very thin. The animals escape the Central Park Zoo to see the ""wild."" There are a lot of New Yorker jokes, and even a crack at Jersey. Occasionally there will be segments that are nothing but back-to-back gags with songs in the background. They would be more tolerable, perhaps, if the gags were actually funny. The abundance of gag-to-songs made me want to stuff my ears with popcorn (I was eating popcorn at the time).<br/><br/>An optimist would call the animation zany. It is angular in nature, very bright, and has very little shading. Unlike ""Finding Nemo,"" there is little realism to the characters (which may be a good or bad thing).<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie has little to offer except the occasional gag."

","I was not that interested in seeing this latest animated DreamWorks concoction until I saw an 11-minute short, ""A Christmas Caper"" just before the wondrous Wallace and Gromit feature, ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". In expertly rendered computer animation, it starred four physically adroit penguins who not coincidentally steal the feature-length film from which they originate. At 86 minutes, ""Madagascar"" has several entertaining scenes, brightly colored images and a kinetic pace that doesn't flag, but somehow the film falls short of the Pixar features to which the creators seem to aspire. A lot of it has to do with co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath trying too hard and co-screenwriters Mark Burton and Billy Frolick cramming a lot of story within its comparatively brief running time. They provide some sharp lines and winking references to other movies, but the movie lacks an ironic punch that would have made it truly memorable.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on two animals, best friends in spite of their different species - a curiously dissatisfied zebra named Marty, who dreams of what life must be like outside his admittedly comfortable digs at the Central Park Zoo in New York, and an egocentric lion named Alex, who enjoys the limelight at the zoo but comes to terms with his natural tendencies amid the wilds of the jungle. It is both a blessing and a curse to have Chris Rock and Ben Stiller provide the voices for Marty and Alex respectively. While they provide some expectedly funny moments, their motor-mouthed presence makes the film pretty exhausting to sit through without fidgeting, especially as Rock seems to be imitating Eddie Murphy's Donkey in the ""Shrek"" series. Neither seems to be directed to develop characters but rather magnify their personalities. Faring marginally better on the sidelines are Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria, the no-nonsense hippopotamus, and David Schwimmer in Ross Geller overdrive as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe.<br/><br/>Once the setting moves to the Rousseau-like tableaux of Madagascar, the movie improves considerably with the addition of comical lemurs in thrall of the crate-wrecked visitors - Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G, plays the hilariously despotic King Julien XIII with a heavy dollop of Indian curry, Cedric the Entertainer is the put-upon Maurice and Andy Richter makes the saucer-eyed Mort sound like the first cousin of a Spielberg gremlin. There is even a nod to the actual ""Born Free"" movie not only in the use of the theme song in the opening but in a relatively somber sequence that has Alex coming back to his natural tendencies among the feared fossas to the increasing fear of his lifelong friends. But the movie's brightest spots are provided by the four penguins (voiced by members of the crew) and two erudite monkeys who are used mostly as transitional cues in the story.<br/><br/>The DVD has a fairly standard set of extras, though I liked the alternate audio commentary track provided by the penguins. The deleted scenes, ""Mad Mishaps"", are fairly incompressible for their deletion other than the fact that they aren't in finished form, and ""The Tech of Madagascar"" is quite dry as is usual for seeing the mechanics behind computer animation. For the kids, there is the video for the inescapable ""I Like to Move It, Move It"" song by the lemurs and video games galore, as well as ""Enchanted Island"", a genuine educational featurette on the real Madagascar."

If you have the type of imagination that digs commando penguins who have a plan and know how to execute it then you must see this movie.<br/><br/>The characters were not your typical animated fair; there was a sophisticated subtext to the primary characters. For example I greatly enjoyed that Chris Rock played a zebra who couldn't decide if he was a black zebra with white stripes or a white zebra with black stripes. The penguins are the most memorable film characters I've seen in years (which either says that movies of late have been exceptionally dull or the movie's creators scored on the break away with these characters  I'm going with both). The dialogue is well crafted and works on many levels. I'm still quoting the movie and I saw it shortly after its theatrical release. I cannot say the same of Shrek (which was good) or any other recent animated film (or live action for that matter). The art work is stylish and beautiful. And the penguins. Did I mention the penguins?? If you don't see the funny in anthropomorphized animals then likely this movie is not for you, but if the thought of a zebra checking out a woman in a zebra striped top to the music of the Bee Gees tickles your funny bone, you'll enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Two flippers up, way up.<br/><br/>P.S.

Also the rocky boundary between the east part of Madagascar and the west is real and the reason the lemurs have survived in such variety. The east is rain forest and the west is populated by humans since it is arable. I don't know about the Fossas though. Are they a real species? They resembled hyenas or wild dogs in their behavior. The transition from zoo animal to wild was great in the way Alex the lion was portrayed. The voice of the head penguin reminded me of Danny DeVito, but he isn't listed in the credits."

","I must admit to not being a fan of the Dreamworks animations. They don't look particularly inventive, the voice talent is often at best distracting, or at worst, poor, and the stories are very sparse.<br/><br/>Madagascar really is no exception to the rule. We first meet the heroes of the film - the animals - at the New York Zoo. Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is a zebra bored with captivity and longing for the freedom of the wild. Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) is a vain yet cowardly lion, happy to pose for the public in his cage, and so full of himself that he buys Marty little icons of himself as birthday presents. Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac giraffe, while Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) is an earth momma, keeping her pals in check.<br/><br/>There is a also a small mafia of penguins in the zoo who want to go to Antarctica. These are funny and inventive characters, but a little at odds with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>This film has its moments - the animals going on the subway to Grand Central Station; the squirrels and chipmunks who rule the island of Madagascar (the wild Marty is so keen on); and the film and TV references - Hawaii Five O, Born Free, Chariots of Fire, American Beauty, and more.<br/><br/>But the characters are two-dimensional, the script is needlessly childish (yes, I know it is for kids, but give them some credit for having brains), and the film is pretty pointless, other than the same old 'you've got a friend' theme that pervades almost every film from the studio. The voice talent is just OK (and Ben Stiller in particular makes Alex irritating) and the animation is boring.<br/><br/>Not one I'd rush to see again."
"philip_vanderveken","8","1","2","22 July 2005"," Maybe not the most original animated movie, but I still liked it a lot
","I've got several animated movies in my private DVD collection, even though I'm no longer a kid. And yes, I always buy them for myself, since I don't have any children (and not planning on having one soon either) or a younger brother or sister. On the other hand, I must also say that I have a rather specific taste. I don't really like the average Disney fairy tale-like movies. I prefer movies like Ice Age, Shrek, The Incredibles,... in which some fine animation is combined with excellent humor. After seeing the trailer for this movie, I was really curious about it. Would it be for children only, or would an adult like me also be able to enjoy it? <br/><br/>""Madagascar"" tells the story of four animals at New York's Central Park Zoo who have lived there all their lives, don't know what life in the wild is like and don't want to know it either... except for Marty the Zebra. When he breaks out of his cage and makes a trip through the center of New York City, his friends Alex the Lion, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo go after him to get him back. But the humans think that the four escaped because they wanted to go back to the wild and that's why they are put on a boat and sent to a wild reserve in Kenia. However, when their ship is hijacked and their boxes are accidentally thrown over board, they end up on a desolate island where they will experience what life in the wild can be like and how much it differs from what they have known all their lives...<br/><br/>Although this movie isn't perfect - especially the last part didn't always do it for me - I must say that I had a good time watching it. The animations for instance are excellent. I like the way the animals look (even though they may perhaps not be as 'perfect' as what you might see when Pixar had made them) and the surroundings are marvelous (New York city, as well as the island). I guess it is just a matter of taste, but in my opinion you can't really compare the different styles of animation. Disney differs from Pixar and Pixar is different when you compare it to Dreamworks. What's wrong with that? If all the animations looked the same, everybody would complain and say that they never try to create their own style and are only copying what works.<br/><br/>Next to the animation, I also liked the diversity in the characters. Take for instance Alex. He's the star of the Zoo and he knows it, while Melman is a hypochondriac who always feels sick and Gloria is a huge hippo who clearly doesn't mind about her size. I even liked Marty the zebra, always craving for attention, but not seen as interesting enough by the audience. And those four characters are also joined by some very good sidekicks. Take for instance the penguins who acted like military commando's or the monkeys who act like they have a lot of style, but still do what any other monkey would do. I really liked the diversity in characters and had several good laughs with each of them.<br/><br/>When I read the reviews from other viewers, I sometimes can't help smiling. The main reason for that is because some people seem to forget that this is just an animated movie, not a documentary. If you really want to see how these animals live and act, don't you think it would be better that you watch the National Geographic Channel, go to a zoo or go on a safari? I'm sometimes asking myself: Do they think the same about Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote? Or do they really believe that a coyote knows how to work with dynamite and can fall of a 1000 ft. cliff without dying? This is still an animated comedy so I don't care whether the animals look truthful or not (by the way: have you ever seen a monster like Shrek or a talking donkey in real life? I haven't, but that doesn't mean that I can't like them). The same for their comments on the humor or the - in their opinion - lack of it. They believe that the humor in the movie was only good for kids. I'm sorry, but I see that as an insult. I'm an intelligent 27-year old with two college degrees, but I'm still able to laugh with those 'stupid' and 'childish' jokes and the situation humor like for instance Alex falling in a field of cacti. When they see it in a Charlie Chaplin movie or ""Road Runner"", they say it is excellent, but when it is done in an animated movie about some zoo-animals, they no-longer like it. Make up your mind people... <br/><br/>All in all this is a movie that will not only appeal to children. The mature audience - it doesn't matter if they go watch it on their own or with kids - will have a good time with it as well. Next to a lot of situation humor, you will also get some fine references to well-known movies, which your children will probably not connect to another movie, but love anyway. My favorite reference was the ""American Beaty""-scene in which Alex sees steaks falling out of the sky instead of rose leaves. Even though the end wasn't as strong as the biggest part of the movie, I still loved this movie enough to give it a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10. And if that means that I'm an immature man, so be it..."

","I actually missed the first couple of minutes of this but picked up the story well enough anyway. Animals from New York zoo, due to a zebra wishing to broaden his horizons, end up on the island of Madagascar. They're obviously new to the wild and must discover themselves and find out who and what they are, which is also what the native lemurs are wondering as they regard the new arrivals with an eye to their own problems. Needless to say, adventure ensues and the audience is taken for a good ride. The use of colour is excellent with bright and vibrant primary colours to the fore. This bold presentation grabs even children's attentions. All the animals are well voiced and there are no truly scary scenes like, say, The Lion King. While the main characters bring the story along the surprise stars of the show are, for me, the barely-used penguins who get all the best lines. Not as good as Shrek or Toy Story (1 & 2), but I enjoyed it more than say The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. Great all round family movie with plenty for the grown-ups as well as the kids."

","I highly recommend this film. Normally Ben Stiller's live action, poor schmuck films leave me looking at my watch waiting for the film to end, but this was wonderfully done. I am a 3D computer animator and I was wowed (the sea water fluid dynamics in particular). The four others that saw it with me (not in the business) loved it as well. The penguins and Ali G as the king of the Lemurs pretty much stole the show. The storyline is good if not a bit simple, but it didn't need to be Pixar's standard introspective plot of ""lost characters finding their way back home or to a new life/purpose"". That is not to berate Pixar. They understand story and animation. I think that this film rates up there with Shrek, but don't expect the same style of humor or animation. The motions of the characters were exceptional and fluid much like the rubbery torsos designs of Tex Avery's animated films from the 1940's. Comedies tend to be subjective to ones mood at the time that one sees the film. Going in expecting a Shrek or Pixar clone (as wonderful as they are), you will be disappointed. Go in fresh, looking at it for its own merits. I still think about scenes several days later, not for the ""That is so stupid, why didn't they just ---"" factor. We loved it and I plan on buying it on DVD when it is released."

","This was a funny movie. It wasn't great... it was no Nemo... But it was funny. It was a tad lacking in the plot. But the one liners were great. As a bunch of little skits it worked really well... but all together there was something missing. The Penguins were GREAT! They should have their own shorter length movie (even they would probably not be able to hold a 2 hr movie). But something like ""The Penguins take Bermuda"" or something... or maybe a 007 rip-off with the penguins. That would be cool. Each of the characters were pretty funny too. Except for the lion. He was kind of not that funny. Maybe it is because of Ben Stiller. Getting sick of the same IL' character from him too... and it is sad that it even comes through on an animated movie. Yikes!"

","Dreamworks has lost what they had with the Shrek movies. That is the charm and fun that they had. This film is a dry film with nothing really to show for it. Madagascar takes place in Manhatten where our main characters are. Alex, a ridiculous looking friendly lion is shown doing some lame show in the beginning. The jokes are just awful in this film. I maybe laughed once during this film which is sad considering this is supposed to be a comedy animated film. Chris rock who I expect to be really funny is not here and I recommend people to see the other film he is in over this one. The other characters are even lamer such as a boring hippo girl Gloria and a dumb Giraffe named Melvin. This giraffe even thought when he got to the wild that he was in San Diego. Hello, its really obvious that is not San Diego. The idea of penguins taking over a ship going to Antarctica and then wanting to leave is just absurd. It's A Wonderful World has been used in way too many movies but yet again its in this film and this film isn't even worthy enough to have this song. I feel sorry for Louis Armstrong in that respect.<br/><br/>Pros Of This Film<br/><br/>-length (its over quick so I don't have to suffer anymore)<br/><br/>-not as bad as Dreamwork's last film although that really doesn't say much. <br/><br/>-good animation<br/><br/>Cons of This Film<br/><br/>-lack of a good plot<br/><br/>-terrible ending<br/><br/>-lame characters<br/><br/>-loses its direction<br/><br/>-not very funny<br/><br/>Bottomline: Don't Waste Your Money on this at the theater if you haven't seen it just wait for it to come out on DVD instead for a rental or wait for it to air on TV."

"MaryPoppins89","4","1","2","11 June 2005"," Typical DreamWorks...nothing ingenious
","OK, from the previews I saw for the film, I expected it to be amusing. Though I'm a steadfast and true Disney fan, I decided to see Madagascar with an open mind towards DreamWorks. So, I went with my family to the movie. Wow, the entire time, classic scenes from Disney films were flashing through my mind as I watched Madagascar. Here are a few of the notable similarities/blatant copies of Disney: the scenes where the lion has dreams while he is tranquilized and when he dreams about steak are so very similar to the classic scene ""Pink Elephants"" scene in Dumbo. Probably the most blatant steal from Disney is when the lion becomes an actual lion and not a ""show-lion."" His eyes change from cartoon eyes to natural lion eyes. Where have we seen this before? Oh, yes, Finding Nemo. Remember when Bruce the shark smells the blood and becomes a wild great white shark again? Yes, I specifically remember sitting in a theater, watching Finding Nemo, feeling very impressed with the idea of using eyes to show the transformation from tame to wild. When I saw that DreamWorks had used this in Madagascar, I became very unhappy.<br/><br/>Madagascar is not without it's redeeming factors, however. Namely, the penguins. The penguins were truly the best part of the entire film. First of all, penguins are awesome animals, and Disney realized this. (See Mary Poppins for the ultimate collection of dancing penguins.) There were moments in Madagascar where there was no dialogue, but there was just a few penguins walking around. The audience was cracking up at the penguins just walking around.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Madagascar was horribly over-advertised, and it turned out to steal most itself from Disney films, like most of the other DreamWorks films. However, the penguins were great."

","We were pleasantly surprised by this movie. Having read several negative reviews of Madagascar, our expectations were low, but our nine-year-old wanted to see it, and we did. I have nothing negative to say about this movie. The primary characters are not exactly ""cute"" cartoon animals, but in the end this may improve the effect of the show.<br/><br/>For adults, there were ""inside"" references to current TV personalities and other movies' themes. For sci-fi fans, the title of a book that appears VERY briefly was a treat. For kids, the action was quick and the plot moved along rapidly, but smoothly. A very big positive was that the movie is about as understated as a cartoon can be. Gags are not allowed to become overly long and drawn out, but are played for a quick laugh that moves the plot forward. The result is a short running time and interesting story that is within the attention span of younger kids, but entertaining to adults as well.<br/><br/>Technically, the animation was much closer to the Shrek end of the spectrum than to Hanna-Barbera. Very good.<br/><br/>I believe that Madagascar is a movie that exactly hits the targets its creators aimed at."

","My husband and I just took the kids (2 boys ages 7 and 4) to see this movie and we had a very fun time. I do not think you can rank this movie with the kinds of entertainment coming out of Pixar, but Madagascar has a lot to offer. The story was a little weak, but the quality of the animation was very impressive. The scenes of New York and Madgascar were very intricate in their detail and gave the movie a lot of atmosphere. The kids enjoyed the characters which were voiced very well by various celebrities. We particularly enjoyed the scenes with the penguins, who pretty much steal the movie. Lemurs were very cute also. This movie is not ""Finding Nemo"", but our family had a very nice afternoon and it is a high quality movie for kids. Have fun!"

Hackneyed characterizations of the hypochondriac as giraffe, the girl with an attitude from the inner city as hippo, the relentless egotistical maniac as lion and his thinking man's friend zebra along with the stupid upper-crust couple of monkeys were almost excruciating. Not to mention the good-fella penguins. When the road-trip began, I was able to wake up again. The absolute star of this show is Julian, the King and if you make it to his opening scene, you will finally be rewarded.

I love Chris Rock and Ali G, but I resented the wisecracks aimed at the adults and found little of value for children. I certainly would not bring my grandchildren to this. The ironic use of themes from ""Born Free"" and ""Chariots of Fire"" only underscored how trivial this movie is compared to the stories being parodied in the music. And what are we left with? Friends stick together? There's no place like home, even if it's a sterile cage? Growling loud and batting smaller creatures defenseless brings ""peace"" to a society?

Such good talent wasted in a very mediocre movie.The jokes are lame, the plot is dumb, and none of the main characters are funny. Only the penguins got a chuckle out of me and that was it.

","Good God! Is this the future of family films? After watching the trailer countless times at the theaters earlier this year, my nephew and I decided to see this film. The idea of penguins escaping from the zoo terrorizing New York City seemed to be kind of funny. Of course our heroes from the zoo, Lion, Hippo, Giraffe and Zebra saving the day would be a bit of mindless fluff. Where did I get the idea the penguins were the antagonists? The trailer! Sadly, the trailer is the funniest part of the film. And Dreamworks sure knows how to pack them in with their special brand of trailers. They show all the best parts of the first fifteen minutes, and leave you in the lurch when you find out...The penguins are only featured for less than five minutes! What's the plot? Well, the Zebra wants to live out in the wild. He gets his chance when he follows an escape route created by the penguins (Remember them?) The Lion, The Hippo and the Giraffe follow the zebra to bring him back home. That's the first fifteen minutes or so of the film. The quartet are captured as well as the penguins by enforcement officials, and sent on a boat trip elsewhere. The penguins cause an attack, and due to the the penguins attack, the Lion, Hippo, Zebra and Giraffe land on a deserted island. And I'm stopping right there. Wouldn't it be nice if the trailer easily explained what the film was about? I guess if they did, nobody would see it!"

I was 12 years old when I saw this movie and even then, I was absolutely disappointed. How can they waste such a great cast and have them participate in this awful movie? This animated film truly had potential, but they ruined it with its unimaginative script, dull characters, and completely predictable story.

I also like how you could almost see the actor's faces in the characters, especially Ben Stiller in Alex. The facial expressions were all Ben. I laughed at the Planet of the Apes reference. That was great. They did another one that I didn't even catch the first time, but when Alex is chasing Marty, they play the Wild Kingdom music and it almost looked like an old clip from that show.

","Please watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" by Darren Aronofsky (2000) before you watch ""Madagascar"" (or parallel or as you like). You will probably instantly notice, that the character of Alex the lion is a shockingly exact citation of the LSD-addicted Sara Goldfarb (played by Ellen Burstyn), who has an eating disorder. Even some shots - the fragmented eating scene right at the beginning of ""Madagascar"", for instance - are done exactly the same way. Knowing that, it's not funny at all to watch ""Madagascar"" - it's shocking. Even though, Alex the lion does not end up in a hospital... How irresponsible can one be to do this in a children's movie???"
"caswingle_do","4","1","3","29 January 2006"," Nothing spectacular
","This movie proves without a doubt that when it comes to the world of CGI movies, there is Pixar and then there is a whole lotta non-Pixar. Guess which is better.<br/><br/>The whole ""humor for the adults"" consisted of a slew of over-the-top pop culture references to American Beauty, Planet of the Apes, Twilight Zone, etc. If an animated Pauly Shore popped out and said ""remember when Charlton Heston saw the state of liberty blown up? This is totally like that! Huh huh!"" it could not have been more obnoxious. Apparently any original jokes were far too taxing for the writers' imaginations; hamming it up with retreads had to do. Also, thank you (the writers) so much for reminding the audience that the animals lived in New York every five minutes. Those of us west of the Hudson River really don't give a rat's rear end. Thanks again for trying out the whole 'irony' thing by juxtaposing one of the most beautiful songs ever (Louie Armstrong singing What A Wonderful World) with scenes of nature's brutality. Its been done before and by people more talented than you. I'll send you the therapist's bill for my 4 year old daughter after the bloodthirsty crocodile swallowed the adorable little ducky whole. Next time, I'll rent something less traumatizing for her... like Saving Private Ryan or Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>The animation was average. Alex (the lion) had a mane that stayed the same basic geometric shape for the whole movie, defying weather, newtonian physics and all known hair care products. Contrast this with the 2.5 million individually rendered hairs of Sully's body in Monsters, Inc. There wasn't a whole lot of attention to detail, but at least the lemurs were somewhat cute.<br/><br/>There are some positives: the thought of paramilitary penguins is hysterical to me and the hapless, sickeningly cute, big-eyed lemur that Alex initially terrifies makes for some good comic relief. Now if I can only get that ""I like to move it, move it!!"" song out of my head..."
"tricksixxx","5","1","3","17 January 2006"," So much potential lost
","The premise for this movie is outstanding. From watching the previews and reading the plot, I thought this was going to be another Shrek of the animation world. Sadly enough, my expectations were shot down pretty quickly. Though the voice acting in Madagascar are well-done, the story never takes off. If they are thinking big name voices are enough to carry an animated film, they are sadly mistaken. Not only did the animation seem low-end, but the only funny moments in it children won't even understand (unless you've let your 6 year old child watch American Beauty). The whole focus of the story with Alex realizing his true instincts as a lion is to prey on his friends is totally underminded for other not-so-interesting aspects of the story. The abrupt and hole leaving ending was anything but satisfying. It was like instead of trying to make a good film, the actors were trying to see who could make their voices better than the other. What a letdown man, I can't believe I spent 4 bucks to rent this off pay-per-view. The only reason this movie gets the score it does is because of 3 things: The good voice-overs, the criminal penguins, and the poor helpless little animal that is constantly frightened (that thing was adorable, and didn't get enough play). 5/10"

","I won't deny it that ""Madagascar"" is a fun movie to watch, which is mainly thanks to the characters that are in it but it isn't exactly a very memorable movie with some genius comical moments in it.<br/><br/>It is mainly because of the story that this movie isn't one of the best animated movie, of the last couple of years. The story is very flat and it lacks a good clear main plot line. The movie is basically heading nowhere and I can imaging that most children will be bored at times while watching this movie. Most of the (good) jokes in the movie are the kind of jokes only adults will understand.<br/><br/>The four main characters are really good and they all have some good chemistry on screen. They are all perfectly voiced by actors who really fitted the characters. But especially fun are the characters who play small parts in the movie such as the 2 monkeys, the penguins and the lemurs.<br/><br/>The movie is fast paced and is mostly filled with the characters jumping and running quick on the screen. Is that fun and good enough to fill a whole movie with? I don't think so. The movie is fast but nothing ever is really happening.

"soymilk","4","1","3","12 August 2005"," Visually stylish, repulsively stylised
","It's hard to say just which demographic group this exceedingly charmless film is meant to appeal to exactly  too childish and witless to find much favour with the adult crowd who snapped up 'Toy Story', 'Shrek' and 'the Incredibles' so readily, while crammed with far too many in-jokes and cultural references which the majority of under-10s probably aren't going to understand, 'Madagascar' comes off instead as a half-baked ploy to appease both target audiences in a way that only caused the two of them to cancel each other out. Not even the vivid visual gloss and likable animation can disguise the fact that this is an inferior product on both counts. There isn't a plot beyond the premise, the story never develops into anything more than a rabble of mildly diverting sketches, and only two of the major characters (which include a big-headed lion, an energetic zebra, a neurotic giraffe and a female hippo with no especially outstanding personality traits  she's just there to be the token female in this otherwise male-dominated affair) actually do anything to justify their presence in the long run. It opens, fuddles around for 80-odd minutes, and then ends just as abruptly as it began, in what easily scores as one of the weakest and most outright inconclusive closings I've ever come across (in the split seconds between the film stopping and the end-credits starting, I could have sworn that the theatre's projector had blacked out). In the end, it doesn't amount to a great deal more than a colourful, sharply-animated shaggy dog story  easy on the vision, but rambling and inconsequential, and full-on proof as to why Dreamworks, as they stand, haven't a chance of stealing Pixar's crown. They may have gotten a head start when 'Shrek' thrashed 'Monsters Inc' at the Oscars in 2002, but it didn't take long before their routine started waning, and if something as limp and lightweight as 'Madagascar' is the best answer they have to the breath-taking 'Incredibles', then surely no one's laughing any more.<br/><br/>In the typical Dreamworks animation mould, the thing that marred 'Shrek 2' slightly for a handful of viewers, and had hordes of critics groaning about 'Shark Tale', this is a viciously, recklessly, 100% artificial potboiler in every single element  the soundtrack that pumps with popular, upbeat tunes at every turning, the incessant pop culture references, the endless, desperate-to-be-trendy bursts of contemporary slang, and last, but by no means least irritating, the tiresomely non-sequiter TV and movie spoofs, most of which have nothing useful to add in the way of story, character or humour, and are chiefly there for the sake of being there (the Twilight Zone, Chariots of Fire, Planet of the Apes  well, it's like Patty and Selma once said in an episode of 'the Simpsons': ""the easiest way to be popular is to leech off the popularity of others.""). Things which make it extremely difficult to warm to whatever slim pickings of heart and appeal you might find lurking underneath all the twaddle, in the tissue-thin storyline which sees Alex the lion and Marty the zebra enjoying a close friendship whilst in the comfy captivity of the Central Park Zoo, but finding their rapport tested when they escape into the wild with a couple of nondescript neighbours, and Alex's carnivorous instincts begin to awaken. Outwardly, that's actually pretty dramatic stuff, and it certainly had potential, but 'Madagascar' hasn't the gumption to flesh it out into anything particularly innovative or daring, let alone convince us to care how things will turn out for our 'heroes' either way. There are a few amusing moments to be had from a subplot involving a foursome of psychotic penguins, but very little that they didn't already show you in the trailers. The highbrow monkeys and cry-baby mouse lemur are funny enough, I suppose, but definitely not worth the cost of admission on their own.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a pretty poor film, and without doubt one of the weakest 3D animated features yet to have seen the light of day. So, it can only add insult to injury that whoever assembled this lovely-looking misfire seemingly knew nothing about the real-life island of Madagascar itself, or the many weird and wonderful creatures that inhabit it. I'm hardly a certified expert on the subject myself, of course, but I have seen enough nature documentaries and flicked through enough wildlife magazines in my time to know that it's spelt ""fossa"", not ""foosa"", and that, sadly, those guys aren't nearly as abundant (or expendable) as this movie would happily have you believe, while in the lemur world (particularly that of the ring-tailed variety) it's the females who wear the trousers around the place (yeah, King Lemur, my foot!). The most galling slip-up of them all, however, would be it's depiction of Madagascar itself as a completely uninhabited island, much in the style of 'Lord of the Flies'. Nope, there are actually people living there, you know (and I bet they're all thrilled to pieces by this film). Little I couldn't forgive, of course, if only the enjoyment value had been a lot higher. Unfortunately, it's about as entertaining as it is educational. Whether it's an informative source you're looking for to assist you with a geographical essay you have to write, or a well-made, agreeable movie to engage you for an hour and a half, you'd be better off looking elsewhere. Try harder, Dreamworks - it takes more than just visual eye candy and a few familiar voices to make this kind of thing pull its weight.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

","As others have already pointed out, this is an occasionally funny but overall a disappointing film (Although I wasn't expecting much to begin with). Chris Rock (the best of the main characters), Jada Pinkett-Smith (who has hardly any input), Ben Stiller & David Schwimmer (primarily a one joke character) all struggle with underwritten roles. Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen - Mr. Ali G) & Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer - Not a character name!!) are very enjoyable, but it is the Penguins who, without a doubt steal the movie. The (all too) brief flashes to the penguins are an adrenaline shot in the arm of a flagging movie. This film is only slightly better than the truly awful Sharks Tale, and both films despite having some fantastic set pieces, in-jokes, visual gags & snappy lines, suffer from a lack of emotional investment as we the audience never truly care for the characters, like we did of Woody, Buzz, Nemo, Marlin & the Incredibles. If Dreamworks Animation are really serious about being an equal contender in the 3D (& to a lesser extent 2D) animation market they have got to start spending a lot more time on writing & developing both the story & especially the characters, before throwing (& waisting) wonderful talent & fantastic visuals & occasionally clever gags at these rather lazy, paper-thin stories. I have no doubt that the younger kids will be kept amused and the older crowds should enjoy the odd moment, but your better off waiting for the DVD. Long Live Pixar!"

Even my kids got a bit bored (age 3 and 5) interestingly they seem to be able to follow the Pixar ones better with more involved stories and characters - perhaps kids aren't as dumb as people like to think - and in fact I wonder how well Dreamworks SKG understand the way kids think - Shrek was too scary, Sharks tale too loud and spasmodic - Madagascar was a step in the right direction but needed a lot more script work before it was made - it could have been quite good."

","Dreamworks continues their losing streak with Madagascar. Shrek and Shrek 2 were brilliant, but it seemed like the writers for this movie were looking hard for inspiration. i didn't like the visual style of the characters in Shark Tale and i have the same complaint of this movie, but looks aren't everything. unfortunately, this film just isn't very funny and the voice casting is equally uninspired. none of the voices are very unique and the actors voicing them wouldn't be my first choices. all of them sound like the actors as people speaking normally instead of creating a voice to give the character more flair. i can't possible imagine more boring voices than Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer. <br/><br/>adults will likely find the Marty's voice annoying. i'm a Chris Rock fan, but it seemed like the studio just needed a loud, wise-cracking black comedian to voice the smart alec character (like Chris Tucker or Eddie Murphy in other movies).<br/><br/>there are a few chuckles, but mostly, most of the movie feels rehashed. a lot of the jokes go way over the heads of kids. there's a Planet of the Apes (the Charlton Heston one) reference. which 13 year old has seen Apes? the only funny characters were the dastardly penguins and the pair of poo-flinging monkeys."

","The three of us saw it and I think it's fair to say that we all felt the trailers were the best part. The timing was really off in the movie--funny, really, the trailers had had great pacing for the gags. The plot was fairly disappointing and the ending was thoroughly unsatisfying. I kept feeling like there should've been more going on throughout.<br/><br/>The animation was good, the characters were okay (yes, ring-tailed lemurs really do act a lot like that, song and dance notwithstanding), and the voices were okay, although I kept feeling like Chris Rock as the zebra smacked a lot like Eddie Murphy as the donkey. Both were fine in their roles and I'm very keen on both actors, but it seemed a lot like the same role with similar, brassy voices. The penguins were very funny and, as someone else said, they should've carried the movie on their own. It'd be nice if the movie had had something like a plot.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most telling response was that, a day later, I still felt let down. There wasn't anything good about the movie I cared to remember."

","Outstanding animated movies such as Nemo and The Incredibles, even Robots have set the bar way higher than this film ever gets. Obvious jokes, hardly any character development - sort of like Looney Tunes without the cleverness. I don't know why they bothered with the expensive voice talent - the kids don't care and it adds little to the story or characters. Chris Rock is a pretty good Zebra - David Scwimmer is ROSS pretending to be a giraffe - more than a little distracting. Jada P-Smith is a big fat hippo with attitude but little to do in the film. Overall I thought there would be more done with the characters and more overall with the story. It's better than some straight to video selections but we won't be adding this DVD/video to our family library. Our daughter was entertained but almost immediately forgot about the movie and has little interest in any of the marketing products - clothes, toys etc - she could care less.

The comedy isn't clever at all. As an adult, I found it to lack the chemistry and fun of Disney movies and like I said, can't even be compared to Shrek. For kids, it's decent enough. One of the main things that bothered me was how the characters acted. Was it just me or was David Schwimmer's character a lot like Ross?

","Madagascar Life in Central Park zoo is hard, especially for wise-cracking, sassy Zebra(voiced by Chris Rock), Marty. Marty feels like the zoo isn't were he is supposed to be in his life. It is his 10th birthday, and his life is half over in Zebra years. His friends, Alex the Lion(Stiller), Gloria the Hippo(Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraffe(David Schwimmer), enjoy the life in the zoo, and immediately reject his idea to break out and go to Connecticut to be free.<br/><br/>Later that Night, Melman awakes to find Marty gone. He wakes Alex and Gloria, and the three embark on a journey to find him. They follow instinct and clues and eventually catch up to him at a train station. But chaos ensues, and they all awake sometime later to find themselves being shipped to the wild. While on the boat, the four friends flip overboard on accident, and end up on a stranded island in the middle of no-where. There, they meet a group of eccentric and lively animals that turn against them when Alex tries to attack Marty.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 'Shrek' & 'Shrek 2' just as much. 'Shark Tale' was visually captivating, and enjoyable to a certain level, but relied on it's cast too much. Dreamworks latest pic, 'Madagascar' is a cleverly written, juicy piece of animation, maybe the best Dreamworks effort yet.<br/><br/>Unlike 'Shark Tale' and 'Shrek 2', 'Madagascar' uses good-old-fashioned slapstick and witty jokes to provide it's humor, as apposed to pop-culture references and the Mafia. Its visuals are great, and it is lively, bouncy, and family-friendly. It's fast, It's clever, It's hilarious. What more could you want in an animated comedy? Sure, the plot is lowsy, but the sharp wit of the script and the voices provided add much flavor to the picture.<br/><br/>One last point, the casting is exceptionally good in this picture. The voices fit the characters well, and seem to get into their characters true personality with ease, particularly Jada Pinkett Smith and Chris Rock. Overall: Despite the lowsy plot, Dreamworks newest and possibly best effort yet, 'Madagascar', is a cleverly written, colorful and juicy piece of animation.<br/><br/>My rating(from 10): between 7-8"

","... but for adults? The animation might be 3-D, but the plot isn't. What starts out with an interesting premise of zoo animals being returned to the wild (which, if you're being picky, would result in the zebra and giraffe being eaten and the lion and hippo starving, but never mind) instantly grinds to a halt once the animals get there.<br/><br/>The animals move about the screen zappily enough, but the visual entertainment is not sufficient to keep discerning non-parent adults engaged. There are some funny jokes. (When the evil penguins arrive in Antarctica they gaze at the bleak landscape of their natural home. After a pause, one says: ""Well, this sucks."") But older viewers will have to endure long unstimulating intervals for gags, which when they do arrive tend to be on a par with the cruder jokes in The Naked Gun series.<br/><br/>And while some characters - the monkeys and the penguins - are wittily constructed, the four leads are plain archetypes: vain lion, neurotic giraffe, hippo with ""attitude"" and aspirational zebra.<br/><br/>Frustratingly the film does raise two interesting issues only to gloss over them in the most facile way. When the animals are awaiting transportation to the wild, a news reporter comments that the move was brought about by pressure from animal rights groups who assumed that the animals wanted to escape captivity. Any debate on the ethics of keeping animals in zoos is then immediately dropped.<br/><br/>And when, at the climax of the film, the lion has to choose between his natural meat-eating instinct and his friendship with his prey, it is resolved by nothing more substantial than the lion feeling slightly sentimental.<br/><br/>The most irritating aspect, for me at least, was the endorsement of the popular quasi-vegetarian code of ethics whereby it is alright to kill and eat fish but not land-dwelling animals.<br/><br/>But perhaps I am being too demanding. The sheer excellence of Dreamworks SKG's better efforts (Shreks 1 and 2) and Pixar's jewels (Toy Stories 1 and 2, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc) and even Fox's predictable but entertaining Robots has raised standards in animation to vertiginous heights. Madagascar is an 86-minute diversion and nothing more."

Okay, I know it's animated, but it should at least follow the laws of physics as they relate to animals in wooden crates floating on the high seas. They would SINK. But enough about good IL' logic.

Marty is tired of the same routine and wants to explore new places in the wild, so he escapes his cage, and Alex, Melman and Gloria break out to get him back. All four of them are put into crates bound for Africa, but when the ship is taken over by penguin Skipper (Tom McGrath) and his gang, the four friends are thrown overboard and swept up on a tropical island. They explore the island and find a tribe of partying lemurs, led by King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), along with Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) who are very friendly. While Marty is excited to stay in this new world, Alex and the others want to go back to the zoo, with all the small dangers and trouble about, but by the end they change their opinions. Also starring Andy Richter as Mort the Mouse Lemur.

The main of the story involves the 4 zoo animals in this new environment, and the small Lemurs defending themselves from their predators. The lion, zebra, hippo, and giraffe end up helping them.<br/><br/>We also see the 4 penguins in Antarctica, standing in the dark and cold, uttering ""This sucks."" The ship eventually returns to Madagascar but it is out of fuel. Maybe Madagascar 2 will take up there."

","Madagascar! Where do I begin. I like and dislike this movie for so many reasons I like it because it is plum out HILARIOUS. The part on the subway with the lion and the baseball fan is good, the part of the Marty the zebra in time square, getting cornered by police and news reporters, the psycotic penguins, and the chimps, and even the part on the boat going to Kenya, but got shipwrecked. I used to want to be an animal conservationalist as a younger kid and this mixed that with my love for comedy. I love a good animal personification (every now and then.) I dislike the movie cause the only real funny parts with the exception of some dialouge by King Julian the ring tailed lemur and one where Alex chases Marty the only funny parts took place when the animals were in New York or on the boat. When they came to Madagascar it lacked funny parts, but had some cute laughless jokes. The movie should have been called New York City Zoo. I mean the parts in the New York scenes were hilarious or on a 10 on a scale 1-10 and the funny parts in Madagascar were a 3.5 PS-I;ve been to every location (New York City, Kenya, and Madagascar) the movie covered except Antarctica."

","Since all modern animated features apparently have to deliver some sort of edifying message, MADAGASCAR has a moral as well. The message, however, is painfully obvious, though MADAGASCAR does illustrate it quite well. The message is: penguins are funny -- and lions, zebras, giraffes and hippos aren't. Unfortunately, it takes an hour and half to get this message across, the bulk of which is wasted on a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippo, while four clever, adorable and delightfully humorous little penguins barely get any screen time at all. They nevertheless steal what little there is worth stealing in this woefully pointless cartoon.<br/><br/>The film begins in New York City, in the Central Park Zoo, which oddly enough only seems to have about ten animals in captivity. In addition to the lion, the zebra, the giraffe, the hippo and the four adorable little penguins, there is also a pair of monkeys, who might have been funny as well, if they weren't given even less screen time than the penguins. The plot finds the four little penguins plotting to escape, which leads to a tedious series of events that ultimately finds the lion, the zebra, the giraffe and the hippo shipwrecked on the African coast where their pampered existence in the zoo leaves them ill prepared to live in the wild. When you get right down to it, MADAGASCAR is really only about the lion and the zebra, the Dreamworks studio apparently thought it necessary to pad the story with other unnecessary characters because the giraffe, the hippo, the four penguins, the pair of monkeys and an assortment of African creatures would supply the company with more characters to potentially exploit in merchandising tie-ins as stuffed animals, Happy Meal action figures and various other toys.<br/><br/>And as a commercial for such items, MADAGASCAR certainly is adequate, as if that were enough. Like most Dreamworks CGI cartoons, the art work is colorful and detailed. But that is where the creativity stops; the screenplay begins with an okay idea, but is not otherwise well written nor does it have a point. The characters are either smart or stupid, depending on which posture is necessary in the scene, thus they supposedly know nothing about life outside the zoo, but when required they have a detailed knowledge of world geography, can commandeer a massive seafaring freighter or belt out showtunes. And the use of music in the film is particularly atrocious: the tiresomely uninspired use of standards (""Staying Alive,"" ""Born Free,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" etc.) seems obviously designed to slap together a golden oldies soundtrack album. And, of course, celebrity voices are used as a substitute for creative character animation.<br/><br/>As a comparison, some versions of MADAGASCAR include an animated short subject, ""The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper."" In it, three of the penguins go on a military-style mission to rescue the fourth, who has been accidentally mistaken for a stuffed animal and is destined to be a dog's chew toy. It is as nicely animated as MADAGASCAR, but its story is clever and concise and the penguins are blessed with vivid personalities and at 11 minutes it is infinitely more fun. Though obviously derivative of the work by Dreamworks rival Pixar (""Toy Story"" 1 and 2, in particular), the penguin short is at least borrowing from the best, rather than settling for being just adequate.<br/><br/>But MADAGASCAR does deserve a bit of credit, however, for challenging the prevailing notion in the movies that romanticizes nature to an absurd extreme. Movies perpetuate the environmentally friendly, though logically foolish, idea that, if it weren't for man, all of God's creatures would live in perfect harmony. The obvious reality is that for most wild animals life is a day to day struggle to survive, both to find something to eat and to avoid being eaten. But the law of the jungle is not PC.<br/><br/>In MADAGASCAR, the lion named Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) and the zebra named Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) are buddy-buddy pals in the zoo, where they are star attractions and all their basic needs are met. But in the jungle, Alex's carnivorous tendencies must come to the surface in order for him to survive -- and as such Marty, his main man in the city, begins to look more like his main course in the wilderness. Thus the film does create an artistic and philosophical dilemma for the filmmakers: how to maintain the illusion of an ecumenical brotherhood between the species and also accept the not-so-pleasant reality that sometimes cute animals are not born to be free, but born to be lunch. The film finesses the problem with a technicality -- fish apparently aren't considered animals -- which should please everyone except PETA. Though the viewer might be inclined to root for Alex to eat Marty just to be spared any more of Chris Rock's gratingly unpleasant performance. Now, to me, that would be a happy ending."

","In ""Madagascar,"" four animals - a feisty hippo, a neurotic giraffe, an applause-addicted lion, and a freedom-yearning zebra - break out of their home in the Central Park Zoo, get crated up and shipped off to Kenya, and wind up stranded on the island of Madagascar. While there, they have to adapt to a whole new kind of life in the wild, learning their place in the natural order of things, which is something they've been shielded from all their lives.<br/><br/>This is a bright, colorful, amiable film with likable characters, first rate animation and fine vocal work from the likes of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith. The movie is at its best in the scenes set in Manhattan as the animals roam through the city streets causing terror and havoc as they go. However, once they arrive back in ""the wild,"" the narrative begins to run out of steam, primarily because the writers have failed to come up with any compelling villain or foil for them to go up against. There's fun to be had in watching Alex, the highly pampered and civilized lion, getting in touch with his long-dormant and suppressed predatory nature, but it isn't enough to make the film much more than a mild diversion.<br/><br/>Still, the movie doesn't completely shy away from some of the more brutal truths of nature, without, at the same time, becoming too frightening or disturbing for impressionable youngsters. It's certainly a lovely movie to look at, and that makes it at least tolerable for adults - impressionable or otherwise - as well."

","Handmade animation is dead! CGI-animation take the pole position nowadays... but made this fact movies really better? In fact, when traditional, handmade animation was declared dead, why, for example, did in early 2005 the new DVD-release of Disney's ""Bambi"" (first released in... 1942!!!) was sold over 1 million times on the first day? And why did the modern handmade features from Japan, like ""Spirited Away"" or ""Howls Moving Castle"" did still outrun almost every CG-feature of today in the IMDb-voting too? In fact too, because all of this mentioned movies have something, that seems to be totally forgotten today: Spirit, soul, fantasy, mixed with reality, depth, truth and credible characters! Gags are only on the second, or third, or even the last place. It seemed, that CG-movies of today are all build up only on a rapid-fire of gags and crude jokes. ""Madagascar"" went the same way. You can see it, laugh about it (and i admit, i laughed too on all the funny gags)... but forget it in a few years, maybe earlier. There is no really depth and no serious conflict in it. When Alex tried to eat Marty, the audience know, that nothing evil will happened to Marty at any time. The film did not trying to develop a real conflict here, and everyone do know this. It is not a conflict at all, only another ""launching pad"" for the next fired battery of gags and jokes. Some little secondary creatures was hunted and eaten by other animals, maybe to show the ""real nature"", but this unsuccessful try to add something to think about it to the film was very fast over tuned by the next crude gag. To compare, take a look on the famous scene in ""Bambi"", when Bambi's poor mother was killed: This is really something to think about it, there was real depth, real danger, real death! And if i look on jokes in classic animated movies of yesterday and see the new features of today, i realized, that yesterday's gags was of finer quality and did not stand above the characters, but a lot of gags of today seemed only in for the reason to cover a weak plot, simple, one dimensional characters and to hide the absence of depth. <br/><br/>Don't' get me wrong: ""Madagascar"" is not a bad movie, it is really funny, but surely not one of the kind of movies, that will captivating and move you and become a immortal classic. On the DVD are some bonus-tracks, in which one member of the film-crew mentioned his wish, that ""Madagascar"" maybe become an immortal classic that will captivate future generations too like the old, classic animated features do until today. But i think, this will not happen. It is a funny and fast, but fast forgotten movie too."

","Madagascar works despite its flaw, a strangely incomplete plot that leaves the viewer hanging, wanting more, but not getting it. Yet, as a whole, you would probably have to be three kinds of curmudgeon not to get a decent set of giggles--and at least a view belly laughs--from the nicely animated story of a zebra in a New York zoo that aspires to live in the wild, and the resultant chaos of his friends' attempts to save him from himself.<br/><br/>The movie never goes overboard (if you haven't seen it, you'll hate me for that). There isn't too much of anything--dung jokes and psychobabble come to mind. It's from Dreamworks, not Disney, so you won't find somebody intoning the ubiquitous ""Follow your heart!"" Madagascar is clipped and fast, funny and gentle, except for the predatory nature of the zebra's closest friend, a lion that winds up in the wild--and there are no zoo workers to toss him steaks anymore.<br/><br/>But for the fact that the middle section of the film isn't fully developed (and the movie makers try to alleviate the truncated feeling by throwing in a hilarious short with four very silly penguins), I'd recommend this computer-animated kiddie show to adults because, even if you aren't in the mood for several giggles and a smattering more, watching the family laugh is worth the rental price."

","2005 was a weak year for animation to be sure. Madgascar stands up well, but in other years would have looked weaker than it is. It is a light, funny and wonderfully inoffensive family film, but all those good qualities make it a tad dull.<br/><br/>Madagascar knows how to make use of peripheral characters. The penguins, King Julian, the scared subway passengers, the monkeys all add to this movie and make it more interesting. Its lead, Ben Stiller's Alex the lion is the dullest of the bunch.<br/><br/>Madagascar opens in Central Park Zoo, where Alex is the star of the show. He loves his life. Luxury, steaks to snack on daily, legions of adoring fans and an endless parade of cheesy merchandise bearing his image. His friends Melman the Giraffe (a hypochondriac with all the medication he needs) and Gloria the Hippo (no body image problem here), seem content, but not as in love with the zoo as Alex.<br/><br/>Marty the Zebra, perfectly voiced by Chris Rock, is in a different zone. He runs on his treadmill, longing for the wild. He does not really know what that this, but he know instinctively that that is where he belongs. One day, h breaks out of the zoo and wanders Manhattan looking for the wild. This leads to the movie's funniest scene, with the escapee Zebra asking directions from a police horse.<br/><br/>Marty's friends chase after him to try and coax him back to the zoo, but all are caught and shipped off to a wild life reserve. On the way, their crates fall from their ship and they land in Madagascar.<br/><br/>From there, the story does not really go too far. It stays funny largely thanks for Sasha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer, but it is lightweight in comparison to its contemporaries.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a fun couple of hours with the kids, Madagascar is funny enough for the mom and dad crowd. Although the sequel has been announced, it is mediocre entertainment at best. *** out of ****."

Who wouldn't want to see another animated film after such films as The Incredibles, Shrek, and Toy Story 2? Some of the greatest comedies of the past few years have been animated, so why not take a chance on Madagascar. Well, the reason is because Madagascar is not the same kind of humor that made the others so great. Madagascar appeals to only one audience (that being ""kids"") whereas the other films appealed to all audiences. There are a few exceptions as always. There are a few adult-oriented jokes throughout the film, but for the most part Madagascar appeals only to children.

The Great Escape, Planet of the Apes, Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone,"" and a few others (whose titles escape me at the moment) were represented. Amazingly, the animators went to great pains to accurately depict the kinds of animals that are endemic to Madagascar -- although the fossas behaved more like a pack of hyenas rather than the solitary beasts that they are. Even the rainforest background was pretty accurately depicted. All of that, however, was lost on a 7-year old and her 5-year old sibling.

Sasha Baron Cohen steals the picture as the King of the Lemurs, but then I happen to find his Ali G personae funny - some of them at least. Jada Pinkett Smith is not allowed enough of a part to develop her hippo (read ""stereotypical fat black woman"") character and the physical humour of the large-bellied hippo and a sympathetic maternal presence are only hinted at. Similarly, David Schwimmer is not allowed to stretch his hypochondriacal giraffe character very far. Luckily, Ben Stiller as Alex the lion and Chris Rock as Marty the zebra, zoo buddies, keep the manic energy going, but at a tolerable level - almost subdued. You may find the Marty character eerily reminiscent of Donkey, in Shrek.<br/><br/>For the kids' sake, the downer aspects of animals devouring each other in the wild are honestly developed and confronted, then quickly glossed over, as Alex happily discovers his wild nature (and the real reason why he is called the ""King of Beasts"") only to find himself in self-conflict over the down-side of his newly uncovered talents and physical advantages.<br/><br/>I rated this low because it's not in a class with Disney's or Pixar's recent animated efforts."

""Madagascar"" actually has many funny moments (a quartet of scheming penguins are given too little screen time), but the targets of parody (""American Beauty""; ""Chariots of Fire"") aren't likely to connect with a young audience, and the voice actors seem confined to familiar shtick (Chris Rock in particular seems to be phoning in his performance), which does nothing to help the stale familiarity of the plot and the fact that there's nothing overly distinctive about this film, especially in the wake of ""Shrek"" and ""The Incredibles"" (pinnacles of both storytelling and computer animation)."

(Granted, this is like saying that ""Highway To Heaven"" is less anodyne than ""Little House on the Prairie,"" but still.)<br/><br/>Short and colourful, but with a pretty thin storyline, our main characters of Alex the urban one, Gloria the practical one, Melman the nervous one and Marty the wild one (believe me, they don't get developed much more than that) aren't all that amusing or appealing, and the movie gets much better whenever the spotlight falls on the escaping penguins or the lemur king and his second-in-command. More of them would have made a lot of difference (and with the movie's box office returns, the possibility of DreamWorks spinning them off into a TV series shouldn't be ruled out).<br/><br/>""Madagascar"" also trots out some very weak cultural gags, some of which really stick out in what's supposed to be a movie for kids (Alex's ""American Beauty"" dream with roses replaced by steaks, complete with Thomas Newman's original music? A ""Cast Away"" gag with a ball called Spalding? And can someone point out that it might not be a good idea to remind older viewers of better movies from the same company?), and the heavy doses of non-original music just make the new stuff by Hans Zimmer and Co. seem weaker than ever. Add to this animation that's on the same level as ""Father of the Pride"" and a very annoying dosage of ""I Like To Move It,"" and you have one very mediocre animated feature. (How mediocre? I've seen Don Bluth movies that come over stronger. Don Bluth movies from the 1990s.) <br/><br/>Oh, for the days when animated movies didn't feel compelled to rely on name voices. But again, thank goodness for the penguins. Smile and wave indeed..."

","Parodied are Tom Hank's Cast Away, Charlton Heston's Planet Of The Apes, Silence Of The Lambs. Oh, and Tarzan (twice) and George Of The Jungle I suppose.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen sounds like he is trying to do a voice somewhere between Jim Broadbent (who I actually thought it was until I read the cast list) and Spike Milligan doing some of his Goon's voices.<br/><br/>Chris Rock's animated Zebra actually does look a bit like him. Right, my main question - what kind of animal is a Foosa? They look a bit like some of the Lions and big Cats out of The Lion King.<br/><br/>By the way, WHO THE HELL IS Cedric The Entertainer? Why should we know him? We in the UK assume he's been in some TV show in the US? Generally I think this film is a little on the short side, could have done with about an extra 20 minutes or so. The little kids will love it like they loved Nemo. Not quite in the same league as The Incredibles though.<br/><br/>Also the 1st time I've found Chris Rock not only bearable but funny as well on screen. He must be improving in his old age but I wonder how much dialog recorded was cut because of obscenity?"
"StevePaget","5","0","1","29 July 2005"," Dreamworks reputation diminishing...
","What a lot of publicity this film received. For what seems like months, my daughter and I have been bombarded with Madagascar TV promotions, food promotions, toy adverts and all the usual hoopla associated with a major kids animated movie release. In a way it's similar to the periodic population explosion which is responsible for the lemming suicide myth. Every now and then, the lemming population becomes so large that they migrate en masse, causing some to die as they flock over a cliff. In this case, the media have waiting too long since Dreamworks last animated epic, the disappointing Shark Tale, so with another 2 years to wait for the next Shrek sequel, they have whipped themselves up into a frenzy over Madagascar. But does it deserve the attention?<br/><br/>In a word, no. Like Shark Tale, Madagascar doesn't really cut it as a winner. A lack of decent jokes is the main reason why the film fails to grab the attention in the way it should. There are some funny moments involving a trio of cunning penguins who have their own escape plan, as well as some good toilet humour, but the laughs are few and far between. After a while the film develops a vegetarian motif, as Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller) starts to return to his wild instincts and craves zebra meat. This is fairly uncomfortable viewing (though this may be for my own personal reasons), as is the heavy-handed patriotism which seems to inflict many films that centre around New York. David Schwimmer's neurotic giraffe is left to provide most of the comic relief, while Jada Pinkett Smith's hippopotamus might as well not be there. There was something odd about the animation which I couldn't quite place, too. It seemed to be too jerky, with characters hopping about so quickly that it was hard to watch.<br/><br/>Madagascar might have the big names and the big studio behind it, but my young daughter wasn't hooked and nor was I."

"TotalEmpire","7","0","1","26 July 2005"," Great animation and performance but largely missing a storyline .
","I always find it difficult to review films like this as any final judgement I make about Madagascar won't do it justice. So here goes. Your Kids will love it but you won't. Even that isn't right. I mean kids will enjoy the whole film from start to finish without a doubt but, for me personally, the whole film was missing a storyline. Here you have four animals voiced by four well known actors. Ben Stiller voices Alex the Lion, Chris Rock takes on Marty the Zebra, David ""Ross"" Schwimmer tackles the job of Melman the Zebra and Jada ""Mrs Will"" Smith does a great job with Gloria the hippo. The animation is faultless and the chemistry between the four animals is slick. Each character is his/her own and, with the exception of David Schwimmer's Melman who reminded me far too much of his friends alter-ego Ross, the character voices fit in perfectly. The jokes are of a childish nature but there are a few moments which will get even the most hardened of adults giggling to themselves.(The penguins are great.)Some parts made me question the U certificate. However, I just felt that there could have been more of a story to it. More of a challenge for the four animals. Visually this is great but as a movie it is too short and basic. It doesn't have the same entertainment value as Shrek or Shark Tale but it does have it's good points. If your feeling down or under the weather and you want a feel good movie then give this a try. If you want an entertaining treat for your children i'd definitely recommend this. Other than that i'd recommend giving it a miss. 7/10."

","My four year old totally failed to get into this movie - from about half way through, he kept asking how much longer it was, and could we go home? Madagascar is mildly funny for adults (at least in its New York stereotypes), but there's far to much rapid verbiage and the characters suffer from too much angst for small children to really be interested. Some of the slapstick made my son laugh, and he was occasionally scared, but he really didn't care at all for the characters. Neither did I - they're just not very likable.<br/><br/>For me, the movie would have been much better if they'd removed the four heroes altogether, and concentrated on the penguins.<br/><br/>Give this one a miss."

","One walks out of the cinema with a feeling of expectations not met... But this movie wasn't the worst made up-to-date. Maybe we as adults have become too used to ""children's movies"" catering more for the adult sense of humour, than children's. ""Madagascar"" is for the kids. ""Robots"" were for the adults. For us grown-ups, only the penguins were extremely funny, and the rest were smilable but not nowhere in the league of ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Robots"", etc. Some spoofs from movies like ""Cast Away"" (the ball), Lion King (the hienas) were functional, and this helped with some humorous bits. Excellent animation. A bit of time wasted if you're older than 12, though..."
"solanki17","6","0","1","18 July 2005"," Madagascar more like celluloid massacre !
","I went to see this on the preview weekend. Having been a big fan of classic Disney films The Lion King, and the Disney Pixar ones Toy Story, Finding Nemo I wasn't expecting much from the DreamWorks stable that churn out the other animation films we are bombarded with (Shrek, Monster's Inc, shark's Tale). Madagascar is from the aforementioned DreamWorks studio, and unlike the Disney classics it lacks that quality storyline that is so crucial to these animated films. More & more so these days we find Hollywood create these movies with two audiences in mind, kids, and adults (usually the ones taking the kids!). The Incredibles did this really well, and it that sense Madagascar does it too, with many in-jokes placed spoofing various movies which would go over many kids heads but a lot of us older lot will appreciate, to name a few ""The Planet of The Apes"", ""American Beauty"", ""Cast Away"", ""Zoolander"" & ""the Twilight Zone"". These provide good humour, but the key essence of the movie is supposed to be humour and lovable characters, and though both the main characters Alex(the Lion voiced by Ben Stiller) and Marty (the Zebra voiced by Chris Rock) are enjoyable to watch and their relationship strong comedic dramatisation, the audience I feel get more viewing pleasure from seeing the secondary characters. My favourites include David Schwimmer's hypochondriac giraffe, the crazy Lemur posse led by Ali G's neurotic voice and he has one of the best scenes when he leads his group in a sing along to ""I like to move it, move it, I like to move it, move it"". But the best of the characters have to be the cool and calculated penguin foursome who provide the much necessary light relief. The story is quite well structured (though for a primarily kids movie it doesn't need to be) centring around 4 Zoo animals (Zebra, Lion, Hippo & Giraffe) who end up being set free from the Zoo to a national park in Kenya due to their Zebra friend who desires to be let free in the wild. But they never get to Kenya and end up deserted on an island, namely Madagascar where they experience all aspects of the wild the Zebra craved but the others don't fancy so much. In the end this is going to sound so cliché, but it is ultimately a fun family movie, more enjoyable for the kids and not so pleasing to u & me as say Finding Nemo. For light entertainment with absolutely no seriousness this might be your tonic !"

","I had heard the negative comments from critics and other concerning Madagascar--I can understand why. From the moment Marty (the zebra voiced by Chris Rock) and Alex (the lion voiced by Ben Stiller) speak, I had a very hard time believing the characters matched the voice. Alex the lion seemed too timid to be a lion (even later in the film when he realizes who he REALLY is as a lion). Rock seemed to force Marty's character to the point where it just didn't seem believable. It's a shame b/c those two are the main characters. I enjoyed David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith as the giraffe and hippo, respectively--those two i believed. The penguins are hilarious and Sasha Baron Cohen aka Ali G steals the scenes he's in as Lemur king Julien. That being said--the Lemurs and Penguins had the best scenes. As an adult, I could care less how the plot was going until the lemurs come in and those biting pop culture references kicked in (look for a hilarious twilight zone and American Beauty reference/spoof--i couldn't stop laughing when i saw those). But it seemed those were the only genuine laughs it had. Kids will love the flick but something was missing to make it Shrek-like in its quality."
"The_Orenda","4","0","2","7 July 2005"," Largely indifferent about the whole thing.
","If you've seen the previous Dreamworks Animation movie, Shark Tale, then you can expect more or less the same loud, in-your-face, mentality that made the first movie a success. Both use New York as a setting, borrow loud booming music from years' past, and reference movies and TV to keep adults awake. With the exception of the show-stealing penguins however, Madagascar is more geared towards short-attention span children as, once again, the imaginative use of CGI of the animals save this movie from a snoring audience.<br/><br/>At the Central Park Zoo, Marty the zebra escapes towards Conneticut to find out what life is like in the wild. His friends, Alex, Gloria and Melman, stop him at Grand Central Station only for them to be captured and ended up put back in the wild.<br/><br/>During the movie, there's a reference to the original Planet of the Apes. Hearing this, you automatically know it has to be one of two scenes, and that's the whole point I'm trying to make. Madagascar's references stink and just drives home another point: there's not a shred of originality in the movie. There's another reference to an episode of The Twilight Zone (""To Serve Lemur"", ho ho), which kids will obviously not get since it was over 40 years ago and that's how the movie will be like to adults. Aside from the references in the movie, there's also the morals. There's a lemur that gets up and sings to, ""I Like to Move It,"" from Reel 2 Reel. Which is fine, and throughout the movie there's word switching to references for the kids, but this King Lemur is dancing with a bunch of girls, telling them how much he likes their bodies moving and how to do it. Once again, I have no problems with a promiscuous lemur (do you?), but this being a kids movie, I would have preferred him to say how much he likes kids, instead of girls, to get up and dance, and there would be a bunch of children in the theater aisles dancing for ten-fifteen minutes and parents would be happy. We also see the animals accepting life being marooned in the middle of nowhere, so they try sea-water. They spray it all over the place and for about five minutes we see our kids laugh and get it in their heads that spraying their drink all over the dining table is largely acceptable because, you know, it tastes like seawater. If your children insist, I suggest renting the movie since there are far better movies being pumped out this year, but if they loved Shark Tale, they will no doubt love this movie just the same."

","""Madagascar"" is the latest animated feature to come from the Pacific Data Images and Dreamworks studios. It follows the adventures of a group of animals from the Central Park Zoo. Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock), dreams of leaving his city life and going back to nature. His friends are Alex, a superstar lion (Ben Stiller); Grace, a sassy hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman, a hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer). The four wind up getting themselves shipped to the Wildlife Preserve in Kenya, but an unscheduled detour leaves them stranded on Madagascar, surrounded by fun-loving lemurs. The story delves into the characters, having lived their whole lives in captivity, and suddenly sent back to the wilderness, unable to adjust. This is what gives the story a clever angle.

"Kyle_Richards","3","0","2","22 June 2005"," Ehhh... Uneventful with a handful of good laughs
","3D animation seems to be all the craze since Toy Story and Shrek came about so successfully. Well, at this point I believe it has gone overboard. The only cartoons you see anymore are either 3D, like this, or anime... I guess I prefer the old stylings, due in part to the poor story lines that come along with many of these 3D animated films packed with 300 celebrities a piece yet feature overused cliché jokes and do-nothing plots. Small children may be entertained by the same jokes we've all seen a million times before dumbed down for them, but thats only because its the first time they saw them.....<br/><br/>This film in particular introduced nothing I haven't seen before with some parodies of old films that only adults could find funny, but since they're not good parodies, adults won't find them funny. No one will. Such as the lion's rant on the beach, ""Darn you! Darn you to heck!"" He says............ All I say is, ""WOW.... That was lame..."" And the corny Beaches parody complete with ""Chariots of Fire""! Wow, I've never seen a comedy feature slow motion running to that music before!!! Oh wait, I have, multiple times. And when you've heard a joke a million times before, suddenly, its not so funny.<br/><br/>The animation style also is nothing that great. The various lemurs and penguins look very nice, I'll give them that. Each one of them fits the style nicely and conveys a nice comical appearance, especially Cedric the Entertainer and Andy Richter's lemur incarnations. However, the four main characters are just atrocities. The zebra and giraffe are just plain ugly. Their awkwardly big lips and triangle shaped features make for unappealing characters. The lion's mane is also a bothersome polygon. Overall, the style is really blocky and, as much as I can appreciate stylized work, this style really just comes out as lazy and unappealing.<br/><br/>The storyline is also quite the bore. Basically, the animals leave the zoo and through an unimaginative twist of fate, they wind up in Madagascar. Then... nothing happens. There is a minor conflict between Rock's zebra and Stiller's lion but its far too drawn out for what it is, which is surprising seeing how this movie is only an hour and twenty minutes.<br/><br/>The movie does have its pros though. There is some good humor from a handful of the characters. The scheming penguins are a joy to watch as are the idiotic lemurs. Cedric the Entertainer, Sacha Baron Cohen (of Da Ali G Show), and Andy Richter play three very funny lemurs with many comedic parts. Even David Schwimmer (of Friends) gives a overall funny performance as the Giraffe. However, Chris Rock and Ben Stiller, who you've come to expect more from, give pretty drab performances, due mostly to the drab lines, and since they're what you see most of time, the laughs are few and in between and you're left wanting more from the other characters, and basically more characters in general. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't live up to what it could have been, an immersing and fun movie full of colorful characters and situations. But this doesn't happen, and anyone looking for something more than a sad rehash of every comedy ever made will be disappointed. I was much more pleased with the movie ""Robots"", which really catered to the situation and took advantage of the fact that they were robots and brought a lot to the table. This movie could have been done with anything and doesn't take advantage of what it is at all.<br/><br/>Overall, its one you can miss, and I look forward to when the fad of 3D animated goldmines lacking the imagination cartooned films used to have dies down."

His three zoo animal friends (lion, giraffe, hippopotamus) don't want to go to the wild. When the four animals accidentally move from the zoo to the wild (Madagascar) the story deals about the lion having problems eating meat out of living animals (in stead of eating dead meat in the zoo). To 'save' the Lion from this problem, the four animals decide to return to the zoo. But in the end they can not leave because their ship is out of gas.<br/><br/>Not an inspirational story.

"thousandisland","5","0","1","18 June 2005"," Disappointing.
","I think I'm just getting WAY tired of the whole CG Animated movie formula, what with the famous comedians voicing all the characters, the outrageous animation style, and the annoying pop culture references. This sometimes works and can add to a film, but it shouldn't BE the whole film. Even more dull here is the lack of character development synchronized with dialogue and mannerisms that are totally exaggerated to the point of being just irritating. I don't know where the ""Acting"" went in these movies. it used to be that you could find all the subtlety and realism that is found in live action; now animated films are just one long comedy routine, everyone is at some wild end of the emotional spectrum ALL THE TIME, and every action is punctuated with falling over or hitting someone else in the head. No animated character is ""annoyed"" anymore - he has to be raving and outraged. And and no one is ""pleased,"" but must be jumping up and down and doing backflips. I think the believable acting standards must have disappeared as soon as animators stopped having to actually *draw* them. <br/><br/>And those are the *developed* characters. You also have the ones that are nothing and go nowhere, like the hypochondriac giraffe that has no other personality traits, and the hippo that has no purpose beyond spouting urban slang that will soon be very dated and embarrassing - if it isn't already. <br/><br/>Basically this is one of those movies that has to be throwing something AT you all the time, either physical pratfalls (it felt like someone fell over comically every two minutes), animation that is trying too hard to be amazing, or babbling dialogue that is neither funny nor character-deepening. And as far as the design goes, these characters *have* to look ridiculous because the movie can't read any other way. <br/><br/>Overall, it's an example of everything that is annoying about computer animated films, and resolves very little beyond the conflict created by the lion's dietary needs once he's displaced in the wild. It's so depressing that a movie like this is already considered a ""blockbuster,"" while a much better film like Brother Bear was not even given a chance. Hopefully, time will prove that it isn't the animation style that makes an animated movie good."

Shrek 2, Incredibles, Shark Tale, etc.) then people would see its fairly average. But still not awful. Chris Rock is funny, but then I always think he is. Ben Stiller is...hmm...overexposed? Is it just me or was David Schwimmer trying to play Melman the giraffe like Woody Allen? The funniest for me were the penguins, as well as Cedric and Sasha as the Lemurs. Hope these comments are helpful to some of you. Its a good movie sure, but doesn't really stack up against the others in this category. So its fine for kids but you adults who go there or have girlfriends who want to see 'cute' movies, its not as fun."
"Kupava","5","0","1","16 June 2005"," Has little fun for adults, but the kids may like it
","Went to see the movie last night, expecting to find it at least amusing, if not funny. It was amusing okay, but I couldn't help seeing some plot problems. The beginning is good, especially the penguin scenes - these birds really steal the show. But as soon as the animals arrive on the island, the story starts to fall apart. Seems like the authors had this great idea of bringing some zoo fauna into the wild life and showing all the fun stuff that can happen in such circumstances, but didn't know where to go from there. As a result, there's no real villain, no real problem that these animals face... and no real fun for grown-up viewers. As for kids, I don't think they can learn much from this story, whether it's knowledge of Madagascarian unique wildlife (which is indeed depicted poorly, with only two major kinds of animals presented in the movie) or lessons of building relationship with friends. Some kids may even get scared by a skeleton hanging from a tree or get upset by seeing a duckling being eaten by a crocodile in one of a minor scenes. It's still worth renting, but not worth going to the movies. 5 out of 10."
"630west","5","0","2","15 June 2005"," why did i bother?
","I went to see this movie thinking it would be funny. I also felt that way when I went to see the Village. I thought it would be scary. Well, Madagascar was not a very funny movie. The Village was also not scary. Anyway, lets get back to Madagascar. There was a few funny moments, but I didn't enjoy it like The Incredibles or Shrek 1 and 2. I don't really like animation from Dreamworks. I think they try to make it for adults and children. Most of the time, that doesn't work very well. Hayao Miyazaki is one of some that can make films for both adults and children. If you like loud annoying laughs, pointless slapstick moments, or just like talking animals, you should see this. Well, I liked it better than the Village."
"Karlos-3","4","0","2","15 June 2005"," Recipe for laughter or boredom..
","I am, quite frankly, sick and tired of DreamWorks' recipe for all their movies. It's like Antz and Shark Tale and Shrek 2 and Madagazcar all came out of some robotic movie writing machine. (Shrek 1 was notably an exception.) Here's the recipe: You get a bunch of Hollywood stars, depict them into goofy cartoon characters, wrap some lame (ridiculously repeated) story and then add a lot of funky dance songs (all past hits, don't think of anything yourself). And you count on the star power of the voice actors and the funny graphics and hip tunes to gather viewers. Because once viewers see the film, they will remember nothing else but a few funny lines and a few funky tunes.<br/><br/>Madagascar is no different. It is wonderfully animated, very colorful and well acted. Ben Stiller does the best job then Chris Rock seems bored at times and the other two are sub par. But beyond that, the movie makers want you to laugh and ignore the details. Don't worry about how or who or why. Just keep laughing to one liners and funny situations and ignore the fact that the story is non-existent.<br/><br/>Here is the difference: You watch the Incredibles and you are completely engrossed in the characters, you know Mr.Incredible is a proud hero yet typical suburban dad, you see Syndrome as the diabolical wack-o. You don't even think about the actors voicing the characters. But in AntZ, you are supposed to see Woddy Allen and Sylvester Stallone. In Shark Tale you are supposed to feel Will Smith is the main character. In Madagascar, you see Chris Rock and Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>The brightest spot in the movie is the diabolical team of penguins. They were a true joy and about the only creative stroke in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Dreamworks has much to learn from Pixar. The most important thing being, they need to be creative, not repetitive. there is no ONE recipe to make movies, they have to give each movie its own spirit and creative touch."
"3_Beekman_Place","7","0","1","14 June 2005"," Another so-so computer animated flick
","Seems they can make them look like Pixar... taste like Pixar... but do they FEEL like Pixar??? Sadly, no. This film is cute, but lacking a lot. Four animal friends in a city zoo get transported to ""the wild"" through a very thin plot. If it weren't for the penguins and a little old lady in Grand Central Station I wouldn't have laughed out loud. It's a tribute to Disney that I can believe a Fairy Godmother can turn a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage to carry Cinderella to the ball.. but some of the things Madagascar expect you to believe is WAY too much. <br/><br/>Serious animation fans will have a problem with the sudden ending... left me feeling cheated. I'm sure young kids will like this a lot.. so buy it for them when it comes out on DVD.. but save your $10 and skip it in the theater. My hope is someday these sub par computer animated films they crank out at such a fast pace, which seems to make the storyline suffer.. will cause an outcry for the return of classic, hand-drawn animation!"
"wxid","7","0","1","12 June 2005"," All Hail the New York Giants!
","Take four pampered, zoo born-and-bred animals, drop them into the deepest, darkest jungles of Madagascar, and hilarity ensues. That at least is the theory in Dreamworks' latest computer generated animation. Though it would be more accurate to call Madagascar a cartoon in the old sense of the word since, technical methodology aside, the style of this movie is, in part, heavily influenced by the likes of Bugs and Daffy.<br/><br/>Dreamworks of course have inflicted upon us the good (the first Shrek), the bad (the second Shrek), and the downright ugly (Shark Tale). Madagascar is largely the work of the key people involved in making the better than average Ice Age. Whilst that flick may have had its flaws, it ranks among the better Dreamworks titles and thankfully Madagascar largely improves upon it to give a genuinely entertaining, funny, and referential hour and a half.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Alex the egotistical lion (Stiller), Marty the wistful, daydreaming zebra (Rock), Melman the hypochondriac giraffe (Schwimmer), and Gloria the, frankly, bland hippopotamus (Pinkett-Smith) happily living their lives in the New York Zoo. Alex is treated like royalty, and is the star of the zoo - drawing crowds of children and pensioners alike. Marty dreams of ""the wild"", a seemingly magical mystical place, complete with flying penguins, where an animal is free and happy. Inspired by some penguins bent on escape to Antarctica Marty seizes an opportunity to escape the zoo, heading for ""the wilds"" - of Connecticut. Seeking to save their friend from what they see as madness, the others leave the zoo to perform an intervention.<br/><br/>Soon enough, Marty and his friends are captured, crated, and on their way to a wildlife park in Africa. The penguins, discovering they are headed for the jungles rather than the ice floes, seize control of the ship and head south. In the confusion our four heroes are thrown overboard and wash ashore on the island of Madagascar.<br/><br/>Animated movies, of late, have tended to fall into one of two camps. There are the intelligent, endearing movies made by Pixar. There are the pop-reference-heavy, visual overloads made by Dreamworks. And nothing much in the middle ground. Madagascar, at last, fills that middle ground with some flair, and a modicum of imagination. It's not going to set the world on fire, but it is far superior to Shark Tale, and Robots. Why? Because it knows it's a cartoon.<br/><br/>Yes, there are references throughout Madagascar. Blink and you'll miss one, certainly. My personal favourite is the Planet of the Apes one in all it's Heston-esquire glory, but there are many others for the adults to spot and giggle at.<br/><br/>But above all, Madagascar realises just how silly it should be, without resorting to puerile toilet humour (well, mostly...) and retaining a sense of fun. Marooned on the beach, Marty soon builds a bar, complete with mood lighting, drinks that you're not supposed to, well, drink, and a door without any walls. I've seen reviewers decry this, but they entirely miss the point. This is Bugs Bunny style of cartoonery. It's Looney Tunes territory, complete with dancing, singing lemurs, an old lady that looks eerily like Tweety's Granny, dream sequences where everybody looks like steak, and a lion that builds an impressive Statue of Liberty out of reeds and logs.<br/><br/>It's ridiculous, it's border-line self-parody, but above all, it's actually funny. Where Robots tried so hard to be funny, and largely failed, Madagascar falls back on the basics of kid's cartoons from the ages and largely succeeds. There's slapstick, there are moments of foolishness, and there are sight gags. The penguins, and King Julian, steal the show, overshadowing the main characters. Nevertheless, the two leads - Marty and Alex - give a strong showing.<br/><br/>The voice work is acceptable, without generally being brilliant - Sacha Baron Cohen being the rather exceptional exception to that. Stiller does well as Alex, and is remarkably un-Stiller in many instances, but Schwimmer, and more so Pinkett-Smith, are hardly used and largely forgettable. Rock, as Marty, suits the character well enough and invests the zebra with remarkable enthusiasm, naivete, and warmth. Unlike Robin Williams' sleepwalking, er, talking, in Robots everybody here feels invested in their characters.<br/><br/>The artistic sense of the film is remarkable for ignoring the rather appalling precedent set by Shark Tale - none of the animals look remotely like their voice-actors, and are stylistically exaggerated to the point of genuine cartoon. Madagascar eschews the faux realism of previous Dreamworks movies and revels in it's flexible, and occasionally over-the-top, lack of grounding in any world we could conceivably inhabit. Penguins deliver karate chops to sailors, an old granny pounds Alex into submission, and Marty is remarkably dextrous given he has no opposable thumbs.<br/><br/>As noted, there are a plethora of in-jokes and references for the movie buff, and the adult crowd. But mainly Madagascar is aimed at the kids, and as such it scores well. Kids will love the colour, the insufferable cuteness of the lemurs, and the inevitable dance song. Adults will find enough to keep them entertained without their eyes glazing over.<br/><br/>Whilst not as clever as Pixar's movies, Madagascar is a step above Shark Tale, a bound over Robots, and an highly entertaining experience.<br/><br/>7.5/10."
"luke360","6","0","1","13 June 2005"," Not so great.
","It was all right, but in usual Ben Stiller form, I was sick and tired of his whining. Even in Cartoon form he is a whiner. The Best part of the whole movie was the Psycho Penguins. They were awesome! My dad and I saw it and he thinks the best line is: Well this sucks! When the Penguins get to Antartica and it's just a barren frozen waste land. My opinion is that the best line is: We killed them and ate their livers. After the Penguins land on Madagascar after turning around from Antartica.<br/><br/>Overall, however, I wouldn't recommend it to non-Ben Stiller fans. It's just a whip to listen to him."

","not what we was hoping for,very disappointing,could have been a much better story line,with young kids who watch films over and over again,they haven't even asked to see this one again,so that sums that up.the overall film was very boring in parts,some funny moments i admit,usually my kids wont move when a film is showing,they all got distracted a lot watching this one,the voice overs just was not for the young kids.what could have been a top hit like toy story etc etc,there was just not enough thought gone into it,and a lot of questions from the kids about the words spoken,which for you the adult viewer is fine,shall i go on,A BIG LET DOWN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY."
"jaxbubba","5","0","1","11 June 2005"," Wait for the DVD
","Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith all star in this newest computer generated film from Dreamworks Studios. The film centers around four animals (Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, and Gloria the Hippo) held captive in a New York state zoo. Though none of them are mistreated, but rather, very heavily pampered; Marty (Rock) dreams of being free in the wild.<br/><br/>The film opens with Marty celebrating his 10th birthday, which orchestrates a middle life crisis for him. He has been raised in the zoo all his life, and his birthday wish is to depart the zoo. His wishes are further strengthened when a group of penguins, who are also in the midst of an escape, accidental burrow into Marty's pen. The penguins are by far the best thing this film has to offer, and steal every scene their in. I could have easily watched an entire film the penguins escapades, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.<br/><br/>Marty hears of a magical place called ""Connecticut"" and upon the zoo's closing, he flees the zoo to find his paradise. After discovering his absents, his friends: Alex (Stiller), Melman (Schwimmer), and Gloria (Smith) follow after him. All four are soon captured, but instead of being returned to the zoo, they are crated up and sent to Africa.<br/><br/>As computer generated films go, this film isn't the greatest; however, it's not the worst either. The film just seems to go through the motions of being a film. After viewing it, there is nothing that seems to stick in your mind worth remembering. I guess what tickled me the most, was at the beginning of the film I was saying to myself, ""Wow, a lion and a zebra are friends (one carnivore and one herbivore)""; to my surprise, this ends up playing a very pivotal plot point in the film.<br/><br/>I really feel that there is nothing to gain by rushing out to see this film, I'd just wait for its DVD release.<br/><br/>http://farisreel.com"

","I've always been biased towards DreamWorks as opposed to Pixar. However, it is very hard to even find this movie enjoyable. Sure, it is watchable, but it felt like I wasted ninety minutes of my life. <br/><br/>The story moves along pretty slowly. There are some funny parts, but generally I felt bored. The ending felt like Finding Nemo's abrupt, hanging, I-sense-a-sequel ending. But where Finding Nemo's ending was funny, Madagascar's wasn't. <br/><br/>I actually felt that Father Of The Pride (discontinued made-for-TV animation series by DreamWorks) was funnier and better than Madagascar.

","I had decided that I was going to see this whether my daughter was going with me or not. It was good but I guess I expected more. The characters were quite funny and there were a lot of references to other movies which some I got and some I didn't get. I liked the premise of the movie because it made a statement to the fact that in life, some of us are content just where we are (which is not always a bad thing) and some of figure there is more to life then just our own little environment and want to seek a little more adventure, but be careful where you go to seek adventure because you may or may not be ready for it. I must say though that the only song (the one that Julian the lemur sings)in the movie will stick with you for a while--it's quite catchy!"

","I am an avid fan of animated movies, and in the last few years specifically computer animated movies. I had really great expectations for this movie going in to watch it, and overall I really wasn't too impressed. I was expecting so much more from the DreamWorks folks. The movie looked great, but overall just didn't have the comedy or entertainment factor of some of their other movies. I was able to sit through it, but did get bored. The overall pace of the movie seemed very slow and blah blah. There were some good moments, and definitely some cute characters, but they were too few and far between IMO. Its worth renting, but I wish I would have watched something else at the theater. DreamWorks is gonna have to pick up the pace if they wanna stay up with Disney and Pixar."
"artemis-fowl-sues","4","0","2","31 May 2005"," ...that's it?
","Dream Works tried to atone for the sin that was ""Shark's Tale""...and while I'm delighted to say that most of the characters did not annoy me as much I thought it would (considering that it starred Ben Stiller), and that it had it's funny moments, which all went to the trailer, it falls short.<br/><br/>Unbearably short.<br/><br/>Too short it made me wonder if all of the hype of ""Revenge of the Sith"" had sucked out whatever enthusiasm of the story's writers and made them produce this...so-so piece of comedy. Considering all the hype, that I have seen from the stores, promoting the movie, I had expected to be rolling on the floor, laughing my butt off. Instead I'm left with a few giggles and eye-candy, which seemed to have taken over the movie industry as the saving grace when it comes to BO counts.<br/><br/>Yes, I love that Madagascar looked like some Garden of Eden with cute furry animals, and predictably ugly savage predators and cuddly Mafia-like penguins. Oh, and all of the spoofs (Shrek anyone?) are funny too, except...you know...it came out flat and forced. It seems that DW has decided, ""Hey, since Shrek has made us tonnes of cash, why not try to imitate the same SPOOF formula into the rest of CGI ridden movies?"" and forget that while spoof/parodies can be funny, it gets old...<br/><br/>The sad thing is that, this movie could have gone far. Somehow they have created characters that was quite lovable and there was a really strong chemistry between all four of them. The graphics was out of this world and they've really outdone themselves. Too bad the lack of originality and creativity killed it."
"BibChr","7","0","1","31 May 2005"," Dang! that Pixar is good!
","No, my title isn't a goof. It's just the thought this harmless but mostly uninspired little movie provoked.<br/><br/>Pixar has an ability to wrap up a relatively involved plot, very involving characters, and something for every age-level.<br/><br/>Madagascar is -- well, it's mostly inoffensive, mildly amusing, passably entertaining... and otherwise nothing to crow about. I took my 5 and 9 year old sons, and they enjoyed and laughed. I chuckled once or twice, sat patiently, and kept thinking about how great Pixar is.<br/><br/>The characters are shruggable, the plot is very lightweight, and the overall effect fine for a kids' movie. The penguins more or less steal the show, followed by the lemurs and the monkeys. Problem is, they aren't the stars. The stars are OK, and that's about it. (With any luck, Chris Rock won't be voicing any more kids' movies.) Do I recommend it? Sure, for your kids. But unless you want to go just to financially support a largely unobjectionable feature movie, you won't lose anything by waiting for the DVD.<br/><br/>Put another way, it's just like The Incredibles, or Toy Story I or II -- only without the plot, the main characters, the humor, the wisdom, or the trans-generational valuable subtexts."
"crazychap","6","0","2","30 May 2005"," it's amusing, but not satisfying
","Madagascar is an attempt to re/create the magic of Toy Story-- this Christmas season marks the 10th anniversary of that movie's release--, and attempts to do it with the casting of some of the wittiest and in-demand stars, including Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, that pull of their usual gags and fast-paced jokes {but it still works}. No offence,although this movie guarantees a few laughs which will make you break a dozen courtesy rules, it is seriously miscast and the story just doesn't make any real sense.<br/><br/>Here are a few examples:<br/><br/>1- How would a Zebra, which stands on four legs, would build a bloody house in 5 bloody minutes? Tom Hanks on two legs could not do that in ""Cast away""<br/><br/>2- There are hardly any human characters that have any importance. Apart from the annoying police officers and a Central Park lady announcing the withdrawal of the animals to the wild. Do they serve any purpose? <br/><br/>3- The acting here is measured by the celebrity status of the actors themselves rather than their ability to play the part well. Robin Williams would've done a better job playing the Zebra than Chris Rock since he learned some Drama lessons in his career. Why not, even Hayden Christensen could play the leading role better than the black comedian!<br/><br/>There are more, but I shan't get to them to avoid disappointing the kids and my nephew back at home, who plans to watch it when it commes out on 15 July.<br/><br/>But there are advantages: The movie is, by no means, boring and it does guarantee a good time and is a good choice to send your children to the movies, due to a shortage of family films this summer {Episode III and the Longest Yard as well as other releases are rated PG-13 in the US or 12A here} and the ""Move it, Move it"" mock video in the film is definitely an amusing scene for people of my generation and above.<br/><br/>In the end, this Movie is Better than the mediocre {but nevertheless successful} Shark Tale and the Longest Yard {which came out on the same day as this one}, but, like those two movies, this one is also burdened by an incoherent screenplay, lack of a real plot, and a cast that is inappropriate to perform the emotional scenes.<br/><br/>Lesson Number One, Children: DO NOT hire Chris Rock or Ben Stiller to do Drama scenes!"

","I just saw this movie today (May 27-opening day) and thought it was pretty good. I went with a friend, and it wasn't quite what I expected from the trailers. There were a few elements that were pretty predictable, but that can be expected in a movie. There were many twists too. And who could forget the adorably animals! All in all, though, it was a pretty good movie-with comedy for the whole family. Comedy that little to mid-aged children can enjoy, comedy for teens to enjoy, and comedy that adults can enjoy. Of course, most of the comedy the whole family can enjoy. It was worth the $5.75 I paid to see it, especially since, at 2:50pm on opening day( I get out of school at 2:20), there was only about 15 other people in a new beautiful theater! And, of course, it's always fun to see it with a friend and laugh at parts that may not even be that funny, but it might as well be with two crazy girls! :-)But, is hard to see without family because you want to tell them so much, but you cant spoil it! Oh well, my adorable cockatiel will listen! I would recommend this movie to most people, but there will, as always, be people that wont enjoy it.
