","Cross Of Iron is a masterpiece, one of the greatest anti-war, anti-authoritarian movies. It is one of director Sam Peckinpah's two finest works -- the other being The Wild Bunch. It deserves to be ranked in the same great war movie company as Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, Seven Samurai, and Zulu. Its setting on the World War Two Eastern Front, its gruesomeness, and its risk-taking viewpoint on ugly combat from the German side, have tended to count against fair assessment of its considerable artistic achievements. Viewers wary of the morality of its German viewpoint and its explicitness might find that it is fundamentally about humanity in general as a victim of war. The film reflects on the humanity which may be found on all sides of conflict--including Russian humanity portrayed variously as relentless, innocent, brave, and feminine.<br/><br/>Cross Of Iron opens with an intense, chilling montage of nursery rhyme, propaganda, combat newsreel and atrocity. By the end of the main title the montage subtly introduces the central characters, a German reconnaissance unit patrolling on the 1943 Russian front.<br/><br/>This 1977 film set rarely matched standards of cinematic mayhem. Cross Of Iron explosions don't look merely like pretty fireballs -- they blast fragments, rocks and debris, leaving no doubt as to why blood gouts from stumps of limbs and shrapnel-shredded entrails. Amid the screams of wounded and dying, as dust subsides from a mortar barrage, an artillery piece shorn of its crew by a near hit swings across a pocked battlefield, its traversing wheel spinning under its own momentum. The carnage occurs in the choreographed slow motion which Peckinpah made his signature.<br/><br/>James Coburn turns in one of his finest roles as Rolf Steiner, a highly decorated NCO who leads a German reconnaissance squad. Steiner fights less for his country than for his comrades. He has low opinions of class and rank distinctions. He is contemptuous both of Nazism and the aristocratic Prussian arrogance of his new superior officer, Captain Stransky, played with great style by Maximilian Schell. But there are hints of a dark side. Although Steiner is articulate and philosophical he has no answer when his love interest during an enforced break from battle, nurse Eva (Senta Berger), bitterly accuses him of being afraid of what he would be without the war.<br/><br/>Among the many fine supporting performances, James Mason plays the war-weary Colonel Brandt. He sees the immorality and futility of German war aims, but his sense of honour and duty about the prevailing struggle makes ceasing to fight unthinkable. David Warner plays Brandt's out-of-place and out-of-time adjutant, Captain Kiesel, who represents to his colonel the hope that a more enlightened postwar Germany might arise from the ashes of inevitable defeat.<br/><br/>War movie buffs irritated by the technical inaccuracies common in many examples of the genre will find some satisfaction in attention to authenticity of weaponry. A range of genuine WWII German and Russian small arms appears. The T 34/85 tanks are real, although the very picky might argue that this is at least six months premature, and that for the summer of '43 they should be T 34/76. Tactics at times deviate from the textbooks, but this is a drama, not a combat manual.<br/><br/>At the time of writing, this great film of a great American director lacks the high quality collectors' edition Zone 1 DVD release it deserves. The Warner Home Video Zone 2 release available through www.amazon.co.uk has the high quality video and sound which have been missing from the non-studio Zone 1 releases. This film is a must-have for war movie fans.<br/><br/>Update as at September 2011: It appears that only the DVD and Blu-ray releases of this film for the European market - notably those published by Studio Canal - are good quality transfers, as well as being in the original widescreen aspect ratio. Studio Canal's Blu-ray release (encoded for Region B only) is significantly better even than their DVD. It shows so much more detail compared to the DVD releases, for example, that the lettering and designs of German military awards like the Krim and Kuban Shield shoulder insignia can be seen clearly on screen, and wine and beer bottle labels are easily read. The Blu-ray is available from Amazon.co.uk, but can be played only on Region B-capable Blu-ray decks. Extras on this Blu-ray include a gem, a documentary by Mike Siegel called ""Passion & Poetry - Sam Peckinpah's War"". This gives fascinating insight into the making of ""Cross of Iron"" and Peckinpah's directorial style through contemporary and later interviews with James Coburn, David Warner, Senta Berger, Maximilian Schell, Roger Fritz, Vadim Glowna, Katy Haber and Peckinpah himself. It includes a shot of Peckinpah reminiscing proudly about receiving a telegram from Orson Welles saying it was 'one of the finest war films ever made'."
"Theo Robertson","10","166","186","20 April 2002"," Underrated Classic
","When Nazi Germany invaded The Soviet Union in 1941 it led to the worst carnage in human history . From June 1941 to the final battle of Berlin in April 1945 the conflict between the Nazis and red army cost the lives of 35 million people. IF you look upon the war between Hitler and Stalin as being separate from all the other campaigns of conflict in the second world war then the campaign in Eastern Europe is the bloodiest conflict in the history of mankind. Something that seems very unlikely to be exceeded . Alas however western film makers seem reluctant to acknowledge this . Off the top of my head I can think of only 3 American / European movies to be set on the Eastern front: ENEMY AT THE GATES , STALINGRAD and CROSS OF IRON.<br/><br/>I first saw CROSS OF IRON in 1983 and have seen it umpteen times since then. This is an intelligent anti war classic and I never get bored with it. James Coburn , star of many a forgettable lightweight caper movie is perfect as the cynical Sgt Steiner. For the first time in his career he shows he has presence and probably gives his best performance in any film . James Mason is also good , though you have admit has Mason ever been bad ? but the best performance award goes to Maximillian Schell as the villain of the piece. It`d be all too easy to have Schell as a goosestepping Nazi , but Schell`s character is a Prussian aristocrat opposed to fascist egalitarianism . He dislikes the Nazis almost as much as Steiner does.<br/><br/>That`s one of many good aspects of the script , it`s so thoughtful and with one exception it doesn`t show any of the Germans as out and out idealogue fascists. But notice the couple of ironic touches in the film where people say the excuse of  "" I obey orders. It was none of my doing. I was not responsible "" Something that has been said a lot of times during the last century , and the century before that , and the one before that. Guess if you travelled a thousand years` in the future we`d still be hearing that. I also find the script perfectly paced, CROSS OF IRON lasts nearly two and a half hours but no matter how many times I watch it I never find it dragging in any way. I sometimes watch SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but I only watch the first half hour and last half hour `cos the middle  of SPR is totally tedious. CROSS OF IRON has a much better script.Maybe the battle scenes of SPR are slightly more gory but at best they`re only as good as the ones in this film. I`d say this is Peckinpah`s best film . The editing during the battle scenes are absolutely superb as we see Soviet soldiers in slo mo , Germans in real time, cutting back to Soviets in real time then Germans in slo mo. Then seeing a cross cut with a Soviet and German dying at the same time.<br/><br/>A classic and unforgivably forgotten film set during the worst conflict in history . In my opinion the greatest WW2 film ever surpassing even DAS BOOT"
"JBLOSS","8","108","123","6 July 2001"," Best War Film there is
","I still rate this as the best and most honest war film I've seen. It ignores the Hollywood schmaltz that spoiled Saving Private Ryan and manages to portray the soldiers as human beings and particularly for German soldiers this is an exception. The battle scenes are expansive and very bloody as we follow the German platoon trying to get back to its own lines. The soldiers are heroes in an unheroic war and the film captures the chaos, cynicism and heroism of the German retreat. Well worth checking out."
"Captain_Couth","10","123","143","16 October 2004"," Underrated Anti-War classic from Sam Peckinpah.
","Cross of Iron (1977) was a low budget masterpiece from ace director Sam Peckinpah. After having a falling out from Hollywood, Peckinpah went to Europe to direct this W.W.II. anti-war film. The film centers around Sergent Steiner, a battle weary veteran who leads his company into battle everyday for the past three years. Unlike others his only concern is the survival of his men and the fact that he's a live to live another day. One day an officer of Prussian descent (Maximillian Schnell) decides to make his and everyone beneath him lives miserable. James Mason plays the battle hardened Colonel whilst David Warner co-stars as his cynical aide de camp.<br/><br/>Using the limited time and budget to it's fullest extent, Peckinpah created a very stylish and action packed film. The bullets fly, shells pound the earth and the blood flows. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography perfectly captures the action. The battles are very well staged and the acting is executed very well. James Coburn earned his stripes with this film. He's the man! Senta Berger a Peckinpah veteran from Major Dundee) has a small role as a German nurse who briefly becomes involved with Sergent Steiner. What I liked about this movie was the fact that Coburn, Warner and Mason didn't bother to use fake Teutonic accents.<br/><br/>If you're a viewer of war films or a Peckinpah fan, this has to be on top of your list. This is one hell of an action film. War will never look the same again after watching this film. Sadly the domestic D.V.D. release is not only expensive but of poor quality. Try and find and alternate way of watching this neglected masterpiece. I have to give this film a very high rating.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation possible."
"vimhawk","Null","69","79","2 September 2004"," A Military Favourite
","I can't add much to these reviews except to comment that I've found this film to be a great favourite among real soldiers. I once got to deliver the classic line to a Major and a Captain about hating all officers. Luckily(?) they knew I was quoting from the film!<br/><br/>I'm not bothered about the assortment of accents in the cast (that others have mentioned). It seems to me that if you believe in their situation and have immersed yourself in the film, as it was easy for me to do, then you don't even notice them after a while. I would argue that the cast (in terms of dialogue) in Private Ryan is far more of a problem, since these seem to be 1990s guys transported back to 1944 and are far too 'knowing'. Moreover, in Private Ryan I kept stepping back from the film feeling that I was simply being manipulated by the director. COI is far more chilling. I really liked (if that's the word) a scene where an artillery explosion killed both Germans and Soviets. Kind of emphasises the 'war is hell' message without preaching or being manipulative. <br/><br/>I think Steiner is one of the greatest military characters ever to appear on film (for what its worth, Gregory Peck as Savage in Twelve O'Clock High, and Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain in Gettysburg are also up there). I must say I didn't really like the ending, but I can't suggest a better one, but as an alternate ""ending"" I would certainly recommend that people *do not* see the awful sequel 'Sergeant Steiner' with Richard Burton(!) as Steiner."
"philip_vanderveken","9","68","80","2 March 2005"," If you like (anti-)war movies like All Quiet on the Western Front than this is a movie you shouldn't miss
","I have to admit that I had some reserves about this movie before watching it. Although my mother told me this is one of her favorite war movies ever (yes I know, it may sound a bit strange, but we have the same taste for war movies), I also saw a rather bad score on IMDb (about 6.6 at the time). Well, now that I've seen it, I can only say that this movie will be in my top 5 of war movies. This movie shows war the way it actually is: dirty, deadly, tragic,... and with plenty of losers, but no winners. In this movie you won't find any glorification of fake patriotism or dying for a good cause that only politicians in their ivory towers seem to know. No, this movie shows the war in its purest and most horrifying form.<br/><br/>It brings us the story of Rolf Steiner, a veteran hardened by the war, who leads his men through every battle and dangerous situation, but who also takes care that they will survive the madness. Than a Prussian officer, who volunteered to leave the quiet, battle-free world of France for the real action in Russia, joins his fighting group. The man thinks of only one thing: to get an iron cross as fast as possible, so his family can be proud and shouldn't see him as a disgrace to their military tradition. This leads to a lot of problems between the two of course and gradually the tension cumulates until it explodes... <br/><br/>I don't know if the story is based on true facts, but the movie certainly gives a good idea of what the war at the Eastern Front was like, especially after the Germans had suffered a major loss in Stalingrad. They had to retread, but had to take care that they didn't get overwhelmed by the Soviet troops when doing so; a lot of the man had lost faith in victory; no prisoners were taken, but were shot at the spot; optimism had made place for cynicism ... It all feels very real and believable.<br/><br/>And the feeling of realism can also be found in the way of filming. Some might say Peckinpah experimented too much with slow-motion, hand-held camera's,... but personally I believe it only gives an extra dimension to this movie, giving it that extra touch that makes it different from so many mediocre Hollywood productions. I really liked the way he followed the action closely, making you feel like you are part of it yourself, but what really sparked my interest was the contrast between the child's voice singing a ""happy"" song and the images of the horrors of the war at the beginning and the end of the movie. That really made shivers go down my spine.<br/><br/>If I thought about anti-war movies, I always used to name the World War I classic ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" (the 1930 version as well as the remake from 1979), but from now on I'll have to add one extra movie: Cross of Iron. If you are a fan of realistic (anti-)war movies, than this is a movie you shouldn't miss. I give it a 9/10."
"bsmith5552","8","62","74","23 October 2001"," Gritty Realistic WWII Drama
","""Cross of Iron"" was Sam Peckinpah's only war movie. It deals with a  company of German soldiers retreating through Russia at the close of  Hitler's ill-fated Russian campaign. Unusual for a war film,  the story is told from the German point of view.  Being a Peckinpah film there are explosions and blood-spurting bodies  a-plenty. The rough terrain and cramped quarters that the soldiers have  to deal with lend well to the declining German fortunes in Russia. As  in his other films, notably ""The Wild Bunch"", Peckinpah utilizes his  now famous slow-motion technique to illustrate the violence and show  the effects of the destruction.  James Coburn stars as the battle wise Sgt. Steiner who has survived the  war thus far by his wits. Maximillian Schell plays his aristocratic  Captain whose main goal is the pursuit of the Iron Cross, Germany's  highest decoration and who will go to any lengths to get it. James  Mason is the Company commander and David Warner is his adjutant.  Coburn is excellent in the lead who continues to do his duty in spite  of the inevitability of impending defeat. Schell is suitably ambitious  and cunning as the chief villain and Mason and Warner convey the  hopelessness of the situation while maintaining stiff upper lips.  ""Cross of Iron"", in it's uncut version (132 minutes) ranks as one of  the greatest of all WWII films in my opinion. One of Peckinpah's best."
"Nick Beaudine","9","53","64","3 March 2005"," And I will show you where the Iron Crosses grow.
","This is one of those movies that I needed to watch a second time and do a little research on. Once again, ""Bloody"" Sam didn't let me down. This is definitely a different war film from its time and now. Peckinpah's directed this in a great fashion that hasn't been seen I have not seen his films since ""The Wild Bunch"". I was lucky enough to have found the 133 minute version in a rental store. I hope one day to see this version on DVD in widescreen. James Coburn is once again in a great role as Steiner. He is also supported by the great James Mason, Maximillian Schell in his best role since ""Judgment at Nuremberg"", and David Warner. The film had some fine editing and slow motion shots, good underscore, and a solid script. It is a tragedy that Peckinpah went so over budget that they had to end the movie half way through the script. I hope one day that somebody will remake this in the eyes of Peckinpah, and be able to film the entire film."
"vnieminen","Null","15","16","8 January 2002"," The Russian Front
","I first saw this movie when I was very young and it has since then remained as one of the best movies I have seen and perhaps the best war movie ever. My grandfather fought and died in the useless war against the Russians in 45 and one of my uncles as well as my mothers father were both veterans of those battles. The Germans who fought alongside the Finns in World War II were not heartless nazi monsters or a band of murderous aryans - they were men who had been taken from their homes to fight a pointless war which destroyed everything and gave nothing. Peckinpah portrays this in a truthful way when the German patrol tries to make its way back to their army group. The scene where Anselm rips a Russian female soldiers shirt in an attempt to rape her before being stopped be Steiner is something never before or after seen in a movie - a seemingly friendly and well behaving man turns into a beast when he sees a woman from the enemy army. War is hell and it brings out the best and worst in us - something that Hollywood should remember before making the next Saving Private Ryan."
"barnabyrudge","Null","67","83","2 December 2002"," Astounding!
","Cross of Iron is probably the second best film made by Sam Peckinpah, rivalled only by The Wild Bunch. It is a war film shich follows a unit of German soldiers as they escape from the front line as the Russians smash through their ranks. This was perhaps the most devastating line to be fighting on during World War Two, and as expected there is a lot of death and gore, not to mention filth, sweat and treachery.<br/><br/>James Coburn plays a German soldier with an almost God-like air of invincibility about him. He is not a comic book creation, but a hardened soldier who terrifies everybody, including his commanding officers. Max Schell plays a commanding officer who wants an Iron Cross, despite the fact that he a coward, and will go to the most treacherous lengths to get it.<br/><br/>This is an upsetting and unflinching film. It pre-dates Saving Private Ryan by two decades, yet is just as detailed and frightening, just as bloody, and maybe even better.<br/><br/>Anyone yet to see Cross of Iron must do so as soon as possible. It is one of the great war films, and an unforgettably chilling experience."
"KenLiversausage","10","14","15","8 October 2003"," The finest anti-war film ever made?
","** Possible minor spoilers **<br/><br/>""The finest anti-war film ever made,"" according to Orson Welles, who knew a little bit about movies himself, and I for one won't disagree. Cross of Iron has its flaws - the incongruity of some of the casting and accents, several sloppily-directed scenes, occasional bouts of pretentiousness - but nevertheless it is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Sam Peckinpah was heavily in the grip of terminal alcoholism when he made this film, and it shows. The sure touch and tight control of script, action and editing he showed in The Wild Bunch (easily his best film, one of the ten best films ever in fact; don't believe anyone who tells you otherwise) are not consistent here, but individual sequences, such as the initial attack on the machine gun bunker, are vintage Sam.<br/><br/>What makes this film great is the savagery of its bleak, existential anti-war sentiments. By showing the battle at the Russian front from the perspective of the ""enemy"", ie Steiner's German platoon, Cross of Iron avoids patriotic cliché and forces us to confront deep-seated prejudices. By the time they are slaughtered at the climax, we do genuinely care about Steiner's men, to the extent that we exult in Steiner's clinical execution of the agent of their murders. The real punch comes right at the very end of the film, during the last part of the end credits: a succession of slides depicting wartime atrocities, including the hanging of children in concentration camps, is projected onto the screen, the sound of the projector mimicking that of a gun being loaded. Overlaid on this is the sound of ebbing manic laughter - Steiner's? - the cruel commentary of a man worn down by constant immersion in man's cruelty to his fellows.<br/><br/>Somebody here criticises this film because the battle scenes are ""confusing"" and ""hard to follow"". Well for goodness sake, isn't that what war is like? Confusing, chaotic, frightening, Peckinpah's elliptical battle scenes, with their distorted sound, dull colours and surreal, disorientating photography, plunge us into the centre of hell in a way Spielberg's technically proficient but emotionally vacuous Saving Private Ryan never does. At the end of the film, watch how Peckinpah shoots the doomed platoon members in telephoto close-up, an effect which serves to flatten their images against the screen, dislocating them from their environment.<br/><br/>Not the greatest of Peckinpah, but a great film. And even average Peckinpah is better than the best that modern Hollywood usually offers."

","Hey guys, all those of you who say ""Saving Private Ryan was better"". Of course it was (in some ways).<br/><br/>But it was also filmed 21 years later, in a modern GCI reality, with this film as one of the foundation stone on which it was built.<br/><br/>SPR used obvious cardboard tanks and Hollywood ""stars"". COI used real equipment and actors who could act, not just pose.<br/><br/>COI did the action shots with real effects, real explosions. SPR did a lot with digital technology. Of course it's a snappier, smoother visual experience, but it has 2 decades of heritage and technology to prop it up.<br/><br/>In my Opinion, COI is one of the 3 best war films of all time. Apocalypse Now had a huge budget in the modern era - COI had 5 yugoslav tanks, and comes a VERY close second. {Don't ask me to pick the third, right now. I have several options, but COI and An are head and shoulders above the rest.} Steiner is a performance of a lifetime for Coburn - should've been an Oscar, IMHO.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I watch several times a year, as a calibration for the other stuff, and for pure fun.<br/><br/>Buy it, watch it, and watch it again, and again..."
"slorta","9","14","16","24 February 2007"," Unrelenting and unforgettable
","I had read reviews of cross of iron well before my recent viewing of this incredible masterpiece on our local TV station during the small hours. None have given this remarkable film any justice. No war film is so unrelenting in portraying just a small sector of the largest conflict in history. With pitiless carnage from start to finish, one wonders how any who were drafted to fight on the eastern front could survive such inferno after so many written accounts of the brutality and suffering of eastern front warfare are made visual in this film. I can't believe the compassion I could feel for the characters considering the age of the film compared with the bubblegum war films of that era. The mosaic opening scene entwining images of the phoenix rise of Germany, prosperity and incredible evil against a child's nursery rhyme left me cold. No one could have any romantic notions of modern warfare after sitting through this film.<br/><br/>This film satisfied something in me that has brooded for a long time. I have grown physically ill of films that portray German soldiers as useless cattle that were mercilessly butchered by brave American\British supermen. The soldiers of all sides were largely boys not a lot different to each other. All sides in the conflict had their brave and humane Steiners or their callous and evil Stransky's, even those who fought to rid the world of the heinous Nazi's. Cross of Iron's closest contemporary in terms of visual repulsion and subject matter - Saving Private Ryan is simply another Hollywood Dirty Dozen in shiny new clothes. It portrays rank and file Germans and their soldiers as hideous Nazi's and paves the way throughout the film for Spielberg to inflict a glorified orgy of death upon them in the final scene which can only be described as a very personal fantasy for the director that unfortunately we are all now privy to. The image where rays of light bathe an American soldier who has murdered a surrendered prisoner like some kind of suggestive sainthood is disgraceful and who knows how many are influenced by this kind of vicious manipulation of film-making. Cross of Iron shows the wholesale slaughter of all humans in war and the increasingly hopeless situation of all involved is a physical strain upon the viewer. There is no better anti-war film."
"tom-darwin","8","14","16","12 August 2006"," Fine Film Built Around 'a Piece of Worthless Metal'
","I saw this film in 1993 at 29 Palms in the Marines. It was selected as a training film for the entire company by my platoon leader who wanted to depict the leadership qualities of the noncommissioned officer & the cohesion of small units. It got a tepid reception from Marines, then enamored of sci-fi actioners & the sardonic 'Full Metal Jacket,' who thought the scenes of male bonding were sappy, or 'gay.' Nor did the company commander seem to appreciate Peckinpah's anti-establishment tone. Anti-establishment is really the best description of 'Cross of Iron' rather than anti-war and, though it is his only real war film, holds to the dark theme of government/corporation vs. manly individualist that marked most major Peckinpah films. The story follows ace platoon NCO Steiner (Coburn) as he holds together his elite but war-weary men & deals with his officers: wise Colonel Brandt (Mason), dissolute adjutant Kiesel (Warner), heroic Lt. Meier (Galo) and weaselly Lt. Triebig (Fritz). Hardest to deal with is his company commander, the ambitious, arrogant Captain Stransky (Schell) who transferred from the comfort of France to the horrors of the East to, as Kiesel notes, achieve 'spiritual domination' of the war, symbolized by his obsession with winning the Iron Cross. Significantly, most of the experienced soldiers, including all the other officers, have already won the Iron Cross while Meier & Steiner, Stransky's subordinates, are highly decorated. Though not well known in English, Heinrich's book is a World War II counterpart to 'All Quiet on the Western Front' as it starkly depicts a German soldier's struggle to remain human through the horrors of Total War & the prospect of Total Defeat. Heinrich is a bit awkward & preachy compared to Remarque & this comes through in the film, notably in scenes with the officers. For a film with a modest budget, it's pretty long, accentuating the preachiness. The impressive multinational cast suffers from the necessity of putting English-speaking stars in the main roles. Only Coburn & Warner make even slight attempts at German accents. Coburn depicts, rather than details, Steiner, using his wicked smile & humor sparingly while bringing to life a talented, tortured individual torn between his hatred of war, love for his friends & his fear of leaving the only world he knows. Mason is, as usual, both nuanced & commanding. Schell is fine as the pompous captain but only gets a chance to show his tremendous talent when Stransky is manipulative, notably the scene in which he blackmails Triebig. The fine Senta Berger gets little chance to develop nurse Eva. The soldiers are all scruffy to the point of ugliness, a Peckinpah feature discarded in the body-by-Soloflex action films made from the 1980s onward. Peckinpah had refined his trademark touches to a fine point. There's the brotherly love the men share without being 'gay' as well as their conflicted attitude toward women, at once desiring, worshiping & fearing them. The contrast of hardened, jaded veterans with innocent youth, first explored in ""The Wild Bunch,"" permeates 'Cross of Iron' in Steiner's interaction with the Russian boy (Prohic) & Private Dietz (Nowka), the latter playing a 'kid's game' of avoiding sunlight as the platoon is about to make an attack. Like 'The Wild Bunch,' the film has a bizarre but engrossing opening montage, featuring war & Nazi footage mixed with band music & a German child's rhyme. Above all is the theme of resistance to oppressive authority. Steiner rejects the bullying of Stransky but also the condescending sympathy of Brandt & Kiesel, which he hates just as much, and expresses disdain for all 'medal scavengers.' Two new Peckinpah features: a surrealist motif including flashbacks & fantasies, and an overt political tone driven home by photos of Vietnam & a Brecht quote in the closing montage. The action scenes, especially the slow-motion effects, are as good as any by Peckinpah. Considering the low budget, they should be the stuff of legend, featuring extraordinary photography & precise, correct detail. Peckinpah's operatic violence contrasts with the crushing, unmanning action depicted in versions of 'All Quiet in the Western Front.' To balance making a film about the most demonized military machine in history, Peckinpah is at pains to depict ALL the major German characters, even Stransky, as anti-Nazi. Stransky declares himself a Prussian aristocrat, Steiner is openly disdainful of a SS soldier & Brandt lays plans for the existence of Germany after the Nazis. The platoon soldiers wear a mishmash of uniform, civilian clothes & pilfered Soviet items, further de-Nazifying them. This is probably Peckinpah's gloomiest film except 'Alfredo Garcia'--which is pretty gloomy--but it lacks the exquisitely artful darkness of 'Apocalypse Now.' Then again, Heinrich's book isn't 'Heart of Darkness.' If you can watch 'All Quiet,' 'Cross' & 'Apocalypse' all in one day without abandoning all hope, then you're as cheerful as Pippi Longstocking. 'Cross of Iron' is a unique work, either as a war film, an action movie or even a Peckinpah work."
"rylojr1977","10","13","15","3 May 2007"," War with the emphasis on ""raw""
","Scanning through some of the (very few) harsh reviews of this film, it's hard to believe that some people who profess to enjoying intelligent, groundbreaking cinema didn't actually like it. My advice: Go rent out a Michael Bay / Bruckheimer film....something like Pearl Harbor. That will be more to your tastes I imagine.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron is the kind of film that scars you mentally. I remember seeing it at a young age on British television in the early 80's, and being totally blown away by it. There are so many visually memorable things about it that stay in your head long after viewing it.....the hypnotic, kinetic camera work, the astonishing, stream-of-consciousness editing style, the grimy, blood, mud & s**t-smeared battlefields that feel almost like the great war rather than WW2.<br/><br/>Of course, great visuals are nothing when they are not married to a great story. The tale is deceptively simple - a recon unit of the Werhmacht is desperately fighting for survival and escape, against the seemingly endless waves of vengeful Russian forces in the immediate aftermath of Stalingrad. The unit is headed by Steiner (James Coburn, never better), a dead-eyed, worn-out Corporal who cares nothing for the Third Reich, the Furher and the army officers, only for his platoon of unwashed, burnt out and cynical troops. His men idolise him for his fearlessness and decisiveness in combat, and as a group they make a deadly and efficient fighting force. The unit is thrown into chaos by the arrival of Captain Stransky (a wonderfully slimy Maximillian Schell), a vain aristocratic officer who is deep down a coward, but is driven forward by his desire to gain an Iron Cross - something which sets him in immediate conflict with Stiener and his unit. Steiner ridicules Stransky's insane desire for a medal as he already has several - ""it's just a piece of worthless metal"". Stransky however will stop at nothing, even turning on his own forces, to gain an Iron Cross. Thus a deadly circle of sacrifice, mistrust, betrayal, judgement and redemption is set in motion.<br/><br/>The fact that the main protagonists are German and the ""villans"" (as such) are Russians is the first of many surprises in the film that defy Hollywood convention. It is risk-taking like this that very rarely happens in modern cinema.<br/><br/>As for the performances.....James Coburn's face expresses more in the flicker of an eyebrow and an enigmatic half-smile/half-frown than the likes of Hanks, Affleck, Cage etc could summon over an entire film. The supporting cast are also excellent. Schell is great as the cowardly Captain Stransky. David Warner and James Mason also excel in small but well observed and minutely detailed roles. Steiner's unit is a group of extraordinary actors. Many look as though they have been plucked from a spaghetti western - battered features, grimy unshaved faces, leering faces. Throughout the film there is a real sense of the actors functioning as a ""combat unit"" - Peckinpah obviously enjoyed being a part of the group and encouraged them to bounce off each other. This is especially evident in the bunker scenes when they are shown not as faceless killing machines but as human soldiers - joking, farting, drinking, at ease. This contrasts sharply when they are on the battlefield, and they become almost animalistic in their struggle to survive.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are truly amazing - the now trademark Peckinpah cross-cutting, slow-motion and multiple points-of-view are evident throughout Watching them now, you can see where the likes of John Woo, James Cameron and definitely Oliver Stone picked up many motifs and ideas.<br/><br/>If you have any serious love for cinema, are jaded by the standard jingoistic bulls**t that Hollywood churns out, and want to discover a film that will stay with you for a long time after you have viewed it, then I recommend that you make the effort to seek this out. If any film deserved the special edition re-issue treatment, this is it.<br/><br/>Stransky: ""All right......I accept. I'll show you how a Prussian Officer can fight!!"" Steiner: ""And I'll show you....where the iron crosses grow!"""

","Cross of Iron is not like your typical WW2, where German soldiers are portrayed as robots, or clones with no personalities or thoughts.<br/><br/>Sam Peckinpah does a great job in letting the viewer see how these German soldiers thought. How they worried about their buddies, how they disliked they superior officers, how, they fought for their comrades, as opposed to fighting for Hitler, as historians would have you believe.<br/><br/>Stg. Steiner, played by the late James Coburn, is a very disillusioned German soldier, who doesn't care about moving in the ranks. He is concerned with the safety of his platoon. When Captain Stransky, played by Maximillian Schell, takes over as their commanding officer, Steiner is quick to dislike him. Stransky is seen by Steiner as an iron-cross-seeking jackal, who cares only about obtain said medal, even if it cost the lives of the men.<br/><br/>The war scenes are awesome...chaotic ...just like real war. Both sides take casualties equally. The book, by Willi Heinrich, who he himself fought in the Eastern Front, is well written and I highly recommended it to any one who likes movies of this material."

","In 1943, in the Russian front, the decorated leader Rolf Steiner (James Coburn) is promoted to Sergeant after another successful mission. Meanwhile the upper-class and arrogant Prussian Captain Hauptmann Stransky (Maximilian Schell) is assigned as the new commander of his squad. After a bloody battle of Steiner's squad against the Russian troops led by the brave Lieutenant Meyer (Igor Galo) that dies in the combat, the coward Stransky claims that he led his squad against the Russian and requests to be awarded with the Iron of Cross to satisfy his personal ambition together with his aristocratic family. Stransky gives the names of Steiner and of the homosexual Lieutenant Triebig (Roger Fritz) as witnesses of his accomplishment, but Steiner, who has problems with the chain of command in the army and with the arrogance of Stransky, refuses to participate in the fraud. When Colonel Brandt (James Mason) gives the order to leave the position in the front, Stransky does not retransmit the order to Steiner's squad, and they are left alone surrounded by the enemy and having to fight to survive.<br/><br/>The impact of ""Iron Cross"" in the 70's was amazing and even thirty years later and having watched this movie for the third time, it is still one of the best war movies of the 70's. The story disclosed from the German side, showing German soldiers as human beings was quite unusual in that decade. James Coburn has one of the best performances in his filmography, in the role of an experienced rebel soldier from the lower classes, hardened by the war, but committed with his subordinates and exerting a perfect leadership. On the other side, Maximilian Schell is also perfect in the role of an arrogant aristocrat aiming only be awarded with a medal and capable to step on his men. The scenarios and the action scenes are awesome, and the battles have an amazing choreography, with Sam Peckinpah still in good shape. Senta Berger has a minor participation, but her beauty was impressive, and I believe this was the last time that I saw a movie with this actress. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Cruz de Ferro"" (""The Iron Cross"")"

","I saw some of the comments on this movie, and I shook my head in disbelief...this is perhaps the best WW2 movie ever made, and I'm in good company in recommending this film; Orson Welles said ""Cross Of Iron"" was the best film about fighting men ever made.<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" may get tons of plaudits, but apart from a diligent art department getting hold of the proper uniforms and equipment, and the docu-drama camera-work, Spielberg's work is just another one of his cheesefests with a visceral opening scene. ""Cross Of Iron"" captures the cynicism, the inner conflicts and the bleakness of war on the Eastern Front. Peckinpah's style of slow motion cross cutting works excellently here and for history buffs, the uniforms and equipment are spot on (real T-34 tanks, not American Shermans or Pattons painted up). Top Hollywood actors such as Coburn and Mason blend in very well with a great German supporting cast (Klaus Lowitsch as the unit slob, Corporal Kruger, is particularly good) but it's the ever excellent David Warner who steals every scene.<br/><br/>Those who say ""this isn't a good film"" really need their tastes re-examining."
"papasergey","9","5","5","6 August 2015"," Germany against all!
","This is the first time I have, eager to 'know the enemy', not given a damn about the feud with the 'Axis' warriors of the World War II and have watched a film — regarding the position of the opposing force. What affected my choice, was, perhaps, the current situation, when, with the outbreak of the most recent war, I have been getting more and more uneasy about the thought, that the previous war was, in fact, far less unambiguous than the banal cliché 'Great Partiotic War', what we call it in Russia meaning homespun truth: 'we had been under attack — so we stroke back'. In actual fact, the USSR just certainly participated in the most awful war of all time. And that was participation to full capacity, our land was lucky to have so much human and economic resources, that, paying little attention to casualties and even speaking about colossal casualties need with a plump 'YES'... In the both world wars' history there were neither the right nor the wrong, neither the defenders nor the aggressors, neither the conscientious nor the deceitful. What there were, was just overcrowded battlefields and tremendous massacres due to the super-powerful military blocs' confrontation. And Germany was against all. It is not just German propaganda! Because saying that Japan and Italy sufficiently helped the Reich to achieve, by 1942, impressing spreading over the larger part of Europe, from Norway, France, and Greece, eastwards to the Lower Volga, — would be, quite sure, a hypocrisy. The Germans (there is no denying their fantastic fighting spirit and self-denial), under their Führer, Hitler, an Austrian himself actually, would indeed approach the Superpower status — only to be eventually pulled up and occupied by the wartime allies whose coalition, however, dissolved shortly after. The former have gone down in history as the monstrous evil fanatics, tormentors of peoples, and what of it? image of the enemy (especially of the shattered one) is likely to be demonised, and since the war was the most monstrous one, the demonisation was likely to reach the unparalleled extent. Jews, alas, have always been destroyed; antisemitism has still not ceased to exist. Shootings of civilian population and property destruction by advancing or retreating troops used to take place on any war and still does. When the war was over, the German and the Japanese rulers were dismissed and they were in the dock, accused of 'war crimes', but that was because the winner is always right and judges the beaten. Just a decorum of diplomacy. I even wonder why so many people still believe that was really a holy violence and a fair trial. And the current war, Donbass war, must wipe out the rose-coloured view of victory in the anti-Nazi war, as Nazism then was not a simple and unambiguous enemy, and there was no deathnail for it then. Today, some heavy-metal songs from the turn of the 1980s and 1990s are extremely topical again. As they describe bombing; warn that just as decades ago the Nazi Germany recarved the map of Europe, sparks of crematory fire of death camps are still visible; narrate the stories of hirelings of dirty tricks and monkey business. In fact, I, just a teenager that time, foresaw that revanchism, that came up in our pluralism age together with any other 'dissenting opinions', would lead to no good... But the Germans are just the ones who least of all stick to their demands in this regard! And the world is lucky to have SUCH Germans today, as otherwise, it might be a World War III with once more 'Germany against all' - and doomsday! However, Germany at the moment needs revanchism like one needs a hole in the head. Who eulogise it, are rulers of Eastern European states as it is a safe bet of giving up everything that connects with Russia, the parent state, and that is none of Germany's business. But how are we Russians going to solve the current pending problem, — that is the challenge. We would be lucky to have the majority once again, as in 1941, been convinced of being victorious: 'victors need never explain'... But what if not?..<br/><br/>Having grounded the significance and topicality of this film, I am going to describe its advantages. This old film measures itself against many modern war films as well as it is still thrilling-to-watch. Almost no 'tall tale' but striking accent when meeting almost any Russian characters (bit parts). Why not involve Russians in auding. There have always been millions of those abroad ('Iron Curtain' is also just a cliché shown to the best advantage by certain circle, isn't it?). The female unit episode is certainly a shocksploitation, but there is a black sheep in every flock. And why, the Western filmmakers showed the Soviet female warrior not just as an abusive woman who immediately laid her arms down and gave in to the Germans. Instead, this composite character is shown as a female hero who combats the enemy many times superior, ready to sell her life and honour dearly...<br/><br/>But the Germans are main characters here. They are neither protagonists here, nor those who are praised and white-washed. We see them such as they must have been on that war. Soviet posters showed them next to trench rats with arms round each other, and quite similar to each other, and that was not just propaganda. No military bearing in the war: it is at the parade where a fighter is clean-shaven, and wears full-dress uniform, and is in blanched boots! While in trenches, even the question of insignia is often of no importance. (Because an officer who keeps subordination too zealously takes chances to have his own soldiers got rid of him). So some exclusively brave Wehrmacht soldiers would wear trophy Red Army garments, give higher commanders a piece of mind, pardon Soviet captives and even exchange defeatist views, wishing Hitler himself 'kaputt'!"

","In 1943, the German front is retreating from the Taman' Peninsula on the Black Sea. Enter Captain Stransky, an ambitious Prussian aristocratic officer, who aims to win himself the Iron Cross. However, his plans are stymied by Corporal Steiner, an implacable but battle-weary platoon leader, who sees no glory in medals. Meanwhile, the Russians are advancing ever closer ...<br/><br/>There are very few Second World War films featuring Germans as the protagonists, and the ones that do are often amongst the best. This is a great, bloody, primal scream of a war film; bitter, cynical, heart-breaking, vicious and completely devoid of sentiment. There is no honour, no morality, only drudgery, fear and loathing. The soldiers' only loyalties are to each other and to staying alive, not to their leaders or their country, and the commissioned officers care only for their own rank and power. Steiner, a brilliant and decorated leader, has an astounding speech where he reveals his unrepenting hatred for all officers and for the wehrmacht - it is an incredible moment of resentment against anyone who would pursue a military agenda or attempt to glorify warfare. The cast are excellent, particularly Warner as the philosophical Captain Kiesel and Loewitsch as Kruger, the platoon second-in-command. The action is brilliantly photographed by John Coquillon (the explosion-filled battle scenes were shot in Yugoslavia), and features Peckinpah's trademark brilliant editing, all jump-cut shots from different times and scenes interspersed with amazingly unsettling effect. Written by Walter Kelley, James Hamilton and Julius Epstein (the screenwriter of Casablanca), from the book Das Fleisch Bereitwillig by Willi Heinrich, this Anglo-German coproduction by a truly great maverick director is one of the most powerful war films ever made."
"tbyrne4","10","8","10","15 July 2006"," My new favorite war film!!
","Wow!!! Just got finished watching Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"". It totally blew me away. I'd resisted seeing it for years even though I am a big Peckinpah fan because it's considered one of his ""lesser"" films. I can't imagine why. This film is amazing. Easily one of the grittiest, dirtiest, dingiest, most insane war movies I've ever encountered.<br/><br/>In my experience, the really great war films have a tendency to be either cerebral and textural (""Hell is for Heroes"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Thin Red Line"", ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Paths of Glory"") or kinetic and adrenalized (""Apocalypse Now"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Deer Hunter""). Of course, most films kind of jump the barrier here and there, but usually you can make a distinction. ""Cross of Iron"" combines the two as well as any film I have seen. It also has the added (peculiar) distinction of being one of the only WWII war films with German protagonists.<br/><br/>Coburn totally commands the screen as the brilliant Steiner, a platoon Sergeant who hates officers and war but feels a strong obligation to his men, who love him and trust his leadership. The mid-way point battle scene in this film where the Russians invade the bunker completely blew me away. I was not expecting something so absolutely insane. This ranks up there with the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Highly recommended"
"esbenpost","9","6","7","4 October 2001"," One of the best (anti)war movies ever
","If all your knowledge about WWII came from the big screen and Hollywood movies, you would get the impression that the second world war mainly was fought in France and the Pacific Ocean, and that the russian front only was a minor happening. The truth is, that 9 out of 10 soldiers in WWII fell in Russia, and that Germany and the German army was long defeated at the time the allied troops landed in Normandy. The question of course is: why hasn't there been made more movies about the war between Hitler and Stalin ? And the answer is: because Hollywood needs bad guys and good guys, and the war in Russia was fought between nazis and communists, who were all bad (or so it seems). Or in other words: the truth just is'nt good entertainment!! In the Cross of Iron Sam Peckinpah has made an astonishing honest and realistic movie about what it was like to be in the front line of the bloodiest war of this century - if not ever. And he shows, that war at the end of the day never is about the ideologies, strategies, the generals or even the head of states - in this case Stalin and Hitler - but about ordinary people struggling to survive. The fighting scenes in the movie are just as brilliant as in f.ex. Saving Private Ryan, and the story is much better, more realistic and without spielbergs obvious flaws. There are no heroes, no saints in this movie. The main character is the war, and what it does to people. In other words: forget The guns of Navarrone, Where eagles dare, The heroes of the Telemark and all those horrible Hollywood movies about how the English and American saved Europe from Hitler (they maybe saved Europe from Stalin - but certainly not from Hitler!!!). Watch the Cross of Iron instead. In my opnioin it is Peckinpah's best, and maybe the best war movie ever. 9/10"
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","9","5","6","8 August 2008"," Unconventional and strong war film
","It is plain to see why so many films and stories about World War II have the Germans be the bad-guys. They are either vile bad-guys or faceless bad-guys and both types of bad-guy are gunned down in large numbers as if they were emotionless unfeeling robots. ""Cross of Iron"" strikes a different and uncommon note by showing them from the point of view we see the typical good guys. In fact, we see their point of view. There are still Germans getting shot at, blown up by artillery shells, but we're right there with them. Seeing through the same perspective as someone else is a powerful motivator for sympathy and if this film demonstrates any one thing it is that war is hell but it is vital to see that it is hell for all those stuck in the middle of it.<br/><br/>""Cross of Iron"" takes place in one small part of the Eastern Front of World War II, it is not really important where since the film is not about the war itself. There is no mention of a military strategy and how the protagonists fit and then how they fight to achieve what their superiors ordered. The film is about the people who fight for reasons that are often beyond them, but they are the ones who know the reality of war while most others are completely delusional to it. They simply have no way of knowing since they are not in the midst of it. This thought sets up the films central conflict with Cpl Steiner, a battle hard soldier facing the delusions of a medal hungry officer assigned as his new commander.<br/><br/>An element of the film that sticks out is its fascinating use of slow motion quick cut sequences. On the surface these seem to accentuate the violence with bursting bloody wounds, but they are actually vital to Steiner's perspective. The story as told through his point of view is literally his point of view. As the battle hardened veteran who has survived many battles he is more acute as to what is going on, he has a sixth sense of sorts, and thus is able to survive. As any great film this element of choreography and editing isn't just for showing off fancy film making technique, it is woven into the story itself. The film simply pulls no cheap tricks and is not afraid to show war as a nasty place where men on both sides often die from the same artillery barrage, children die, both sides brutalize others, etc...<br/><br/>To top it off, James Coburn gives a great lead performance and David Warner, who never quite made it to stardom, has a great supporting role. --- 9/10<br/><br/>BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence"
"SgtSlaughter","10","5","6","7 November 2002"," Brutally Honest WWII Masterpiece
","REVIEW OF THE REGION 2 DVD FROM STUDIO CANAL<br/><br/>In 1976, audiences witnessed John Sturges' entertaining and appealing look at World War II from the German point of view in ""The Eagle has Landed"". A year later, ""Cross of Iron"" was a released. Sam Peckinpah's venture into the boots of the German soldier is a much more honest, downbeat and brutal tale. While ""The Eagle has Landed"" is a story of pure heroism, ""Cross of Iron"" is a depressing take on the horrors of war. This film proves that infantry soldiers are usually just men fighting for survival, no matter what uniform they wear.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1943, the German Army is on the retreat in Russia. They're low on supplies, food and ammunition; the Reds are advancing in overwhelming numbers. Enter Prussian aristocrat Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell) an ambitious and inexperienced officer who firmly believes in German patriotism and spirit. His superiors, Colonel Brandt (James Mason) and Captain Kiesel (David Warner) dismiss him as arrogant and disillusioned; gradually, the true source of his ignorance is revealed to be madness. In contrast is Sergeant Steiner (James Coburn), the hero of the piece. Steiner will prove that Stransky is an incompetent coward, and though Stransky comes to realize this, he refuses to admit it. The film follows a series of arguments and conversations regarding class difference, as the two men bait each other and grow to hate each other.<br/><br/>The conflict between Steiner and Stransky is a microcosm of the war around them. Every one of their encounters is either borne out of or cut off by vicious combat of some sort. How important is Stransky's madness within the greater madness of a World War? From the moment Stransky appears, he is the villain. He's freshly shaved and clad in a clean uniform, ordering dirty infantrymen to push his luggage-laden motorcycle out of a mud hole. His first meeting with Brandt and Kiesel defines his character: he jumps when artillery shells burst outside a cramped bunker, yet meticulously combs his gel-covered hair as he defies Brandt's opinion that the war has already been lost. We've seen five minutes of film, and we've already chalked Stransky up as an arrogant idiot. Unlike typical characters, though, Stransky's disillusionment grows throughout the piece, until a nail-biting climax involving a Russian assault on a rubble-strewn German rail yard, the outcome of which is never clearly determined.<br/><br/>Steiner and his men are the heroes of this film. They're dirty, underfed and fighting for their own survival. Their only loyalty is to each other. The Fatherland and higher callings don't matter  when Stransky has a member of an SS squad transferred to Steiner's unit, the Sergeant promptly puts him in his place as a fellow infantryman. The difference between Nazis and ordinary men is drawn with bold, unmistakable strokes. Steiner's hate for all officers never appears less than genuine. He considers them to be career soldiers whose only aim is to make war. Kiesel actually makes this point late in the film when Brandt asks him, ""What we will do after the war?"" to which Kiesel replies, ""Prepare for the next one."" Perhaps Steiner's view is unfair, but he sees Stransky as inept, and in the middle of a retreat, Brandt and Kiesel busy themselves with a formal investigation into Stransky's conduct. Perhaps a little more than the stake of the officer corps' reputation is at stake, eh? Something a bit more significant, like men's lives? Steiner's dedication to his brothers-in-arms shines through even when he is not in their presence. During an interlude at a hospital, he has a hallucination in which he pictures several of the patients as members of his squad. When one of them really does show up, he elects to return to combat instead of taking his awarded leave to the Fatherland. His commitment is to his men and only his men.<br/><br/>The effects of combat have rarely been portrayed so starkly. The first example comes when Kern (Vadim Glowna) explodes at his comrades during a birthday party, which immediately follows a deadly, violent patrol. Later, in a quieter moment, Kruger (Klaus Lowitsch) is the lone survivor of a Russian bombardment. Steiner finds him in total shell shock; he can't move or let any emotion show through his voice. This scene is stark and moving. Battle sequences are brutal and intense. Peckinpah cuts rapidly from real-time to slow-motion very realistically. Many combat veterans say that time seems to slow down when you're in the midst of a firefight; here, we see things as a soldier would. Sometimes, the hand-held camera follows the men right into the trenches at a dizzying pace. At other moments, blood squibs and onrushing bodies are slowed incredibly.<br/><br/>Peckinpah's film is ultimately a statement about the sheer madness that war is made up of. It's not necessarily anti-war, but it is brutally honest and unflinching. One scene set in a Russian shack, in which Steiner's squad captures several women prisoners, will become engraved in your memory due to its sheer graphic nature. Other lighter moments of soldiers' humor revolving around farting, lack of bathing facilities and pure dirty nature of trench warfare are simultaneously hilarious and grim. This is easily one of the most engaging films about warfare ever shot. The North American DVD is to be avoided; I highly recommend the UK DVD which contains an uncut widescreen transfer."

"sddavis63","7","4","5","8 July 2008"," On The Russian Front In 1943
","A fine movie, made even more interesting by the fact that it's one of the few movies (""Das Boot"" would be another example) that depicts the Second World War strictly from the German perspective, ""Cross of Iron"" is notable for the performances from a strong collection of actors, headlines by James Coburn as Sgt. Steiner. Steiner leads a German platoon at the Russian Front in 1943, a time when the Germans haven't yet lost the war, but they're definitely on the road to defeat. Steiner is the winner of an Iron Cross, and he comes under the command of Capt. Stransky (another fine performance by Maximilian Schell), a Prussian officer so desperate to impress his family that he'll readily lie in order to return from the Front with his own Iron Cross. Steiner is a fascinating character; a bit of a loner, who holds his officers in contempt as well as ""the stinking Party"" and whose only real commitment seems to be to the platoon he leads. For Steiner, the romance of war (if it ever existed) has long since been shattered. Any idealistic view of why he's fighting is gone - he fights now simply ""for survival."" The movie seems a little bit disjointed at times, and, like many war movies, eventually the battle scenes start to seem like a bit too much of the same thing over and over again - which, of course, is probably why soldiers are able to persevere through war. Still, it's a fascinating look at the cynicism bred by war. 7/10"

","I saw this when it was first released in the UK (yes, I'm that old!) and it is still one of my favourite WWII films. From the children singingat the beginning to the wry humour throughout, this film brought a humanity to the story that I found refreshing given the subject matter. Coburn was excellent and the casting of British stalwarts James Mason and David Warner added to the enjoyment. If you liked this film then you might be interested in ""Misfit Brigade"" (aka Wheels of Terror) based on a story by Sven Hassle, a Danish guy who was in a German Penal Battalion onthe Russian Front. Based on real characters the filmis a real insight into the horrors of that campaign. OK, it's not quite as good as COI, but well worth viewing."

","This was probably James Coburns' best film in my opinion. An anti-war film based on the German perspective. It shows the bravery and dedication many of the Wermacht soldiers unfortunately had to a misguided cause. I was exceptionally impressed with this film despite some of the mid-70's campy filming aspects , but overall the story and plot was solid. I truly enjoyed the comradery story of the film and it truly showed the dedication the men had to one another more than to the cause of the Third Reich. This is a must see film for any war or anti-war enthusiast, and almost at the same level as ""A Midnight Clear"" (another MUST see). So if you haven't seen this, please do."
"cairnsdavid","Null","4","5","21 November 2002"," Oh, the ambivalence!
","A film about war and violence from a filmmaker who is never quite able to decide what he thinks or feels about these subjects. If that sounds like a damning criticism it really isn't meant to be. Peck avoids most anti-war movie cliches, and doesn't shy away from the guts and misery, but can't avoid getting his caveman instincts aroused by the carnage. With this filtered through his typically warped sensibility you get something more complex than either liberal hand-wringing or gung-ho militarism, and certainly more interesting than the Spielbergian combination of the two seen in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The film has flaws - it's homophobic in a way that's tacky and dull (the truth about heroic homosexuals in the war would be more arresting), and the film is certainly uneven - but it's the surrealistic weirdness that makes it compelling, and unevenness is the price you pay. Peck's drug of choice on this one was Slivowitz, a hellish Yugoslavian apple brandy which will take the top of your head off, and the film definitely feels like something conjured from a deranged mind. To be frank, Peck didn't know what he was doing half the time he was shooting this film. This shows particularly in the mad ending, which tails off unexpectedly leaving no resolution but a feeling of total disorientation, and in the dreamy shell-shock sequence, which compares well with Jaglom's TRACKS as a portrait of war psychosis. James Coburn is excellent (he will be missed) and Maximillian Schell a sinister delight. And long live the great David Warner - somebody give that man a decent role again. Casting him as a characterless thug in TITANIC just WON'T DO."

Stransky needs the ""Iron Cross"", he'll do anything to obtain it. When Lt. Meyer leads a successful counter charge against the attacking soviets, dying in the process, Stransky quickly tells his commander, that he lead the fighting action, so that he can obtain the Iron Cross as a reward.<br/><br/>There is but one problem, Steiner knows that Meyer lead the charge and that Stransky was in fact hiding cowardly during the Russian attack. Knowing that Steiner would never lie for him, Stransky quickly decides to not inform Steiners squad of the general retreat.<br/><br/>Although Steiner manages to save his troops from the initial soviet attack, they are caught deep behind enemy lines and have to make their way back to their battalion.<br/><br/>Besides Coburn and a, for once, great part by Maximilian Schell as Stransky, there are James Mason and David Warner as worn-out commanding officers who both give great performances. I also want to recommend the German actors portraying Steiners squad, they do a great job, especially Klaus Löwitsch as Cpl. Krüger and Vadim Glovna as Private Kern.<br/><br/>It is a different war movie, because it depicts the German soldiers as actual living people, not the human targets for heroic Americans.<br/><br/>I think more Americans should watch movies like this, or ""Das Boot"" or ""Stalingrad"", so that they can overcome the dehumanizing portray of Germans in Hollywood Movies.<br/><br/>The average German grunt was fighting for his live, perhaps for his loved ones back home. Most of them had no interest in politics or had the politics driven out of them by the sheer terrors they experienced on a day to day base.<br/><br/>The crimes of Nazi Germany are undeniable and something we still have to deal with almost daily, but the Germans in WW II were still humans. Misguided, foolish, cruel and uncaring perhaps, certainly flawed, as are we all, but they were men like the ones in the opposing trench."
"Dwolvesbane","7","5","7","15 December 2008"," A Different Kind of War Film
","Films concerning the Second World War face a problem that is somewhat unique to their subject matter. In almost any other war that is popularly represented in films it can be difficult to draw the line between ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". Certainly a film made in one of the belligerent countries has a tendency to simply portray their own countrymen as heroes and those of opposing nations as villains.<br/><br/>The Second World War does not have such wavy distinctions however. The war clearly pitted the allied nations, of which most were free democratic countries with one partner, the Soviet Union, a notable exception which could be described as the lesser of two evils at best, against the most brutal expansionist powers since the Roman Empire. This makes it quite easy for a filmmaker to vilify the Germans, Japanese, and Italians, but what of a film that features them as the main characters? What of a film that paints some of them in a heroic light nonetheless? Sam Peckinpah's Cross of Iron handles this issue quite well. In order to reconcile the heroism of the average soldier with the brutality of the government they serve the main cast of characters is a rag-tag group of soldiers that have found themselves in this war and just wish to do their job and come out alive, politics be damned. To heighten this, the main conflict in the story is not against the Soviet enemy, but against a politically motivated and glory obsessed party line Prussian aristocrat. This method of dealing with ""The Nazi Problem"" is really quite common in films from Germany as well as from other nations and does depend a bit on a popularized German stereotype, but it is effective in separating the actions of the common soldier from that of the regime, though one wonders how different this film would be if the enemy had been the Americans or British, rather than the admittedly inhumane Soviets.<br/><br/>These distinctions aside the film is a fantastic testament to the ability of the independent and human spirit to endure the ravages of most brutal war and is certainly worth a watching for anyone interested in war films or cinema in general."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","7","11","19 June 2009"," War is Peckinpah's survival hell.
","Out on the Eastern Front 1943, battered by the war itself, a war they are losing, a platoon of German soldiers must also cope with a new aristocratic commander who deeply covets the Cross Of Iron, Germany's highest medal of honour.<br/><br/>Universally hated and panned by the critics upon release, Cross Of Iron now stands up as one of director Sam Peckinpah's finest works. On first glance it would seem to have been a strange film (genre) for Peckinpah to tackle, but scratch away at the scabs left by Peckinpah's trademark violence, and you see underneath that it sits comfortably with his character driven Western fables.<br/><br/>Adapting from the much lauded novel by Willi Heinrich, Peckinpah is bleakly telling of men in combat, men who are not here for heroics, they are merely trying to survive, the realities of war draining their last bit of strength by the day. Then it's at the mid point when you realise that Peckinpah (possibly chuckling away into his stein of beer) has neatly led us into sympathy for the enemy of the good old war film, the German soldier. All cloaked by death dealer Peckinpah himself, with slow-mo blood baths and poetic like harshness emphasising the story unfolding. Men, true to the director's form, are defined by what they do above all else, regardless of the consequences. Men perfectly portrayed by James Coburn (never better) as Feldwebel Rolf Steiner and Maximilian Schell as Hauptmann Stransky, giving us men from different spectrum's who have differing ideals in life.<br/><br/>Also evident is a classic Peckinpah theme of establishment superiors trying to stamp down on the ""real"" men, the irony of such being that this was yet another Peckinpah film beset with interference outside of his control. Cut and tampered with, it's only now that we can see Pekinpah's actual uncut version of the film - so accept nothing that runs under 130 minutes on Home Formats. From the opening montage of WWII footage, played out as German children sing a haunting little ditty, to the climatic, almost surreal finale as Coburn maniacally laughs into the end credits (be sure to watch these to the end for Bertolt Brecht's bitter quote closure), this is no ordinary war film. It's all shot expertly by cinematographer John Coquillon. So with the ugly themes of moral corruption and the shattering of youthful innocence, this is one unpleasant, even insane picture. In short, Cross Of Iron ""is"", as Orson Welles was known to say, one of the greatest anti-war films ever made. 9/10"

","By the time he got around to directing a World War II movie, Sam Peckinpah was a shell of his old self. Yet even in his advanced state of alcoholism and mental collapse, Peckinpah could find moments of glory, especially when the subject rallied his attention. Such is ""Cross Of Iron"".<br/><br/>It's the spring of 1943, and in a southwestern section of Russia near the Black Sea a platoon of German soldiers struggle to stay alive. Leading them is Steiner (James Coburn), a crusty but sympathetic non-com who quickly finds himself on the bad side of his new commander, the incompetent, glory-seeking Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell).<br/><br/>""Men like Steiner are our last hope, and in that sense he is truly a most dangerous man,"" observes another, more reasonable officer (David Warner).<br/><br/>He certainly kills well. Working for both Hitler and Peckinpah, you expect nothing less.<br/><br/>""Cross Of Iron""'s agenda isn't clear. ""Anti-war"", yes, but with Germans as a nominal rooting interest and Russians storming the front, it's also a world where warfare is the only reality. There's a lot of idle banter about the ugliness of conflict, uttered by men we can only assume were happier about it when they were winning. We see a lot of death while Steiner looks on in stoic agony, a representation of the Peckinpah ideal in all its stark nihilism. He even turns his back on a tryst with the gorgeous Senta Berger to return to the front, this despite the pains Peckinpah and Coburn take to register Steiner's distaste for the cause of the Third Reich.<br/><br/>Peckinpah has a way of turning weaknesses into strengths on screen. The film is so sordid in its life-is-cheap aesthetic it becomes more visceral even as it becomes less coherent. Peckinpah embraces the ugliness of his surroundings here, of bad teeth and bodies pancaked under tank treads, until the very pointlessness of the visuals becomes a kind of point that resonates long after film's end.<br/><br/>In his Hen's Tooth DVD commentary, Stephen Prince makes many sharp observations. One regards the blurred, muddy look of the film, realized by cinematographer John Coquillon. Coquillon and Peckinpah worked together on the similarly grim ""Straw Dogs"", and Prince notes how well Coquillion brought out the chilly, expressionist side of Peckinpah just as Lucien Ballard captured something more lyrical.<br/><br/>Two sequences show Peckinpah's still-sharp editing prowess. The opening scene features Steiner and his platoon taking out a Soviet mortar position with quick cuts that seem to catch moments of death on the off beat; later we see similar dispatch in a stealth attack on a bridge.<br/><br/>Except in these smaller moments, though, the film never gels. Often the film goes too far in search of random profundities. One hospital-based scene cross-cuts between convalescents attacking a bowl of salad and Steiner dancing with a nurse. Warner and James Mason are wasted as a kind of Greek chorus bemoaning the tide of war between slugs of Mosel. A Russian prisoner is gunned down while Steiner cries out in overplayed anguish. I don't even want to begin trying to explain a sequence where Steiner's squad face a group of female Russian soldiers; it simply doesn't work on any level and runs ten long minutes.<br/><br/>Enough does work to keep you watching. Coburn is a rough diamond, maintaining a fragile cool that gives this film a solid center. Its look is hard and surprisingly authentic considering its legendary budget problems. ""Cross Of Iron"" isn't great, sometimes it's not even good; but its sordid sensibility and ruthless aesthetic resonate with the power of its one-of-a-kind director."
"MartinHafer","8","3","4","11 January 2013"," Über depressing.
","""Cross of Iron"" is a seriously depressing war film. And, considering that it's supposed to be set on the Eastern Front during WWII, it SHOULD be an incredibly depressing film! So, although I don't like all the blood and gore, it was appropriate to the time and place. Yes, you will see soldiers with limbs blown off, corpses being run over by tanks and blood, blood, blood. All this can be forgiven, though I have NEVER thought director Peckinpah's slow-motion scenes were particularly good--just indulgent. But, compared to the usually sanitized war films, this one is superior in this sense.<br/><br/>The story is about a particularly indestructible German soldier named Steiner (James Coburn). He has just been promoted to sergeant and the infantry men serving with him love him and look to him for leadership. However, quite the opposite is Captain Stransky--a cowardly officer whose only goal is to get himself an Iron Cross. And, it seems to gall him that Steiner has one and he does not. So, in order to 'earn' one, Stransky pretends that he was responsible for a brave act--one he never committed. Now, the only man who can contradict his fake story is Steiner--who knows the Captain was no where to be seen when they were being attacked.<br/><br/>While this is the main story, the film only focuses on this a bit, Mostly, it focuses on Steiner and his men as they attempt to make it back to their lines after the troops are overrun by the Russians. It all makes for a very tense and realistic story. Depressing and fatalistic, that's for sure--but very effective in conveying the hell that this war was for both the Germans and Russians. And, it's a rare film in that it is shown from the German point of view. The bottom line is that if you want to see realism and feel really, really depressed, this film is for you.<br/><br/>By the way, although the mood of the Front is pretty accurately portrayed, crazed purists will notice a few anachronisms here and there. The worst I noticed were American Corsair fighters dropping bombs on German troops. While the Americans did send a few planes to the Russians, they were all rather obsolete (such as the P-39s). The Corsair, at the time, was possibly the best fighter plane in the world and you NEVER would have seen them in the Soviet Union--only in the Pacific."

Although some of the historical facts are tossed around, the end result is a better understanding of the German's point of view of World War II and the political issues at hand with the US, Europe and Russia. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I felt a greater appreciation for humanity.  But then, Peckinpah has that impact on me.  As hard as this was to watch - it just broke my heart in so many places - I'm glad I made it through it.  Much more ""realistic"" than Saving Private Ryan."

","Cross of Iron has to rank as one of the best war movies ever made. I rank it up there with All Quiet On The Western Front. The opening children's song with the beginning of the movie is very haunting, if not totally ironic, abstract and thought provoking.The story of a German platoon on the Eastern Front is very well done. The acting and the story are excellent. This is probably my favorite performance by James Coburn as Steiner a war-weary German Sergeant. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. There is brutality between the Russians and the Germans as well as to their own people. If you are going to rent a bunch of war movies Cross of Iron belong up there with Saving Private Ryan, Platoon and All Quiet On the Western Front.

","Think of Sam Peckinpah and you instantly think of the final bloody shoot out from The Wild Bunch, the controversial rape scene from Straw Dogs, or the other shoot out in Pat Garrett. All of them memorable movies that won deserved critical acclaim.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron is a film that has been continually overlooked in this context which is a great shame because for me its probably his second best film after WB.<br/><br/>Definitely an anti-war film taken from the ordinary German soldier's perspective. Not quite in the same league as All Quiet on the Western Front, but very emotionally involving for all that.<br/><br/>James Coburn plays cynical Sgt Steiner a man who has seen enough killing and is sick of it, even though he won the Iron Cross,he regards it as nothing more than a piece of useless metal.<br/><br/>Contrast this to Maximilian Schell's Captain Stransky, Steiner's commander. A self-confessed aristocrat with an image to maintain; a man who has seen very little frontline action and yet if he doesn't receive the very same Iron Cross would mean certain social death for him back home. <br/><br/>
Both men are so socially & ideologically different and yet fight on the same side. A German who only fights because he has to whether he likes it or not, another German who is scared of fighting yet has his social standing to worry about. Nazism isn't even questioned here - there are no stereotypical jack booted Jerries or mad ranting generals; just ordinary men fighting for their own personal ends.<br/><br/>As usual we have the typical Peckinpah trademarks of slow mo action sequences of men being tossed in the air like litter as well as the cold blooded inhumanities one man (or woman in this case) can inflict upon another.<br/><br/>But in addition, and which is never really made clear in this film, is that this particular conflict isn't just about class and Iron Crosses but also of a Children's Crusade. <br/><br/>Peckinpah makes this harrowing point on quite a few occasions: the blonde Russian boy soldier that befriends Steiner for one, the scene at the end of the film where Steiner leads Stransky into battle and is almost killed by yet another boy soldier. But most telling of all is the musical score, initially sung in chorus by children coupled with a final slide-show of young children either being hung or suffering a miserable existence through no fault of their own.<br/><br/>A very good anti-war film then: a bit too simplistic perhaps but is excellent all the same. Coburn, Mason & particularly Warner play their parts with passion & openess.<br/><br/>****/*****"
"Tweekums","10","4","6","21 March 2011"," Peckinpah on the Eastern Front
","The vast majority or films set during the Second World War unsurprisingly follow the exploits of heroic Allied forces as they battle for our freedom; this however is different, it follows the exploits of a group of German soldiers who are no less heroic in their battle to survive as the retreat from the Red Army. Chief protagonist is Corporal, later Sergeant Steiner; he is no Nazi, like the rest of his men he is just fighting to survive. His world is complicated when a new officer is transferred to command him; Captain Stransky isn't a Nazi either but he is desperate to win an iron cross which makes him very dangerous. After their base is attacked Steiner ends up in hospital and upon his returned learns that Stransky is claiming to have led the counter attack and has named him as a witness. Steiner informs the colonel that Stransky was nowhere to be seen at the time and a lieutenant who died in the attack actually led the counterattack! Stransky is now likely to be court-martialled rather than get his iron cross unless he can get rid of Steiner; in the confusion of retreat that might not be too difficult and Stransky doesn't mind if Steiner's men are lost with him.<br/><br/>This film was really gripping and it was refreshing to see the German's depicted as something other than a bunch of evil Nazis; most are depicted as honourable men. Coming from 'Bloody' Sam Peckinpah it will surprise nobody to learn that there is quite a lot of blood spilt here; often in gory slow motion spurts. The cast did a fine job, notably James Coburn as Steiner, Maximilian Schell as Stransky and James Mason as the honourable Colonel Brandt. Amongst all the brutality there are some touching scenes; notable those between Steiner and a young Russian prisoner. If you are a fan of war films I'd certainly recommend this; it is excellent and very different from most films of its genre."

","For a long time this was my favourite movie, though in comparison with Speilbergs SPR looks a little dated.  It is the story of one Prussian officers quest to win the iron cross on the Russian front and his battle of wits with a battle weary Sgt.  There are some damn fine action sequences in this film, in particular the tank assault and final scene (somewhat reminiscent of Peckinpahs Wild Bunch).  Peckinpah makes good use of slow mo and with the use of fast editing highlights some interesting detail (the soldier been blown to pieces on the barb wire fence).  However there is some dubious moralising  along the way and a rather tedious, though surreal 'shell shocked' scene which bogs the film down.  I bought this film on DVD and was disappointed with the quality.  I have read this film was heavily cut and would be interested to see a directors cut.  Having said that if war films are your thing, this is worth a watch.  The Germans campaign on the Russian front is crying out for a decent movie, Enemy at the Gates certainly wasn't it, this is probably as close as you get for now."
"Hancock_the_Superb","6","8","17","21 June 2008"," Disappointing, anemic, but still entertaining effort by Peckinpah
","It is 1943, and the German Wehrmacht is being overrun by a Russian counterattack. Oblivious to his army's declining fortunes, aristocratic Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell) turns up to take command of a company of bedraggled troops. Stransky makes clear his primary goal is to win the Iron Cross, seeing the medal as merely an appropriate decoration for his social status, rather than something to be won for heroism. Stransky instantly clashes with Sergeant Rolf Steiner (James Coburn), an embittered non-commissioned officer who's seen more than his fair share of combat, and has some archaic notions of honor, loyalty and heroism. When Steiner refuses to endorse Stransky's bid for an Iron Cross, Stransky takes revenge by leaving Steiner's platoon behind - forcing Steiner and his men to undertake a hellish forced march through enemy lines, before setting up the final showdown between Steiner and Stransky - in the midst of a Russian offensive.<br/><br/>""Cross of Iron"" is Sam Peckinpah's only war film, and is something of a disappointment. As with ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"", it's an interesting movie, but one can't help but think a more sober, reasonable early-career Peckinpah - the one that produced ""Ride the High Country"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" - would have made a masterpiece out of it. As it stands, ""Cross of Iron"" is still interesting and fairly entertaining, but far from a masterpiece, with many serious flaws.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with ""Cross of Iron"" is its lack of subtlety. The message is pretty clear: officers are evil and reprehensible cowards, letting enlisted men to die like dogs while capitalizing off of their sacrifice. This is a valid point, albeit an unoriginal one, but the message is as subtle as a neon sign. Stransky is a caricature evil officer; he introduces himself by outright stating his only goal is to win an Iron Cross, not even masking it as a joke. He baits two officers into admitting their homosexuality and then uses this information as blackmail. During his first battle, he cowers and hides in a bunker, then brazenly demands a commendation for heroism. Later, he leaves Steiner's platoon behind and, even later, orders his men to machine-gun Steiner's platoon. Although he has glimmers of humanity (his one-on-one with Steiner about the importance of the Cross to him), Stransky never rises above the level of caricature. James Mason's Colonel Brandt and David Warner's Kessel are presented more sympathetically, but in the end they're completely impotent and ineffectual (Kessel suffers from dysentery to emphasize the point), only emphasizing the message. <br/><br/>In any case, Steiner hates them all, as he makes clear in a speech to Brandt and Kessel. This serves as a self-defeating character trait, as Steiner is unwilling to help Brandt punish Stransky for cowardice. One might accept Steiner's viewpoint as valid, but one would also hasten to add that it's counterproductive. If he hates officers so much, why not go after the really nasty ones? Steiner is just a bitter, angry, cynical man, not without reason, but it's clear (as with many Peckinpah characters) that he thrives on combat, making his stance somewhat ambiguous and even self-contradictory. That may be the point, but it doesn't really endear us to Steiner. <br/><br/>That all might be excusable (Peckinpah, after all, never was much for subtlety), except that the entire film has an inescapably anemic feel. Major scenes lack the power they should; whether it was Peckinpah's own state of mind, or the film's low budget, the movie pretty much lacks any real force or drive. The major confrontations between characters seem forced; the battle scenes, with one major exception, lack the visceral power that one would expect of a Peckinpah film. The movie certainly has its share of effective moments: the first battle is a doozy, impressive considering the budgetary restraints, Stransky's baiting the two officers, the scenes of German soldiers struggling to remain sane between battles, Steiner's hallucinatory hospital stay - but they're counter-balanced by the weak, cliché and trite sequences that riddle the film. The confrontation between Steiner's platoon and a group of Russian women soldiers is a great idea that fizzles out almost before it begins. The scene where Steiner spares a Russian POW, only to see him machine-gunned by his own men, is rather trite. The final showdown between Steiner and Stransky is well-done but the conclusion is just baffling. The overuse of photo and video montage over the opening and closing credits provides another clunky note. (One might also point out that the use of Wermacht soldiers as protagonists is a novel idea that ultimately comes to very little.)<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, with James Coburn giving arguably his career-best performance as the embittered Steiner (in spite of a dodgy attempt at an accent) - yet another ""Peckinpah professional"" trapped in an inescapable circle of personal hell. Maximillian Schell gives an intense performance, managing to overcome the cartoon constraints of his role. James Mason and David Warner comport themselves admirably, but they can't overcome their weak roles. Senta Berger (previously of Peckinpah's ""Major Dundee"") has a brief but effective role. There are many talented German actors filling out the supporting cast - Klaus Lowich, Roger Fritz, Dieter Schidor, Burkhard Driest - who give memorable characterizations.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron is a very mixed bag. It's entertaining enough, but really it lacks much in the way of depth or originality. Perhaps if Peckinpah had laid off the coke while shooting - or, better yet, been given a reasonable budget to work with - we could have a very good film on our hands. Instead, we have an interesting film that exists mostly as a ""what-might-have-been"".<br/><br/>6/10"

I believe the excitement died within the first twenty minutes of the film. I found myself hoping for improvement as the film progressed, but it continued to slide deeper into the bad movie kingdom. One of the major disappointments is the acting. This is NOT the Wild Bunch and do not look for that level of work in this film. Seeing James Mason, James Coburn and Maximillian Schell on the cover would make you believe Cross of Iron would be well acted---well, that is the wrong assumption. The acting plain out is garbage.

"jammasta-1","6","6","13","28 November 2008"," don't expect history, it's all about the men
","This movie is very uneven. It seems Peckinpah was unable to decide whether to shoot a metaphysical ""deep"" movie, for which the entire ""Eastern Front affair"" would only be a pretext, or a more reflexive war movie. To some extent, he approached the same junction later found by the makers of ""Stalingrad;"" while both movies serve very well as proof of the ""war is madness"" thesis, they tend too much toward the sub-conscious, unrealized, sub-real. This movie tells the story of Corporal/Sergeant Steiner, a ""living legend"" of the German reconaissance, bearer of a lower-class Iron Cross. One day, he is given a new superior, Cpt. Stransky, a Prussian aristocrat who volunteered for the Eastern Front and got reassigned from Paris. Stransky isn't much of an officer, besides, he has never been to the East and so isn't accustomed to the kind of war waged there (much different from the Western, clockwork a-country-a-month warfare conducted on France in the 1940). Yet, he's focused on a single goal - to get his own Iron Cross. Soon enough, the German trenches are attacked by a huge Russian force and survive mainly through the heroism of a few brave officers - mainly Lt. Meyer, who dies in combat. Eager to get it over with (and probably expecting no further chances), Stransky decides to act on it and claim the Cross for conducting of a counterattack (Meyer's doing). However, he needs two witnesses - and one of them is, by necessity, Steiner. What practically rips the movie apart is a set of scenes which seem more like delusions or manic dreams than reality. While the hospital scenes, placed as they are just after the aforementioned battle (in which Steiner got wounded) are intelligible, some similar scenes in the latter part of the movie aren't. I still haven't found any movie which would successfully resolve the realistic-metaphysical paradox, this one hits still too far from home. Other unrewarding aspects of ""Cross of Iron"" are the many mistakes, the roles played by Mason and Schell (bordering on self-parody, time and again reminiscent of Altman's ""M.A.S.H."") and questionable realism of front changes and battle occurrences (like a single plane bombing without an assault to follow or a cannon bombardment laced directly on German positions yet seemingly leaving the Germans untroubled). I guess Peckinpah managed to touch upon the nightmares of the WW2 Eastern Front, yet in general, it's far from ideal. As for the metaphysical aspect of the movie, it leaves the viewer a bit confounded. I, for one, don't know, which parts of the movie are imagined and which are ""real."" Perhaps it's all a dream and Steiner spent the whole movie in hospital... I'm giving it six stars, because it's worth viewing just as much as ""Stalingrad."" Other than that, it's a tough movie, unsympathetic, demanding, unrewarding. A typical Peckinpah? Not really, no. I wouldn't name it as the late master's masterpiece, yet it does bear his mark (outside the bloody slo-mo sections)."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","3","5","22 February 2015"," Forgettable war movie
","""Cross of Iron"" is a war film that features Academy Award winners James Coburn and Maximilian Schell as central characters. The film is directed by Sam Peckinpah (""The Wild Bunch"") and a writing team that includes Julius J. Epstein (""Casablanca""). The first 45 minutes of this over-2-hour long movie, we find out about the life and interactions of a group of soldiers during World War II. They talk about war, but also about everything else guys talk about, such as French girls.<br/><br/>Next up is lots of war action and Schell's character who seemed charismatic as always and so dominant early on just like a central character, disappears out of the picture for almost the whole movie until the very end. It's all about Coburn (Steiner) at this point. The film had occasionally some good scenes, like with the Russian women or also when they talk about Schell's character possibly (not) getting the Iron Cross. As a whole, however, I was rather disappointed. Yes, shooting belong to a war, but at some point, it felt as if the whole movie consisted of nothing else anymore and it was a bit too much war action for my taste.<br/><br/>I believe this film could have been kept at 100 minutes with many of the insignificant scenes being left out. And, especially the ending left me disappointed here. It felt completely unrealistic that Coburn's character and Schell's character would all of a sudden bond again after all that happened before. Why would Steiner kill the other guy in his rage, but not Stransky, who is actually even more responsible? This film received much more acclaim than the sequel with Richard Burton as Steiner, but I cannot say that it was considerably better. Both left me wanting for more. Not recommended."

","Sam Pekinpaugh has given us a big war-time movie situated on the Russian front, starring James Coburn as the savvy and taciturn Sgt. Steiner and Maximilian Schell as the newly arrived, dapper, Junker aristo, eager for the Iron Cross, the decoration given only for heroism in battle. It has Pekinpaugh's signature on it -- an abundance of painful deaths, more explosions than have ever before been committed to celluloid, and all in slow motion. The story is such that, if it weren't for some cogent lines, it could have been directed by Sam Fuller.<br/><br/>I'll give one example of what I thought was a good line. At the end, both Coburn and Schell stand face to face, armed, and about to be overwhelmed and killed by the onrushing Russians. It's only a brief pause, but Schell admits his status still requires the winning of the Iron Cross. ""You come with me,"" says Coburn, ""and I'll show you where the crosses of iron are."" It's neat because by a simple transposition of words within the phrase, Coburn has turned a medal (the Iron Cross) into a grave marker (crosses of iron). <br/><br/>It has its weaknesses. It's really too long and too loose-limbed for what it has to say. As Steiner, Coburn is a monument to military perfection, while Schell is a stereotypical cowardly and spiteful traitor. Coburn does well enough by the role of the humanitarian but dedicated sergeant. <br/><br/>Schell is a marvelous actor but he has only one scene in which he's able to put his chops on display -- when he tricks a subordinate into admitting that he prefers the company of men to women. ""He said YES! He said YES!"" Schell is in a transport of delight at having finagled his subordinate into a possible admission of homosexuality which, as far as we can tell, isn't true. The effect, though, is to make the subordinate a compliant slave.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film in any way but it lacks poetry of any kind. Pekinpah by this time in his career was describing himself as ""a functioning alcoholic."" He's lucky he got it out at all."
"mihkelm1","5","3","5","2 January 2012"," highly intriguing
","I think what is most interesting is the interaction between the two characters, who in reality are not so different: one being the hierarchy hating Sergeant and the other a traditionalist Prussian officer. I think the depiction of the officer (Hauptmann Stransky) was historically accurate, therefore the credit goes to creators of the film for having recreated what can be believed as an historically accurate representation of war's confusion and the characters in it. The film is highly unusual in itself for viewing the events from a German perspective, But it makes up for that by drawing a very clear line between Feldwebel Steiner's platoon and the rest of the Wehrmacht. At the same time though there is no doubt for which side he's fighting for. That's why for all practical consequences there's no difference between the traditionalist Prussian officer and the outlaw"" /the good guy in the film.<br/><br/>I wouldn't rate it as a top ranking war movie, as it contains a bit too many clichés for me. The action scenes are overplayed and terrible. A lot is left for the viewers imagination. One doesn't get the general picture of soldiers' movements, just the endless scenes of artillery fire (and sound). A historically accurate confusion is not good in a movie.<br/><br/>What I absolutely don't get is the inclusion of a cute children's' song at the beginning and ending."

","The 70s were a strange time for the war movie, especially those dealing with World War Two. We were by now a generation past the conflict itself, and really cinema could use this giant wound in twentieth century history to say whatever it wanted. And since the anti-war movie was now en vogue (despite not being timely in any specific sense) a humane story about a platoon of disillusioned Germans amid the chaos of defeat could work as well as any other.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron was adapted from a German novel, with a screenplay by Julius Epstein of all people. But why not Epstein? After all Casablanca dealt with the war from a similarly oblique angle. You could even draw a line between Casablanca's Rick and Cross of Iron's Steiner, but let's not get carried away. Cross of Iron is a meditative and touching work, with a beautiful optimist streak amid the deluge of despair. And yet it refuses to get bogged down in philosophy, and does not shy away from a realistic amount of action.<br/><br/>The assignment of Peckinpah to the material, while it seems natural in retrospect, was perhaps not the most obvious. Peckinpah was certainly not a great dramatic director. However, his handling of action sequences plays a major role in the impact of this picture. For once, his typically poetic scenes of violence are not exciting – they are too chaotic and disjointed for that – but they are startling nonetheless. Shots are arranged to correlate separate events – David Warner does a nazi salute, a shell explodes outside, a picture of Hitler falls off the wall – evoking the situation in a direct and captivating manner.<br/><br/>Of course Peckinpah's rapid editing schemes mean there is little room for development within the frame, but he nevertheless does take care over the focus and meaning in his images. In fact, the precision of the fleeting shot is often more crucial than that of the lengthy one. Thus Peckinpah quickly establishes mood with an insert of James Coburn backed by wafting mists when he first sets eyes on the Russian boy. A pair of beams is crossed above Keppler's head to highlight his stark expression when he is bullied into betraying Triebig. Throughout, the clarity of Peckinpah's images enables him to rush all that information through in a lightning fast series of cuts.<br/><br/>And in these brief flashes we get to see some stirring acting performances – acting that is at odds with the cutting, being slow and moody. James Coburn was now becoming the archetypal world-weary, reluctant authority figure, and here his tarnished emotional core is at its most perfectly understated. His greatest moment is that ghost of a smile, rolling across his face like an involuntary twitch, that he gives when the Russian boy gives him the harmonica. The next best performances belong to some of the lesser-known German players. Klaus Löwitsch and Arthur Brauss in particular giving us some very real and likable characters.<br/><br/>English-speaking European co-productions like this one tend to be a bit messy, mostly down to the disparate forces working on them (the oddest thing which I haven't yet mentioned is that Cross of Iron's producers were all in the porn industry) as well as the bad mix of low budgets and lofty ideals that tends to be behind these projects. However Cross of Iron is, probably more by accident than design, a very apt and fruitful meeting of creative minds – a lovely, tonal work of beautiful melancholy."

","A Peckinpah classic on par with ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""Straw Dogs"". Made later in his career, it is a great war film and a supreme human drama. James Coburn, one of the greatest actors to have walked the silver screen, is brilliant as Steiner, a respected, individualistic soldier who locks horns with Kruger (Klaus Löwitsch), an aristocratic Prussian superior whose military service amounts to a series of desk jobs. As a result, Kruger is ready to sacrifice anything and anyone for the coveted Iron Cross. My synopsis simplifies the conflict, of course, but this brawny military nightmare exudes a raw anger and power that is electrifying. Peckinpah's trademark penchant for staging masculine violence is in brutal evidence, as is his uncanny ability to capture the troubled male psyche. Featuring a stellar cast and a superb screenplay, this is simply stunning."

","The biggest complaint I have about this movie is the editing.  The battle scenes are so poorly pieced together that I can hardly tell what's happening.  In once early scene, for example, we see some Russians running toward the German trenches, then a few seconds later some Germans running in the same direction.  Then some explosions in random places, then it cuts to the bunker where we see wooden planks falling on German soldiers.  Who is attacking what?  It just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>It's true that Saving Private Ryan set a new standard for war movies, and perhaps it's unfair for me to pan this 1977 movie based on SPR.  But there are better movies even from this time period.  For example, Stalingrad shows fighting on the Eastern Front in a much more detailed and realistic fashion. That movie is entirely in German, so you'll need to read the subtitles.<br/><br/>
Other failings (imho):  Much of the dialogue is muttered or screamed, so it cannot be understood.  The Actors do not seem AT ALL like German soldiers. (Spoiler Alert)The ending does not show what happens to Capt. Stransky, and the howling laughter seems an unsatisfying way to conclude the movie."

"Fletch63US","10","4","8","15 April 2005"," A film for any teenager going into the military
","'Cross of Iron', to me, is Sam Peckinpah's last great film and his least screened. I would like U.S. to change that. 'Cross of Iron' is standing the test of time, which is the sole criteria of what makes a 'CLASSIC'. In this particular case I dare use the most over used word in the film dictionary for its truth can be viewed by any generation and its point comes through in a way the audience can identify with it on some level. 'Cross of Iron' goes against type from the beginning. The film is told from the German's point of view. Returning from a patrol on the Russian front in WWII, our hero Steiner and his platoon find a new commander, an arrogant Prussian officer who wants the 'Cross of Iron' although he lacks the heroic act needed to earn Germany's highest military honor. War weary disillusioned and traumatized Steiner stands between the aristocrats son with a silver spoon in his mouth and Germany's highest Military Honor 'Cross of Iron' even though he does not even remotely deserve, much less has he done anything to earn one.<br/><br/>Strip away the scenery and props 'Cross of Iron' is a morality play. The morale between the classes, Steiner represents the common man, the Officer is the one from money and power. 'Cross of Iron' is also about the morality in and of honor; honor to one's self, honor to one's cause (or purpose of being) and honor to those who gave their lives for their purpose of being, dying for what they believe to be the highest good for all. <br/><br/>The graphic portrayal of the horrors of war are presented as a character, not to glorify violence or the savage vicious brutality of war, rather for we the audience to decide for ourselves our own morality of honor in the middle of the meat hook reality of War being Hell. For this reason alone, I feel every 17 year old in America would do themselves a favor to see this film.<br/><br/>I relate George W. Bush to the Prussian officer who wants the 'Cross of Iron' to feed his egotistical sociopath delusions of grandeur, no matter of deservability AND no matter of how many lives are lost to get it. This revaluation came to me during my second viewing of this film, which made it all the more contemporary to view in that foul year of their Lord, 2001.

"Leofwine_draca","7","2","3","20 May 2016"," Peckinpah's crushing anti-war epic
","Sam Peckinpah's sole war film is an anti-war epic set on the German/Russian front during WW2. Its hero is Sergeant Steiner, the one man who sees the corrupt evident in the German army and the one man powerless to prevent it. Steiner is played by James Coburn, a very good actor usually associated with westerns, and I really can't imagine anyone else in the role. Coburn is magnificent. He ably portrays a complex man, willing to do his duty for his country on the front line, but frequently ashamed, surprised, depressed and, in the end, driven half-crazy by the brutality and futility of battle. In fact, Coburn's presence alone makes this a very good film – but there are lots of other reasons it's fine, too.<br/><br/>Even today there aren't many films detailing the war from the point of view of the Germans, and this depiction of the front line from the soldiers themselves is very well realised. Peckinpah, unsurprisingly, goes for the hellish, where children are gunned down, the innocent are slaughtered and the trenches are a mass of explosive attacks. The director's use of slow motion and freeze-frame editing is spot on, fitting the battle scenes very well indeed. The film takes a little while to find its course, but by the time it does you'll be hooked, and it finishes off with a massive, sprawling battle that really hits home the message that war is bad. The use of a simple children's song at the opening and closing credits, along with photographs of a young woman being hanged by a Nazi soldier, is utterly effective and completely moving.<br/><br/>It's worth making note of the calibre of the supporting cast, too. Maximilian Schell makes for a compelling, humanised villain, yearning for a hero's status but unwilling to actually do anything heroic; David Warner is extremely realistic as the officer who's reached the extent of his powers, physically and emotionally, and is now nothing more than the broken shell of a man. James Mason adds the quiet dignity I've seen him bring to many a film. All in all, a very good film, filled with many unforgettable images of the results of man's violence against man."

","Peckinpah's WW2 masterpiece.<br/><br/>1943. Stalingrad has fallen and The German Army is being pushed back on the Eastern Front. Nowhere is the situation more dire for the Germans than at the Kuban Bridgehead / Taman Peninsula. Here we see the war through the eyes of a platoon of German reconnaissance troops. Their senior NCO is a grizzled, resourceful veteran, Corporal Steiner (played by James Coburn). He is unconventional, insubordinate and irreverent, but the regiment's commander, Colonel Brandt (James Mason), tolerates this as he gets results. However, his company has a new commanding officer, the inexperienced Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell). Stransky is a by-the-book, authoritarian aristocrat and him and Steiner are bound to clash. Moreover, Stransky is obsessed with winning the Iron Cross.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Peckingpah (Straw Dogs, The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid), this is Peckinpah's Magnum Opus. Very gritty and realistic portrayal of war. Shows perfectly the chaos, terror and desperation of battle - the perfect maelstrom of war. <br/><br/>Through the characters we see the different soldiers you meet in a war - the tough, resourceful ones, the political operators, the fanatics, the scared recruits, the paranoid ones, the realists. This gives a great insight into how different people, even on the same side and in the same unit, can view the same war. <br/><br/>These characters also provide a commentary on war - it's pointlessness, hopelessness and wastefulness. Peckinpah rams this home with some very tense and graphic battle scenes. His camera work and editing are particularly impressive, conveying well the life-or-death struggle that is being carried out, as well as the randomness of injury and death.<br/><br/>Like most Peckinpah movies its a bit rough around the edges. There are some continuity gaps, military inaccuracies and a few plot points aren't entirely sound. However, none of these are major and, if anything, the looseness of the production contributes positively to the movie. The lack of polish adds to the grittiness. <br/><br/>Good work by the entire cast. James Coburn is solid as Steiner, as is James Mason as Colonel Brandt. Good support by David Warner as the war-weary, cynical Captain Kiesel. Pick of the bunch is Maximilian Schell who is perfect as the cold, scheming, manipulative Captain Stransky.<br/><br/>A classic and one of the greatest war movies ever made."

","Set at the Russian front(and heck, a little of that is actually spoken, and some of the cast appear to be from there), during WW2. The decorated platoon leader Rolf Steiner(Coburn) gets on the nerves of newly arrived Prussian upper class-raised coward Captain Stransky, who is hungry for an Iron Cross, the highest honor that could be bestowed upon a member of the German army back then. This is in part about the deceit the latter engages in, as well as the situation the soldiers there were in... as they try to maintain their humanity, the will to live and hope. It goes into the psychological damage done by armed conflict, and gives a genuine sense of what actual combat is like(and hammers home the point that it affects *everyone*). At any moment, an explosion or enemy charge could occur. The battle scenes are chaotic, overwhelming and disorienting. It is highly realistic. This is in the spirit of All Quiet on the Western Front, and is a fantastic anti-war film. The tension is thick, such as the early scene of an officer attempting to subtly root out a homosexual. While not much time is devoted to individual characters(there are too many for that to be feasible), they all have personality and are developed. The acting is great, especially by the leads, and names like David Warner. Dialog isn't bad. It gets somewhat overly poetic at times, which feels out of place. The FX are very well done. Editing and cinematography are highly impressive. There are some unforgettable surreal, dreamlike bits once our hero finds himself in a hospital. From the creepy opening to the equally eery ending, this is 125 minutes. There is a lot of bloody, violent and disturbing content(including rape), some grotesque sequences and details and a little female nudity(all but full frontal) and mild to moderate language in this. I recommend this to everyone mature enough to appreciate it. 8/10"

It is for me the best war film ever, with of course Das Boat and The Bridge, which both show the German point of view...This feature, unlike many other craps, doesn't invite you to think this or that, as if you were an idiot; for instance the bad Germans - or Russians - vs the good...<br/><br/>This movie shows you things you perhaps had never seen before, and after that, you can make your own conclusion, your own analysis.

Steiner(Coburn, battling that German accent, but I still liked him in the part and felt he fit the role well), a veritable war hero respected by many, has one and stands in the way of Stransky getting just that. Stransky claims he lead his accompaniment bravely into battle(of course, he's lying through his teeth), but many men around him, especially Steiner know different. As Steiner and his men are at their posts as the Germans retreat, Stransky doesn't inform them leaving the soldiers for dead. Though, as we have already established in several war scenes, Steiner is able to escape certain death from Russian tanks and foot-soldier gun-fire. He still stands in the way of Steiner getting that cross as he courageously(and intelligently)leads his men through rough terrain and possible death to get back to a German outpost in a nearby village.<br/><br/>Sluggish pacing, at times, makes this film a chore to sit through..it really felt a lot longer to me than it was. Still, the film has thrilling war sequences sprinkled throughout, Steiner men's voyage across war-ravaged Russia is indeed quite interesting and harrowing, the camaraderie between Steiner and his men is refreshing and realistic, and seeing Steiner and his men outsmarting the Russian forces through cunning ways of quick escape is suspenseful and quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Ultimately, seeing what Steiner and his men go through on their difficult journey makes the impending tragedy even more jolting. I felt the film is a bit sloppy and uneven, but has enough compelling elements(such as Steiner's seeing visions of his beloved soldiers' faces during good times once they are dead;the Russian kid that gets it by his own people;war-ravaged country-side and the dead lying all throughout)to keep the interest of Peckinpah faithful."

Looking at Saving Private Ryan I see the same eye for detail... but nothing can beat a Coburn as disillusioned soldier. What I like more is that most actors are not well known but they act great.

","Cross Of Iron is a brutal war film set in 1943 during the German-Soviet war. Directed by Sam Peckinpah (his only war film), it gives many incites into Nazi Germany's domestic and foreign policies, and some into the Soviet Union's too.<br/><br/>Cross Of Iron is based upon Willi Heinrich's book 'Das geduldige Fleisch' (or Willing Flesh), 1956.  The main storyline concerns the activities of a German reconnaissance platoon, part of Army Group South, who are retreating from advancing Soviet forces on the Taman Peninsula in The Crimea.   The principal character featured is Corporal, later Sergeant, Steiner, a vociferously anti-Nazi soldier who fights not to serve the Fatherland or even his officers, but simply to protect the lives of his comrades.  His new commanding officer, Captain Stransky, a Prussian aristocrat, is desperate to win the Iron Cross gallantry medal that his family expects of him.  When Steiner refuses to lie to conceal Stranky's cowardice in battle, a clash of wills ensues.<br/><br/>The film begins by showing a newsreel montage (like the use of newsreel footage at the end of Elem Klimov's Come and See) depicting Hitler variously addressing a rally, amiably chatting with schoolchildren and inspecting soldiers.  This is cut in with images of the German army advancing and blond Aryan children climbing mountains while carrying a huge Swastika flag. This propaganda footage is then vividly contrasted with the sickening opening of the action, where the reality of war on the Eastern Front is shown when a German reconnaissance patrol, trying to make their way back to their base silently through Soviet lines, literally slit the throats of their enemies. The end credits of the film, are a direct opposite of the opening credits, they show photographs of German officers hanging civilians and distressed stick thin children against the background of burnt out buildings. Finally, as a warning about, and a judgement on, both the Nazi party and Hitler, a quote from German Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht is shown: `Do not rejoice in his defeat you men.  For though the world has stood up and stopped the b****rd, the bitch that bore him is in heat again.'<br/><br/>There is an exploration of the Prussian tradition in Cross Of Iron. When Steiner refuses to lie to conceal Stranky's cowardice in battle, a clash of wills ensues.  The aloof Stransky, who has volunteered for duty on the Eastern Front from a safe staff posting in France, is, like Steiner, actually very anti-Nazi.  He considers them, particularly Hitler, to be inferior to himself, and views himself to be a projection of the old Prussian values of self sacrifice and military dominance.  Prussia was an area of eastern Germany that no longer exists, having been annexed by the Soviet Union after World War II; it still belongs to Russia today. However, Prussia, in the 19th century, became the most powerful of the then divided German states.  Under the government of Otto von Bismarck, known as the Iron Chancellor, it was militarily very aggressive and effective, and won a series of minor victories that enabled it to build up its size, wealth and strength.  Long-term antagonism with France then resulted in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, in which Prussia stormed over the borders and eventually besieged Paris.  The French, forced to sue for a humiliating peace, ceded Alsace-Lorraine and paid huge reparations.  Prussia's victory facilitated a united German Empire, whose first Emperor, William I, was the King of Prussia.  The Prussians then effectively dominated Germany until the 1918 World War I defeat.  The military, even in World War II, were very Prussian dominated, as many of the army's senior leaders belonged to Prussian families.  Hitler, who never trusted Prussians, had an aversion towards the existing aristocracy whose inherited privileges were at variance with his desire for a new meritocratic and racial elite.  Hitler was probably right not to trust them, as the senior army figures, led by Claus von Stauffenberg, who unsuccessfully plotted to assassinate him, were almost exclusively Prussian.   When the Soviet's drove into Germany in 1945, they had there own plans for the Prussian elite: Unlike any of its predecessors, the advancing Soviet army was intent on eradicating the Germanity of East Prussia once and for all.  In a perverse twist, Prussians, also known as Junkers, many of whom were dead, were also fingered as being uniquely responsible for Nazism; large landed estates were broken up for the benefit of landless peasant farmers and jobless workers from the bombed-out cities.<br/><br/>In Cross Of Iron we learn something of the Nazi Party's attitude and policy towards homosexuality.  When two characters: an officer and his orderly are tricked into admitting they are gay, they are blackmailed.  They are informed that: `if you get caught you will be hanged.' SS leader Heinrich Himmler, in typically illogical fashion, believed that male homosexuality was an Asiatic vice, inflicted upon innocent Nordic races by the Catholic Church.  The Nazi's, desperate to create large families to increase the German population, were particularly hostile to homosexuality, and after they came to power, in January 1933, repressions began.  The Gestapo then decimated Berlin's large gay community prior to the 1936 Olympic games, destroying the flamboyant scene so vividly brought to life in the work of English novelist Christopher Ishelwood.  Consequently, this ultimately led to homosexuals, forced to wear pink triangles, being interned and murdered in concentration camps.  However, given human nature a strong gay presence remained in the German military forces throughout Europe, particularly in occupied France: Parisian homosexuals apparently had a field day with their uniformed German counterparts, engaging in activities which would have put them in a concentration camp had they been living in Germany.<br/><br/>Women in Nazi Germany were viewed primarily as functionaries for the facilitation of producing millions of children to fulfil the numerical, military and economic expansion planned by Hitler, who wished to fill the army and send out colonisers to populate captured territories in eastern Europe, especially the Ukraine.  Divorce laws were tightened and farmers collected marriage loans to stop excessive migration to urban areas.  The Nazi party formulated policies (following the French tradition) rewarding fatherhood: prolific paternity was rewarded with automatic representation on various committees, while childless bachelors were discriminated against. Women found themselves not required for military service and not really wanted in the general workforce, they: were expelled from certain professions and given an educational diet of cooking and housekeeping. In the film, the only female Germans shown are the nurses at the hospital, and even here they are only shown dancing with wounded men, or pushing them around in wheelchairs.  This is shown to be a great contrast in the film with the Soviet's, who had no compunction in using women as frontline soldiers. The German soldier was presented with the clear differences in the political systems and social attitudes of life under the Nazi's national socialism and the Soviet's Stalinesque communism regarding women.  The German attitudes, which were simultaneously both chivalrous and condescending, changed somewhat when faced with reality of how the enemy used women.  In Germany, this situation only changed from late 1944 onwards, when impending defeat caused many ideological taboos to be cast aside, and civilians, including many women, were conscripted to assist the defence of the nation: women were drafted into operating searchlights or non-combatant duties.  They still were not used as combat soldiers, unlike the Soviet's, as the Nazi leadership claimed that only sub-human Slavs and Bolsheviks would use women in this way.<br/><br/>Cross Of Iron was released in 1977, which makes it a contemporary of three other famed World War II films: A Bridge Too Far (1977), Midway (1976), and MacArthur (1977).  Unlike these three films, the director, Sam Peckinpah, clearly makes an effort to effort to demythologise World War II, and its perspective, the events are shown through German soldiers, makes it interesting and singular.  A Bridge Too Far retells the story of operation Market Garden, where American, Polish and British soldiers tried to capture key bridges behind German lines, on the river Rhine, in a complicated parachute and armoured assault.  Midway recalls the Battle of Midway; a naval confrontation between America and Japan.  This film is largely historically accurate in revealing how the previously unbeaten Japanese fleet was defeated in a battle where the damage inflicted was all done by aircraft: the opposing fleets never saw each other.   MacArthur is a semi-documentary biography recalling the exploits of American General Douglas MacArthur.  This film focuses upon MacArthur's recall from the Philippines by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942; his return to free the country from the Japanese and his often fraught relationship with American President Harry Truman, which led to his dismissal from the army during the Korean war.  Perhaps the film that can be closest linked to Cross Of Iron is Apocalypse Now (1979), set during the Vietnam War, and based upon Joseph Conrad's novel Heart Of Darkness.  As with Cross Of Iron, the action focuses mainly upon one soldier, Captain Willard, who is sent into the jungle with orders to find and kill renegade Colonel Kurtz.  The further Willard travels into the jungle the more he becomes disturbed by the battles that envelope him, and his companions are slowly killed off one by one, again as is the case in Cross Of Iron.  Both Apocalypse Now and Peckinpah's film are laden with tragedy, every major character is guilty of heinous acts and all of them have their own motivations.  These films have a skewed moral morality, where individual quests for redemption are undertaken by confused outcasts. The thin line between internal conflict and external action, and the laying-bare of fake code of honour make these films in many ways ideological twins.<br/><br/>After viewing Cross Of Iron it becomes apparent that this film gives us numerous insights into both Nazi foreign and domestic policies, as well as demythologising German soldiers.  The way women were viewed and used by the Nazi's, here as nurses remote from the theatre of war, is apparent; largely because of the very obvious contrast with the Soviet women combat soldiers. The treatment of the film's homosexual characters gives out an accurate picture too.  They are easily blackmailed, because they realise that if they are exposed as gay they will not merely be punished, but will be hung until dead.  The Prussian military tradition is conveyed, through Stransky, who defines this to be sacrifice for country above self and vociferous ant-Nazism.  There are orders in the film that `no Russian prisoners are to be taken.'  The overriding impression left by the film is that ordinary soldiers in the German army by 1943 realised that the glory days were long gone, and that they were now fighting merely for their own survival rather than for Fatherland or glory.  When Hallenbach, an SS Special Action Squad soldier and party member, is drafted into the unit he is referred to by the ordinary soldiers as `Nazi pig***t,' and is ostracised, reflecting the new feeling on the ground.  There is an impression of historical accuracy in the film, particularly in the battle scenes, a Soviet assault is led by their T34 tanks, the T34 - called `the best tank in any army up to 1943' by Colonel General Heinz Guderian, one time Chief of the German Army General Staff - was a tank that is credited as having had a large part to play in the Soviet triumph over Germany, and adds to the air of authenticity that the film presents."

","Cross of Iron is the brutal tale by Sam Peckinpah, of a small platoon of German troopers lost behind Russian lines. James Coburn, James Mason, Maximilian Schell and David Warner shine as the seasoned troopers trying to get through another day at the front. Their survival is threatened by the aristocratic Schell's need to return home having been awarded the Iron Cross. He won't let anything come between him and his objective his ambition, not even the appearance of cowardice. Through his scheming, Coburn's platoon isn't notified when the Russians engage in a major offensive, and they're forced to try to survive and make it back safe to their own lines. This is a gruesome tour de force, and Peckinpah really does deliver on the promise of his reputation. The sense or realism is increased by the fact that most of the minor characters are actually German or Yugoslav. The Partisan chicks are pretty hot though. :-) One of the ultimate WWII movies, and unique because it (tries to) shows the war from a German perspective."

","My dad has been at me for years to watch this Sam Peckinpah movie and I've always resisted, never being a particular fan of either war movies or Peckinpah, but finally caved in to his exhortation and I'm glad I did. I'm aware of the film's troubled production history and it's true you can almost see where the money ran out, but what's left is still a memorable treatise on the hell of war.<br/><br/>Set during the German Army campaign in Russia, James Coburn is Corporal, later Sergeant Steiner, a maverick but fearless platoon leader of his own ""wild bunch"" of men. No respecter of rank or class, he accepts war for the bloody playground that it is, his nonchalance and insolence compensated by his individual bravery and military brilliance so that his unconventional actions are tolerated and indeed overlooked by his perceptive high command Colonel Brandt, played by James Mason.<br/><br/>Onto the scene however comes a glory-hunting, Prussian, Nazi Officer, Captain Stransky, played by Maximilian Schell who craves as his own personal badge of honour, the Iron Cross, which Steiner already has, but who wants to take the shortest and safest route to get it. This opportunity arrives quickly for him as he seeks to take the credit for a heroic offensive actually led by another captain who conveniently for Stransky, dies in the process. To get his Iron Cross, however, he needs Steiner to corroborate his invented bravery, setting the two men at odds with each other. Later at a key point in the movie, Stransky conveniently abandons Steiner and his men on the front-line, expecting them to perish and with it the one obstacle to his own vanity project.<br/><br/>With ever more brutal individual episodes, taking in Steiner's platoon co-opting a Russian boy-soldier into Steiner's troop then encountering a group of Russian female soldiers and the climactic final scenes where Steiner miraculously leads his men back to their own lines only for Stransky to cold-bloodedly order them to be fired on, the film ends with Steiner and Stransky meeting face to face for their own Butch and Sundance closing scene.<br/><br/>Peckinpah is in his element with the military hardware, explosives, man (and woman and child) - power at his command and delivers a compelling study of class, courage and honour in the heat of battle featuring his familiar trademarks of blood and gore and slow-motion ""dance of death"" choreography/photography.<br/><br/>Balancing his ultra-real but stylised action sequences with credible individual characterisations, Peckinpah comes up with a highly individual but often brilliant war movie. Coburn is magnificent as the laconic rebel Steiner and is counterpointed well by Schell's strutting career officer. Mason too is excellent as the presiding, battle-weary colonel while David Warner as his jaded captain acts as the conscience of the film.<br/><br/>I get that with Peckinpah you either love or hate his over-the-top excess but it's naturally suited to a war setting and while he has certainly here left behind a film with many memorable images, scenes and performances, they are always at the service of the story and message at its heart."
"clanciai","9","1","1","10 March 2020"," The ordeals of a conscientious objector as an officer in the German army
","This is indeed thoroughly a masterpiece, with tremendous realization of atrocious war scenes, with outstanding acting performances by above all James Coburn but also Maximilian Schell and James Mason among many others, but an objection must be raised against the story. Is this really credible? Could German soldiers act like this against fellow soldiers? I must find it hard to believe. The shattering finale, when James Coburn leads his last men back to his own German lines, must all the same be considered one of the strongest war sequences ever filmed, reminding very much of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" from 1931, and Maximilian Schell succeeds after all in making his character credible, although this is the crucial instant of the film and the story. The bloody gory scenes are so overwhelmingly multiple and crowded, so you must suspect Sam Peckinpah made this film just to be able to wallow as much as possible in visual cruelty and atrocity. James Mason is a contrast to this in his cool detachment to his job, while Steiner is the one really interesting character, both here and in the follow-up ""Breakthrough"" two years later with Richard Burton in the role. It's impossible to say if James Coburn or Richard Burton makes it better. Burton makes a more aged scarred veteran, while Coburn is more virile. The most interesting scenes of the film are those of his sensational extra-sensory experience of reality after his severe concussion as hospitalized with Senta Berger as his nurse - this is exactly how you may experience brain damage after a critical concussion. It is and remains a masterpiece for all time, but it is not a very sympathetic or likeable one - Sam Peckinpah's films never seem to be able to include any well needed refreshing sense of humour into their epics of cruelty."
"charlie-05244","8","1","1","30 January 2020"," A great war classic
","Based on a German novel named ""The Willing Flesh"", this is another classic movie from master Director Sam Peckinpah which offers a very interesting perspective on WWII as it is one of the few movies where the action is centered around German troops. So instead of the usual ""good allied vs. evil nazis"", the film's key message is that war is a nasty business, regardless of which uniform you are wearing. It is not casual that Orson Welles described it as the best anti-war movie since ""All quiet on the Western Front"". Shot in former Yugoslavia, and despite a troubled production history (Peckinpah was reportedly sober only for a few hours a day during production) the movie offers some fantastic action scenes in typical Peckinpah style, with lots of gore (at least for the time) and slow motion explosions, while exposing the increasing madness of a war that nobody seems to understand. James Coburn, while somewhat a bit over aged for the role, offers a memorable performance as indomitable corporal/sergeant Steiner, supported by an equally talented cast. Steiner's only goal is surviving in hell and helping his comrades to stay alive as well. The music is also perfectly written for the movie. It just falls short of being a masterpiece but remains a brilliant statement about the absurdity of war. Interesting fact: in the original script, Steiner and Stransky die together as Steiner intentionally blows up a hand grenade. In the movie, as the production had run out of money, Coburn (with Peckinpah unable to direct) had to improvise the end: the result is perfectly in tune with everything you have seen throughout the film. My favorite quote from the movie:
""...and I will show you where iron crosses grow"""

","Our story begins on the punishing wasteland of the eastern front in 1943. The gallant but disillusioned Sgt. Steiner(James Coburn)has been awarded the coveted iron cross for bravery in combat. Steiner's new commanding officer Capt. Stransky(Maximillian Schell)a supercilious Prussian aristocrat, hungers for nothing more than personal glory and the chance to earn his own iron cross. It isn't long before a bitter contempt develops between the two men, as the jaded Steiner realises that Stransky is a dangerously deluded coward. With the red army pushing the Germans back, contempt turns to disgust after Stransky takes credit for the heroic actions of Steiner and his men and leaves them at the mercy of the Soviets.<br/><br/>Steeped in deliciously morbid cynicism, Sam Peckinpah's only war movie captures military life on the hellish eastern front with unparalled skill. Deeply rooted in satire, never have I had the pleasure to enjoy an (anti)war movie so raw, so mesmerising, so flawless. The hauntingly dreamlike imagery does nothing short of dazzle and the poignant atmosphere of muddy trenches fills ones nostrils with the nauseating stench of war. As far as war movies go, Orson Welles said that Cross Of Iron was the greatest he had ever seen. I am inclined to agree, if it wasn't for stiff competition from classics like Patton, A Bridge Too Far or Attack!. The performances are nothing short of brilliant. James Coburn and Maximillian Schell dazzled in their portrays. The one and only James Mason was also on fine form as the war weary Colonel Brandt. A hoard of competent European talent also flex their acting muscles in supporting roles. With a flawless script, Cross Of Iron is just as much a study of class relations as it is a study of war. The battle of wits between the demoralised Steiner and the priggish Stransky is just as gripping as the physical battles between soldiers and tanks. Steiner is a man more loyal to his men than he is to his country. His only goal is to survive the carnage which surrounds him. Officers and medals mean nothing to him whatsoever, describing his iron cross as nothing more than ""a worthless piece of metal"". Stransky on the other hand, has his loyalties driven by an almost erotic obsession to win the iron cross. Like most members of the upper classes, he views war through rose tinted glasses, a trait which eventually leads to his undoing.<br/><br/>The explosive but bizarre climax oozes with darkly comic humour. As a matter of fact, the entire movie does, although the black humour is at its greatest near the end of the movie. The film itself is a metaphor for insanity, with insanity shamelessly represented by the climax. The final 25 minutes make the writers seem as if they were high on crack, although the final sequence itself is just so beautiful in a darkly humorous, yet horrifying kind of way that it succeeds on every level!. Too amazing to spoil, no war movie you have ever seen or will see will end with a sting more piercing than Cross Of Iron. The movie boasts a handful of muscular battle scenes which see Peckinpah play his trump card. Anyone who has seen The Wild Bunch or Straw Dogs will know that I am talking about slow-motion!. The intercutting of slow-mo action with standard speed action heightens the tension here in a way more impressive than that of any other Peckinpah movie!. The camera techniques utilised include shakycam and tight close-ups. Monstrous explosions puncture the scenery as men brutally fight for their lives with the odd squib bursting(another Pekinpah speciality). I was also impressed to see real Soviet tanks put to terrifying use in a taut skirmish at a disused factory.<br/><br/>Whilst totally surreal, Peckinpah's gorgeous nightmare will definitely leave a lasting bitter taste in your mouth. The lashes of black humour(which are occasionally hilarious in a cruel kind of way)and harrowing imagery will rock your world in one of the most severe portraits of war ever painted!. 10/10."

","Directed by Sam Peckinpah, ""Cross of Iron"" stars James Coburn as Corporal Steiner, a German officer who leads a ragged band of soldiers against Russian forces during WW2. Set during the Soviet's Caucasus operations, which forced the German Wehrmacht to retreat in late 1943, the film is typical of Peckinpah: lots of squibs, slow motion deaths, cross-cutting and wistful machismo.<br/><br/>Though praised by Orson Welles, and though it contains 2 or 3 good sequences during its final act, ""Cross"" is a thin, routine war film. Peckinpah can't compete with the macho poetry of Sam Fuller, the film's moments of sentimentality/pathos are wholly generic (a kid dies, men are betrayed etc), its battles are repetitive, and the film hilariously continues the ""Steiner cliché"". This is a cliché, common in films and novels, in which we're asked to sympathise with a cool, rebellious, skilled, anti-authoritarian, deadly-but-kind German soldier who's literally always called Steiner.<br/><br/>""Cross of Iron"" contains a subplot which watches as Steiner, played by the always likable James Coburn, locks horns with an aristocratic Captain who betrays Steiner and his men in favour for meaningless accolades. Their relationship is offered as being representative of Germany during WW2. The German people, in other words, were led astray by selfish, inept leaders who marched a country headlong toward its death.<br/><br/>""Cross of Iron"" is oft praised for being ""about the German perspective"". While this is true to some extent, the film does little to challenge mainstream preconceptions toward WW2. You might say a braver film would have portrayed ""Allied"" forces behaving as the Wehrmacht does here. Indeed, the Allies killed (through designed starvation and forced labour) more Germans in the five peace time years following WW2 than died during the entire European theatre. Which is not to say that WW2 films should pick sides, but rather that one should recognise that Axis Imperialism was formally no different to Allied Imperialism during this period (indeed, British Imperialism and desires to preserve a kind of monachist feudalism, led directly to WW2). ""Cross of Iron"", meanwhile, merely reinforces your typical, reductive view of WW2.<br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing."
"The_Film_Anorak","10","3","6","10 October 2009"," Contender for the title of greatest war film of all time
","This was Sam Peckinpah's only war film, having made his name with Westerns and then crime thrillers. The transition is seamless though, not only because some of his Westerns contained military characters and war as their backdrop, or the opportunity it gives him for gripping bloody action, but perhaps most crucially because it enables him to explore his favourite themes in a new setting.<br/><br/>As usual with Peckinpah, foremost among the themes of this film are men, their loyalty to one another, a team of hard-bitten old stagers fighting a losing battle buffeted by forces beyond their control, and sticking to your code in a brutal world. James Coburn is brilliant as Steiner, ably supported by a range of character actors as his comrades in the trenches, with a great international cast providing their support, including James Mason, David Warner and Maximilian Schell as Steiner's antagonist, the ambitious but devious Stransky.<br/><br/>To Peckinpah's eternal credit though, while telling his story of rough men in a rougher world, he gives a superbly detailed account of the squalor, fear, brutality and futility of the war on the Russian front. Although not blessed with the budget and technical advances of later classics like Saving Private Ryan, it gets across the scale of the fighting, and also captures the atmosphere perfectly. The Peckinpah style is very suited to the subject, shooting at different speeds, not flinching from depicting bloody action and alternating between tension, explosive violence and the daily life of the men.<br/><br/>This is a very hard-hitting account of the way with a number of scenes that are quite difficult to watch, and the overall tone is grim. However, the story is more than compelling enough to have you on the edge of your seat watching Steiner's platoon struggle, no longer for victory but just for survival.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it was also beset by the problems which Peckinpah's films frequently encountered. The director's own alcohol and personal problems made filming difficult at times, the international co-production had financial difficulties and as usual, the producers disagreed with Peckinpah on final cut and the theatrical version is not exactly what Peckinpah intended to show. Having said that, having scoured the world (my latest DVD version is the South Korean release) for the complete version, it's pretty close to what Peckinpah wanted to put out, resulted in a tremendous film and did well enough to spawn a sequel. It still begs the question though: why did those behind the scenes in films treat Peckinpah the way they did? Yes, he was difficult and didn't compromise, but every director's cut of his films was far superior to the producer/executive's version, with the money and time he needed he always delivered, and I would go as far as to say he was never wrong about what should go in a film.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron is perhaps the last film he made where in spite of any problems most of his vision made it to the screen, and the last where he was at the top of his game. For anyone interested in Peckinpah, the cinema of the seventies or good war films, it's truly unmissable."

","Corporal Rolf Steiner returns from a skirmish on the frontline with his small group of men to find that the broken and dispirited Captain Kiesel has been moved to one side and that he is now under the command of Captain Stransky. Stransky has specifically requested reassignment from France to the Russian front in order that he may have an opportunity to win the Iron Cross before the war is finished. While the Russians get ever closer, Steiner finds his legendary status among the men no help in him saving them and he comes ever more into conflict with Stransky.<br/><br/>Opening with a wonderfully smart title sequence this war film never pretends to the audience that this is going to be anything but an anti-war war film. Those in any doubt are put through several pointless and bloody battle sequences where losses are all around. In a way the film is a rather blunt weapon because this message is writ large across every battle scene and I found myself remote from the specific individuals involved and merely left with Peckinpah's overarching interest in the futility of the whole thing. To a certain degree it does of course work and the film is convincing in its depiction of the conditions and the battles are engaging and understandably chaotic. The problem I had with it is that it doesn't have a huge amount beyond this. Early on I assumed that the nature of the characters Steiner and Stransky meant that the film would create this miniature drama within the bigger picture. This element didn't totally work for me though and there was not much in the way of depth to the characters and the story. That said the film does still work on the level it stays at and fans of Peckinpah will be pleased.<br/><br/>The cast are mostly good even if I didn't think that they had enough material to work with in their characters. Coburn holds the film with ease and makes for a strong presence while Schell fits his character well; they work well together but individually neither manages to find any depth. Support is roundly good with starry turns from Mason and Warner as well as faces I didn't recognise such as Lowitsch, Glowna and others.<br/><br/>Overall then a solid war film that is unmistakably a product of Sam Peckinpah. I would have liked more depth in the characters and the narrative but for what it is it still works well and produces a collection of scenes that have no touch of glorification to be found."

Pure brainwashing, like a goddamn Britney Spears chorus that won't go away because you've heard it a 1000 times.<br/><br/>COI is an odd war movie, which isn't necessarily bad. For one thing, it's from the point of view of the desperate German army. The attempt to ""humanize"" the soldier fighting for Hitler only succeeds partly. The reason it doesn't - and never can - fully succeed is that there couldn't have been nearly as much individualism among the German ranks as is presented here. A German corporal, who is an efficient exterminator of enemy soldiers, risking his neck by keeping a Russian boy as prisoner? Gimme a break. Well, ""Russian""... This Russian is played by Slavko Stimac, a Serb kid famous for his awful Yugoslavian movies in the 70s and 80s. Dyed blonde, he looks even more ridiculous. Also absurd was his playing of the mouth harmonica when caught by Coburn's troops. What was that all about? Another strange/silly moment was when Senta Berger said ""long live Germany"", just as Coburn was leaving her for good; that didn't make much sense in light of the way her character was established previously. Additionally, a nurse as good-looking as Berger throws herself at Coburn, and then HE leaves HER, because of his sense of duty! Too Hollywood, too Hollywood for me...<br/><br/>A problematic factor in an American production about Germans are the accents/language. Either you get German actors who will all speak in German (an approach that would guarantee box-office disaster), or you let your international crew speak English the way they normally do. Listening to Coburn and Warner speak English ""like Germans"" doesn't quite work; it comes of as silly more than anything else.<br/><br/>However, although the movie drags at times, I do like that ending in which Coburn laughs semi-hysterically; it was almost the only way to intelligently finish the story."

What remains is a movie to be judged on its message and on its acting.<br/><br/>The movie is about the personal fight between a 'rusty' soldier and an upper class officer. The soldier does the fighting, the officer is only there to get his decoration, because he can't bear the humiliation to go back to his entourage in Germany without one. This collision between interests is the theme of this movie. It is an interesting theme but the movie is only partly able to display it. The story is fragmented, some events hardly fit into the movie. The end is very sudden, it seems no one knew how to finish the movie, or maybe the budget was gone. Anyway, it seems rushed. <br/><br/>But that is not the biggest problem. Acting is. Good acting should make you forget you are looking at an actor. Instead the actor must be able to make you believe you are looking at the character he plays. High ranking stars James Coburn, Maximillian Schell and James Mason were chosen for principal parts. James Coburn is not really an actor, he is only able to show his face and it depends on the movie whether you accept him in his role. In this entire movie he remains an out of place James Coburn. James Mason is a good actor but profoundly British and his part is to small to see him as the German he is playing. Schell is the only one who is able to make you forget he is a star, and merges with his character in this story. So the movie fails primarily on the acting and secondly on the flow of the story. <br/><br/>This movie seems to be out of date, maybe it was good in its time but it misses the extra to still be attractive.

Usually the reviewers get it mostly right, but here is a good example of how nothing is perfect. I don't know where to start criticizing this piece of trash. With a cast that includes some of my favorites I was expecting an interesting experience and was punished with a nightmare mess of a movie. I felt so sorry for James Mason as I couldn't figure out what accent he was trying. Maximillian Schell is awesome, but here I actually laughed out loud twice which could not have been the intention of the writer or director. I could only understand about 20% of what David Warner was saying and James Coburn was supposed to be the star I guess and had about 12 sentences of dialogue. He also had a totally unintelligible scene with some woman, maybe a nurse? I had to really stretch to find a reason to give it a 2 instead of a 1. A couple decent lines and battle sequences is about it here. I kept waiting for it to get better, but amazingly enough it got worse towards the end! If you have to see every movie ever made, then go for it. Otherwise, there has to be a better choice out there somewhere."

"BestBenedikt","6","2","4","14 November 2018"," Somewhat superficial - more of an action movie than a war film
","This film makes the biggest mistake a war film can make in my opinion: It's directed and edited like an action movie. CROSS OF IRON jumps from shot to shot very quickly, with almost every second one showing a soldier dying theatrically in slow motion in front of an explosion.<br/><br/>You also don't get a good sense of the geography of the various battle scenes - once characters are in a trench, in the next shot they are shown inside a building and after that they are suddenly in the woods (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN does this way better f. e.). All in all, the battle scenes move way too quickly, even if they are well done from a technical standpoint.<br/><br/>This action-heavy tone conflicts very much with the few attempts of seriousness througout the movie - especially at the end, when the film all of a sudden decides to show us random pictures of war crimes and the Holocaust, which feels very disconnected to the film.<br/><br/>Although the acting is generally good, the relationship between Steiner and Stransky isn't thorougly explored and the whole psychological aspect of the film falls flat and feels kind of superficial.<br/><br/>The film isn't bad by any means, just not as good as I expected going in. It's still watchable, mainly due to its high production value with some nice sets and well done practical special effects, and I have to give Peckinpah credit for showing the German perspective of the war. But how people can call this an anti-war film is beyond me."
"denis888","6","2","4","11 May 2014"," Too Much Violence, Too Many Goofs
","Sam Peckinpah was real master - his Major Dundee is a classic. Here, he tried the very nerve of many Russians - so-called Great Patriotic War in Soviet Union, here we see Taman region of 1943 and all is shown through several German army officers and soldiers. James Coburn and Maximillian Schell are mani stars, and well, they do good job. But then, all the right message of the movie - War Is All Hell - is somewhat blurred and lost. One thing which stands on the way and does not allow to delve deeper into the plot is any goofs - Russian uniforms are a laughing stock and not correct, many weapons are wrong, even Soviet T34 tanks when firing make a wrong sound. We hear Russian speech in the movie - several times, it is good and clear. several times, it is very heavily accented and all wrong in a choice of words (believe me, I am Russian). Sam Peckinpah dwells too long in brutally violent battle scenes - yes, was that brutal, violent, bloody, dirty, merciless and wild. That is true. But here we expected more of a personal tragedy displayed. Instead, all the deep tragic moments are smashed away with prolonged (too much prolonged battle sequences). It gets to a real drag sometimes. Russians never wore those helmets in attacks like those and rarely fixed bayonet to their Mosin rifles - too heavy and not effective. Russians never attacked like that, too. Russian tanks are also a bit sluggish in the movie, while in reality they were incredibly fast, quick, precise in firing and good for breaking walls. Goofs aside, violence aside, that was a good movie. Another weaker point - too long."

","Cross of iron is arguably the greatest war film of all time. Blending mind numbingly awesome battles with tense and emotional drama. This alone makes it a great piece of cinema but I personally feel that cross of iron is far far more than just a war movie.

The steadily advancing Russians were like an army of darkness destroying EVERYTHING in there path. I don't think that is what is what director Sam pekinpah wanted out of his film, but I think would have appreciated this idea.

","****SPOILERS**** It's spring 1943 in the Taman Peninsula with the once invincible German Army in full retreat. After the German Wehrmacht suffered a disastrous defeat at Stalingrad earlier in the year the Red Army then launched a massive 500 mile offensive along the souther sector of the Eastern Front. One of it's main objective is to recaptured the Crimea and Taman Peninsulas and it's there where the movie ""Cross of Iron"" takes place.<br/><br/>Sgt. Steiner, James Coburn, had been out on reconnaissance with his platoon and during a fire fight with the Soviet troops he captures a young Russian boy that later, instead of having him shot, not only spears his life but escorts the kid back to the Russian lines. Sgt. Seiner expecting that he'll be taken back by his comrades in the Red Army the boy soldier is instead machine gunned by the Reds before he could reached their trenches. This is how war is depicted in Sam Peckinpah's classic ""Cross of Iron"" cold impersonal and deadly where in the end there's no winners but only losers on both sides of the battle-line.<br/><br/>Undoubtaly the most shocking and effective anti, or even pro, war film ever made this side of ""All Quite on the Western Front"" ""Cross of Iron"" shows what war is really all about and how it effects by almost totally dehumanizing the men who participate in it. Taking over Steiner's company is an arrogant and pompous Prussian aristocratic jerk Capt.Humptmann Stransky, Maximilian Schell. Capt. Stransky wanted a transfer from his cushy assignment in occupied France to the bloody and hell-fire Eastern Front so he can earn himself the coveted Iron Cross. We see right away that Stransky and Steiner don't at all care for each other since in Stiner's case he already has earned an Iron Cross and is anything but overjoyed by it. Referring to the Iron Cross Sgt. Steiner says that it's just a worthless piece of medal but Capt. Stransky is so obsessed by the German war decoration that he goes so far as to blackmail one of his men Let. Triebig, Roger Fritz, to falsify a sworn statement, which Sgt. Steiner refuses to do, to testify to his courage in battle. <br/><br/>During one of the many battles that Steiner & Stransky participated in a Let. Meier, Igor Galo, lead a counter-attack against the attacking Reds, which cost Meier's life, repulsing and thus keeping the Russians from overrunning his infantry company's defensive positions. Stransky was hiding in his bunker during the entire Russian assault. After the dust cleared Stransky tried to get the credit that the dead Let. Meier earned by telling his superior Col. Brandt, James Mason, that it was he, Captain Stransky, who manned the guns and passed out the ammunition during he fighting not Meier. <br/><br/>It's later when Steiner is wounded in action and hospitalized, for a severe concussion, that Capt. Stansky's orders from Col. Brandt to receive an Iron Cross is just about finalized. Yet the very fact that Steiner is still alive and not willing to go along with the ridicules sham of Strasky being a war hero, which he's not, that leads that low-life Prussian swine to do everything in his power to not only get Steiner but his entire platoon killed in a sick act of revenge and cover-up.<br/><br/>Great study of how war brings the worst, as well as best, out in people. With a heroic but disenchanted Sgt. Steiner not only fighting the enemy Red Army but his own superiors. With the only thing he cares about, and is willing to give his life up for, is the men in his platoon. In the end even Sgt. Steiner's platoon, by then reduced to only two men, has no attachment to him anymore. Steiner leaves it and goes after the hated Stransky who was responsible for having it mowed down. When the platoon,together with Sgt.Steiner,tried to make it's way back to the main German lines. Caught in no-mans land in a vicious cross-fire between the Red Army and fellow German troops ,under the command of Stransky's boot-licking lackey Let. Triebig, Steiner's platoon was wiped out almost to the last man. <br/><br/>Triebig's own men couldn't continue, when they realized that they were shooting on their fellow German soldiers, to keep firing on Steiner's platoon with a totally outraged Steiner jumping into the trenches where Let. Triebig was trying to make a run for it. Cornering the rat after the gutless coward pleaded for his life telling Steiner that he was only following, Capt Stransky's, order. Sgt. Steiner then blasted Triebig to bits and pieces reloading his machine gun at least once as he kept pumping away. It's now left for Sgt. Steiner to come face to face with Capt. Stransky and make him answer for what he did to him and his men in his selfish quest for the Iron Cross. A medal that he planned to get at the expense of the lives of men who were far more qualified to get it then he'll ever be.<br/><br/>A once in a lifetime movie about war and the courage cowardice and self-sacrifice that comes along with it. An outstanding cast headed by James Coburn and Maximilian Schell leaves it's audience with a real insight of what war is really all about. As well as a unique experience of how men, and women, are changed forever by both living and suffering through it."

","How're ya'll? (that's how we start slightly uncomfortable topics in Arkansas) In your ""Credited Cast"" listing the actors and characters for James Coburn and Maximillian Schell (Steiner and Stransky) are reversed - Coburn played Steiner and Schell played Stransky.<br/><br/>Beyond that, this is an absolutely fantastic movie - if you believe the way to defeat one's enemy (in this case WAR in general) you must first know your enemy, I highly recommend you study this film before contacting your congressperson. In my mind it is a direct precursor to later WWII masterpieces such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Thin Red Line"" while surpassing other films done at about the same time - ""A Bridge Too Far"" and ""Midway."" By not being a history of a specific battle with specific historical characters and a rigidly known time-line, it is freed to dwell within the condition of warfare and focus on the experience of the men and women alone.<br/><br/>Peckinpah's unflinching vision and poetic understanding of violence coupled with the masterful involvement of the multinational cast and Gold & Thomas musical score combine to create an experience that will certainly haunt you."

James Coburn in one of the better performances of his career, and then there is Mason, Mason performs a colonel much better than his Rommel. Nothing is what it seems to be.

","(64%) A raw slice of second world war carnage from director Sam Peckinpah that very nearly dances its way toward being a wartime exploitation flick, but due to the fact that it is so well made, strongly acted, and grippingly intense that it never drops fully down to such trashy levels. The viewpoint is taken from the eyes of the Nazi fighters, made up from an international cast of actors, battling and losing, against the Soviets during one of the final parts of the war. James Coburn leads well despite never truly feeling like the character he plays, but the action is harsh and bloody with fantastically well shot battles as this tries, and largely succeeds, to bring the horror of war to life. Despite the so-so ending, this is worth a look for both war, and Peckinpah fans alike."
"naseby","9","0","0","19 April 2014"," ""You heroic horse's ass!"" ***SPOILERS***
","A classic film by any criterion by Sam Peckinpah, in his usual blood-and-guts fashion. That fact aside, being quite strange, as it's very much an anti-war film, told really from the perspective of a rag-tag German Army platoon fighting its way back from the Russian Front in 1943 (the turnaround for the German Army in WW2). <br/><br/>Rolf Steiner, (James Coburn), the respected stalwart NCO newly promoted from Corporal to Sergeant, falls foul of arrogant Prussian-Aristocrat officer, Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell). Stransky, still a novice coming from peaceful, occupied France makes no secret of WHY he asked for a transfer to the Russian Front - 'to win the Iron Cross', he says, as arrogantly as he is... arrogant! He's immediately looked on with disdain by the ragged but experienced Colonel Brandt (James Mason) and Captain Kiesel (David Warner). <br/><br/>Stransky even discovers himself a nice lackey, in Lieutenant Trebig, holding the latter's homosexuality he has recently observed with his adjutant, over his head.<br/><br/>His opportunity to win the Iron Cross 'dishonestly' presents itself in a Russian attack at his headquarters - only he squirms down below in the subterranean mire, whereas Steiner, the platoon and an equally respected Lieutenant Miers take on the Russkies head-on. <br/><br/>Miers is killed fighting bravely, Steiner is injured and goes on leave, having it off with a nice bit of skirt (Senta Berger as Eva, his nurse) and then there's the evaluation of the attack - Stransky puts his name down somewhere for the Iron Cross and put upon Trebig is called as his witness, surprise, surprise, never mind he's boasted about winning it in the first few words he uttered to the upper echelons. Steiner returns, and swears blind to the inquiry into 'who lead the attack, Stransky or Miers' that the latter lead the fighting and Stransky was nowhere to be seen. Steiner is needed as a second witness for Stransky, the latter even asks Steiner for this! Colonel Brandt again leans on Trebig to tell the truth but he can't even wobble slightly with Stransky threatening to reveal his homosexuality.<br/><br/>The platoon acquires a new Gestapo soldier, he's warned by Steiner he's not a popular man in spying on them - and that he'll get a bayonet up his ass if he even sneezes the wrong way. The platoon is sent out and encounters severe fighting that is vicious as the Russian Front was. Even a scrape with some Russian women leaves a couple of them killed, the green and innocent new private Dietz gets his as does the Gestapo man - in a not very nice way, it has to be said. But they still have to manage to get back to their lines. Stransky is beside himself in not being nominated for his Iron Cross as he feels he can't go back to his upper-class family in disgrace without one.<br/><br/>In the meantime,Steiner's platoon is as cut off somewhere and are struggling to get back to own their own lines. An order from Brandt is put out, to all units to break off and get back. Stransky deliberately sees to it that Steiner's platoon don't get the message but in any case, Steiner and Co. manage to get back to their own lines, using the approved code on the radio, to take his men in. Of course, Stransky gets wind of all this first and decides it could be a fake - that's his explanation anyway! He orders his men to open fire on Steiner and his platoon even when they wave their hands and blurt out the password/code wildly. Only three of the original platoon make it back including Steiner, who sees Trebig in the trench. (Trebig by now even states to himself 'my passage home' - some attempt to show he isn't totally lead by Stransky). Trebig wails that it wasn't his doing and it's Stransky all along. Steiner just lets rip on Trebig with his machine gun in typical Peckinpah fashion, letting him know his little fable cuts no ice.<br/><br/>Steiner catches up with Stransky, telling him Trebig is dead, Stransky retorts that Trebig wasn't under his command for a long time - then the two go head-to-head in some sort of duel into the Russian Melee as a challenge. This near-last scene has Brandt leading a charge and Steiner and Stransky going off to fight. Stransky hasn't a clue how to reload his machine gun and Steiner just laughs his head off in the ending scene, showing an explosion by a railway carriage as we are lead to believe the two of them have been killed. <br/><br/>An interestingly-filmed British-German production, with Peckinpah's blood and guts approach and set-pieces giving him rein to exploit it to its maximum potential. It must be said, the film was a hit in the then West Germany. But you can see why. It shows it mainly from their perspective. A product of anti-war feeling from Germans, on the Russian Front is this debatable? They even take in a young Russian boy-soldier as some sort of 'chum' after Stransky previously ordered him to be shot, as was the norm in Russia at the hands of the German Nazi ideology. As also, they meet some Russian women and some humanity is shown from the platoon, with scant reference to rape, scorned upon by Steiner - this is not mostly truthful to German soldiers of the period. I'm not saying they couldn't show any humanity, but it looks as if it's promoted and wasn't typical of the war on the Russian Front. Steiner as an anti-war but courageous soldier at odds with a king-s**t officer Stransky is well-played and the latter's deceit for his own ends perhaps warranted him getting killed more violently. The action is well-handled and typical as I have said of Peckinpah, but this remains one of the best and memorable war films we all grew up with before Saving Private Ryan."

"Pycal","8","0","0","19 August 2005"," The greatest WWII movie ever made.
","Cross of Iron is simply the greatest WWII film ever made. Sam Peckinpah's direction is absolutely brilliant. The battle scenes in the film are some of the most realistic battle scenes I have ever seen. The battles are so realistic, that you almost feel as if you are a part of them. In some scenes your staring right down the barrel of an MG-42 machine gun as it fires. When soldiers are shot or bayoneted, it almost seems as if you yourself are being shot or stabbed. The film is violent, gritty, and extremely powerful. 'Cross of Iron' is much more intense than any Hollywood WWII movie, especially those glorious almost pro-war films of the time. The editing is superb, and Peckinpah's cross cutting helps the audience see the horrors and confusion of war. I must also mention that the film contains some of the best uses of slow-motion in cinematic history. <br/><br/>It also helps that the costumes and weaponry are for the most part accurate for the period. Even if the T-34/85's did not come until after 1943 (when the film takes place), it is still great to see actual tanks on the battlefield. No CGI we have today can be as effective as the real thing. <br/><br/>Unlike most English language WWII films, Cross of Iron is shown from the German perspective. A perspective in which I find quite interesting. I'm usually quite bored with the number of siminlarly plotted WWII films focusing on the U.S. Army. In Cross of Iron there are no Americans, just Germans and Soviets. I'm glad many German actors were cast as they add realism to the film and they do not seem dubbed either. Even though the English dialogue does not hurt the film, I would really like to see the German version. <br/><br/>The film does an excellent job of accurately depicting each side. It is not bias like almost all of the Hollywood WWII movies. Each side suffers a great amount in the film. I have seen few WWII movies where both sides are treated so equally. Instead of the enemy soldiers being portrayed as villains, it is the hard line Nazis inside the German Wehrmacht that are vilified (I don't consider Stransky a villain like he is in the book). Most German soldiers were no different from their American counterparts, as they did not fight for a political reason, but rather simply to save their own skin. <br/><br/>The question one may ask is how does 'Cross of Iron' compare to 'Saving Private Ryan'? Well, it doesn't. This masterpiece is far superior. No WWII film even comes close."

Steiner is the existentialist anti-hero, anti-authority and bearing the marks of a cynic, he nonetheless cares about the fate of his men in a war that is absurd. From stupid and vain superior officers, to petty infighting amongst one's own ranks, this film embodies war not as something heroic, but as something solitary and individual. . . . ."

There as a seen where a troop transporter rolls through the mud, and over a long dead soldier whose smashed body is barely visible. It was a small but great detail. When bombs exploded, bodies, and body parts flew. I couldn't believe how graphic this movie was allowed to be for being so old.

This being illustrated by using images of atrocities and quoting Bertolt Brecht as the film begins and ends. Make certain you see the ""uncut"" version.

The dilemma being is his new superior officer, Captain Stransky (Maxmillian Schell), who is a Prussian and is determined to get what Steiner already has - The Iron Cross (the highest military award that a German soldier can earn for those who don't know) at any cost.<br/><br/>The film is marvelous although it has some areas where it's weak yet the harsh battle scenes depicted here would give another WWII movie a run for its' money.  Coburn and Schell are good here and so are the supporting performances turned in by James Mason and David Warner who both portray high-ranking German officers.

"latsblaster","8","0","0","18 June 2003"," Cross of Iron: Violence & Realism by Peckinpah
","Sam Peckinpah´s ""Cross of Iron"" is not a dated war-movie according to me. I rather say that it is one of the most modern war-movies I have seen. Seldom I have seen a violent movie that seems so real. ""Saving Private Ryan"" really tried, but the acting and direction was at times so awful that I couldn't stand it. ""Cross of Iron"" is masterfully edited and directed. People might unlike the fact that the Germans speaks English and are mostly cast by actors from the west, but I don´t want to look down on ""Cross of Iron"" just because of that, because it has so many qualities. And Peckinpah has chosen a great cast, most of all James Coburn (a favorite actor for me) and James Mason performs good even if they never ever has been close to be Germans.<br/><br/>There is almost no weak spot I can find in ""Cross of Iron"". It doesn't try to look beauty, rather dirty, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Enemy at the Gates"" did, but ""Cross of Iron"" did it without computers and I really think that it looked even more real than ""Saving Private Ryan"" and it never did the mistake to be over explicit. The ending might look a bit too abstract but I think I couldn't think of another alternative.<br/><br/>""Cross of Iron"" has been re-released in Sweden (on booth DVD and VHS) and is easier to find here than many other old movies. If you find it, give it a fair chance since it is as good as (or even better) any other classic war-movie. I think that ""Cross of Iron"" still has a chance to be considered a classic, and I don´t know if that is the case today.<br/><br/>
I recommend ""Cross of Iron"" to anyone, but first of all for those movie-watchers who see a lot of war-movies.<br/><br/>Rating: 8+ of 10."

","Sam Peckinpah's only venture into war films is a mixed success.  The storyline concerns a German World War II captain who's main goal is to earn himself the Iron Cross (Maximilian Schell), and how he butts heads with a corporal who's just trying to do his business and survive (James Coburn). At a few points in the movie, the story seems to forget where it's going, and trails off into unnecessary subplots and action sequences.  Peckinpah's directorial skill is evident in these scenes  nobody has ever done action as good as him  but he could've used a better script.  For all it's flaws, it's worthwhile viewing  especially for Peckinpah fans  but it is far from the director's best."

","You don't need many words to describe this film. Terrific cast, terrific cinematography and a lasting image of the horrors of the Eastern Front during World War 2.<br/><br/>This film is Sam Peckinpah's greatest film! Why? Well, the horrors of the Eastern Front really happened whereas film's like the 'Wild Bunch' were fiction. When you watch the film you get an idea of what it must have been like to endure the privations of war. More importantly this film refuses to let us forget the sacrifices made by all sides during the war.<br/><br/>These things apart, James Coburn has played in this film the most memorable,deepest and important role of his career. Coburn's performance allows us to understand the mental torment of someone who is forced to kill for a campaign he doesn't believe in. He isn't a Nazi but forced to endure for the advancement of their cause. This is important because many war films mistakenly depict the German soldier as a committed Nazi, evil and inhuman.<br/><br/>Maximillian Schell is a fantastic foil as the cowardly superior officer only thinking of his own advancement while all around him struggle to survive. James Mason also provides a heavyweight supporting role as the commanding officer who is straight and honest.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron allows us to somehow visualise what must be the most mysterious and darkest aspect of the war. Conventional war is bad enough but the Eastern Front went beyond the convention.The hatred shared by both sides for each other fueled the conflict to heights of unparalleled savagery. Not even Cross of Iron will allows us to see what it was really like, but then, do we really want to?"

","Sam Peckinpah directed this almost unique account in Western cinema of the fighting on the Eastern Front during WW II. This is basically one of the most intense warmovies ever made, not surpassed until Saving Private Ryan came along. This is a gritty, raw tale set against the largest and most brutal landbattle fought in human history. Coburn is excellent a the seasoned sergeant Steiner, having to lead his men through several hard battles and narrow escapes, and his fight against his arrogant and cowardly superior, captain Stranz (Maximilian Schell).<br/><br/>The rather weird ending is explained by the lack of budget. German producer Wolf C. Hartwig, who gained most of his money making countless softcore sexcomedies, ran out of budget near the end of filming and Peckinpah was left with only two days to complete the big finale, but it does not detract from the overall quality of the picture. <br/><br/>A sequel,called ""Breaktrough: the battle for Avranches"" was made in 1980 Richard Burton (!) reprising the role from Coburn and also starring Robert Mitchum as his American nemesis. The setting was now the Normandy battles in july 1944. As directed by stalwart Andrew V. McLaglen, it is painfully inferior to the original Cross of Iron."

","Most of the war movies that have been coming out lately (SPR, Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down) make gore look good. They pull this off by emphasizing the sacrifice of going to war and the honor that goes with it. Sam Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" shatters this concept. The blood and the gore are not used to demonstrate the courage of the soldiers but the suffering of them. Their death's serve no higher purpose and they only wish to survive the war. This is moviemaking at it's most brutally honest, a story about German soldiers fighting in Russia against both the Soviet army and themselves. The cinematography is beautifully done (with Peckinpah's trademark slow motion violence) but the film quality is unfortunately not so good. An 8 out of 10. Highly recomended."

","It is not difficult to make a good movie: take a good script, a good director and a good actor.  This is what happened in this movie, you have three ""best things"" combined.  Sam Peckinpah and James Coburn don't need to be introduced.  Julius Epstein is (was) a very skilled script-writer and very respected for this in Hollywood.  He wrote one of the best comedies of all time: ""Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)"".  The script is not falling into the pitfalls of describing the Soviets as heros and the Germans as idiots who can be shot by ten in one machine-gun salvo.  The historic context is correct (Kuban-peninsula retreat in 1943) and the battle-scenes are realistic.  The Russians brought in an overwhelming battle-power of T34 tanks against the dispersed German infantry and nothing could stop the Russians until they conquered Berlin in 1945. In the heat of the movie you can easily imagine the fear that those tanks could give when you were hidden in a trench!"

","I first saw Cross of Iron in 1984, and until that point in my film viewing, had never paid attention to Peckinpah one way or another.  The first thing that caught my attention was his startling effect of using explosions in two speeds.  Although there was a rapid fire explosion taking place, slow motion objects - such as a tire, or piece of metal - would float and seems to hang, making the effect surreal.  I commented on it to a friend, and he said, ""That's Peckinpah for you.""  I also was fascinated by the sexual inuendo of the tank moving in and out of a hole in the wall, while the two were in the bath tub together.  Again, Peckinpah?  I truly enjoyed this film, and having been raised with John Wayne and war films of the 40s, this was a breath of fresh air for me.  I recommend it to anyone interested in war films, and especially anyone who isn't aware of Peckinpaugh.  I for one, am working on seeing and learning more about him."

","For many years this was the only major release war film I had seen that looked at WWII from a vantage point other than America's.  Perhaps Peckinpah's third greatest work behind the Wild Bunch and the Getaway, he did a wonderful job with the Epstein and Hamilton adaptation of Willi Heinrich's novel the ""Willing Flesh"".  As usual, Peckinpah was able to communicate through his ample directorial skill, the intensity of war without the need of the ample CGI present in Saving Private Ryan(Peckinpah relied on two special effects personnel to Spielberg's 113!)  While much of the apologist ethos for the Wermacht solider on the Eastern Front can be attributed to Heinrich, Peckinpah massaged it nicely into a blanket anti-war statement.  With a few stills at the film's conclusion, he broadens the scope of the story to reach most of the armed conflicts that had transpired since WWII. Historical liberties aside, Cross of Iron provides the American audience with a broader view of the intellectual and nationalistic struggles facing the German people in the Post World War One era as Hitler came to power.  Ultimately, whether it be the rhetoric of the Prussian aristocracy, the Nazis, or the inability of the people to take responsibility for the dehumanizing qualities of each, Cross of Iron successfully communicates the vagrancies of war and its effect on the human condition."
"sychonic","Null","0","0","5 October 2000"," Complex war drama
","To call this an ""anti war"" movie is to do it gross injustice. It is instead a complex analysis of human violence: the underlying causes, motivations and situations that comprise any conflict.  This really is Peckinpah's best, or at least up there with Wild Bunch.  Just the setting is extraordinary--a group of German soldiers set on the eastern front against the Russians, neither side is particularly admirable.  Peckinpah is known for his study of the masculine, and has been accused of glorifying violence.  Here one could easily argue that he does just that--the fighting is brutal, ugly, frightening, and ultimately exhilarating.  <br/><br/>Coming out of many, many wars--through all the horror, the brutality, the gore, the mangled corpses, men coming back from battle--many shattered, have written that it was also the most intense time of their lives. SP seems to take that idea and study why it might be--the platoon here are not cardboard heroes, they live in filth, they kill and are killed, and have an almost permanent sense of fatigue. And they seem to desperately want to go home--but they don't, they fight, live their lives intensely. They do their duty, they fight the battles, not merely for survivial, but for ... well that's the question.  In the movie ""Anzio"" Robert Mitchum claims that wars are fought because men like it.  Peckinpah doesn't say anything so simple--he confronts the viewer with intense images, violence and heroism, killing and surpising tenderness, and leaves it there. <br/><br/>
There's a trenchant scene where a German General is confronted with a horribly disfigured soldier--Peckinpah seems to want to make you see all sides of the black power of War, which has always been with us.  Peckinpah doesn't have much in the way of female characters--they seem added on, the real essence is Peckinpah's careful and close study why males have an indescribable urge to kill one another."

The colonel, played by James Mason, unsuccessfully tries to mentor the sergeant, but Steiner's mistrust of officers and politicians remains a barrier.  At one point, Steiner explains that he fights, not for ideology or political goals, rather so he may finish and go home.

","Cross Of Iron is truly one of the greatest war films ever made, possibly the greatest of all WWII films. It was completely overlooked at the time of its release because by that time Peckinpah was seen as an alcoholic, drug-addicted madman, whose best days were far behind him, and few people in the US or UK were too interested in queueing up to see WWII German soldiers in a sympathetic light. Most of the critics who bothered to review it at all dismissed it. Added to that, it was butchered in the US, (surprise, surprise!!) from 132 to 117 minutes.<br/><br/>Also it was probably a little TOO realistic and graphic for mainstream audiences, and didn't feature the usual phony Hollywood comic-book heroics, opting instead for a truly bleak, brutal, horrific 'War is Hell' grimness. So it passed under the radar almost unnoticed. All over Europe however, (where it was uncut) it was a HUGE success, so much so that it spawned a sequel (!?!) the only Peckinpah film ever to do so.<br/><br/>Over the years though, it's had a dramatic re-evaluation and is now considered one of Sam's most highly respected works, and rightly regarded as a genuine (though disturbing) masterpiece, and features very highly on most 'best war films' lists.

"Quinoa1984","8","2","5","5 January 2008"," a little spotty, some acting flaws, but it's still got the verve and punch of a harrowing anti-war classic
","There are reasons I could not recommend Cross of Iron, but they're mostly surrounding little things that strike as being a little more 'ordinary' or just conventional. There's some moralizing from the perspective of the German side, there's a little acting that doesn't quite click (mostly due to accents that are a little forced), and there's only so much character development to keep the story moving. But those facets are tolerable, even sometimes compelling. What does make the movie *highly* recommendable, however, is that as with every film he made, to one degree or another, it's a Sam Peckinpah movie.<br/><br/>What you see from Peckinpah is what you get, and this time it's in the form of a war movie. It fits that he would make a war movie; the iconic scenes of the Wild Bunch where Peckinpah lets loose in his style of slow-mo violence on its western heroes, it's like it's ripped out of an operatic battle scene. So is the case with Cross of Iron that Peckinpah is phenomenally successful in portraying war as chaos, as battles rage and it becomes part of the narrative that we don't know who's fighting who.<br/><br/>It's in the editing, and in the (occassionally overwrought) slow-motion speed, not to mention the various squibs, that make Cross of Iron hit so harshly. On a low-budget, Peckinpah makes the most of his resources, and relies on montage and the inherent idea that war, especially when on he point of view of the side that will lose, is the most horrible concept realized by men in power. And sometimes Peckinpah, also in tune with his usual idiosyncratic method of editing in other scenes as cut-aways, drives the point home on a psychological level. Steiner (James Coburn) is a good soldier, a very professional one, who will lead his platoon despite the fact, as he tells James Mason's Captain, that he hates the uniform, hates officers, hates himself in his own skin. And sometimes he'll flash to a moment, a visual, that makes his journey all the more personal. Coburn brings it out in his personality, a kind of look that's intense, thoughtful, and always on edge. He plays this dangerous but ethical man to his logical conclusion, leading up to the ending where he finally breaks out in a desperate, maniacal laughter at the absurdity he's in.<br/><br/>As said, it's not a great film. It shows that Peckinpah was working with independent financiers that gave him only so much to work with. But it's hard to look away at times from what Peckinpah gives with what he's got. There's one of the most interesting scenes of any war movie here, not in a battle, but in a sort of ""filler"" scene- Steiner's platoon comes upon a Russian house full of women, some soldiers, after crossing over a protected bridge. There's a sense of peril in this scene, of multiple rapes about to occur. But then there's a morality here that's expressed too, with an unexpected moment with a sex act, and a naked woman bathing in a barrel. The acting here is some of the best in the movie, where all of the looks from the actors, many of them likely non-professionals, tell all there needs to be said about the smaller tragedies, the ones that get overlooked when looking at the big battles and strategies ala Stalingrad. Peckinpah gets so much right with scenes like these, with taut editing and a graphic vibe, as he does in other portions of the picture, that it's forgivable for what he gets wrong. It's a balancing act he, thanks to Coburn, pulls off excitingly."

an iron cross like everyone else in his militarist family.<br/><br/>The problem is he wants Coburn to testify to his activity in repelling a Russian
assault. Coburn won't lie for him so Schell puts him in a position Uriah the
Hittite would have found familiar.<br/><br/>Cross Of Iron gives us one of James Coburn's top performances on the big
screen. The battle scenes as created by Peckinpah are outstanding. Schell
matches Coburn with his performance and there's a good one by James Mason
as a more realistic German general than those he reports to back in Berlin.<br/><br/>Those of us who watch the MeTV channel or remember Hogan's Heroes from
the 50s remember that famous gag about being sent to the Russian front for
any infractions of Nazi rules and etiquette. Cross Of Iron shows us how this
indeed was no joke to those who went there."

","One of the all-time classics of western cinema, Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs, Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid) proved a huge feat of filmmaking strength with this gruelling and sadistic wartime drama pitting Nazi Germany against Russia on the Eastern Front! No stranger to controversy, Peckinpah masterfully handled both beasts on the frontline while coaxing an almost Shakespearean feel out of the story pitting not only army versus army but a Captain against his Lieutenant.<br/><br/>The hard-nosed but effective Lt. Steiner (James Coburn), commands a loyal unit of rogues against a marauding enemy as Germany inevitably fails to occupy the East. He not only has the respect and friendship of the men he fights with, but even the Colonel (James Mason) believes that his kind may be Germany's only hope.<br/><br/>His new commanding officer, Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell) however - a highly educated and proud officer with the kind of superiority complex that one could associate only with a Nazi officer - quickly puts the situation further at odds with his dislike of Steiner.<br/><br/>As the barrage of infantry and artillery against the German line intensifies and costs more than any man is able to take, their rivalry comes to a head through an epic war in every sense.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron is first and foremost very gory and one of the first true war movies of its kind to swap paintball grade bullet wounds for explosive exit wounds and authentic wartime injuries, to the point where it could almost be considered Grindhouse; considering its production values.<br/><br/>Coburn takes the classic antihero archetype beyond Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin, giving us a dirtier, more damaged frontman than had been seen before (and for some time after). Whereas Schell is deliberately cold, proper and clean cut as the kind of German we really love to hate. But he too goes beyond the stereotypical.<br/><br/>The support cast is brilliant and not just James Mason and David Warner as one would expect. Cross of Iron sports actual Germans playing Germans and are committed to creating stand-out characters that we do grow attached to.<br/><br/>What we end up with may be somewhat expected, but there is plenty you won't see coming and Cross of Iron sports anti-war messages of a different nature to that of what you may be used to. In fact, despite it's dated production values, it's totally on target.<br/><br/>Cross of Iron is one of the essentials of war film!"
"virek213","9","1","2","14 March 2016"," Peckinpah's Politically Incorrect World War II Opus
","When it came to Sam Peckinpah as a filmmaker, there was never an easy way of doing things, and a penchant for doing nothing the way Hollywood wanted. When he wasn't battling with studio chiefs and producers (which was a great deal of the time), he was frequently battling with critics who liked to nail him for his graphic violence and the complex approach he took to that violence, especially with films like THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS. It earned him the fairly distorting misnomer ""Bloody Sam"", which didn't really begin to explain the depth for which he cared about filmic art. And probably no other film of the fourteen he made was quite as infuriating as his 1977 World War II film CROSS OF IRON.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name by Willi Heinrich, the film is set along the Eastern Front of World War II, where in 1943 the battle between Stalin's Soviet forces and Hitler's German forces was becoming the personification of a meat grinder war. James Coburn, a Peckinpah favorite, gives another extremely probing performance as Sergeant Rolf Steiner, the leader of a vastly outmanned and outgunned platoon of German foot soldiers, who learns that his particular squad is about to be taken over by the very autocratic Captain Hauptmann Stransky (Maximillian Schell). For reasons that are quite selfish, namely the desire to get the German equivalent of the Purple Heart or Bronze Star, the Iron Cross, Schell forces Coburn to go into battle against a regiment of the Soviet army that literally cuts their platoon to pieces. As is par for the course in a Peckinpah film, we have two men in conflict with one another, both practically two sides of the same German coin, only one of them (Coburn) cares more for the lives of his men, and Schell just cares about getting that damned Iron Cross, and is so blatant about that ambition that he tells Coburn, ""I will show you how a true Prussian fights."" Coburn then retorts, quite rightly, ""Then I will show you where the Iron crosses grow."" It is not too surprising that the battle and action scenes in CROSS OF IRON are distinct from every other filmmaker that has ever lived; we are, after all, talking about Sam Peckinpah here. And he certainly doesn't make things easy; besides the carnage that he shows, he is as precise as ever at showing how the horrors of war affect the men that have to fight it, and how alienated and anesthetized they can be to death and killing on a mass scale we hope never to revisit. Coburn, of course, is brilliant in his role as the humane Steiner whose only concern is for the men he leads and not for the officer corps, especially not the vainglorious Schell (another fine performance). Both actors are supported by a great cast that includes, among others, Senta Berger (who played the love interest in the director's 1965 Civil War western MAJOR DUNDEE), David Warner, and James Mason.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, CROSS OF IRON failed to find much of an audience outside of continental Europe because Peckinpah depicted World War II in such a politically incorrect way: from the point-of-view of German foot soldiers, as opposed to Americans and/or Brits, something that clearly seemed to alienate people just wanting to see a standard-issue war film where good guys and bad guys are clearly distinguishable. But that's John Wayne theatrics of the worst kind; and in real war, the line between good and bad is not only a thin one but it's a line that is also frequently crossed. In any case, Coburn, Schell, Mason, Warner, and their fellow German soldiers are frontline soldiers in the heat of battle, not the Nazi commandants who gassed six million Jews with impunity in the concentration camps. They may be wearing the uniform of a country and a leader with a (to say the least) unjust cause, but that by itself doesn't diminish the reality of the horrors they experience, and in that respect it makes them no different from the Americans, the British, or even the Soviets.<br/><br/>Helped immensely by a crew that includes the great British cinematographer John Coquillon, who had already worked with Peckinpah on STRAW DOGS and PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID, CROSS OF IRON is one of those films that ranks with the best films about any war ever made, whether it's about World War I (ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT; PATHS OF GLORY), World War II (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), or Vietnam (BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY; PLATOON; FULL METAL JACKET). Even with a few flaws in it, this is a movie that needs to be restored to its full original, and extremely disturbing, glory and power, especially for how it adds to Peckinpah's reputation as an ultimate seeker of the truth of Man's contradictions, no matter how disturbing or politically incorrect he is in doing so."

He specialized in westerns such as The Wild Bunch (especially), and more generally went for adventure stories with a shade more subtlety than straight-up boys'-own swashbucklers.<br/><br/>Late on in his career, he took on an interesting task in Cross of Iron: a Second World War film told from the perspective of the German soldiers. In any such film, there are a couple of elephants in the room: Nazism and defeat. While Nazism can be covered, and indeed has been covered in the past, from other perspectives such as the Allied soldiers, or German civilians, this point of view has the unique colouring that we know they are destined to lose. If any happy ending is to happen for the main characters (and it may well not), it will be contrasted with the fate of their fellow soldiers.<br/><br/>In Cross of Iron, this is partly dealt with by isolating Sgt Steiner (James Coburn) and his squad behind enemy lines, and forcing them to make a daring trek through enemy territory. This cuts them off from the main pressures of the background, and allows the writers to bring them in on a controlled basis.<br/><br/>The main conflict, apart from against the Soviet army, is between Steiner and Capt. Stransky (Maximilian Schell), a political commissar of sorts who, while he claims not to be a Nazi party member, enforces their ideology over Steiner's seemingly more noble, practical approach. The main underlying thrust of the film is an anti-war message, that those at the top do not understand the brutality of the front line, and so resort to armed conflict entirely too frivolously.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, though, the film is mainly a straight adventure, with very limited subtlety. The 'subtext' is even transformed into a supertext when it is spoken directly by Steiner: ""I hate officers."" It seems that, by his third-to-last film, Peckinpah had perfected his formula, enabling him to produce a strong, exciting adventure film with a bit of depth, without straying far from his comfort zone. However, he had also become somewhat set in his ways. There is a great deal of narrative and thematic potential in the central idea, I think, but Peckinpah had lost some of the flexibility to explore it."

","Sam Peckinpah's films always seem to leave a lasting impression on me and his brilliantly audacious and harrowing anti-war account ""Cross of Iron"" simply had me thinking of his classic western ""The Wild Bunch"". Both focused on a dying breed of men, hoping for better times in a changing environment and let's not forget the sweat, the blood and the male comradeship. Peckinpah's humidly brute if candid war drama takes on the point of view of a weary battalion of German soldiers on the front line against the advancing Russian military towards the end of the Second World War. The raging testosterone is evident, from the use of a hardy script, hard-bitten performances weaved together by a genuine rapport and the gratuitous shots of raw violence, as Peckinpah is not afraid to show blood and guts spilling out with numerous ear-splitting explosions and rapid gunfire raging throughout. However there's something rather beautifully voluptuous in the way he engineers it, as it comes across as poetry in motion or a wet dream in its exciting barrage of pumped up machismo, but also taking time out for some more lighter touches too. He has always been a great visualiser, where the arrestingly intense action is grounded with an authentic tough as nails edge that never loses sight of the brutal outcome it engraves -- psychically and mentally. Running through the jadedly versatile story is an unflinching moral card, but its angle on classes (feuding rivalry between German officers in who really deserves heroic credit --- even begs the question why the glorification in a losing war and the ones who should be held up our those unknown soldiers fighting up front) and the motivations behind individuals only goes on to make it more so powerful (with the ironic ending cementing it), jolting and deep in its impulsive structure and emotional arcs by not only concentrating on the cynical acts, but the innocent face of war. While gritty and blunt, it remains technically sharp and is effectively photographed like the spectacular slow-motion during the large-scale battle sequences. Maybe a little too long in the tooth, but it never lets up for it two hour plus running time. James Coburn heads up the cast in a magnificently tough-skinned performance and across from him is a dominating Maximilian Schell. Also there's sensational humane support from the likes of Klaus Löwitsch, James Mason and a bitter looking David Warner."

","I first viewed this film upon its release in 1978, & was totally mesmerized by it. It was one of the first films that I recall seeing that featured the horrors & confusion of battle realistically. Wounds were graphically depicted, instead of just showing a red dot on someone that has been shot.<br/><br/>I recently purchased the DVD from Amazon, because there is finally a full-length, quality, letterbox version available. I watched it 3 times in a row, when I received it, & saw something different each time.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is very accurate in depicting the weapons, uniforms, & awards for that period in the war.<br/><br/>Having read much & having seen many documentaries about war on the Eastern front, I do not believe that most people have any conception of the scope, magnitude, & savagery of the German-Russian conflict in WW2.<br/><br/>There have been some comments about the Iron Cross being Germany's highest military award in WW2. The DVD cover even incorrectly states this.<br/><br/>In actuality, the Knights Cross is a higher & rarer award. It is worn on a ribbon around the collar, & subsequent awards are the oak-leaves cluster & crossed swords that are attached to the original Knights Cross. I think that there is another award called the Military Cross, which is also rare & higher than the Iron Cross.<br/><br/>Hitler always wore an Iron Cross on his semi-uniform jacket, that he was awarded in WW1.<br/><br/>In WW1, Germany's highest award was the Blue Max (Pour de la Merite) as in the 1960's movie ""The Blue Max""."
"Hilsdong","8","1","2","2 September 2007"," Tough, gritty WWII drama...one of the best of the 70's
","Cross of Iron is truly one of the great war films. The battle scenes are filmed with an intensity that you rarely see in films like this. The cast is first rate and Coburn is especially hypnotic as the heroic Steiner, the war-torn soldier who gets involved in a bitter feud with the newly transferred Captain Stransky (played with grim authority by Maximillian Schell). Stransky is obsessed with being awarded the Iron Cross and tries to bribe Steiner into signing a reference for him by promoting Steiner to a Sergeant. Steiner is a complete rebel in as much as he hates authority in the German Army so his promotion does little for him. He is admired by senior officers for his impressive soldiering and his leadership of his platoon so his shortcomings in his behaviour causes them 'to look the other way'. Stransky on the other hand is a wealthy man with Prussian blood and one suspects his Captain's rank came from his higher class background rather than his soldiering skills (as indicated in a bloody battle scene where he cowers away in his bunker, and the real soldiers are out in the trenches fighting at close quarters). These are two totally different men and the conversations indicating their bitter rivalry are fascinating. Coburn and Schell are perfectly cast, but the support is top-notch too with James Mason as the old-school type Colonel and David Warner as a slobbish Captain who seems to have given up hope on everything in general. Peckinpah is one of the few directors who can handle confusing battle scenes with such masterly control(check out the first shoot-out in 'The Wild Bunch') and was definitely the right man for the job here. The film puts an unromantic point of view on war as having the heroic soldiers on the retreat and losing big time - there's no flag-waving patriotic rubbish here - just a good, honest tough war drama. A terrific film which is generally overlooked in a lot of top ten war lists."
"franzleopold","10","1","2","21 July 2007"," A glorious failure
","This movie has enough comments but I couldn't let the last two go. But first the interesting question for me about this movie is would have it been worse if Peckinpah had had the budget he wanted. He had plans for a great set piece ending with countless T-34s. Instead he had to improvise what we get. But what an improvisation. Amongst war films this is unquestionably a masterpiece and perhaps the greatest American war film ever made. To situate this hyperbolic remark my faves are the like of The Cruel Sea, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, The Battle of Algiers, and Come and See. But until special effects came in I think this film best captured the nature of combat. If anything it is not boring enough. Bad editing? Postmodern cretinism. Movies do not have to operate simply within their own confined space. Occasionally they strive to represent life. This film tries to do that, and that resolve for me absolves it of its manifest failings. Because life always undoes representation. And for film to capture its undoing by extreme moments of life, such as combat, is rare. I think there are glimpses of that in this film."
"yenige","8","1","2","27 September 1998"," an early predecessor to Saving Private Ryan
","Many things led up to the creation of the movie Saving Private Ryan, which for some reason seems to have become _the_ realistic movie about the Second World War. Cross of Iron, whether Spielberg has seen it or not, is definitely one of those things that laid the groundwork for realistic movies about the most destructive war in history. Cross of Iron is an early attempt to tell a tale of German soldiers in World War Two, and tell it realistically, or as close to reality as could be achieved. Based on a book written by, I believe, a German  soldier who was on the Eastern Front, the movie tells the story of a veteran platoon of German soldiers and their decorated leader, Sgt. Steiner. Taking place on the Eastern Front in the closing years of the war, the movie is gritty and violent. The viewer gets a glimpse of the conditions the soldiers had to endure, as well as the stress from the constant death and depravity all around. Unlike Ryan, which almost cheerily displays the gory horrors of war, the impact here is more subtle. Visual horrors like gore, dismemberment and such are present but not overbearing. Surrealism forms a strong theme in the movie, and it does end very strangely. Overall, a good effort to tell a realistic story about a subject matter normally glossed over."

At one point, it is asked who will rebuild Germany after the war, and as James Mason answers, three soldiers are killed in a hail of bullets, poignantly reminding us of the waste of war. Steiner and his outfit are men fighting for their lives, they would throw away the worthless piece of metal that is the Iron Cross. I found myself having the same amount of sympathy for these men as I did for Hanks' platoon in SPR. It is said that the film ran into production cost trouble but Sam Peckinpah made 5 old tanks look like 50 and the constant hum of Soviet artillery numbs you like it did those soldiers. Peckinpah delves into a kind of psychotic, warped nightmare when Steiner relives some of his memories. The battle scenes are brilliant and it is a truly wonderful study of men at war"

The action sequences were a little jumpy and hard to follow at times.  I would still recommend the movie.<br/><br/>As a WW2 history buff I was excited to see, with the exception of the most of the German vehicles, most of the equipment was authentic looking.

"Aylmer","8","1","3","27 December 2018"," Accurately messy experience with the Eastern Front
","While there have been a few movies at this point to deal with the Eastern Front (most recently the German TV series ""Our Mothers Our Fathers""), nothing including STALINGRAD and the numerous Finnish war films have captured the horrific nature of the grit and fighting quite like this one. Sam Peckinpah uses editing like a science and makes this film a sort of WILD BUNCH in Eastern Europe. The quick cutting, slow motion, and balletic cross-cutting back and forth creates an exciting fever dream of an experience and certainly breathes a lot of life into the film's more superfluous scenes (such as Steiner's trip to the home front). We don't get exploding heads, murdered civilians, and entrails all over the place so I can't call this an anti-war movie along the lines of COME AND SEE. I would instead call this possibly the most macho WW2 adventure ever made with a strong satirical tone not really made too obvious until the last reel (which is a bit of a fluke I hear as reportedly they had run out of money to make it the way Peckinpah had originally envisioned).<br/><br/>This may be the only film to depict the desperate German holdout in the Taman Peninsula in the summer of 1943. My main complaint is that it isn't given much context (ie. a glorious map session like we got in BATTLE OF NERETVA or A BRIDGE TOO FAR) because the Taman Kessel was a unique phenomena of the war with its only resupply / escape over the Kerch straits to Crimea. On one hand it was the only hope the Germans had of ever attacking the oil fields of the Caucasus again, and on the other hand a very precarious and easily isolated pocket.<br/><br/>Nope, in this movie we are down in the trenches with the men for the most part, fighting for their lives every day and not very conscious or concerned with the greater strategy of the war. They may as well have set this in the Rzhev meatgrinder, which was probably even more horrific but beyond this film's budgetary scope. Most of the Germans (outside of oddly cast James Coburn and two of his senior officers) are played by real German actors speaking accented English. Once you get past the casting of American Coburn and Englishmen Mason and Warner in the key roles, it actually feels much more authentic than, say, ENEMY AT THE GATES. It falls victim to a couple cliches of course, with Zoll the ardent Nazi of Steiner's group being suicidally incompetent and a rapist (who is even introduced as a possible SS man though that wouldn't make any sense for him to be serving in a Wehrmacht unit so early in the war) who of course gets his just desserts. Maximilian Schell's villain is more of a Prussian aristocrat obsessed more with glory than Nazi racist/homophobic policies, even exploiting them to his advantage, which is a nice change of pace.<br/><br/>See with an open mind especially as a fan of Peckinpah's other action films. Pound for pound, it probably boasts the most action of all his films. Don't expect to be too enlightened or educated about the horrors of war or the human condition, though there are a couple good such scenes sprinkled here and there."
"sol-","Null","1","3","27 June 2017"," Straw Soldiers
","The title here refers to the Iron Cross, a German medal for bravery, as the story focuses on one Nazi officer so set on achieving the titular medal that he recklessly puts the safety of his platoon, behind Russian enemy lines, into danger. Maximilian Schell is solid as always as the self-interested commander in question, though he is ultimately a supporting character here as the film is told from the prospective of a recently promoted sergeant in his platoon, played by James Coburn. The storyline is a little messy and comes off as more a series of episodes than a coherent narrative, and yet this chaos is somewhat appropriate for a movie about the madness of war. Memorable elements include Coburn warming to a Russian orphan who he takes back to his bunker, a couple of a latent homosexual soldiers facing off with Schell and a terrific sequence in which Coburn hallucinates while being nursed in hospital, with an excellent editing design perfectly capturing his confused state of mind. The film features a lot of quotable dialogue too and there is something to say for the film's uniqueness in showing the German side of things without demonising (all of) them. One does have to tolerate a lot of Sam Peckinpah's trademark quirks here - most notably, excessive slow motion shots - but the overall movie leaves an indelible impression, chaotic and frenzied as it may be."

","Resembles an Impressionist or Modernist painting, as, for instance, Guernica. Each sub-theme plays its part, but is not followed through in the overall narrative. The whole is greater than the sum of these parts. Those reviewers who find the film to be a total mess are the usual obtuse and insensitive dunces that made up the studio suits who dumbly did their best to wreck Peckinpah's creations. Moreover, several of those retards seem to think this film is about Nazis: in fact, there is not a solitary Nazi in the entire movie. (Well, there may be one). These men are hapless apolitical soldiers, even the pompous self-promoting and dishonourable Prussian. Also, the Iron Cross is not remotely the equivalent of the American Purple Heart. The Iron Cross was awarded for bravery in battle as well as other military contributions in a battlefield environment. The Purple Heart is awarded for a broken nose, provided a bona fide enemy delivered the punch; or a flesh-wound in the bum, when running away. <br/><br/>The film's story plays out as a series of interlocking and merged, but individual and self-contained, episodes. For instance, the early episode of the ironic tragedy of the little Russian boy, taken prisoner and then shot by his own side, is one of these episodes. His harmonica can be taken as a lucky charm, which saved his life when captured, and which he gives to Steiner, thereby surrendering his good luck to the German Sergeant, who survives to the bitter end.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are intensely striking. The combatants are difficult to tell apart, and that figures, since there's little essential difference between them. They might as well be on either side. The tanks are faceless, anonymous, death-dealing robots, indiscriminately destroying anything in their path, human or inanimate.<br/><br/>Another very effective and affecting episode is Steiner's hallucinatory and romantic spell in the hospital. This recalled the fate of those wounded British soldiers in World War I, who returned to the front when recovered but undaunted, to carry on and die regardless. The nurse is resigned to the soldier's decision. No genuine frontline soldier is concerned in the slightest with the rights and wrongs of the conflict, but, as the film notes, merely with staying alive and supporting his comrades. Captain Stransky, with his questionable un-Germanic name, loses sight of that ethic because of his unnatural desire for the bravery cross; but he maybe sees enough light towards the end to shelve this attitude.<br/><br/>This is, obviously, a remarkably fine film. The only reason I'm docking one star is because it seems wrong to have all the good Germans played by American and British actors, and the dodgy German played by a German.

","In ""Cross of Iron"" director Sam Peckinpah tells an story about true heroes and their real acts of heroism and false heroes and what do they do to be recognized as brave mens and guarantee all the fame to the themselves. <br/><br/>During the Second World War the Prussian Captain Hauptmann Stransky (Maximilian Schell) fights along the Nazists even though he dislikes Hitler. All he wants is to put his hands in a medal of honor named ""Cross of Iron"", a medal given to acts of bravery in a battle. He's a total coward, manipulates his subordinates and does everything he can to win this medal. But he's the new leader of the squad. Newly promoted Sergeant Rolf Steiner (James Coburn) is the good guy in this story, the good German. He's gonna be one of the many obstacles that Stransky got to deal with. Steiner is a real hero, a guy who always risks his life in order to protect his friends and even potential enemies like a Russian soldier boy that he kept as prisoner. But both men are united against the Soviets in a desperate attempt to survive.<br/><br/>Along with the vanities, friendship, bravery, pride and the Cross of Iron there's also the battles, the shootings, blood, insanity, fights like a typical war movie. The originality of this movie is to show the German side of the war, a side that's almost isn't showed in movies and here they got the chance to be the ""heores"" of the story even that we know that in real life wasn't that way. If you're looking to an accurate story don't watch it. But if you want with bloody battles and a good story you must watch it. This is the only incursion of Sam Peckinpah into war films and he really did a terrific job here. It might not be violent as ""The Wild Bunch"" but it has many characteristics of his preview works (the great editing alternating slow motion and still images and then moves forward). <br/><br/>Another rare and interesting aspect is the homosexual relationship between the Leutnant Triebig (Roger Fritz) and a young soldier named Kepler (the actor is not credited). Their relationship appears briefly in a scene when both are caught by Stransky (they don't know that). Stransky uses their unfoldment as a way to use Triebig as an allied to his plans. I think that this worked really well in the movies, it's not something you see even in recent war movies. The focus here it's not only the war strategies but the man strategy to get what he wants, even if all he wants is a medal or to stand for those he likes.<br/><br/>Good performances by James Coburn, Maximiian Schell (the best in scene), James Mason, David Warner and Igor Galo (he plays the young Leutnant Meyer). Since this was an very underrated movie by the time of its release I hope that someday (soon) maybe Hollywood remake this classic. Here comes an suggestion: Tom Wilkinson must play Captain Stransky, I can picture he playing this almost villain."
"wildamike","9","1","4","22 July 2009"," Blames the German soldier and society
","Cross of Iron is frequently characterised as an apology for the German soldier, separating him from the guilt of the Nazis who ordered him to perform various atrocious acts. I suggest the reverse is the case: Peckinpah goes out of his way to show that evil German deeds cannot be blamed on the Nazis, but in fact arise from disturbing elements already present among non-Nazi Germans. Here are several examples: When Schnurrbart and Steiner discuss ""what are we doing here?"", they quote from Friedrich Bernhardi, an aggressive German expansionist who wrote before Nazism existed; the most evil character in the film (Captain Stransky) despises the Nazis; the snivelling Lt Driebig has no Nazi connections; Steiner sees both Eva the nurse and the hard-hearted German generals on his home leave as sharing guilt for the war, but there is no indication that any of them are Nazis; in fact, Eva's final words to Steiner are ""long live Germany"" – she is just an ordinary German patriotically doing her bit to support the war; Steiner accuses the cultured (and non-Nazi) Colonel Brandt of being in effect no different to Stransky. We only see one Nazi during the entire film.<br/><br/>Peckinpah drives his theme home with the final quote from Brecht: ""Do not rejoice at (Hitler's) downfall  because the bitch that gave birth to him is in heat again"". In other words: Hitler is not unique; mass-murderers like him will arise again and find willing allies; and German atrocities would have happened anyway in WWII even without the contribution of the Nazis. The most disturbing part of Peckinpah's theme, is the implication that any culture can give rise to a Hitler – the next one need not be German.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, some of its special effects look very dated now, but the inherent realism more than makes up for this. Classic Peckinpah film techniques are all here, and the juxtaposition of slow mo and different angles combine to give an overwhelming effect of what it is like to be under a battalion assault. The battle scenes are extremely realistic, particularly the manner in which Lt Meyer plans and leads a counter-attack to clear the trench system, and the manner in which the tanks break into the position. There is plenty of humanity shown among both Germans and Soviets. Even the nasty Stransky's character is understandable, and all the more terrifying as a result. I have to rate this film higher than Saving Private Ryan, because whilst the latter has sublime early scenes (both in France and USA), it then descends to that awful clichéd final battle."
"jdaniels-4","Null","1","4","24 August 2003"," A LESSER PECKINPAH
","Frightening!, horrendous! - and that's just the cast! I'm a big Sam Peckinpah fan but this movie (though interesting) is well below par. I can tolerate James Coburn (though he seems to be using the same accent he affected in ""Fistfull of Dynamite"" - as an ex-IRA man), but James Mason & David Warner as German officers?!! Steady on old chap! Their scenes together are so stiff upper lip they appear to be acting in Zulu Dawn - maybe they thought they were? A few reviewers have suggested this is a good companion to ""Das Boot"", but one of the great things about that movie is the German cast, who (wow!) even communicate with each other in German. So refreshing after years of  seeing British &/or American actors pretending to be French/German/Oriental(!) by affecting ""just zee right accent"". Today, in the age of ""world movies"", James Mason as a German is about as convincing as Brad Pitt playing Malcolm X. That's the way movies were made back then I guess so you can't blame Peckinpah too much, but it does put a strain on the credibility. Maybe because I have high expectations of any Peckinpah film this one let me down, but aside from the miscasting I think it lacked substance & was nowhere as good as the director's other work. It seemed fairly shallow (considering the subject matter), and consequently lacking impact. The sets looked a bit fake too. Oh well, still plenty of other Peckinpah to enjoy. And how about Maximillian Schell? (the token European)- the only actor to appear in both a Peckinpah movie and ""The Thorn Birds""? (sure hope so!!)"
"mharrison-17627","1","2","13","25 March 2019"," Bad film
","A bad, low budget film that feels like it was made for TV. James Coburn was 20 years too old for his character, and James Mason and Maximilian Schell were clearly way too old too. The director was a talentless hack who drank four bottles of spirits every day during filming."
"Jakealope","8","1","5","6 August 2005"," Great East Front Realism but a Flawed Movie
","Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. By using Yugoslavia and the local army, who used vintage Russian weapons, it gave it realism that no Hollywood production could match, where Combat! or the Battle of the Bulge used American tanks painted with German crosses. The acting and stars performed well too: Schell, Coburn, Mason and Warner pulled their weight. What I hated was the plot itself: the enemy in this case was the career minded Prussian officer Hauptmann Stransky played by Maximillian Schell. For instance, he wanted to kill the Russian boy soldier prisoner but Steiner stopped him. A little background is in order, the Germans killed millions of Russian pow's, often shooting them right after they surrendered, then the Soviets threw the survivors of the German camps into their own camps after the war. Adding the million of others murdered by the Nazis, including machine gunning 2 million Jews, Stransly would be a saint. Why the filmmaker left out any references to the massive atrocities of the Germans and Russians and focused on one phony glory seeker is beyond me. Peckinpah was famous for his artistic slow mo approach to violence, like in the ""Wild Bunch"", but this film lacked the excitement and novelty of that one.<br/><br/>Obviously the German writer must have it in for officers and had a class warfare angle to the plot, the plebes versus the Prussian aristocrats. But the Nazis had that same attitude too, so hating aristocratic career Junker officers is hardly some badge of goodness. Once again, it's hard to make a movie about the East Front and ignore all the mass atrocities; that is an atrocity itself, except for the closing credits. It is a good action movie and interesting, and has a good European look so I do recommend it in spite of what I said above. Some of the action scenes are well done and have a better feel than the usual contrived Rambo-Terminator Kung Fu super hyped combat scenes we are dosed with these days."
"robertmaybeth","9","1","6","25 May 2018"," A very under-rated film - the only war movie to capture the Ostfront from the soldier's point of view.
","Based on the novel of the same name, this film is one of Peckinpah's best films. The ambition of Peckinpah's efforts are shown by the large scale of the events shown, and you truly get a feel of the story he was trying to tell. But something gets lost in the translation from book to film, and this film is at times too subtle or too overt, with a lot of the subtleties of the characters getting lost in the process. Despite a fine cast, with many first rate actors, the movie aims high but just doesn't quite achieve the scope Peckinpah was going for.<br/><br/>And what a cast it is, too. Including James Coburn, James Mason and Maximilian Schell, the chemistry between them proves to be one of the best parts of this movie. Coburn plays Sergeant Steiner, a man too long in the war and too jaded to be false in any way. His superior Captain Stransky (Schell) needs Steiner's help to vouch for him so he can get the Iron Cross medal he is obsessed with getting. Schell will go to any lengths to get the medal, and tries to convince Steiner to vouch for him regarding a battlefield event (that didn't happen the way Stransky said it did). Steiner, predictably, dislikes officers almost as much as he hates the war, and refuses to do it. At one point Steiner throws his own Iron Cross on Stansky's desk and blurts, ""Here, take it!"" but nothing less then a real Iron Cross will do. The two continue to be in conflict for the rest of the film, all done in a very murky subplot that is sometimes unclear - the main issue I have with this movie. <br/><br/>This was obviously a herculean effort by Peckinpah, and despite the muddy subplot that the film centers around, the battle scenes are fairly well done. Filmed partly in Croatia - that was still firmly in the Communist Bloc at the time of filming - the battle scenes feature genuine T-34 tanks along with dozens of extras during the Russian assault scenes and give the movie a real touch of authenticity. Set in spring 1943 - one of the rare lulls in the Ostfront between Stalingrad and the colossal battle at Kursk - it does manage to give a sense of the overwhelming enemy facing the German Wehrmacht during all stages of the war. There's enough great battle scenes here to distract from the, somewhat weak subplot and to show what war in the mud of Russia might have been like. Unfortunately the movie has a relatively weak ending - Steiner and Stransky are still alive but still battling on at the end. So the ultimate fate of the two strongest characters is left untold.<br/><br/>All in all a great war movie, if a little frustrating to interpret while viewing."

Many of the philosophical and political comments made here would be apropros to the book upon which it is based, but the movie is a mere shadow of the book.  I see no profundity in the movie itself and none of the imagination of some of Peckinpah's other work.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie to any but the most die-hard Peckinpah fan.  It has taken me several years to watch the movie completely through to the end as I simply fall asleep during the repetitive battle scenes and the poorly-written dialogue."

"LaGayaScienza","6","0","5","27 September 2019"," Rough, dirty, a bit outdated and unpleasent for the ears
","After reading reviews from many different point of views I started to watch this film with curiosity.
Some reviewer said that the only used explosive in the ""Cross of iron"" is dynamite. This can be true because every explosion sounds similar. In the famous phenomenological war description ""Storm of steel"" (about WW1) there appears a plenty of grenade or projectile types, each of them produce different, peculiar sound. This historical inaccuracy can be an issue for somebody, because In the WW2 the types of explosives were even multiplied.<br/><br/>I guess ""Cross of iron"" is a must for James Coburn (famous white teeth) /Sam Peckinpah (famous slow motion deaths) fans. Haters can compare this with another, new Eastern front movie ""My honor was loyalty"", where SS-men speak German, have prussian military haircuts and even shave outdoor on the frontline.<br/><br/>Overall, despite worn-out aspect, ""Cross of iron"" is a movie above mediocre and without mainstream cliches."

"dworldeater","8","0","4","22 April 2018"," Great WW2 movie, Peckinpah style
","Cross Of Iron is a very good and different WW2 film that is very original and well done. This movie was'nt a big budget production by any means, but Sam Peckinpah got a lot of bang for his buck in his last great film. The film is gritty, bleak and depressing and is taken from the German soldier's point of view in the final days of battle on the Russian front. This film is mostly devoid of dogma or politics of the war, but very accurately conveys the horrors of war. James Coburn gives one of his finest performances as skilled German soldier Sgt. Steiner who is a killing machine, but hates the war and his superiors.(which mirrors Sam 's views on authority, especially producers, of which his battles are legendary) The film has excellent performers for sure with Maximillian Schell, James Mason and David Warner. The battle scenes are great and showcases a lot of Sam's signature slow motion shootouts. This is Sam Peckinpah's only war film and it is very unique and quite excellent that he comments on violence and ultra authoritarian governments. He does not beat the viewer over the head with this subtext, but the anti war message is there. Even with Peckinpah's alcohol and drug problems, he still is on the top of his game in this production and made a very memorable and effective anti war film."
"jturnbull-398-395794","8","0","1","24 October 2013"," James Coburn in his best role?
","I had been aware of this film but it wasn't until recently I purchased it on DVD. Others have noted its similarities in some respects to Stalingrad, but I feel CoI is a superior film. The acting is sharper and we are presented with a range of characters all with different views and attitudes to why they are on the Eastern front, and what they hope to achieve be it glory, sanity or to just survive and get the hell out of there. All of the lead and support actors are very good in their roles, and it is possible this is Coburns best. The villain of the piece here of course is the vain glorious Prussian aristocrat who seeks the Iron Cross for purely personal yet family reasons. He needs to return home as the hero and patriarch and is quite happy to betray the ordinary soldier to obtain his lofty aims. Yet he hates the Nazi's and the 'little corporal and failed painter'. He clearly sees that regardless of how the war ends it will be his class that will eventually rule Germany. The Iron Cross will just be a trophy of his superiority. A good bookend to Stalingrad but IMHO a somewhat more satisfying film."
"seaneenreillyy","10","0","1","19 December 2009"," Magnificent
","This movie is magnificent for two reasons: Firstly, there is the performance of James Coburn. There are few if any celebrated actors who could've carried this role so well. There is simply a gulf in dignified class between what Coburn brought to the role and anything so called contemporaries such as McQueen and Marvin could've given. James Mason's own marvellous performance echoes Coburns. This performance by Coburn first and foremost makes this movie special.<br/><br/>Secondly, this was a very important film in that it humanized German suffering. It is sad but true that following this release, instead of a growing understanding of right and wrong having existed on all sides during that terrible war, the emergence of the series 'Holocaust' placed all Germans back into the convenient stereotype of being brutal, unquestioning sadists. This phenomenon is only now beginning to have run its course. An extremely important movie."
"jinmo2007-1","7","0","5","13 November 2008"," This is a great movie but it has its flaws.
","One glaring flaw of this movie is its portrayal of the ""privileged"" officer/nobility class in the German army of WWII. Hitler was himself a gefreiter in the Reichswehr of WWI and, to give the devil his due, during the inter-war period he had tried very hard to eradicate the class- and rank- inequality in the Wehrmacht. Not only that, Hitler actually HATED the German officer/nobility class and did his best to screw them given half the chance. For example, in the movie, during the dance party for the patients in the military hospital where Steiner recuperates, the adjutant for a visiting general gives order to ""take meat and wine"" from the buffet table ""to private room"" (so that the general and his entourage may consume it in privacy). Such thing could never happen in Hitler's army. Had there been any general attempting such thing, he would almost certainly have been court-martialled."
"melkordoom","8","0","1","28 July 2008"," Decent war film, some minor flaws.
","First of all I am an avid history buff. I have read most of the comments on here, if not all. I would have to disagree with the person's who remarked that this was a bad war movie. first off this movie is meant to be anti-war, like all quiet on the western front, only set about 25 years later. Secondly this movie does get combat correct on the Eastern Front, well at least combat that was not fighting in urban settings such as Stalingrad, Leningrad etc... So one can not really compare Stalingrad (albite a really good movie)to this film. Now onto some of the flaws that a no one has really mentioned, the uniforms were a bit off. First off Steiner is wearing a 1943 style uniform (with the 1943 style field cap), that is the year the film is set. However, if Steiner was on the ""Russian"" front for a few years, he would be wearing an older uniform (like some of his comrades are wearing early war and some pre-war uniforms, Steiner's is mid war). The tanks/trucks/ some of the rifles and submachine guns used are post WWII cold war era Yugoslavian/soviet made (including a lot of the ""soviet"" soldiers uniforms, however they do at least wear the correct jackets and helmets). The acting is not the best, and the German accents are not that great, but other than that and the above mentioned mistakes there is not a whole lot wrong with this movie. Oh, and to make a comment about people saying that this does not depict life on the Russian front correctly (because the men have beards and long hair, and there are a few strong homosexual themes) one has to think about what some one would do/look like if living in a trench in eastern Europe for months on end with out any real break. The higher command might have been bothered by this small annoyance, but would let it slide considering they had much worse things to worry about. Hope this comment from a history major/ movie buff helped."
"jonathan-577","8","0","1","18 October 2007"," Sam battles Julius to a draw
","This is a flawed film. There are a few occasions when the sweeping grandeur gives way to a mere reading of lines. And the accents are all over the place, which of course is the price we all pay for having James Coburn, James Mason and David Warner as the most sympathetic Nazi soldiers since Leni Riefenstahl. But the payoff is a movie that seems to reflect an insider's knowledge of how men actually behave when at war. Sure it's also working on an overtly allegorical level - but the allegory is about class, not race much less 'freedom' or something: Coburn's weary pro soldier and Maximillian Schell's aristocratic Prussian general have Hitler surrounded with their mutual disdain, leaving you to ponder all the chaotic lives papered over by the theatre of fascist discipline. Most of the time, it's just about your dream scenario of what would happen if Sam Peckinpah were to direct a script by Julius Epstein. These are two brilliant but flawed artists slugging it out in the rectangular ring, a man of action meeting a man of intellect, and while the attenuated sentimentality they share does peek through in their respective ways, on balance it's just thrilling. The medical leave sequence is as brilliantly conceived and edited as the explosion that puts us there, and the double-amputee soldier who offers the general a foot to shake is worthy of Lewis Milestone. The battle scenes, it should go without saying, take you there."

","The reason I liked this movie, was for the first time it showed the war from a different point of view, the common soldier,it also reminded me of the German film Das Brucke(The Bridge), it was about the final desperate days of Germany and how war stole a lot from the people of that era. I heard my mother say that was when we lost almost two generations. But what engrossed me the most was the shots of the Russian T-34/85 tanks and the other equipment. I will admit it inspired me to get back in the hobby of scale model building after a hiatus. To me it's more fun now than then. I model WWII Russian and German armor, solely because, like in the movie, it was a struggle unlike any we have or are likely to see again. Let's remember that all in that conflict were not the same. That's why this is one of the best movies on the war in Russia(Kuban bridgehead)yet to date."

James Coburn is Sergeant Steiner a decorated soldier and leader of the group much like ""Kat"" in All Quiet on the Western Front who could care less about his decorations. James Mason as Colonel Brandt is an officer who knows the war is essentially lost but goes through the motions because he's a professional career officer and that's what's expected of him. David Warner as Captain Kiesel is burned out from war and has become oblivious to it's horrors. This is a film that requires the viewer to watch and watch with concentration to get the full meaning.

"JAM-31","Null","0","1","6 December 2001"," Hell on the Eastern Front
","I just gave this film a second viewing, and realized that it is far superior in many ways to other films depicting the eastern front, primarily ""Enemy at the Gates"" and ""Stalingrad.""  <br/><br/>I originally didn't think there was much separating it from Peckinpah's other films; it has a heavy influence on manly bonding, slow-motion shots of soldiers twitching as blood-squibs explode on their bodies, and what some may see as a sexist attitude towards women.  These are soldiers who are fighting a war against kids and women, fed up and disgusted by those, like Captain Stansky, who still see the Russian conquest as an heroic adventure. These soldiers aren't much different from Pike's outfit in ""The Wild Bunch."" But ""Cross of Iron"" displays a very convincing atmosphere of death, horror, and futility.<br/><br/>The film has a few low and dated production values--the 1970's haircuts, old methods of filming combat (the slow-motion, again) and some lack of scope hurt the film a small amount.  But the movie excels in depicting the terror of combat.  Being shelled by one's enemies comes off as particularly devastating.  However, scenes without combat are just as effective; A high-ranking officer realizes he can not shake hands with a combat veteran who has stubs, a truck drives right over the carcass of a rotting German soldier, and the dialogue and appearance of the men in Steiner's platoon constantly reflect weariness and fatigue.  ""Cross of Iron,"" together with ""Come and See,"" may be the definitive war films on the Russian Front. Grade: B+"
