","Black Mass: A Near Miss<br/><br/>'Black Mass' is another is a line of crime dramas set in Boston. The film will inevitable be compared to 'The Departed.' And it falls short in the comparison. The acting is top rate, and Depp is much better, not as hammy, than the comic portrait of a crime boss by Nicholson in 'The Departed.' Depp is genuinely threatening in the film and the make-up job given him in the film adds to the fright. <br/><br/>'Black Mass' has the look of a 70s television show, and that works in its favor. In fact, the overall look of the film is exquisite. That, and the acting, are the two best things in the film. However, the movie is both too much and not enough. <br/><br/>'Black Mass' tries to cover too much and thus it lacks focus. This is where 'The Departed' succeeds. While 'The Departed' has many layers and character, it has a focus: the Southie, Billy. 'Black Mass' doesn't have a main theme, a main character, a main protagonist or antagonist. There are a bunch of characters in tense situations with some irony and symbolism. However, in the end, there is nothing to hold onto, no lessons, no emotions, love or hate, for any characters. <br/><br/>As I was watching, both my film buddy and I thought the same thing: Scorsese could have made this story work with his writing and directing. We also thought that in an era of long- form television that it could have made a great 10-20 episode show. Then it could have gone into depth about the childhood relationships between crime boss Bulger, his FBI friend Connolly and Whitey's brother, State Senator Billy Bulger. <br/><br/>As miniseries, it could have more deeply explored the racial tensions between the Irish and Italians with the African Americans stuck in the middle. It could have taken a deeper look into Boston politics and corruption, police corruption, and more. The miniseries could have also gone further into the Irish American funding of the IRA. As it was, it touched on each of those issues in an unsatisfactory fashion. If the film had taken a deeper look into any ONE of those themes, it would have made for a better movie. <br/><br/>Rating: Matin√©e<br/><br/>For the great look and outstanding acting, I suggest you see it on the big screen. Otherwise, wait for the miniseries. Hey, a man can dream. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"

","Black Mass serves as a nice redemption for the floundering career of Johnny Depp, who has leaned more on quirky voices and loud makeup than his actual skills in recent years. His portrayal of mob boss Whitey Bulger is a powerhouse performance and easily his best since he first introduced the world to Jack Sparrow. It's too bad the movie as a whole doesn't fair quite as well. Despite a great cast and some interestingly insane source material, somehow a movie about one of America's most infamous criminals feels more like small claims court. Director Cooper focuses his narrative on Bulger's less-than-legal partnership with the FBI. It's a fascinatingly close-knit community we witness (agents, felons, politicians, and families alike) in which loyalty and corruption go hand-in-hand. It's a grimy yet quiet 70's-feel gangster film that engages its audience nearly as much as it reminds them of better films. Therein lies its big problem: What is Black Mass offering that hasn't already been perfected in other gangster films? Unfortunately, instead of a true movie-making vision, it's like a guy watched every crime drama from the last 40 years and just spit out a less-interesting copycat. Not that a counterfeit of something great can't still have its positives: the score is beautiful and the performances from the top-notch cast around Depp are nearly as superb as his, all of whom nail the oft-parodied Bostonian accent with aplomb. But with too many side plots to juggle, not enough cohesion to the storytelling, and an unfortunate lack of auteur vision, Black Mass just can't stand against the great American crime films of yore (Chinatown, Godfather, Goodfellas)."
"thechristopherpennington","6","88","129","24 September 2015"," What was the point?
","I swear to God I really really wanted to like this movie. I am kind of a fan of Bulger's for some sick reason and I felt like Johnny Depp was appropriately menacing and weird looking and did a good job with making the Violence believable. What failed was the writing. There is never really any attention paid to why Whitey was Whitey or how he got to be Whitey or why he wanted to be Whitey. His kid is dead his marriage ruined and he is just accumulating money to accumulate money? Why? He apparently has no vices to speak of except giving money to con men from the IRA. The whole thing just makes no sense. The whole thing just seemed apathetic.It could have been a real classic but they fornicated with the puppy yet again. It was just Depp looking weird and enjoying a WHitey Halloween costume while he strangled hookers and killed informants. Thanks Hollywood. I suspect you can blame the producers."

","Black Mass is a crime drama movie revolving around the true events behind the Winter Hill Gang and the gang's leader Whitey Bulger played by Johnny Depp. The premise for the film was very interesting as it played on Whitey Bulger's connections as his brother, William Bulger, played by Benedict Cummberbatch is a Massachusetts State Senator while one of his childhood friends John Connolly played by Joel Edgerton is an FBI agent. This an amazing premise however it was not fully executed as it focused mainly on Joel Edgerton's character and Cummberbatch's character felt out of place at times. This may have been a more realistic approach however I felt like they could have utilized Cummberbatch's character more in the film as it would have added two assets for Whitey. The Film is divided in three parts overlooking Whitey's almost twenty year reign. However because of this approach it leaves viewers wondering what happened in that time frame and feels as if it was forced to make the movie feel more like the actually events, so spread out. The cinematography and direction of the film is very crisp and sleek which makes the film a lot more enjoyable. The acting all together throughout the film is superb as it holds a stellar cast. I found Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton,Kevin Bacon and Benedict Cummberbatch to be all great. Depp's performance was electrifying and he should get an Oscar nod but I would not be surprised if he does not get one.<br/><br/>Overall decent film<br/><br/>7/10"
"apgpuckslinger","6","46","74","25 September 2015"," Underwhelming
","I saw this movie with a bunch of my college friends (we are all in college). They all loved it. And I will say that Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton were fantastic in this movie, however, the movie lacked the qualities of a great mob movie. I have always been fascinated by the mob genre. I have watched the sopranos, goodfellas, donnie brasco, the godfather, and basically all mob movies under the sun. I feel like Johnny Depp and Edgerton are great at portraying their characters, but I feel like no other character was developed at all. Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the great actors of today, but Cooper just wasted his talents on a weak supporting role.<br/><br/>I was also looking forward to see the inner workings of how Whitey Bulger came to power. I understand that he was a silent, cold-blooded mobster that used the FBI to become to be one of the most influential criminals in Boston. However, other then a few choking scenes and murder scenes, I would have liked Cooper to show more of the specifics of Bulger's rise to power. Also, we rarely see Bulger interacting in the everyday mob-life, but we always see how he handles unique, problematic situations all-the time. I would have liked to have seen one normal day in Whitey Bulger's life given the movie was only was 2 hours long. <br/><br/>Overall, a decent movie with great acting by Depp and Edgerton, but lacking on some of the finer details of a classic mob movie. <br/><br/>P.S. I could not take Ben Wyatt serious in that mustache."
"baiolemi","6","20","29","20 September 2015"," Meh.. A ""less good"" version of Goodfellas..
","Black mass is a decent flick, but by no means is it anything more than decent. Nothing stood out at all; the acting was fine, the story was fine, and the soundtrack was terrible in my opinion. The music sounded like it belonged in a Bourne movie. All of the ""plot-twists"" that were supposed to feel surprising didn't feel very surprising. It was completely obvious when something bad was going to happen to someone, unlike other gang movies like Goodfellas or Godfather. <br/><br/>If your not too picky and want to watch some decent gang action and drama then you will likely enjoy this movie, but if your a movie snob like me I would recommend passing on this one."
"urthpainter","5","139","245","20 September 2015"," drudgery
","If you like slow, plodding movies full of unlikeable characters, by all means gear up for this sleep inducing film. Goodfellas is an action movie compared to Black Mass.<br/><br/>There are a few good qualities here: top shelf production, excellent acting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices - leading to predictable consequences.<br/><br/>But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters are worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer any true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea.<br/><br/>But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason to sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The scumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a law enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best (including Benedict, who for all his talent, brings nothing of note to an already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture what-so-ever, and often these fat, out of shape gangsters look absurd in their early 80's sunglasses and attire. There will be no awards given for costuming or make-up here. True Depp is transformed with prosthetics, but as a friend and I joked - his character is far exceeded by the likes of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer, you've been robbed of one of the films three or four memorable moments. Interestingly, all of these good scenes are just spice to the meat of the film. This is not a good thing! When the main arc is dull, the violence (while realistic) lacks stylistic punctuation, and the constant voice overs are delivered with apathy... one wonders what the hell the director was thinking!<br/><br/>Waste of time, even for fans of actors involved.<br/><br/>my score? a disappointingly average 5 out of 10."
"srfzr-x80","6","55","94","17 September 2015"," Comprised of spectacular performances, Johnny Depp and Co. carry this run-of-the-mill B list Mob movie to relevance.
","Encompassed with episodic rhythm and an awfully conventional format, Scott Cooper mutates a story of rich soil capable of greatness to a detaching and routine crime film. Black Mass grasps only on the superficial layer as it focuses solely on documented events of the crime they organized. Due to this, the movie suffers as it seems to be merely a biography- laying out these horrific events in these specified timeframes but not putting any focus on the characters that performed it. All action, but none of the story that happens between that allows the audience to view who they are and what they're like. Black Mass fails to delve deeper into the roots, and this of course limits the scope of all the actors. Great mob cinematography such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and the Sopranos- all of these were so great because they allowed the audience to see what the characters were like when they weren't shooting, beating, or plotting against people.<br/><br/>That being said, in their limited boxes boy do these actors put on a show. Led by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, the audience can tell straight from the start that this cast reveled and lived their roles. With the amount of overwhelming, heinous events; the film had to have someone cold-hearted and sleazy, and woah did these actors become the epitome of that. However, due to this heavily limited character, the only ""rise"" the audience feels are from the bone-chilling actions that these men did. Black Mass fails to captivate. And when the closing credits roll a feeling of disappointment washes over you, as it feels like you just watched an episode on the ID channel with really, really good actors."
"jacobcornblatt","Null","79","142","20 September 2015"," ""Black Mass"" is all but Great
","I try not to get my hopes up too much for certain movies, and ""Black Mass"" (which I got very excited about) just reminds me why.<br/><br/>Oh, Scott Cooper... how did you manage to make one of the most twisted, unusual, and mysterious gangster stories into an emotionless web of a film? From acting to editing, there was so much wrong that it's almost surprising.<br/><br/>My main issue was the nonexistence of a certain necessity: stakes. In all great mafia flicks, stakes are essential. Would ""Goodfellas"" have been as remarkable if it didn't feel like any wrong move would set off a universe-ending set of events? Would the ""Godfather"" have been considered the greatest film of all time if a war wasn't seconds away from breaking out? ""Black Mass"" managed to keep a story that easily could've had those steaks from having any at all. This was, of course, caused by the emotionless acting, but more on that in a second. But this film really made me not care if the protagonist (whether you consider that to be Bulger or Connolly) lives or dies; and in a mob movie, that is a worse crime than anything committed on screen.<br/><br/>So the acting I blame entirely on Cooper. Every single actor did a great job with what they were given, but the problem is that they were given the wrong thing. For example, Depp was probably told to play a silent yet psychotic, friendly yet intimidating crime lord. Did he do that well? Absolutely. Is that who the character was written as? Not at all. Same goes for Joel Edgerton's - who I thought did the best job out of all of the actors - character, Jesse Plemons' character, and even smaller characters like Adam Scott's. All those actors did well, but not in the right parts.<br/><br/>The list goes on with issues, so let's talk about why the movie got 2 stars rather than zero (therefore, let's talk about the positives). I've heard some critics discuss the overuse of violence in the film. Though there is quite a bit of violence, I thought it was used very tastefully. No blood was used where it didn't seem necessary, and personally, I think that the violence becomes numbing, which takes us even further into the mob guys' mentality on murder. Also, I thought the shooting locations were very well chosen, as they really captured the narrow-mindedness of the lead characters' lives.<br/><br/>So should you see this movie? -If you love mafia movies of any shape or size, then go see it. -If you love Johnny Depp, wait until it comes out on demand. -If you don't love mafia movies, haven't seen many mafia movies, or just have none of the listed qualities above, then don't see this film."

","The intrigue of all crime movies relies on a simple idea: people are complex, but actions are not. Behind every reductive, one-word crime ‚Äî""murder,"" ""theft,"" ""extortion""‚Äì is a human with a motive and a history to support that motive. Part of the reason we follow the stories of criminals is to overlay ourselves on their paths, trace the steps around their intentions, and see where they turn where you would not. Great crime stories give us the opportunity feel our own humanity guide us through darkness. Unfortunately, I felt nothing while watching Black Mass.<br/><br/>Heralded as a return to acting form for Johnny Depp, Black Mass tells the true-crime story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, a mythologized, south-Boston crime lord who operated from the late 70's to early 90's. As an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the film portrays the key years of Bulger's ascent to power in the Boston crime world, during which he acted as an FBI-informant through slick FBI agent (and Southie homeboy) John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). At the behest of Connolly and his less enthusiastic boss Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Bulger provides information that precipitates the downfall of the Italian mob, allowing his own Winter Hill gang to take over all aspects of Boston crime, from the drug trade to money laundering, and everything in-between.<br/><br/>However, with such a compelling, cant-fail crime premise, the film is bafflingly hollow. Other than hearing a laundry list of crimes that Bulger supposedly spearheads, we almost never see any crimes being committed, other than the odd shotgun rampage or prostitute murder (both which felt sadly derivative for such gruesome scenes). Doors slam, money is exchanged, and men with furrowed brows walk hastily down empty alleys‚Äîbut it never feels like we are made to understand why.<br/><br/>Where is the money coming from? What are Whitey's motivations? Who are the victims of these crimes, or rather, where are the commoners (for a film with such a large cast, it seems completely devoid of extras) of Boston at all? Even the undeniable Benedict Cumberbatch seems adrift and misused in his role as Whitey's state senator brother Billy Bulger.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper chose to focus only on a handful of key years during Whitey's reign of terror, perhaps to draw focus on his peak instead of wasting time on his rise or fall. Unfortunately, the result is a dubiously avowed criminal juggernaut who feels‚Äìand sometimes looks‚Äîlike he is made out of paper. Much has been made of Depp's transformation into the balding, ghostly Bulger through the magic of makeup, prosthetics, and false teeth. He looks legitimately ghoulish throughout the film, yet the performance feels thin and insubstantial, perhaps less due to Depp's acting than to the camera's disinterest.<br/><br/>Depp does has his moments, especially in one particularly tense scene where he slinks out of the shadows to confront Connolly's untrusting wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson), lurking over her like a pale, demonic shadow. During that scene, I felt like I was watching a horror movie. Afterwards, I could only lament the fact the rest of the movie didn't try harder to be a horror movie, or didn't try harder to be anything interesting at all.<br/><br/>Black Mass has the trappings of a great film with solid performances, beautifully lit shots, and a wealth of source materials, making its ultimate failure that much more disappointing. Crime stories are a staple of American cinema and we accept them for their inherent limitations. However, in 2015 it's simply unacceptable to approach the making of a crime movie with absolutely no creative spirit.<br/><br/>Several other reviews have likened Black Mass to a poor imitation of Goodfellas or other Scorsese films. If Goodfellas is the gourmet p√¢tisserie of crime movies, then Black Mass is an airport Cinnabon, a fluorescently lit sprawl of half baked, cookie-cutter crime characters we've all come to expect‚Äìa dash of angry FBI chief here, a sprinkle of disgruntled mob grunt there‚Äìwho delivered their lines and then seemingly evaporate into stale air. The movie runs over two excruciating hours yet fails to make plain the impact of the Bulger's crimes, resulting in a story which accomplishes the impossible feat of feeling both protracted and unfinished.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper strives to portray Whitey Bulger as the boogeyman, an unstoppable nightmare whose actions are made infinitely more terrifying by the knowledge that they exist in reality. Instead, Black Mass is the kind of dream that you forget the instant you wake up.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

","The icy blue eyes of notorious Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger stare out from the screen in Scott Cooper's ""Black Mass"" like the gaze of some confident jungle predator calmly lying in wait, holding his ground until the moment he moves in for the kill. And that same coolly calculated composure extends to every aspect of how the actor playing Bulger embodies the role, or rather disappears into it. But if Johnny Depp's mesmerizing performance ‚Äî a bracing return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires ‚Äî is the chief selling point of ""Black Mass,"" there is much else to recommend this sober, sprawling, deeply engrossing evocation of Bulger's South Boston fiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly, played with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton. Something of an anti-""The Departed"" (which was partly inspired by the Bulger case), the movie has an intentionally muted, '70s-style look and feel that may limit its appeal to the date-night multiplex crowd, but quality- starved adult moviegoers should flock to one of the fall's first serious, awards-caliber attractions. Not only that but Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays as a Senator and as Whitey's brother) has given a stellar performance. He is truly a talented person who gives his all in every film/show he acts.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar, if not then at least a nomination. Truly worth watching"
"sfsknight03","2","156","306","20 September 2015"," Boring, uninspired crime drama
","I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to inform others about how awful this film was. And I want to prefice this by saying I love crime films and have seen the greats such as Goodfellas, the Godfather, and The Departed but this was just drivel. <br/><br/>Let's start with the acting: Johnny Depp plays Boston crime lord James ""Whitey"" Bulger and reveals virtually nothing about the character he plays aside from the violent actions he portrays. The supporting cast does nothing to make this a compelling story either with the exception of Joel Edgerton's John Connolly as a street-wise kid turned FBI agent loyal to Bulger's cause. <br/><br/>The pacing and dialogue are also the biggest culprits here. The film develops slowly leaving the watcher wondering if it will ever pick up to an emotional crescendo with only to find out the ride is as monotonous as your daily drive. Moreover, the dialogue feels like students taking turns reading out of a textbook. I know that the film is a biographic one but there's no need to have it feel as though you're reading a Wikipedia article. <br/><br/>Likewise, the musical score tries to underpin the uneasy feel of the movie but only works to put the viewer to sleep with its two tone rise and fall. None of the cinematography and shots of the scenes work to create anything worth capturing attention. There are shots of Southie that do convey the bleak outlook of Bulger's turf but they are few and far between as the film mostly focuses on the boring and uninspired dialogue and setting the actors are captured in such as living rooms, offices, dark bars, and car interiors. <br/><br/>If I was to summarize watching this film with an analogy I would describe it as eating and tasting a cardboard box."
"Troy_Campbell","5","14","21","13 October 2015"," Not bad, just so damn standard.
","The American crime genre is arguably the cornerstone of modern cinema. Think cinematic masterpieces and there's a good chance every third one is a mobster flick or underworld yarn. This breed of film is nothing if not reliable. Why, then, is the first notable movie about one of U.S.A's most notorious and durable heads of crime so unmemorable? Checking off key points in an organised but uninspired manner, this James ""Whitey"" Bulger biopic is seemingly more concerned about fitting in all the Wiki-worthy moments rather than truly delving into the psyche of a monstrous man. The unfocused script stems from the choice to trace two decades of Bulger's life (1975 to 1995), an unwieldy stretch of time that results in an unclear filmic timeline and the requirement for truly horrible makeup and wigs. Johnny Depp has succeeded at portraying a gangster before ‚Äì his John Dillinger in Public Enemies is enthralling ‚Äì however he's lumped with too many poorly executed physical alterations and character development shortcomings to make an impression here. Aussie Joel Edgerton fares better as a morally intriguing federal agent skating on thin ice, and Kevin Bacon is enjoyable as a frustrated FBI boss, but why Benedict Cumberbatch signed on for such an inconsequential role, as Bulger's Senator brother, is anyone's guess. Scott Cooper keeps it relatively low-key behind the camera, aside from a couple of stylish murder sequences, with the suitably dour cinematography and unfussy score following suit. Overall Black Mass is never overtly bad, per se; its major sin is just being so damn standard."
"paulmcuomo","6","3","3","8 December 2015"," Black Mass has a great cast, but only two get used well
","Scott Cooper is a guy who directed Crazy Heart which I've heard is good but haven't seen, and Out of the Furnace which I was unimpressed by for its tone. Regardless, his film have a solid feel to them - they feel robust, and he is great for getting great people in-front of the camera.<br/><br/>In this film, the two featured leads, Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, deliver the best work they could possibly do; Depp's performance as James Bulger is malevolent, terrifying, and in many scenes totally believable. He isn't a light, jolly, seductive figure that Depp's reputation lends itself naturally towards, and I think is totally worthy of an Oscar. Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, Bulger's FBI handler who is manipulated is fantastic as the man whose awe of Bulger drags him in deeper and deeper to the point where he can't separate personal and professional boundaries.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is that the emotional fulcrum point is around the two most emotionally compromising people. The other cast are fairly wasted; the most notable example is Benedict Cumberbatch, who does great as Senator Billy Bulger, who creates a honorable, no bs man who loses his position because of his brother is pushed to the side despite a great performance with a believable Boston accent.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a strong one, but it keeps itself from being perfect. Depp's performance however IS perfect, and is solely worth seeing for that."
"zardoz-13","5","8","11","14 October 2015"," Sluggish Crime Saga with little Cinematic Flair
","""Out of the Furnace"" director Scott Cooper's ""Black Mass"" qualifies as a gritty, atmospheric, but middling mobster melodrama that chronicles the life and crimes of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, a notorious Boston gangster with an Irish upbringing who evaded authorities for 16 years before justice eventually caught and convicted him for 11 homicides. Adapted from a thoroughgoing non-fiction bestseller by ""Boston Globe"" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, this unsavory, R-rated, crime chiller provides ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star Johnny Depp with a chance to atone for far too many silly, superficial comedies. Academy Award-winner Jack Nicholson did an imaginary take on this real-life sociopath in Martin Scorsese's memorable law and order epic ""The Departed,"" a mob movie ten times more suspenseful than ""Black Mass."" Now, Depp stars as the infamous felon himself. Although he appears incredibly chilling as the bloodthirsty maniac who is currently serving two life sentences plus five years, nothing about Depp's performance reveals any insights about this heinous individual. Indeed, thanks to prosthetics galore, Depp bears a striking resemblance to Bulger, but nothing beneath his grim, tight-lipped portrayal yields a clue about the murderer's mindset. Reportedly, Bulger refused to talk to Depp about his life. Meantime, this is not the Depp that we have grown accustomed to in movies like the frivolous ""Pirates"" franchise, ""The Lone Ranger,"" ""Tusk,"" ""Dark Shadows,"" and ""Mortdecai."" Instead, this is the Depp of ""Public Enemies,"" ""Donnie Brasco,"" and ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" As Bulger, Depp strangles a defenseless young harlot with a rope, beats an adversary to death with his bare fists, and mows downs an unarmed, but treacherous henchman with a carbine. Don't walk into ""Black Mass"" and imagine you're going to see something that will make you giggle with glee. Unquestionably, ""Black Mass"" constitutes a long overdue return to form for the immensely talented Depp. Critics have hailed his performance as Oscar worthy. As unforgettable as Depp is, the man who steals the show and delivers the best performance is Depp's co-star Joel Edgerton of ""Warriors."" Cast as corrupt FBI Agent John Connolly, who conspired with the real-life Bulger to shield him from prosecution, Edgerton emerges as nothing short of sensational. While Depp relies on prosthetics to impersonate Bulger, Edgerton shuns elaborate make-up and turns the tainted FBI agent into a sympathetic flesh and blood character. He gets under Connolly's skin and shows us what makes the man tick.<br/><br/>A profane, violent, but episodic crime thriller, ""Black Mass"" covers familiar ground. Director Scott Cooper, who also helmed ""Crazy Heart,"" neither pulls any punches in his casual depiction of mob violence nor does he startle us with any surprises. You've seen everything that Cooper stages here in other gangster movies. Essentially, ""Black Mass"" is an empire-building crime film, but Cooper doesn't recount either how Bulger established his empire or solidified it with his intimidating reputation. Instead, he dwells on episodes that earlier movies like ""The Departed,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Town,"" ""Killing Me Softly,"" ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle,"" and the two ""Boondock Saints"" thrillers have done before and done with greater panache. Basically, the action unfolds in five year increments, beginning in 1975 as a number of Bulger's cronies cut deals with the Feds to save their necks. Freshman scenarist Mark Mallouk and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" scribe Jez Butterworth neglect to explore the psychology behind the treachery that prompted Bulger's underlings to inform on him. Meantime, Cooper focuses almost entirely on the relationship between Bulger and Connolly. The subplot involving Whitey's older brother Billy could have been left on the editing room floor. Incredibly, ""Black Mass"" omits some of the more compelling incidents in the page-turning Lehr and O'Neill book. Specifically, the filmmakers have altered the events that brought Bulger and Connolly together as conspirators as well as some of the crimes. <br/><br/>A convicted bank robber who did 9-years in Alcatraz, Bulger masqueraded as a Robin Hood-style gangster around South Boston, but his fellow goons weren't fooled by his shenanigans. Ironically, loyalty among these thieves is the first casualty. As the film unfolds, Bulger henchman Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons of ""Varsity Blues""), goes on the record swearing that he isn't a ""rat!"" On the other hand, FBI Agent John Connolly worshiped the ground that Bulger trod and refused to testify against him. Connolly grew up in the same blue-collar Irish neighborhood as Bulger. Whitey intervened in a fight where Connolly would have suffered grievously without his support. Connolly struggles to convince his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson of ""Kinsey"") that loyalty supersedes morality. Nevertheless, her husband's adulation for Bulger repels her. Connolly sets out to recruit Bulger as a source, but Bulger balks at being an informant. Inevitably, Connolly forges an unholy alliance with Bulger, so the Bureau can crush the Mafia in Boston and he could claim credit for the demise of the Italians. Ultimately, Connolly sold his soul to the devil, while Cooper makes Bulger appear as sinister as Satan.<br/><br/>Distinguished by its brooding cinematography, authentic production values, and documentary flavor, ""Black Mass"" succeeds more as a tour de force showcase for the actors than a landmark example of a gangster movie. A top-tier supporting cast, featuring ""Sherlock"" star Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billy, who carved out a reputation for himself in Congress as a man of the people, surround Depp and Edgerton. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour, and Adam Scott play Connolly's eloquent, well-tailored, FBI colleagues. Harbour delivers a powerful performance as the weak link in the group of FBI agents who turn a blind eye to Bulger's criminal activities as long as he furnishes them with information about the Mafia. As Bulger's amoral associates, Rory Cochrane, Jesse Plemons, and W. Earl Brown will make your skin crawl. Peter Sarsgaard rounds out the cast as one of Bulger's sadistic but ill-fated adversaries. Nobody gives a weak performance in ""Black Mass."" Sadly, for all of his crime-does-not-pay sentiments, Cooper has fashioned a dreary, sluggish crime saga devoid of any cinematic flair or unpredictable spontaneity."
"Ol_MekDonald","1","35","67","20 September 2015"," A superficial, generic, by-the-numbers ""Gangster"" flick--What a joke.
","Black Mass is a waste of your time and money. DO NOT see this. The number of well-known actors used in this film is a damn shame because every single role is such a cardboard cutout that any lesser-known actor wouldn't have made a difference. Depp plays ""Whitey"" Bulger, and to constantly remind the audience that he's a real bad guy, he gives stone-cold, eye piercing looks, he throws in the necessary run of the mill curses, kills a few unremarkable people throughout and that's it. Don't expect any action or colorful, well-written characters. Yes, this is based off a true story, but, in the context of the film, there is no significance; it doesn't matter--it's been done a ton before and it adds absolutely nothing new or refreshing to the genre. Except for a couple of interesting subplots (which are all quickly brushed off and ""resolved"" by a single line of dialogue in a following scene), this film has nothing going for it. And it really is a shame; there are hints of a better film that shine through every once in a while during its seemingly forever-feeling run-time, but, that's not to be had. There's not much more to say because this film really doesn't have much going for it. DON'T go to see this--it really is THAT bad."
"trublu215","6","39","79","10 September 2015"," A hot blooded gangster film about a cold blooded bastard.
","Black Mass tells the story of the infamous alliance between the Boston FBI and the city's bastard son, James ""Whitey"" Bulger. In telling a story that has stained Boston and the FBI for all of eternity and telling with precision, guts and, most of all, honesty, it solidifies Black Mass as one of the best films of the year thus far. Starring an unrecognizable Johnny Depp and a scene stealing Joel Edgerton, the film blasts off on screen, making you want more and more as it play out. Just like in typical gangster fashion, there are long speeches, there is brutal violence and there is not one moment where it ever lets up. While the film itself doesn't break any new ground regarding gangster films, it is still a more than welcomed addition to the lot of them and may even become iconic but it is a bit too early to tell. Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic as Bulger. Depp brings a level of performance to the table that we haven't seen in years. He can be charming, cunning, ruthless and, at times, so cold blooded you question if this man has any humanity. For an actor to be able to pull off this kind of role, it takes a specific mind set and Johnny Depp nails it. Between scenes of him murdering anyone who threatens his empire, we see Bulger, the family man. The man that would kill for nothing being brought to his knees as he is told his son has died. There is humanity in Depp's performance as Bulger, there's just so many layers to peel back in order to get to it. I can't rave about Depp enough. The man is mind blowingly fantastic in this film and no words I can put down can justify the level of perfection he brings to this film. Joel Edgerton plays John Connolly, who ends up stealing the show in many scenes. Edgerton has become a force to be reckoned with and a pool of untapped talent that has finally been able to roar to the surface with August's The Gift (for which he wrote, directed and starred) and now with Black Mass. I sense an Oscar nomination for his work in Black Mass. He is THAT good. To be able to act opposite of Depp's career best performance and hold your own, that is saying something in and of itself. Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons, Julianne Nicholson, Rory Cochrane and everyone else in this cast is pitch perfect. Even Dakota Johnson is good but then again, my expectations for her was that it was going to be hard to take her seriously but she ended up delivering a fantastic performance as Lyndsay Cyr. Scott Cooper has directed some pretty fantastic films, Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace. But Black Mass is his masterpiece thus far. Cooper created a film drenched in the styles of the 70s cinema. It acts a love letter to films like The Godfather, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Mean Streets and even Serpico. Cooper's direction skyrockets what could have easily been a bomb into something very organic and very special. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic in this film, covering Boston never like a character but as a playground for Whitey. It is engrossing and engaging throughout and never overwhelming like Cooper's Out of the Furnace cinematography was. Every component to this film screams for perfection and with a director like Scott Cooper and a cast headed by an Oscar worthy Johnny Depp, the film gets just that...perfection."

For me, biopic as a whole (and in some ways this is the case of this film) are part of a genre that is extremely difficult to make interesting, engaging, or at least curious to the public, that is, it requires a huge racing everyone involved in the production, and also that the story in question has some basis to be adapted to the cinema. Black Mass is not an example of excellence in this type of film, far from it, but can fulfill its role as a whole is good, has an extremely attractive story, and at times his many jumps in time cease all very chopped, but the whole experience is justified by a major factor: Johnny Depp. All actors in the main long core are fine in their roles, which already slightly increases the overall grade, but Depp is really fantastic, leaving those who really watches in fear for all who engage with him, even with some dramas placed within the story somewhat unresolved, all convictions and Jimmy Bulger motivations are extremely convincing in the hands of the great actor. Analyzing only the narrative and structure of the feature film the note would be 6 or even 5 though, as the evaluation can not just focus only on a few factors, but in all, 7 seems but fair, a good movie, which has great asset as the expertise of its actors."

","""Long and boring"" are the first words that come to mind when exiting from this film, which seems strange because a gangster film which is boring is almost a contrast in words. Off-hand I can't think of another gangster film that had less action, suspense, or drama. Apart from the length and direction, the musical score is almost non-existent, which in a film of this nature trying to recapture bygone days, is a cardinal sin.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst feature of the film, though, is the acting, from Johnny Depp's poor imitation of Jack Nicholson to the Irish accents that come and go throughout the film. It's not all bad acting. For me, David Harbour (""End of Watch""), Dakota Johnson (""The Social Network"") and Juno Temple (""Magic, Magic"") stood out.<br/><br/>This is a film you can surely miss."

They worked hard to make him Ray Liotta on every level except he's dull and monotone where ray does that stand up and applaud rage face Depp is incapable of. He's just not enjoyable to watch. He looks a bit like Whitey Bulger but it's really incidental and a waste of effort. Hell if anything he looks more like Dracula than Whitey Bulger who was actually a fairly attractive guy. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is a weird borefest. None of the scenes connect. Stuff just happens then they move to days or weeks or years later with no transition. Nothing in any point ties to later scenes either directly or metaphorically. Characters come and go aimlessly. <br/><br/>It's a real shame, other than Joel Edgerton who's wasted on this poorly written bad cop the rest of the cast is quite good. Roy Cochrane played his partner Steve Flemmi and he was great. <br/><br/>I don't think anyone's gonna read these reviews and pass on this, but I'd say at least don't waste money on this one. Just go watch good fellas, it really is just ripping off it pretty bad. I'm gonna go watch the Whitey Bulger documentary, I suspect it be more entertaining and enlightening. You also leave this film feeling like you didn't learn much about Bulgar. <br/><br/>I think the critics are giving this movie too many breaks because they were wowed by Depps Ray Liotta impression. I was not."

The acting is fine, but this movie falls flat on keeping the audience engaged and interested. We spent the whole movie looking at each other and hoping it would end. Definitely don't recommend seeing this. Love Johnny Depp like most of you, but take my advice and watch this when you don't run the risk of waisting $15 and two hours of your time.<br/><br/>The movie spans 30 years of crime under Whitey Bulger and jumps from hit to hit and scene to scene leaving the viewer questioning why it matters to continue to watch the movie. The primary point of drama is whether is Bulger's relationship with his friend Cooper will unravel and leave them both out to dry; but the viewer quickly loses interests when it becomes evident that the move has nothing special to it.

","Maybe this is my fault and I missed the point of the film, but it simply doesn't allow you to get to know Bulger at all. Its simply a string of scenes of Bulger doing bad things with little connecting, little explanation and nothing in terms of who he really is. How did he become who he is, whats his motivation? None of this is answered in the film. I think it was simply too big of a story to tell in 2 hours so they cut out any background or emotional story lines and simply left the more ""exciting"" murders and crimes. <br/><br/>The acting was average. Nothing stood out as being exceptional or cringy, though the characters seemed one dimensional.

Told in flashback form, the film charts Bulger's career and his relationship with his brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) who (amazing but true!) was the State Senator for Massachusetts.<br/><br/>Depp is a chameleon-like actor. Unlike someone like Tom Hanks (who is always 'Tom Hanks'), Depp transforms himself physically to inhabit his roles: Jack Sparrow; Willy Wonka; The Mad Hatter; Edward Scissorhands ‚Äì it is sometimes difficult to equate the roles to the same actor. In ""Black Mass"" he does it again, being almost unrecognisable in the role. But he delivers in the acting stakes and turns in a chilling performance as the psychopathic mob leader. <br/><br/>In supporting roles are Jesse Plemons (""The Program"") and W. Earl Brown (""There's Something About Mary"") as his right (and left) arm men and the talented Dakota Johnson as the concerned mother to his son.<br/><br/>Although it's good as a simple gangster film, the film is a little two-dimensional to be great.The treatment of the relationship between the brothers ‚Äì surely one of the most dramatic and surprising parts of the story ‚Äì is perfunctory, with Cumberbatch (sporting a good Bostonian accent) having relatively few minutes on the screen.<br/><br/>It's also almost impossible to form any emotional connection with Depp's character. Most screen villains have at least some sense of dark and shade (see Tom Hardy's recent portrayal of Reggie Kray in ""Legend""). In contrast, Depp's Bulger is as uniformly dark as the title suggests.<br/><br/>Directed by Scott Cooper it's a workmanlike film, with many inevitably violent scenes.

","First of all, I had NEVER heard of this movie. It's just by chance that I got to know about it when I had ordered a DVD of the crime-action flick THE DEPARTED and instead got a box set containing both the movies. I had really enjoyed THE DEPARTED and thus I had no choice but to watch BLACK MASS since I had got it along with it. I had spent my money, I had to deal with it.<br/><br/>Now comes another curious case. I took me three attempts to finish this movie. At first, I watched the first 27 minutes and turned it off. Weeks later, which was yesterday, I decided to give it a watch. I watched till the 43rd minute and then again turned it off. After a few hours, I became determined to finish this movie at once. It turned out to be fine since the second half did improve a bit. BLACK MASS didn't really get me involved until an hour was already gone. There were good moments in the first half as well, but they were just very, very few. <br/><br/>Thankfully, Johnny Depp's performance is great as James 'Whitey' Bulger. He has sunken his teeth into the character and has come up with a strong performance. The film had got my attention right when I found out it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it. He has done a great job, but unfortunately, his character doesn't get much scope and that's true. Joel Edgerton is decent.<br/><br/>What works in favor of BLACK MASS is Depp's fine performance, some brief yet decent action bits, a few dramatic moments and the ending score. <br/><br/>What doesn't work in its favor is the unfocused screenplay, poor editing, underdeveloped characters (which is a surprise since this is a crime drama which devotes almost every bit of it to nothing but its characters) and a patience-testing first half.<br/><br/>BLACK MASS isn't in totality a bad movie, but it's just not the kind I'll prefer watching anymore. Except for a few moments, there are no thrills or exciting moments which made THE DEPARTED engaging. BLACK MASS is everything but not engaging. The film's only high moment is only during the climax even though the things feel wrapped up a bit shoddily but still nicely. It did make me keep checking how much time had elapsed, whenever I found the scenes longer or boring.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's due to my seeing the film in parts that I'm not completely exhausted. BLACK MASS is a very standard gangster film meant strictly for the fans of crime dramas as well as Johnny Depp. Rest others, see for yourself. As for me... the DVD is just going to be... there in the collection, although I doubt I'd ever want to see it again."

His portrayal of notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger is brilliant, and is the sole reason that 'Black Mass' is worth watching.<br/><br/>Depp aside, this film doesn't have much going for it. As someone who watches a lot of crime/dramas, there's nothing about the storyline or script of 'Black Mass' that makes it stand out.

Depp was controlled, measured and sweeping against all odds. But the main sad thing was,it was not more than an alliance between two southies in boston, it delivers a vile piece of criminal story with gloomy performances from the solid-rock actors.

However what useful information Jimmy actually gives the FBI as an informant isn't entirely clear except one scene where John Connelly (Jimmy's FBI confident played by Joel Egerton) turns up to the office with a load of snaps of Jimmy's rival gangster clan hanging out. The film looks great but the audience never really get to know any of the characters. Towards the latter stages of the film Joel Egerton acts every scene as if he's on his fifth shot of whiskey which is mainly caused by the introduction of an FBI investigator keen to pursue Jimmy's criminal activities.

Which it is of course, but its just slightly more interesting.<br/><br/>Depp's performance is good because it is unusual for his career. In my opinion Blow was both a better film and better acted, but here Depp plays to his age, which is new, and he does it very well. <br/><br/>Depp's character, James Bulger, was a homicidal psychopath who once stole a poor mans winning lottery ticket so he could add a few extra million dollars to his million dollars. Quite why we should have a film that glamorises that I don't know, but I digress. The point is that Depps performance is so charismatic that we find ourselves rooting for this scumbag until the very end.<br/><br/>Depp's acting aside there are some good moments, but those moments are spread thinly between gangster caricatures and, to be honest, an obvious plot. Its well written, adequately directed and generally strong in most areas but it lacks that special something that would make it deserve to be remembered."

The film failed to engage my interest (that doesn't mean it wont engage someone else's)I had seen Legend recently which was a far better production and Tom Hardy superb; so films with a Gangster theme appear to be prominent this year. This film also based on a true story was far grittier and didn't glamorise the actions of those that the film portrays - Johnny Depp is almost unrecognisable as Whitey Bulger which the film is essentially about. This could have been a brilliant film instead it is a collaboration of scenes mismatched together threaded together to make some sense which it fails to do as you don't connect to the characters in it; becoming ordinary and pedestrian instead of gripping your attention as say characters in the Departed which has been often referred to in reviews. I agree with a previous reviewer that had more emphasis been put on the development of the characters from childhood Whitey Bulger, John Connoly and Billy Bulger (brother and senator) and how this then transformed into later life this would have been a really good film as it is, it is worth watching but don't break a leg to do so. It also fails in the final 30 minutes as it doesn't show us how we get to the bringing the gang down - it simply just happens! there is no tension or how it all unravels.

Black Mass, like many such films, feels rough around the edges like it just doesn't have the time to tell the entire story so it just bites off pieces here and there making the finished work look like Cliff's Notes of a much larger story.<br/><br/>I didn't feel satisfied with what I got in the end. The movie doesn't focus on any one character or at least paint a portrait of the criminal world. To tell the truth I felt rather disappointed after the movie ended because I expected so much more from this film. I do believe it had the potential for greatness."

","Even without taking into account the misleading advertising, this is still a complete disaster of a film. The writing is sloppy at best, the editing is downright horrific, the score is so bland that it seems to be dead set on ruining any chance that any scene has of showing any quality, and even the acting is frequently cringe-worthy. This is a film so overtly disorganized and lacking of vision that by watching it you get the feeling that it actually wants you to give up and watch something else.<br/><br/>The main attraction is Depp's performance, but for the entire second half of the film, he takes a screen time backseat to appease the very poorly cast Joel Edgerton, who despite being a fine actor in his own right, could not possibly do any good with a character that the audience could have witnessed in a small role in a single scene, and know just as much about as they do by the end of the movie. In fact, the same could be said for nearly every character. I learned nothing about Whitey Bulger that I didn't gather from the trailer for this movie.<br/><br/>Characters and plot lines come and go with no indication of significance because the film's main thematic focus appears to be the idea of using a bad guy to get other bad guys, and the ethical dilemmas that might surround such an agreement. The way it decides to convey this theme would be by having a scene where Joel Edgerton says that he needs Johnny Depp, and then one or more of his colleagues (or wife) either silently or loudly question his enthusiasm for the informant while new information is received to further enforce the illusion that there is anything here to actually invest in. Now repeat that scene about twenty or thirty times and you have the bulk of the movie, then throw some violent scenes in between with little to no context or reason to care and you have the rest, that is the rest that you will still be able to vaguely remember less than thirty minutes after finishing it.<br/><br/>But a script never makes or breaks a film; that responsibility lies in the editing. And my god, does this film have really, really bad editing. There is never any sense that the movie has an idea of what is going through the audience's head as they traverse through scene after scene of insultingly forced use of music (which is cookie-cutter enough already without taking center stage) and dreadful cutting. Things don't get prettier when looking at the pacing of the film from a broader perspective...it should not be clear WITHOUT researching a film that it can't decide who the protagonist should be (or if there should be one at all) or how much focus should be given to ANY character or ANY event. I'm not sure what went wrong because there's a lot of talent involved in this in both the cast and crew, but the final product here is a dull mess of a motion picture whose only redeeming qualities (a few entertaining moments and standout performances from Depp and Sarsgaard) are so outweighed by its flaws that it's really not even worth a glance."

"CleveMan66","2","16","32","19 September 2015"," ""Black Mass"" is massively disappointing.
","It's a story that was begging to be filmed. James ""Whitey"" Bulger gains control of organized crime in South Boston and, with the help of corrupt law enforcement officials, expands his criminal empire to include the whole city. He gets rich through racketeering, extortion and drug trafficking and enforces his will through violence. Meanwhile, his younger brother is a rising star in Massachusetts politics and becomes President of the State Senate. When Whitey learns that law enforcement is closing in on him, he disappears. Bulger rises to number two on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list (behind only Osama Bin Laden) but remains a fugitive for 16 years until he's arrested. Yes, It's a story tailor-made for Hollywood. Unfortunately, the Hollywood treatment is exactly what Bulger's story gets in ""Black Mass"" (R, 2:02).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp stars as Whitey Bulger and the film focuses on the middle portion of his life, his rise and fall as a Boston crime boss. In the mid-1970s, Bulger was on the rise but his criminal activities were confined to the South Boston neighborhood where he grew up. When his childhood friend, FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), suggests an alliance that can help both of their careers, Bulger agrees. Whitey will supply information about his rivals in the Italian mafia, while the FBI uses that information to bring down the Italians, but ignores Bulger. That arrangement does benefit both parties. The local FBI cripples the Patriarca crime family and Connolly gets promoted. Bulger becomes the undisputed crime lord of Boston and ignores the FBI's demands that he refrain from committing serious crimes. As Bulger's criminal activities increase, the FBI realizes they're in too deep with Whitey to even try stopping him.<br/><br/>There are many problems with this movie, starting with the casting. In a film whose main characters are male, the female cast members do most of the best work. Dakota Johnson (as Whitey's long-time girlfriend) and Julianne Nicholson (as John Connolly's wife) give especially strong performances. Among the males, Edgerton, and Corey Stoll (as Connolly's supervisor) do their usual exceptional work, while the actors playing Bulger's cohorts (Rory Cochrane, W. Earl Brown, Jesse Plemons and Peter Sarsgaard) are no more than serviceable, and consistently outstanding actors like Kevin Bacon (as the director of the FBI's Boston filed office), Adam Scott (as an FBI agent) and Benedict Cumberbatch (as Whitey's politician brother) are simply miscast. The same can be said for Johnny Depp. He gives a convincing performance, but the make-up used on him is distracting and it feels like a lot of time and effort went into making Depp look, sound and act like Ray Liotta in ""Goodfellas""¬Ö ¬Öand that's not the only distracting part of this movie ‚Äì or the only connection with ""Goodfellas"". As in that 1990 classic, gangsters are depicted as respected in their neighborhoods/families and there are scenes in which people are talked to very calmly right before they're killed (including one such scene in an otherwise empty room) and there's even a scene in which a dangerous criminal frightens someone by threatening him as a joke, a la Joe Pesci's character in Martin Scorsese's film. The original aspects of this film's characterization of gangsters aren't very compelling either. The opening scene, designed to show Whitey's menacing personality, has him complaining about one of his friends licking his fingers and putting them back in a bowl of bar nuts. Seriously? Is this a gangster movie or an episode of ""Seinfeld""? Worst of all is the script's liberal use of dramatic license. Several of the movie's characters, plot points, and major facts are different from what happened and how it happened, while other important details are left out. It's unnecessary and counterproductive to change so much of a true story that so many people know so well. It also would have been nice if the script related the movie's title to the story in some way, shape or form. This movie is based on a fascinating and many-faceted true story and, overall, the film tells a fairly interesting tale, but the devil is in the details and this version of the story of the FBI's deal with Boston's devil is disappointing.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Movie goers tend to fall into one of two groups when it comes to Johnny Depp ‚Äì big fans or denigrators. Whichever side of the line you fall, there are few actors who can claim such a diverse career of on screen characters ranging from Edward Scissorhands to Gilbert Grape; from Donnie Brasco to Captain Jack Sparrow; from Willy Wonka to Sweeney Todd; and from John Dillinger to Tonto. Depp now turns his talents towards one of the most unsympathetic real life characters imaginable ¬Ö South Boston's infamous crime lord James ""Whitey"" Bulger.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) proves yet again that he is an actor's director, rather than a visual technician or story addict. In this adaptation of the book from ""Boston Globe"" reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, Cooper has Depp and Joel Edgerton as his two leads, and an incredibly deep supporting cast that provide the look and feel for this period piece dramatizing the crime and corruption during Bulger's reign.<br/><br/>When one thinks of the memorable kingpins of crime/gangster movies, those that come to mind include Michael Corleone (The Godfather movies), Tony Montana (Scarface), Jimmy Conway (Goodfellas), and Frank Costello (The Departed). The Costello character was supposedly partially inspired by Bulger. What made each of these characters fascinating to watch was the insight we were given into the psychological make-up of each and the inner-workings of their organization. And that's the disappointment of Cooper's film.<br/><br/>For the Whitey Bulger story, there are two distinct directions to explore: the building of Bulger's criminal empire, or the motivation of the FBI Agent John Connolly (Edgerton) as he juggled his job and relationship with Bulger. Unfortunately, the approach here is to show a hand full of cold-blooded murders to prove Bulger's management style, and a few FBI meetings that show the obvious uncertainty within the agency. Rather than a muddled mash-up, a more interesting movie would have chosen a path and dug in deeply.<br/><br/>Despite the story issues, it is fun to watch how Depp and Edgerton tackle their roles. Under heavy make-up (wrinkles, receding hairline, hillbilly teeth, and crazy contact lenses), Depp becomes the intimidating force of Whitey Bulger. Just as impressive is Edgerton as Agent Connolly, as we witness the Southie neighborhood boys all grown up, but still playing cops and robbers ¬Ö and it remains difficult to tell who the good guys from the bad. Edgerton's cockiness and strutting capture the ego and ambition necessary for a federal agent to bend so many rules. In fact, despite the vastly different approaches, it's not entirely clear which of these two fellows possesses the greatest ambition.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother who became a State Senator. We get very few scenes featuring the brothers, and in fact, Cumberbath's best scenes are instead shared with Edgerton. It's difficult not to chuckle at their first meeting in a restaurant as we watch a Brit and Aussie talk it out with south Boston accents. Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott play Edgerton's fellow FBI agents, while Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane (especially good) and W Earl Brown make terrific Bulger crew members. Peter Sarsgaard leaves quite the impression as a doped-up associate, while Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple provide the film's minimal female presence. Corey Stoll storms onto the screen as a Federal Prosecutor who is not amused by the relationship between Connolly and Bulger, but this movie belongs to Depp and Edgerton.<br/><br/>The concern is that any viewer not already familiar with the Whitey Bulger story may find the story not overly interesting, despite the terrific performances. Fortunately, this viewer was mesmerized by last year's exceptional documentary entitled Whitey: United States of America v James J Bulger ¬Ö a must see for anyone who wants full details into the Bulger reign of crime and terror, as well as his 20 years on the lam."

"rgkarim","8","15","30","19 September 2015"," Depp Leads the Mob Acting, but Depressing and Dull at Points
","Icy Blue eyes stare at you, their cold, blue gaze promising fear and death with every blink. Who or what do these eyes belong too? None other than the notorious criminal Jimmy Whitey Bulger, one of the most notorious crime lords in history. Okay¬Ö so maybe it was Johnny Depp playing the mob legend, but regardless of the source, those eyes sum up the tone of the movie Black Mass. This film kind of snuck under the radar for most, but I'm here to help shed some light on what it beholds. Returning after a three-week hiatus, it's Robbie K with another movie review. <br/><br/>As the title suggests, Black Mass is a tale that is perhaps one of the darkest movies I've seen in a long time. The visual portrayal of Bulger's rise to power is one without filters, where violence, threats, and death rain in high definition splendor. Unlike older mob movies that resulted to gunfights and quick, clean kills, Black Mass gets its hands dirty with detailed torture and gore painting the silver screen a sickly red. Those with weak constitutions will need to avoid this picture, especially during the instances where Whitey results to other means to deal with the ""rats"" of Boston. I give props to Scott Cooper and his team for unfolding a portion of the mafia world, but like so many took it a little too far than was necessary. How many random characters being shot in the head does one really need to see to get the message? <br/><br/>The major component that I felt was the greatest aspect of this movie was the acting. Once more Johnny Depp has impressed me with his talent, temporarily chucking the whimsical and wacky for the dark and dismal. Depp brings a level of unease and terror I never thought possible in both looks (great makeup) and delivery of his lines. Like many of my fellow reviewers have stated, this could indeed be an Oscar worthy role for Depp and while he was the main pillar of this movie there were other supporting actors who need a little praise. Joel Edgerton as the corrupt CIA officer packs a pretty mean punch, oozing with festering greed, as he feigns ignorance for Whitey's services, while trying to cover his hide. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the role of a politician to the T, with the confidence, arrogance, and cheesy grin to sell the crowd. The movie could have been even better if Cumberbatch could have been more integrated in the film, but he made the most of his time. And of course Kevin Bacon uses his familiar tactics , which although not impressive, did help tie the story together. <br/><br/>Now what about the story? Whitey's tale is very detailed, showing the life changing events that shaped him into the threat he became. Even more detailed is the corrupt deals Whitey makes, and the drama that unfolds with each shot. However, despite all the attention to detail, the tale isn't all that exciting. Black Mass felt more like an upscale documentary, devoid of any movie magic or exciting choreographed scenes. The pace of the movie is slow; at times feeling like it's going nowhere, primarily due to a lack of suspense. Maybe if there had been a rival in his history, or at least some glimmer of hope it could have had a little more thrill to it. The details also make things a bit convoluted as well and hard to follow until they literally state the purpose a few minutes later. What does this boil down to? A need for editing, to not only assist with the clarity, but also keep the depression to an absolute minimum. However, if you are one for the facts and wish to avoid the fluff that Hollywood thrives on, this movie's dynamics will more than entertain you.<br/><br/>Black Mass certainly has some of the best mobster betrayal seen for some time, capturing the ruthless nature of the Boston underbelly. However, if you can't stomach intense violence, and you are looking for some more exciting twists to a film you need to pick another option. This film has a lot of quality to it, but overall it wasn't the most entertaining or impressive film to grace the silver screen. Being a biography, this movie probably would have been better suited for a TV special on the History channel. My suggestion is to wait for this one to come to Redbox to watch in the comfort of your own home, unless of course you are an avid mob movie fan, or Depp enthusiast. <br/><br/>My scores are: Biography/Crime/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5"

"reviewsbycaleb","5","8","14","20 September 2015"," If nobody saw it, would Black Mass still be another Depp disappointment?
","""If nobody sees it, it didn't happen"" - Whitey Bulger In the words of Whitey's devilish advise, I wish, for me, that Black Mass didn't happen. It's not that Black Mass is a bad movie, but it was just so dang boring. One of the year's best casts, stories, and overall opportunities for greatness is wasted with this dull, and minimalist gangster bore.<br/><br/>Black Mass, essentially is a canvas for Johnny Depp to re-thrive his recently deadbeat career. Depp, as one of the most infamous gangsters of all time, does not disappoint. The control and maturity of the performance is applaud worthy, and maybe award baiting during next year's Academy Awards. Along side him Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast gives terrific performances. Director Scott Cooper also gives a dark tone and effective camera work that is noteworthy. The screenwriters also give a moderately air tight story that I wouldn't call a weakness, despite the at times over dedicated dialogue. So what went wrong with Black Mass? Let us first get to some plot first.<br/><br/>Whitey Bulger's rise from small time gangster to FBI's most wanted man is a well known fact, but not a well known story. How he got there is the primary purpose of Black Mass, I think. When FBI agent John Connolly (Edgerton) moves back into his hometown, he reacquaints himself with a childhood friend who was ""very good to him"" growing up, Whitey. The problem here is that this is not a simple childhood reunion, due to Bulger being a motivated, psychopathic gangster, and Connolly being a morally corrupt FBI agent. Together Bulgar and Connolly get rid of each others competition and ""rats"" in order to rise up their respective ladders to a not so respectful end. Black Mass does not focus on the business side of Winter Hill Gang's operation, but instead almost solely on dealing with the FBI, competition, and Bulgar's own paranoia. Him and his goons kill quite a few people in this movie, and you can see most of the executions coming from far away. There is one stand out scene, taking place in a parking lot, that was the only excitement or suspense in this entire movie. Everything was predictable. Everything was boring. The story format was intriguing, especially at the beginning, with Bulger's colleagues informing against him, then flashing back to the crimes being explained. A really interesting development was the refrain from making Depp's Bulgar, ""cool"". One of his guys who was informing the FBI against him explained Bulger as ""just a criminal"". Cooper and the writers make sure to not commit the all too common mistake of having people leave the theater praising a serial killing gangster.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? The lack of cohesiveness of all the minimalist parts drowning the movie of all excitement or intrigue. Over control and nuance kills this movie. Black Mass did not compel me or bring me into this world of South Boston in the 70s and 80s. I knew I was watching a movie the whole time. While being well made and acted, Black Mass completely fails at being even remotely entertaining or immersive."

","I was very interested in watching this film as a true-crime buff. We all understand that there will be a certain amount of theatrical license taken whenever dealing with such subject matter. I didn't expect it to be too far off base from reality since the Whitey Bulger fiasco has been highly publicized. Johnny Depp was a little odd choice in my opinion by his been known to pull bigger rabbits on the hat (even literally). Good to have Johnny Depp reminders every once in while he's a legitimate actor not just trying to fund additional island property.<br/><br/>The problem in films of this nature tend to be how familiar the general public is with the issues and our opinions of what we believe reality to be. We hold film a little too stringently against reality or at least what the media has presented as reality to most of us. I would like to think that enough due diligence has gone into whatever form of dramaturgy has happened by responsible parties to present a relatively balanced film. But in general we want the grit and grime without regard for legalities or implications.<br/><br/>True, the film focuses on alliances and the levity provided that we have always suspected. And we have seen a ton of films in this genre with such focus and we have fabricated our own concepts of how such organizations work, how such unholy alliances are formed, and therefore have an expectation of what we should see. This past history in turn doesn't really provide a fair shake for any film in the current time frame as we have so much the compare it to.<br/><br/>I believe that the real demystification of this spell (not to say the cast wasn't good or to question the deftness of Depp) is that we seem to have seen this story a lot. We know how it ends, we realize there's very little arc and we'd like to see a twist to the hat trick that we haven't seen before... If it sticks to the reality of the situation, it's simply not gonna happen.<br/><br/>Does it deliver? Yes. Is it a Tarantino yarn? Not remotely. Will you be entertained, to a greater extent? Yes.<br/><br/>I think this year DiCaprio may have Depp on this one."
"estebangonzalez10","6","5","8","29 September 2015"," Depp finally playing a serious role without going over the top
","""If nobody sees it, it didn't happen.""<br/><br/>Black Mass is Scott Cooper's follow up to his dark thriller, Out of the Furnace. This gangster film centers on the true story of one of Boston's most wanted criminals, Whitey Bulger, an Irish mobster who served as an informant for the FBI against the Italian Mafia for many years, during which time he used the special treatment to get away with committing several gruesome crimes of his own and rise to the top. The film is extremely slow paced and it focuses on the small details of Whitey's crime life, but it is also a breath of fresh air for its realistic portrayal of the gritty criminal life without sensationalizing these gangsters. The violence is real and gruesome and not something worth celebrating here. It does however prove why audiences love the more fast paced fictitious portrayal of these criminal, because it can become a dull exercise at times to portray these characters as real people. The greatest strength of Black Mass is without a doubt Johnny Depp's portrayal of Whitey because it was exciting to finally see him play a straight role once again. He's menacing without going over the top. The prosthetics were a bit distracting, but it was worth it to get to see Depp playing this older man. Black Mass tries too hard to remain authentic to the real life events and by doing so it becomes a dull procedural at times, but Depp's performance makes it worth recommending. <br/><br/>The film centers on Whitey's relationship with a Boston FBI agent named John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) who struck a deal with him during the course of several years. Whitey was asked to snitch on the Italian mafia which would lead to more arrests for Connolly while Whitey was allowed to get away with his criminal undertakings. It was a win-win situation for both of them. The story then closely follows how Whitey went about doing his business with his entrusted men, Kevin (Jesse Plemons) and Steve (Rory Cochrane), performing gruesome executions while the police looked the other way. Meanwhile, Whitey's brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) was rising to the top of the Massachusetts Senate, but he doesn't play a major role in the story. Other characters who are simply introduced but not given much to do are Whitey's partner: Lindsey (Dakota Johnson), Connolly's right hand man in the agency: John Morris (David Harbour), and Connolly's wife: Marianne (Julianne Nicholson). The film uses these characters to explore some of the family dynamics and when it does it works to its advantage, but the film feels like it is missing some cohesiveness between each separate individual. Take for instance a scene where Whitey is sharing a meal with Lindsey and their son while he is explaining to him how to get away with hitting a boy in school who is bullying him. The scene works perfectly to give us a sense of how Whitey thinks and acts, but it doesn't do anything for the film narratively and it feels like a separate scene all together. There are several moments like this that seem to be presented only as facts, but these facts don't add up to much and it drags out the premise making us lose interest in the story. <br/><br/>There are some great scenes where Depp is allowed to shine, but other than that the film does miss a lot of its targets. The talented cast is mostly wasted with Benedict Cumberbatch, Juno Temple, and Kevin Bacon given very little to do. Depp and Edgerton stand out since the primary focus of the film is on their relationship, but the side plots don't work. While the film tries to focus on other characters it never feels connected to the main relationship that is so central to the story. Johnny Depp might garner some attention for his performance, but the film will quickly be forgotten come award time. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Considering how Depp has already portrayed the role of John Dillinger in Public Enemies, my expectations for this movie were soaring high and I was sure that Depp would do wonders with this role. But surprisingly enough, he didn't do wonders but instead he did something unimaginable, something so exceptional that it very well may be regarded as his finest performance till date.<br/><br/>The story chronicles around the life of James ""Whitey"" Bulger. When his control over his... turf is challenged by the northern Angiulo Brothers (mafia family), he has no choice but to become an informant for the FBI... correction as Jimmy says.. strike a business deal with them. What follows is a series of events that depict the rise of a small time gangster into becoming one of the most infamous violent criminals in the history of South Boston.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper takes you on a journey which is downright brutal and chilling. There is not a single moment in the movie where you'll want to take your eyes off the screen. He manages to get you hooked from the very beginning and before you realise you're completely involved in the lives of all the characters. I mean that's the mark of a brilliant director, isn't it? To be able to have such an impact on his audiences that they would talk about the movie even after they've left the theater.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp with his icy blue eyes will definitely give you chills and creeps. His predator like gaze will stare right through the screen and pierce your body to give you the shivers you've never felt before. The unpredictability of his character will bring about many uncomfortable scenes for the audiences.<br/><br/>Trust me when I say this the only time I've been terrified of him is when he starred in Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd. He has managed to shut the mouth of every critic that said his career was going downhill. His transformation into Jimmy is so real that it almost makes it difficult to recognise him.<br/><br/>Well to praise only Depp would not be right because the movie would not fair well without its supporting cast. From Jimmy's right-hand man Stephen Flemmi (exceptionally well portrayed by Rory Cochrane) to the newcomer Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) and the cold and calculative hit-man, Johnny Martorano (W. Earl Brown). Also, John Connolly, played by none other than Joel Edgerton, who's back in his neighborhood to bring down the Angiulo Brothers by any means possible.<br/><br/>And not to forget Billy Bulger (Benedict) as the powerful state senator. Although given only a little screen space, he still manages to leave an impact (like always.. hater's gona hate).<br/><br/>People say you'll regret the things you didn't do more than the ones you did. So not getting your asses of the couch and watching this movie will definitely be the one thing that you'll regret. Trust me on that. To conclude, Depp deserves nothing short of an Oscar for his ""Strictly Criminal"" performance. I hope you enjoy it."

Unfortunately, it completely failed to live up to my expectations, leading to a very poor night.<br/><br/>As most reviewers will tell you, the acting is done well in this movie. Depp especially does a fantastic job. However, his character (Whitey Bulger) was never fleshed out, the only backstory given through the FBI agent (Connolly) who he informs to, who was a childhood friend of his. In fact, the plot was executed so poorly that you never truly care for Whitey and have no idea what his story actually is, or his motivation. This is exemplified perfectly in one early scene.<br/><br/>Whitey is introduced in a scene which takes place in a bar, in which he sits silently at a table with a group of mob members. These members are having a conversation meant to set up a bit of plot regarding the current mob politics. The characters who speak, however, can barely be heard over the bar noise. They aren't even shown on camera, because visually the scene focuses only on Depp watching another character eat out of a peanut bowl after licking his fingers. After the conversation ends, Depp calls out the character for doing this, and threatens him. Right from the beginning, the plot took a backseat and the movie served only to show that Whitey is a really bad guy.<br/><br/>This movie completely failed to deliver on plot, with no connections from one scene to the next and no excitement. There was not even a climax. Towards the end, Depp suddenly gives guns to the IRA and gets caught in the next scene. That's it. The movie ends minutes later. The lack of emotion and plot, with the only focus being on Whitey Bulger's bad side, holds this movie back from offering anything compelling. It was just bad."

It tries to copy the great gangster flicks of our time but just ends up being mediocre.<br/><br/>When we are introduced to the CIA agent things got a little bit more interesting, but then the film tends to speed past anything interesting as if it's not of any importance and tries to focus on intimate moments between the main characters, it might of worked if the script wasn't so boring."

","I was really looking forward to this movie but at the end it was a bit underwhelming. Good acting from Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton. Depp in particular is menacing as Bulger. He will probably get nominated for an Oscar and so will the makeup artist. <br/><br/>Some characters were wasted such as Benedict Cumberbatch as whiteys brother and Corey Stroll as whyshak. But I guess they couldn't fit them all in the movie.<br/><br/>Some unnecessary scenes like the dinner scene with David Harbor which i suspect they were trying to make like the ""what do you mean funny"", scene from Goodfellas.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the scene at the start with Bulger explaining to his son how to get away with crime<br/><br/>so like I said good but not great."
"Benkenobi510","6","3","4","19 October 2015"," Black Mass
","There's no doubt that Johnny Depp's career has had several ups and downs. For every 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Ed Wood', there's a 'The Tourist' or 'Mortdecai. 'Black Mass' falls somewhere between the two, Depp is fantastic but the film itself, drags.<br/><br/>Depp plays Whitey Bulger, a Boston gangster with a psychotic edge, who aligns himself with childhood friend and FBI agent, John Connolly, played by Joel Edgerton. It's almost a clich√© to say that a performance is 'trans-formative' but it does apply to Depp in this film. Much like Steve Carrell in 'Foxcatcher', you look past the make up and see a truly nuanced performance that is surprisingly subtle at times, if not ludicrously OTT as well. Joel Edgerton's performance is likely to not get as much awards attention as Depp's, but he deserves to. One scene in particular which show's his range is where he has to bluff his way through a conversation with his boss about the FBI's involvement with Bulger. His demeanor goes from showboating jerk to sniveling loser in seconds. A man whose power only extends to a certain degree and no more. <br/><br/>The dark atmosphere and weather of South Boston gives the film a grey-ish tint to it. This reflects the dark subject matter as well as the spiraling mood of Bulger and the people he is connected to. However, it also gives the film a very boring 'look'. The cinematography is not particularly engaging nor beautiful either. <br/><br/>All of the criticisms are mostly nitpicks because the biggest issue with the film is that it is all too familiar. Shades of The Sopranos here (Family and home life juxtaposed with violence etc.), hints of Goodfellas there (Links with the FBI, ""How am I funny"") which gives the vibe of a boring college gangster slideshow and/or quiz of 'Guess the gangster film!'. For a casual viewer, it could be effective. But sometimes, it's a little too lazy on standard gangster film traits. <br/><br/>What elevates a crime film from ordinary to brilliant, is the layers and subtext attached to it. The Godfather is great because it juggles a man's blood thirsty ambitions with his family life. Heat is great because it examines the relationship between the cop and criminal. Black Mass features Johnny Depp kicking someone's head in, and that's about it. But boy does he do some good kicking!"

","I'm Irish and I live in a Boston suburb. Here is what I would have done to make a better movie. Start the film in the projects when Connolly and the Bulgers were young. Show the environment they were raised in.The cops. the Catholic Church. All were relevant in their upbringing. How being a ""rat"" was considered more serious than being a murderer. How loyalty was considered the most worthy quality. Tell us something about the growth of Howie Winter and the Winter Hill Gang and how Bulger grew within that gang . Describe the relationship between the Irish gangsters of Southie and the Mafia in the North End. Take the first 30 minutes of the movie as background and then tell the Connolly- Bulger story. I didn't like the way that the Connolly angle shared equal screen with the Whitey angle. As for the Whitey Bulger portrayal, forget the drivel of the tragedies of his son and mother's deaths. The guy was a bad guy. The viewer doesn't need to be reminded that even bad guys have a heart once in a while. I never got the feeling that the whole film was nothing more than the story of a local hood.A little know gangster outside of South Boston. As for the Angiulo family, pure hogwash . My friends and i used to go over the the North End for pizza after a Bruins game and we knew where Angiulo lived so how could the FBI not know. The actors' make up was horrible. Boston accents were pretty good and Depp was good . An o.k. movie but could have been so much better"

","By now we've seen this format often enough with its well-rehearsed drills: men in suits and big ties: large hair on everyone; a soundtrack of known and more obscure period hits; moody settings in bars, wasteland, and a shabby district of town; a protagonist that is attractive in a psychopathic sense, a supporting cast of solid actors embellish the entire piece; a script with a couple of strong scenes and a memorable line and bada bing - it's a quality piece of work.<br/><br/>There's little wrong with this movie: some people may quibble about Depp (who seems to have channeled a bit of Nicholson from The Departed as he filched Keith Richards for the pirate series), but really, it's not worth the struggle. We've seen it, or a variation of it a few times and it does nothing new. So it grinds on to it's inevitable conclusion and then we forget about it.<br/><br/>If there is tedium it's in the script which skates over the material in the standard ways, although it offers a central focus over loyalty, but somehow this too has been over done, overplayed too often as well.<br/><br/>It's not bad, it's not great; its just another product off the line."
"teddyryan","5","3","4","5 October 2015"," Johnny The Wolf
","It has been the Fall of disappointing movies. BLACK MASS stands at the top of this list. Take one look at Johnny Depp as Whitey Bulger and you'll think his make-up artist had Tim Burton on a direct line. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I understand how BLACK MASS fell into the trap of becoming yet another poorly failed Goodfellas/Donnie Brasco. The life of one of the most infamous crime bosses is hard to discern - what is even harder to discern is the world that surrounds him. <br/><br/>It's not truth versus fable. It's how do we explain the damn thing? <br/><br/>From his heinous acts of legendary proportion, the real Whitey is known as one of the most ruthless/inhumane people to ever walk this planet. He was on the 10 most wanted list for the entire world before being captured by the FBI. There's some nasty buggers on there - so we get the drift. <br/><br/>However, for most movies/TV shows to work, the audience has to have an affinity for the main character - it's the element that made The Sopranos such a smashing success. Do we even have the right to give Whitey Bulger the privilege? <br/><br/>Yes - purely on dynamics, of course. His heart is black (no spoiler here, folks). Lets see how it beats - not just look at a dude dressed up like the Joker with a leather jacket. <br/><br/>In my opinion, there are alternatives to create a more compelling story - but I didn't write the film or will claim to be able to pull it off myself. Although I might have had some objections with making Johnny Depp look like the Wolfman.<br/><br/>Give me a strong story runner from TV and we might have some gasoline. David Milch, want to hop in the batter's box? We'll surely give you a bat. <br/><br/>SPOILER* We're not asking for a documentary - we can't ask that of any fictional movie. But, we do want human moments that make us relate to the character - if at least for five minutes. And, where Goodfellas has Henry Hill in tears when asking his boss for money or Tony Soprano crying in therapy, Black Mass has a few mundane blas√© scenes with his wife and mother - who checks out early on. <br/><br/>In fact, every female character in the film is the same (except for the prostitute Whitey strangles played by the sultry Juno Temple).<br/><br/>SPOILER* the one good scene Whitey purposely freaking out the FBI agents at dinner when discussing a homemade family receipt - this is in the trailer - which is why I wanted to see the movie. This is followed by Whitey paying a visit to Connolly's wife upstairs. He is terrorizing, horrifying, you name it - and he's actually dynamic here. Too bad this is five minutes amongst 122. <br/><br/>Wait for this on HBO. Do not pay for it on demand. Seriously. Don't."
"Seraphion","6","3","4","3 October 2015"," Good, but seems to be missing something in the story tightness
","The movie is being told from the perspectives and narration of Kevin Weeks, John Martorano and Stephen Flemmi, who were the right hand men of the crime lord James (Jimmy) ""Whitey"" Bulger. In 1975 Jimmy leads a South Boston's small time gang Winter Hill. He recruits Kevin Weeks as he takes him to brutalize Joey Angiulo, member of the competing Angiulo mafia from the North. Meanwhile, an FBI agent John Connolly, who grew up in Jimmy's neighborhood, comes back to Boston. He soon speaks to Jimmy's brother Billy, who's now a senator, to arrange a meeting with Jimmy. Connlly proposes an alliance between them to bring down the Angiulo. One night at Winter Hill's watering hole The Triple O's, one of Jimmy's guy raised his fist in his drunkenness to Jimmy. Jimmy soon takes care of it decisively. Connolly wins his superior's approval about the alliance with Jimmy. Jimmy only told Flemmi about it. Jimmy lost his son to an illness. This makes him more ruthless as he expands his crime activities.<br/><br/>In 1981 Winter Hill's illegal activities are racking up a lot of cash, and the gang pays bribes to both the police and even the FBI. Jimmy gives out the address of the Angiulo headquarters to Connolly, making the FBI more lenient to Winter Hill. Jimmy also has a hand in the Miami company Jai Alai. He made the deals with John Callahan and Brian Halloran. Callahan says that the company's new owner Roger Wheeler is being nosy about the bookkeeping, and asks a favor from Jimmy. Flemmi asks Bryan about a hit on Wheeler but Jimmy tells Bryan to leave with some money. Soon Wheeler gets killed. The FBI gets annoyed about it and Bryan comes forward to ask for protection from the bureau. But Connolly dismisses Bryan and calms his fellow agents. He confronts Jimmy about Wheeler but Jimmy manages to get the name of the rat who sold his name out from Connoly, and soon Jimmy kills Bryan. As the FBI again panics about Bryan, they hit the jackpot and arrests the Angiulo head. In celebration Jimmy and his crew takes Connolly to Miami in spring of 1982. Flemmi kills Callahan there at Connolly's knowledge, supposedly strengthening the bond between Jimy and Connolly.<br/><br/>In 1985 Jimmy and Billy lost their mother. Jimmy starts supplying arms to the IRA. In cold blood he kills Deborah, the daughter of Flemmi's girlfriend, who was ratting to the police. The district attorney in the FBI's Boston office gets replaced with Fred Wyshak, and Connolly gets a hard time to convince him about Jimmy. His fellow agents also discover that the intel supposedly from Jimmy are actually old ignored intel from other informants. The boat carrying the arms to Ireland gets intercepted due to the pilot being a snitch. Connolly's colleagues deny him the pilot's name but Jimmy soon finds the man and kills him. Connolly's colleague comes clean to the press and opens up publicly Jimmy as an FBI informant since 1975. In 1995 Jimmy left Boston and became a fugitive. He is captured in California in 2011.<br/><br/>The story is decently written and shown enough balance for the main focus character Jimmy Bulger. Yet this balance only lasted for about one third of the whole movie, since Jimmy becomes a pure wolf in sheep's clothing until the ending. On the other perspective, most of the other characters also have little to none variation of their original introductory state. John Connolly seems very stupid that for years he doesn't realize he's been played by Jimmy. So does John Morris' indecisiveness which lasted for years. Only Stephen Flemmi's character has a little bit of humanity shown when he stood by as Deborah gets killed.<br/><br/>The crime is the real attraction for this movie, pure cold blood executions to be exact. The movie makers were more than able to present us the camera tricks to show those convincing scenes with blood splattering all over and doing it at close distances. Don't expect to find anything like a shootout or the likes in this movie, though. If the movie makers stayed true to history or the book it was based on, apparently Jimmy Bulger is one who prefer silencing his targets ""persuasively"".<br/><br/>The drama parts had good grounding at the first one third or so of the duration. It nicely balances Jimmy's personality by giving depiction of humanity in caring for his son. But after that, it looks like the drama went all gone as the movie prefer to emphasize more Jimmy's ruthlessness after his son's death. Furthermore, The movie isn't being clear about the Lindsey's whereabouts after her loss.<br/><br/>The acting in overall is indeed a great job to see. Johnny Depp is truly one of the masters in deep character acting. His portrayal of Jimmy made me forget that he was also the confused Edward Scissorhands and the quirky Jack Sparrow. Add to this is the performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, who although had just a less significant part here, managed to add in a touch of authenticity into his speech's accenting. Having a cast of big names but small parts here turned out to be quite a nice move. Putting the less famous Rory Cochrane and Jesse Plemmons alongside Depp keeps the focus to the relationship between Jimmy and Joel Edgerton's Connolly at significance. Still placing familiar faces like Peter Sarsgaard, Dakota Johnson, Corey Stoll and even Juno Temple helped other scenes to gain attention.<br/><br/>My say for Black Mass (2015) is a 6 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see it in the cinemas. It's adequately entertaining as we get to be presented with quite a gripping story based on true events."
"caspian1978","6","3","4","3 October 2015"," Characters without Character
","Although I enjoy short movies, this 2 hour film needed to be 3 hours in order to work. Much of the movie is spent introducing characters who are quickly killed off or disappear before the audience gets to know them. The back story for movies such as The Departed helped the audience see the progression of the movie's characters to help them see the motivation of why and what the character is all about. We see the roles played by Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio well defined before we even see the opening credits. We see their past, where they came from, and home they were motivated to become the people they were. Black Mass fails at this miserably. We are introduced to many characters in such a short period of time. Each time, the audience easily looses track on who the main character is because we jump around to so many different people. For example, the movie starts with introducing Kevin Weeks. We start to take a journey with this character in the third person and then quickly leave this character completely to meet more characters. This is a story about James 'Whitey' Bulger. Then again, we spend more time with John Connolly only to loose any connection on what makes either one tick. The audience sees Whitey experience the death of many of his loved ones, but we do not see or hear of anything prior to the movie that would explain who and what he is and how he became that way. The same goes for Connolly's motivation. Just because he's from the neighborhood does not clearly define his motives, let alone his bond and loyalty to Whitey. The side story of the relationship with the Bulger Brothers fall short. The 800 lbs. elephant in the room is not really talked about as the two characters hardly share any screen time. Also, Black Mass does not have a single positive female character. Each is either limited in what they can bring to the story let alone a victim. Leave it to 4 male writers to fail at writing anything positive for a woman. Sadly, Black Mass is one of the best performances Johnny Depp has had in over ten years. The period piece of Boston / Miami in the 70's and 80's is great. The overall story of Black Mass is interesting, but falls short. The reason is simple. The main character is never defined. Although Whitey Bulger is the main star, we spend less than half the movie away from him as we are bored with side stories that are connected but have no connection with the audience. Black Mass could have been great, but did not have enough time."
"Ed-Shullivan","10","13","29","13 September 2015"," A deal with this devil garners you a free pass to a living hell in south Boston
","Scores a 10 out of 10 rating<br/><br/>The crime film genre remains in good stead with the launching of director Scott Cooper's Black Mass which is a movie biography based on factual evidence of south Boston's number one crime lord of the 1970's and 1980's the vicious head of the Winter Hill Gang, James (Whitey) Bulger. To help prepare you for what type of crime boss Whitey Bulger really was there is an earlier documentary film released in January 2014 titled ""Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger"" that is well worth watching for its in-depth insight in to the real south Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger before seeing Black Mass and realizing how well produced and acted the film really is.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the lead role of James Whitey Bulger with a hard to achieve balance of rare human compassion for his family and as a fearless gangster who knows no bounds in maximizing the physical violence he will dispel on anyone who gets in his way.<br/><br/>It is always difficult to take a true story of a mans life that evolves over decades and capture the essence of the man in a two hour film but director Scott Cooper does an excellent job in achieving just that. It is hard to fathom that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) would make such a ridiculous deal with a devil like James ""Whitey"" Bulger and allow him to run rampant over south Boston in exchange for providing a continuous stream of confidential information that would bring down his competition in South Boston.<br/><br/>Two primary reasons to see this film are the rich cinematography which is pure luster in color and the excellent script writing. There is also the benefit of a superior list of top notch supporting actors such as Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Julianne Nicholson and Kevin Bacon just to name a few. It is an all star cast with not one stand out performance since there are so many great scenes in this film.<br/><br/>I would love to predict that there will be numerous Academy Award nominations for Black Mass but in my humble opinion the true way to assess most films authenticity of success is at the box office to which I predict Black Mass's gross sales over the next year will surpass all of its competition hands down, Academy Award winner or not. I hope I never encounter Johnny Depp knocking on my door playing Whitey Bulger with a deal of a lifetime...or with death."
"bryank-04844","4","14","32","16 September 2015"," It's okay to look at 'Black Mass' as a distant sequel to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies.
","It's okay to look at 'Black Mass' as a distant sequel to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. Both have bad guys, wars, guns, monsters, and Johnny Depp. Maybe I'm reaching a bit there, but it's still fun to think about them as distant cousins in movies. The story of James 'Whitey' Bulger has been told a lot, especially recently. If you're unfamiliar with who Bulger is, he was one of the most vicious and heinous human beings to ever walk the planet. He was even the FBI's Most Wanted man for more than a decade, as he spent most of his time in Boston as a mafia boss who committed murder amongst other things.<br/><br/>Not only that, but he was also an FBI informant, who in turn the FBI let him and his henchmen do whatever they wanted on the streets of Boston. It wasn't until only in the past couple of years until Bulger, who was then in his 80s, was caught, tried in court, and sentenced for the rest of his so called life. There was even a fantastic documentary about him, which you can read about HERE, or more famously, the movie 'The Departed', directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio. In that film, Nicholson played a character that was based on Bulger. So you get the general gist of who this guy is.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper ('Crazy Heart', 'Out of the Furnace') wanted to tell Bulger's story in the form of a feature film that tracked his start as an informant for the FBI and his rise to power as the most vicious kingpin and criminal we the world have seen. Despite an excellent performance by Johnny Depp (perhaps his best in years), 'Black Mass' is slow crawl to the finish line with episodic editing and far too much dialogue versus violent action sequences as the trailer would lead you to believe. Cooper even tried to mold 'Black Mass' as a Scorsese film in having his characters narrate over the film throughout the two hour run time.<br/><br/>Even the narration was bland and unmoving. If you're looking for a 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' type of movie here, you won't get it, even though some of the performances from Benedict Cumberbatch (Bulger's senator brother) and Joel Edgerton (the FBI contact for Bulger) are amazing. The film slowly treads along and shows us how Bulger and John Connolly (Edgerton), two childhood friends, who form an alliance between the FBI and mafia in exchange for information to take out other mafia outfits out, notably the Italians, to which Bulger and his crew have free reign to wreak havoc on Boston without getting pinched.<br/><br/>And yes, this actually happened in real life. As the film progresses, we see more and more FBI agents and officers asking many questions to why nobody thinks to bring in Bulger himself. Add a semi violent scene in the mix, the mix and repeat with the questions and dialogue for over two hours, and you have yourself 'Black Mass'. I must admit I was pretty excited for this movie, but its slow pace and mediocre violence made me only want to view this once and never again, as 'The Departed' or the Bulger documentary itself is a far better experience than this movie.<br/><br/>The only real shining light here is Depp as Bulger. His emotional and physical transformation is nothing short of haunting and frightening. Those steel blue eyes are as cold as an iceberg when he stares at you, and Depp pulls this off very convincingly. There's a great scene at a dinner table where Depp scares the daylights out of you and makes you laugh that infamous nervous laugh, as you never know if he'll snap and viciously kill you. I would not be surprised if Depp received a trophy for his performance here come award season.<br/><br/>Yes, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemmons, Corey Stoll, Rory Cochrane, and Peter Sarsgaard are in the movie, but their characters are only given a couple of minutes of screen time, that we never get to spend enough time with them to make anything work or feel any remorse, let alone anger. In the end, I wish 'Black Mass' was better, but at least there are other options in regards to this subject matter to watch.<br/><br/>Worth a Look"

","Well.. In this decade, it was seldomly we see a movie like this. Cooper try to made a movie focusing on lead character with gangster- drama. He wanted to make a movie with Johnny Depp digging the Bulger character deeply. For a few years back, we could see only small amount of movie with this typical such as ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"", ""American Hustle"", and ""Winter's Bone"". I would say that this movie was not on par to these 3 movies, especially Scorsese's Direction. Of course if we see the experience aspect which Scorsese had, Its not even fair to compete this 2 director. Cooper is a young director and Scorsese is a legend and we should appreciate what Cooper could do to make such a movie at this time where movies are in crisis. Why in crisis ? Because i think movies nowadays taking the wrong path. Director's priority is not making a good movie, but it is how to make money from movies.<br/><br/>Firstly from the acting. When i see Bulger character, i see Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Bulger's character is not even original (for classic movie viewers). Johnny Depp was not in his best potential as an actor. He is not good in this kind of typical character. Also when i see the supporting, all of them were just average (even Cumberbacth). But i give an appreciation to Joel Edgerton who did such amazing performance.<br/><br/>Then the cinematography. Typical static shot, unworthy close-up shots, classic wannabe, empty establishing shots. Blunt writing with no memorable dialogue. Unoriginal narration style with forth-back plot.<br/><br/>Art-Direction ? No no no.. I couldn't say anything which can make this movie feels artsy."

I can best describe he's performance as darkly comical, frighting and really uncomfortable at times. That's the power and the weight Depp brought to this performance and he absolutely pulled it off. I'm so happy to see Johnny Depp giving a good performance that wasn't anything like Transcendence or The Lone Ranger. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie was beautifully shot and the camera work used in the film was just stunning.

There wasn't anything to latch on to since the movie doesn't have a protagonist or a character that you can relate to. Everyone is a villain.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the movie wasn't that interesting and it was very hard for me to latch on. These a lot of police investigation in this movie that was actually documented and to me it wasn't very interesting and I wish that the movie focused a little more on Depp's character.<br/><br/>Overall Black Mass has amazing cinematography, a great performance from Depp and good directing.

","It's like every gangster movie made in the past 15 years is just a weak pastiche of previous gangster movies. Nothing new has been added to the genre in a long time and this film certainly isn't adding anything but canned dialogue and a pointless story. ""F you, you F-ing F bal. I'll kill you."" <br/><br/>For me the roles have reversed between TV and movies. TV, once the ugly step-sister of feature films, has completely usurped the position of movies in modern pop culture. Movies just seemed overly formulaic, the character development is either lacking or forced, and there just isn't room for surprises.<br/><br/>We start off with one of the central character's thugs being interviewed. A promising start but this kid all but disappears after the first couple of scenes. Why? Because there are WAY too many characters introduced in the film. The wives, the bosses, the cop's partner, the hit man, the cop's boss, the DA, and on and on. In a TV series this would be possible but not in a two hour movie (that seemed like four hours). How about having a better tory and many fewer characters?<br/><br/>And just look at all those movie stars. Movie stars, at least to me, are a complete liability and watching a bunch of tired hacks sleep walk through an even more tired script like Black Mass isn't my idea of a good time. ""Look everyone, it's Johnny Depp! He's acting! He's really acting!"" I just can't get beyond the fact that I'm looking at Johnny Depp and can never get to the point where I'm seeing a character. I also couldn't get past the fact that it looked like he was dressed up for Halloween as Freddie Krueger. I'll take the TV no-name actors every time.<br/><br/>And please just stop it with the accents! I have dedicated my life to learning languages and nothing mugs me more than a phony accent. I have worked to perfect my accents in French and Spanish for years and years yet I would never try to pass myself off as a native.<br/><br/>As I've said before, I wouldn't trade one episode of Breaking Bad for all of the movies I've seen in the past three years.

Nothing about how he became this person, his life before the events in the film, the nature of his personal relationships, how he became leader of his gang, his upbringing or anything else. It is an empty film with boring dialogue mixed with excessive profanity and occasional violence. The very few occasions when somebody gets killed are the only thing to keep you from sleeping. They don't explain in any depth the events that transpire in the film, and a viewer could easily get lost. They never fully explain who his brother was, so the one scene with him served no purpose at all. If you want to give this film a chance, do so with a cup of coffee. I almost dozed off numerous times. Ho-hum."
"krycek19","1","6","13","18 December 2015"," Why Black Mass and Depp sucks
","Sure, Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable and sinister and creepy as the real life gangster James Whitey Bulger.<br/><br/>But he is not creepy enough. He never seems out of control and totally insane like Heath Ledger's joker in The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>It's not just that Depp is unlikeable, he's suppose to be unlikeable, its more the fact that there isn't a single likable character in the movie.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton ticked me off from the moment he appeared in the movie. He looked constipated and fat. And not once was he not wearing a suit where even his neck was covered by the collar of his shirt. I hated his suits and his big hair. Like everyone else in the movie he was scum.<br/><br/>The movie is in general depressing and boring. As bad as Good Fellas, which in my opinion is one of the crappiest and most overrated gangster movies ever made.<br/><br/>And I love good gangster movies like Donnie Brasco, another gangster movie with Depp where he is so much better. Or The Untouchables or Scarface. Masterpieces within their genre.<br/><br/>This could have been an interesting movie if Depp have had the guts to play Bulger like a complete psycho. Like Al Pacino in Scarface. Sure he kills several people violently, but even that is done boring. If there had been even one character worth rooting for it could also have improved the movie.<br/><br/>Black Mass is one clich√© after another and it goes completely by the book as far as gangster movies go which unfortunately makes it very very boring."

","I wasn't sure at first about the choice of Johnny Depp to play the infamous Boston mob kingpin ""Whitey"" Bulger, as it seems of late his cinematic output has been at best , uneven, and at worst, abysmal. Under Scott Cooper's direction, though, Depp turns in a performance that is truly astonishing. Depp manages to convey both unbridled mob violence with scenes of domestic tenderness, often within mere seconds of one another. He is ably supported by the fantastically cast Joel Edgerton as the not-so-upright FBI agent who nails a perfect Bostonian accent in addition to the nuances of his conflicted relationship with Bulger. In fact, all the supporting roles are faultlessly cast. Benedict Cumberbatch-who seems destined to become the all-time winner of the Cinematic Workaholic Award at the rate he's racking up roles-is exquisite as Bulger's social climbing yet loyal brother, and Kevin Bacon and Peter Sarsgaard both give their brief appearances wonderful texture and depth. My one negative is the failure to really flesh out the female characters, with the exception being that of a young hooker who has one of 2015's great dramatic scenes. I love love love that particular scene both for the heartbreaking emotion and self-assured camera work. Hopefully this is the start of more good work to come from both Depp and Scott Cooper."

"mhikmetaltug","7","3","5","1 October 2015"," Lack of Taste, Black Mass critic.
","Young director Scott Cooper's third directing experience Black Mass, tells the real story of ""James ""Whitey"" Bulger"", a well-known Mobster who was active in South Boston in the period of 1970's until mid-1990's. <br/><br/>I found the biography of Whitey Bulger intriguing. Johnny Depp as the Bulger character vitalizer, did well job on the character, And of course, Benedict Cumberbatch's presence in the cast, as William Bulger (brother of Whitey) must have made the attraction on the audience. I found it wise to blend his acting skills, with one of the most characteristic actor, Depp. Generally I admit the casting was good. <br/><br/>Everything in the director Scott Cooper's kitchen, such as great actors, cinematography and a unique biography adopted script, has been served to him, to cook. However, I found something missing meanwhile, I was expecting more from the movie. I loved the art direction, shooting angles, acting and etc. But still I felt the attachment problem with the arid taste of editing and directing. The main problems of the latest Hollywood Mobster movies are these actually. The same scenes with individual violent punishments of betray, the boss's and the gangs sudden rise story, depicted in one scene in a few seconds, boss's problems shown as his loneliness as he loses his family members or getting frustrated with his wife and old friends. And in the aspect of the gang members, senior to junior, feeling the boss fear with a thinking of the boss is going mad day by day. The all come as in the right and simultaneous way, just as millions of other similar late Hollywood Mobster movies.<br/><br/>Scarface ""Tony Montana"" had been brought in life by ""Al Pacino"". It was unique and it still is mentioned as a classic Mob-story because It was the first. The depiction of Tony Montana from his penniless times to become the drug lord of the whole Miami depicted almost same as In this biographic history of Whitey Bulger. <br/><br/>Besides, Scarface was more violent and graphic, It wasn't the style that made it apart from it's equivalents (for instance) as ""Black Mass"". The real difference was its way of giving the sense of ambition and violent side of Tony Montana to the audience, with much more accurate catharsis than the others. I am sure, the acting skills of Al Pacino as playing the character, such as using his mimics, anger expositions, both physical and mental descents and ascents, must have thrilled and caused more emotional changes than the after 2000's mob story movies on the audience while watching Scarface, even second time as well. I felt that way at least. <br/><br/>So the missing part was generally the lack of the absorption of the characters by me. It is possible for the director, wanting to stay loyal to the real life story of the Whitey Bulger so that, maybe his calm and creepy silent characteristic depiction was thought to be depicted sovereign. The violence was castrated by the director and the editors maybe, instead of a more novelish way of narration. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it, to get the feeling from a genre that I like to watch. But, for instance, ""Kill The Irishman"", ""Departed"" (although I believe that it was inspired by the Hongkong version ""Infernal Affairs"") and some more other examples of TV and cinema productions, telling the inside stories of Irish mobs made me more attached than ""Black Mass"". Unfortunately, I must admit that it would be much more effective with its cast, and unique biographical story."

","I know there's a fair school of through that says Johnny Depp's star has waned over recent years, but I was surprised that I'd never heard of 'Black Mass' until it was on sale on DVD. It sounded pretty good - a true life tale of how a gangster turned Government informer, plus it had a stellar cast including Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon and that creepy guy out of 'Breaking Bad' who looks a bit like Matt Damon. However, when I started watching it, I soon realised why it never really set the Box Office alight.<br/><br/>It's dull. That's it. This is going to be a pretty short review. There's really not that much I can say about it. It's just boring. I suppose I've watched a lot of these gritty true-life gangster/snitch films in my time, therefore I couldn't see anything new here. However, I really do think that anyone fresh to the genre would find this a little slow and hard going. It may have a decent cast, but that almost becomes a problem. The film bounces around from actor to actor and from present to past and feels completely disjointed, like each scene doesn't really relate to the one that's gone before. Then, because every scene doesn't feel like it should follow the one before, the whole film comes across like one big series of mini stories where the actors are never allowed to show their considerable talents because none of them are ever allowed the time to do so.<br/><br/>Whatever the public mood is towards Johnny Depp right now, he's always been one of my favourite actors and I'm certain he has plenty of good roles ahead of him. Just like I know he loves to immerse himself into whatever part he's playing and is more than happy to do whatever it takes to 'look the part.' As with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' he's almost unrecognisable as the main character, sporting a balding hair piece and more than a few added wrinkles. However, it takes more than a good set of prosthetics to make a movie and, unfortunately, his passion for his craft doesn't save the film.<br/><br/>It's not terrible, but for the cast that's been assembled for this production you'd be expecting something along the lines of 'Goodfellas.' Sadly, the only two words that come to mind here are 'boring' and 'forgettable' (sorry, Johnny)."

","This biopic of a famous Boston crime lord falls flat for a number of reasons. Depp acts his socks off and the make-up and camera departments deserve credit for imbuing a coldness in those blue blue eyes. Cumberbach also copes ably with a role that is a departure from much of his previous work. But the story fails to engage. The main problem is the FBI office. The complicity of the FBI in the rise of this nefarious individual is what makes this story stand out, but the squabbling between the various characters in that setting lacks gravitas. Kevin Bacon is unusually limited. The story chases Boston authenticity, forsaking gripping drama in the process. There is one scene where Bulger plays mind games with an FBI officer over the dinner table about a 'secret' family recipe. A potentially dramatic scene, if we hadn't witnessed it before, beat for beat, in Goodfellas. Taking a cookie-cutter to that iconic 'You think I'm funny?' scene is symptomatic of the lack of ambition and verve in this film. Not a terrible film, but the lack of risk, or surprise, is disappointing. The filmmakers should have watched 'Snowtown' before starting out."

It's not a typical crime thriller, it's a realistic classic on the same level as Goodfellas.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper, the screenwriters and lead actor Johnny Depp do an excellent job of gradually revealing the personality of Whitey Bulger, a true psychopath. Bulger is quick to betray his friends and is unforgiving even to his closest associates when they present the slightest threat to him, while at the same time he demands total loyalty from everybody around him.<br/><br/>I haven't liked Joel Edgerton in other roles, such as Ramses in Exodus: Gods and Kings, but he is the ideal actor to play John Connolly.<br/><br/>Black Mass moves along at just the right pace, not too fast for character development and yet quickly enough so that it's never dull."

Don't expect to see the Depp you are used to because they transformed is whole look and you barely recognize him.

It the fact is that Depp doesn't need to be taken seriously. Yes, the past few years have been a little unkind to the actor, but before Jack Sparrow sailed into shore, Depp had a wonderful range of beautiful roles that defined him as a true Hollywood star. And since his big transition to mega-star, his kookiness has since become lost in translation.<br/><br/>And here, while the true story of Bulger is terrifying and an important part of Bostonian history, the film is a predictable affair, trying too much to be like goodfellas and ending up just a profane almost chore like effort to get through, but, the performances are good, despite some questionable casting.<br/><br/>Depp is good as Bulger, but the make up is terrible, he looks like a cross between Klaus Kinskis' Nosferatu, and the bad guy from Thor: The Dark World, and it really takes you away from the narrative, and the psychotic tendencies that Bulger obviously has.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the second two acts really get bogged down in so many sub plots, as the first act is truly remarkable, especially when tragedy hits Bulger.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's not a bad film by any means, it's just that we've seen this true life crime story time and time again, and they can be wonderful at times, but this has an element of d√©j√† Vu to it."

Everyone got so excited, that they got disappointed when they realized that it wasn't another Goodfellas. Let's be honest, how many movies are? It was really never meant to be in the first place. The Whitey Bulger story is something much slower, creepier and slimier. Black Mass is the Whitey Bulger story, as it really went down. With everything considered, it is nothing short of a great crime movie. At the center of it all is a tour-de-force performance by Johnny Depp. It's the best performance he's done in more than a decade. He has the Best Actor nominations on lock. Every time he is on screen, you cannot keep your eyes off of him. He's fascinating, and yet absolutely revolting. Other than Depp, we have a so-so performance by Joel Edgarton, and a surprisingly stellar performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger.

Yes he loves to hide behind make-up and prosthetics, but doesn't Mr. Depp always sink into these bizarre characters like a glove? His range of performances is something to be admired, and his portrayal of the notorious South Boston gangster Jimmy ""Whitey"" Bulger is no different. It's simply an outstanding performance. The entire film seems to hinge on it; he's captivating, frightening, odd, and charismatic all at once. And Depp isn't the only one doing great work here. Benedict Cumberbatch does a fine job with that difficult Boston accent, Kevin Bacon is reliable as usual, Dakota Johnson, Corey Stoll, Jesse Plemons all provide solid character work. But the real standout is Joel Edgerton. This man is unstoppable as of late. With The Gift earlier this year and now his turn as a corrupt FBI agent in this film, Edgerton has established himself as a true talent we can expect great things from. But with all these fantastic performances the film just isn't that memorable.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper does an admirable job but his approach to the content lacks insight or originality.

However, if you are from Boston you will have a hard time not focusing on how incorrect the Boston accent is on just about everyone (except Connelly and Depp does okay with the Boston accent but he's mostly growling and being menacing rather than really trying to claim a true Boston accent. Kevin Bacon, on the other hand, can't even seem to land one single line with an authentic accent).<br/><br/>Anyway, the writing and story line are slow and I'm not sure anyone who isn't already familiar with the case of Whitey Bulger, the FBI, his brother Billy Bulger and the whole sordid scandal will come away with sufficient information or anything interesting here.<br/><br/>I kept asking Why? Why is James Whitey Bulger doing this - what has he done - what's the background here with the Bulger family - tell us more about Anjulo, give us more detail on his associates and the connection with his 2 brothers. The movie just gives us a very broad overview of a sad and fascinating criminal case. I think this story would be much better served by a miniseries rather than a film where time constraints seem to make it impossible to bring the fascinating details to light.<br/><br/>The kid who played Landry on Friday Night Lights (Jesse Plemons) does a great job. He's great in Breaking Bad and also great in Black Mass. I don't understand why Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott wanted to be in this. Depp and Joel Edgerton (FBI agent Connolly) do an excellent job with their characters. Benedict Cumberbath as William (Billy) Bulger is just silly; I've never seen Benedict be so awful and ill suited for a role.

It charts his criminal activities and his subsequent dealings with the FBI.<br/><br/>Directed by Scott Cooper, Black Mass is one of those instances where a great lead performance deserves a better over all film. Depp literally inhabits the role of Bulger in a fully formed perf that reminds us of what a fine actor he can be. Unfortunately the edgy material to hand never really ignites in filmic form. Maybe we were spoilt by the offerings of Coppola and Scorsese previously? For this comes off as a cheap imitation of far greater films, with the crafters of the pic giving us something of a caricature piece.<br/><br/>Although compelling as a lead character study, much of the narrative is rendered as playing it safe, putting emotive heart where it doesn't belong. Most of the support characters, and key to the story, are under developed, while the pace is decidedly attention sapping and certainly not adroitly understated. Nevertheless, we do get good acting perfs to support Depp, notably Joel Edgerton as corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while Masanobu Takayanagi's (Hostiles) cinematography is delicate of moody hues.<br/><br/>There's a fascinating story trying to get out of this, but the 15 year wait to get it to screen hasn't been worth it.

He managed to evade the authorities for many years, no mean feat in itself. The film's plot is packed with murder and violent incident, but it feels like an attempt to return to glory days rather than being anything new or fresh. The profanity irritated me a bit and the endless parade of familiar faces have little to work with. There's no sense of era, really, just more and more time spent in the company of hateful or corrupted characters. I enjoyed it to a degree, but is it one I'd keep coming back to? Not particularly.

"jaredpahl","4","1","1","5 November 2017"," A Bland Look at the Underground Boston Mob Scene, Black Mass Fails to Make Use of a Powerhouse Performance from Johnny Depp.
","I had gotten my hopes up for Black Mass, perhaps too high, when I heard Johnny Depp would be playing the lead role as infamous Boston gangster Whitey Bulger. Combined with director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) it was reasonable to think that Black Mass could be a triumphant return to Donnie Brasco form for Johnny Depp, and a strong gangster picture in its own right. Upon seeing the film, I was disappointed. Depp's Whitey Bulger lives up to the hype, but the movie around his performance never got me hooked.<br/><br/>Black Mass recalls a period of time in the mid 1970s when Irish Mob Boss Whitey Bulger began working with his brother, Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) and FBI informant John Connely (Joel Edgerton), to take down the rival Mob families of Boston. Sure, it is an interesting true story, and Whitey Bulger is an interesting real life character, but the film struggles mightily to build a dramatic structure. This should be a movie about personalities, about betrayals and backstabbing. But Black Mass plays more like a documentary. It follows certain characters, but not intimately. Its players serve as parts used to explain the inner workings of the Irish Mob and the FBI. Not as individuals with their own feelings. In a documentary, there is an interest that comes from seeing the actual historical evidence of the story. In a crime drama, you have to do more. I never felt that Black Mass had anything of its own to say about Whitey Bulger, the Mob, or the FBI. The drama in Black Mass is incidental. All I saw was a film that tells me what happened, but not what it meant for anyone involved.<br/><br/>The reason Black Mass doesn't work is not because of the performances. Individually, there is some great acting on display. Edgerton and Cumberbatch are convincing as hard boiled Bostonians, and Kevin Bacon gives a performance reminiscent of his work in Mystic River. Depp, however, is the main attraction, and his Whitey Bulger is the first truly Oscar-worthy performance from him in years. Working with cold, blue eyes, he creates a ghostly, menacing figure that can stare at the screen and tell you more about his character than any amount of writing can. And that's a good thing, because Bulger is not much of a character on the page. According to the script, he's a bad-tempered wise guy, a la Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas. But that's it. Depp does all the heavy lifting. He fleshes out Bulger as much as possible, illustrating his fierce connection to his son as well as his hair trigger temper, but it's still not enough to save the film.<br/><br/>Black Mass is not a bad film, but it is a misguided one. There are good performances all around, and hints of strong filmmaking, but the movie never managed to grab me. Simply telling Whitey Bulger's story is not enough. With only an admirable Johnny Depp performance to differentiate it from the countless crime dramas that have come and gone in Hollywood, Black Mass is unfortunately forgettable.<br/><br/>43/100"

","To be honest... I've actually never been a particularly big fan of crime and mafia-related film and media. I can see their value. And I can understand their appeal. It's fun to sort-of put yourself in the shoes of men and women who do terrible things and sort-of vicariously live through stories depicting the criminal underbelly of major cities. And it's fascinating to see how these stories can play out and how these people either thrive or ultimately fall. But I find myself quite picky when it comes to these sorts of films and typically only enjoying the better entries. Because frankly, for every ""Godfather""... for every ""Casino""... there's about a million and a half lesser or even overtly bad films or shows or stories dealing with this subject matter. So I try to look for the best of the genre on the odd day I find myself interested in watching one of these sorts of films.<br/><br/>""Black Mass"" is a strange and fascinating beast. Based on the enthralling and troubling real-life story of Boston gangster Whitey Bulger, and sporting a top-notch cast of wildly talented performers, this should have been an easy and surefire hit. And yet, director Scott Cooper and the screen writing duo of Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth deliver a film that never quite comes together. Only mildly entertaining and informing the audience with some shallow surface level thrills and admittedly fantastic performances... while ultimately feeling far too dry and clinical to really leave a mark. The ingredients are there, but the final product feels hollow and without any real substance. Watching this film is like trying to chew on air- there's just nothing there.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp leads a star-studded cast, as the story follows Bulger's rise and fall in the Boston underworld over the course of a number of years, covering some of the major events of his life- from the tragic death of his son, through his troubling connections with the FBI as an exploitative informant, to several of the murders he was tied in connection to. And to give credit where it is due, Depp is a phenomena in his portrayal of Bulger, and the cast at large is quite good. Depp has always been an incredible persona in the world of entertainment, but as of late his performances have lacked variety and mainly fallen into the realm of ""quirky goofballs."" Here, we see his sheer talent at work, as he lets the role take him over completely. Supporting performances by the likes of Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon and Benedict Cumberbatch similarly light up the screen (though Cumberbatch hasn't quite nailed his American accent yet here), and it's just a joy to behold everyone on screen. This most certainly is an actor's film.<br/><br/>And in terms of simple aesthetics, director Cooper does do a pretty stellar job in terms of his visual storytelling. The film is slick, gritty and definitely feels very true to life in terms of direction and flow, and Cooper's keen eye for composition and detail lends a lot to the proceedings. And this is wonderfully accented by cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's superbly grounded lighting and some good, moody score by composer Tom Holkenborg. It's a well- crafted movie at very least in terms of production. But the issue here is the story and the portrayal of characters. And that's where it starts to fall apart and lose faith and interest from the viewer.<br/><br/>While my knowledge of Bulger's life and dealings isn't quite vast, I do know a bit about him, and I know that his story could make for one hell of a film. But ""Black Mass"" doesn't really give us much outside of sheer, blatant details and facts. It's a very calculated film that doesn't really even attempt to delve in the heads of Bulger or his associates much at all, save for a few key scenes early on. It just presents facts over and over. Cold, hard facts. This happened. Then this happened. Then this happened. And it's monotonous for much of its screen time as a result. This could have been a very dark and provocative character study into the mind of a career criminal... instead, it feels like the writers are going down a studio mandated check-list of things they had to include. It takes the soulful performances of Depp and the others and strips away the humanity by not allowing us to care about them or at very least get invested in what's happening. Even with people like Bulger, there needs to be some degree of humanity or reason or exploration to the film for us to care. This is just a roughly-arranged timeline of ""stuff happening."" Hackneyed and trite in terms of structure and delivery. And it robs the film of virtually all potential... coming across more as a drab, dry and dreary presentation on Bulger than a compelling film about him.<br/><br/>And that's why I just can't forgive the film, despite its remarkable performances and some admittedly solid direction. It's just such a chore of a film, lacking any entertainment or interest. And that's a shame. Depp deserves better. Heck, even Bulger deserves better in a way. And ""Black Mass"" just fails to meet its sky-high potential. I'm giving it a very mediocre 5 out of 10, and would only recommend it to the biggest of crime-story junkies and fans. All else really need not apply."

"pfgpowell-1","6","1","1","9 October 2016"," A tad two-dimensional, sad to say. Good, yes, but ...
","There's something oddly flat about Black Mass, a take on the life of Jimmy 'Whitey' Bulger, the notorious Chicago gang leader, but it didn't really occur to me until I'd seen the film. The film is structured more or less in flashback, with various of Bulger's henchmen, who really have nothing to lose, opening up to the FBI about their boss's various crimes, which include a long list of murders.<br/><br/>So we get scenes of Bulger as he sets out and as he is recruited by an old school chum who just happens to be an FBI hero as an informant. Bulger, who can't abide 'rats' and who has killed men merely for arguing with him, doesn't, of course, see it that way and likes to regard his relationship with the FBI as 'an arrangement'. But whatever you call it, it played very much in his favour. The pitch was that as the FBI is more concerned with bringing down organised Mafia crime in the north of the city, it will turn a blind eye to the nefarious dealings of the 'Southey' Bulger as long as he feeds them information to help bring down the Mafia.<br/><br/>Then we move on a few years to Bulger, under the protection of his FBI handler, being far more established in the Southside and making a pretty penny. We move on again to a later version of Bulger, this time involved in the murder of a businessman he is working with. And on it goes. It's all very interesting and very well done, and Johnny Depp especially, made up to such an extent that you hardly recognise the man, does a good job of creeping us out. And yet . . .<br/><br/>Given that the relationship Bulger had with his corrupt FBI buddy is central to the film (and which was the case in real life ‚Äì the bent FBI agent is now serving 40 years in clink), it is hard not to compare Black Mass with Martin Scorsese's The Departed, which covers the same ground, but which fleshes out the subject matter by introducing a story and a new character, another Southey FBI man who works undercover as part of the Bulger character's gang to expose the mole the FBI begin to believe they have in their ranks.<br/><br/>That is partly why The Departed scored where Black Mass just doesn't: despite the murders, despite the creepy scenes involving Bulger, despite everything there isn't really that much too Black Mass. In many ways it could be a documentary. And to be honest we want more than just a documentary, we want a story and sadly Black Mass doesn't give us a story in the film sense.<br/><br/>It is well-made, though and doesn't deserve to be written off because it isn't as good as Scorsese's The Departed. It's just that it's a shame it isn't quite a bit better."

And sometimes his makeup was so bad that it made what should have been his most powerful scenes look ridiculous. And there were problems with the story and etc, etc. it is a shame because the story of which this movie is based on is pure gold. The acting is excellent almost all around. In the end, I think the ultimate fault falls on the director. Hollywood needs to stop risking the outcome of properties by saving a few dollars using noobie directors who have less than 5 films under their belts.

But relationships among main characters aren't well defined, there are no connecting stories to make bonds believable. I like most actors so i was not prejudiced. I read somewhere Joel Edgerton was good in Black mass. Perhpas that is true, but John Connoly's dialogs were so childish, his actions that should be sneaky, scheming and cunning were simply transparent and unbelievable. No, i did not buy the story for a minute. Which is strange since the story is true. The good part, which isolated could be given high scores: Jimmy Whitey Bulger Johnny Depp looks scary indeed. The empty bright eyes could fit the horror flick. Strong occasional resemblance with Christopher Walken made me think Johnny studied him for this part.

"randymcbeast","5","1","1","14 January 2016"," I thought this movie would be so much better
","This movie was more about style than substance and even the style was lacking.<br/><br/>The substance issue comes from the fact that the story was not even close to being fully told. If I think about a similar type movie like Goodfellas I can only say that this movie pales in comparison.<br/><br/>It just left too much out and instead concentrated on just a few intense moments of the main character's life. That doesn't work. For instance, we didn't get any view into Bulger's personal life during all of these events. The FBI agent Connolly was covered a bit but not Bulger. Think of Henry Hill in Goodfellas and how we got a pretty decent view from start to finish.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm expecting too much as I'm sure it wasn't meant to be a biography but it's a fascinating true story that needed more coverage. It was like eating a bland plate of food and still feeling hungry afterwards.<br/><br/>The neighborhood shots and overall feel of the movie for that time period was done well so I'll give it that. The negatives were a plenty though, in addition to the swiss cheese story. The accents were awful, especially Cumberbatch. Casting an English actor to play an Irish Southie was just wrong on so many levels. The makeup was also quite off for a few of the characters like for Depp and the Jesse Plemons character.<br/><br/>There was quite a bit of buzz and critical acclaim for this movie and I have to think that it was mostly due to the cast. It is indeed an amazing cast but at the end of the day the movie doesn't tell the story so it doesn't matter who's in the cast."

","This, we're told, is the true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp with a dubious hairline), an Irish American crime lord who 'ran' South Boston with savage ruthlessness in the 1970s and 80s but turned informer to help the FBI clear out Cosa Nostra rivals who were threatening his 'turf' in protection, gambling, drugs, all the usual rackets. So far, so familiar. The unusual element to this story is that Bulger's brother Billy was a rising figure in the Massachusetts state senate. One of the movie's great flaws is that it never makes clear why James's criminal activities, which regularly made the newspapers, had no apparent impact on the senator's career for more than twenty years.<br/><br/>The movie's other great flaw is the ""so far, so familiar"" element. Stories like this have been told before, with repeated scenes of violence and fusillades of f-words, in GOODFELLAS and with a lot less profanity and a lot more style in the GODFATHER trilogy. We see James ordering and even carrying out brutal killings, but despite the weird hair and weirder expressions Depp's performance has a slightly pantomime air about it: you don't feel the incarnate evil of Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST or Sean Penn in DEAD MAN WALKING. Cumberbatch has a good stab at Bobby Kennedy Boston, but does not look comfortable in the role. Joel Egerton is probably the best thing in it as the star FBI agent who finds that dancing with the devil puts his soul in peril. A gripping movie, even enthralling, but short on originality."

Just you know, maybe blind, since his eyes are made of glass. The brutality is sparse but gut-wrenching and yet it fails to add anything to the plot or characters.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","1","18 November 2015"," Always good, rarely great
","""Black Mass"" is the newest movie by writer and director Scott Cooper although he ""only"" directed here. I quite enjoyed his previous works ""Crazy Heart"" and ""Out of the Furnace"", so I was pretty curious about this two-hour movie here. After his takes on alcoholism and revenge, he gives us an insight into the world of crime in 1970s' and 1980s' Boston. The main character in all this is James Bulger played by Johnny Depp. I must admit that I am not the greatest Depp fan, but he is okay in this movie. Again, it is much more the makeup and the ruthless way (with murdering people left and right) he was written than Depp giving a truly great performance, but still he is fine overall.<br/><br/>The MVP, however, is Joel Edgerton as John Connolly and I can totally see why he is considered for his first Oscar nomination here. He is the epitome of a sleazy unlikeable federal agent in here, who is not afraid at all of getting his hands dirty, even if he does not do so in the physical sense. However, he refuses people witness protection after they testify against Bulger and he is really close with the ruthless criminal himself. The character of Connolly's wife, played by Julianne Nicholson, actually gives the appropriate reaction to a man like Bulger, which is staying as far away from him as possible. Cochrane is fine too. I am a bit biased on him as he's an actor I like. Sad to see he does not have that much to work with, but he is still pretty good. Actually, early on I had to think of him in ""CSI: Miami"" when he is the aide to Horatio Caine and in here Depp is almost the evil equivalent. Everybody fears him (unless they're drunk), nobody dares to say a word against him and even his girlfriend/wife (played by the stunning Dakota Johnson) doesn't really dare to interfere when he tries to get their son as well on the path of crime.<br/><br/>I felt that ""Black Mass"" needed a bit to get going, maybe 25-30 minutes, but afterwards I watched a very solid crime thriller, which is even more interesting because it's close to reality. Basically all the major characters in here, including the two Bulger Brothers (I keep reading Bulgur), are still alive today. Talking about the brothers, Cumberbatch disappointed me here. He had quite a bit to work with to make this an even better movie in terms of solidarity and respect between brothers, but it never was an interesting topic and the film would not have been worse without him. So my final verdict is that I hope Edgerton gets an Oscar nomination as he carried the film nicely (without Depp's heavy makeup and costume and truly baity material). His arrest near the end was the finest moment of the film. I recommend ""Black Mass"". Certainly worth a watch if you like historic crime thrillers."
"lucasversantvoort","6","1","1","18 November 2015"," Not the comeback of Johnny Depp, but he's not solely to blame
","Ever since it was announced Johnny Depp would be playing hardened criminal James ""Whitey"" Bulger in Black Mass, there's been some debate on the merits of Depp's career. One camp thinks that Depp's been wasting his time (and talents) with all those Pirates and Burton films while the other camp is occupied by those who feel that even in those films his acting skills were on display. Nevertheless, Black Mass was intended to be a return to form for Depp.<br/><br/>We start in the present, in a police station where a former 'associate' of Bulger states he's willing to provide information against him. He says, however, he doesn't consider it to be snitching. (We will see other like-minded individuals testify against him as well as their reasons for doing so as the film continues.) We flashback to Boston in the 70's when Bulger was still small-time. We get a sense of his violent ways and how little things can set him off, particularly if he suspects betrayal. We also meet his brother, state senator Billy Bulger, and FBI agent John Connolly who grew up with Whitey. Connolly meets up with the reluctant Whitey and proposes a deal: Whitey will provide information on his competition (the Italian mob) and the FBI will use that to build a case against them. It'll make the FBI look good and Whitey will be rid of his competitors. Connolly manages to convince his superior, McGuire, to try out this idea for a while and Whitey agrees as well, though he (also) emphasizes the 'fact' that what he's doing is not snitching. Things escalate however as Whitey realizes he's got some leeway with the FBI due to his 'informant' status while Connolly gets in way over his head, hanging out with Whitey, covering for him, all the while rationalizing his behavior by emphasizing the long-term advantages of his 'deal' with Whitey.<br/><br/>So, the million dollar question: is this the return of Johnny Depp, the actor? Mostly no, I'd say. While he's not bad, Depp just isn't all that threatening a presence. Compare that to, say, Pesci's performance in Goodfellas or Mikkelsen's turn as Hannibal in the eponymous series. Sure, the makeup is good, but makeup does not a great performance make. Decent? Sure. The Oscar-worthy turn we've been expecting? No.<br/><br/>Depp isn't solely to blame, however. Black Mass, in the end, just isn't about Bulger. He adorns the poster, but the real drama ultimately lies in how the film depicts the controversy around the FBI. The film tries to add some character development to Bulger, but since he's a violent criminal both at the film's opening and closing, it isn't very effective. The film appears more interested in the goings-on at the FBI. Connolly becomes a real sleezebag when he's constantly having to convince a colleague and his superior they're doing the right thing. When McGuire and particularly his next-in-line, Wyshak, call him on his bullshit, it's incredibly satisfying. The moral conundrum of making the deal with Whitey to capture other mobsters despite the controversy it raises. The following protocol versus getting great results question is interesting. Meanwhile, whenever Depp appears (particularly in the film's second half), nothing really happens. Sure, he has someone killed or does the killing himself, makes threats and so on, but the real drama in the end takes place in FBI HQ.<br/><br/>Speaking of drama, whenever the film tries to paint a picture of family life, it falls flat on its ass. This is the kind of film that opens the relationship between Connolly and his wife by having them get ready for a little of the ol' in-out, in-out on the kitchen counter. Yeah, because why spend time showing the bond they share, thus laying the foundation for future tensions, when you can show them getting ready to have sex? It really makes me care for them... The same applies to Whitey and his wife. It feels like these underwritten scenes should counterbalance his tough-guy persona, to show how his family tragedies only made him a better crime boss, but in terms of drama, it's thin.<br/><br/>In the end, Black Mass is a very run-of-the-mill crime drama. It feels like the end result should have been infinitely more compelling than it is. Definitely less than the sum of its parts."

It doesn't provide much of an exact narrative, aside of just following the accounts of Whitey's involvement with this conspiracy. It often feels like it's just selling the fear of this man and not quite a personal depth. We explore his personal life and the people connected with him, but the center of the attention is just the crimes he committed. While it's still ultimately gripping, the movie doesn't lead to any satisfying core whatsoever.<br/><br/>The story is mostly told by Bulger's associates who were interviewed for telling the full information about the activity of the Winter Hill Gang. It's pretty much just documenting the events of what crime and conspiracy that involved Whitey. Sure, there are moments that involves his personal life, but much of the focus is his criminal and informant years. It's just digging into his career rather than his humanity. It's not bad, but we seem to concern more about what a dangerous man he is than knowing him more as a human being. It doesn't have an exact point- of-view either. Despite of being narrated by various witnesses, these spectators aren't the center, either. The FBI are also just rigorous work in narrative detail, doesn't exactly talks about the ethics, it's basically just a sideline from the crimes being committed outside. Otherwise, it's an engrossing study of a dirty plan gone wrong.<br/><br/>The direction is slick, in a classic gangster movie way, breathing into the darkness beneath the exteriors. And everything sure looks stunning. It pictures its gritty setting so well, that the only nitpick you may utter is how over-the-top Johnny Depp's makeup is. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't look awful, but for a movie where everything looks so convincing in its time, that transformation is the only one that takes the contrary. But again, I'm just nitpicking. The acting is also splendid; and while the makeup is a little too much (I'm sorry, I never stop,) it doesn't take away Depp's attempt of humanity towards this role. He is effectively frightening, externally, and cold-blooded, internally, and that's pretty much what we expect for a criminal like this.<br/><br/>Black Mass is terribly straightforward, its aim is basically just displaying what a ruthless criminal Whitey Bulger was, and although we see his personal life, it doesn't get flourish, because this movie is all about uncovering his bad deeds and the FBI letting this man slide. The movie looks beautiful, the atmosphere is, again, quite gritty, and fans might be pleased that its lead actor is not as cartoonish as his cosmetics (I never learn.) But there are crime biopics out there that have better intentions, Black Mass is just a rotten portrait of a once most wanted man. There is no denying that it's a pretty interesting story, especially in cinematic form, but it needs to be more engaging than this."
"naysbaghai","7","1","1","24 October 2015"," A modern day Goodfellas with differences in plot and cast
","I've learned that anticipation can occasionally be the enemy of awareness, a lesson that I discovered while watching Black Mass. As a member of the film nerd mafia, I desperately wanted this film to answer one buzzing question - does Johnny Depp still possess the acting chops he held prior to Pirates of the Caribbean? It doesn't matter if you've seen the movie or not, because the answer is dead obvious: yes.<br/><br/>Depp shines as James ""Whitey"" Bulger (or Jimmy, as we are encouraged to call him), an unpredictable and ice-cold gangster who prowls the waters of the story like a great white shark, manifesting his fearless and violent nature at the sign of any given threat. As he dives into the depths of this real-life Boston gangster, he is completely unrecognisable and genuinely frightening, receiving assistance from the talented makeup artists of this film. While this film is designed as a vehicle for Johnny Depp, the ensemble cast further seduces you to go see the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch and Joel Edgerton morph into their roles as Jimmy's allies, while Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott perfectly suit their roles as detectives from the 70s. It goes without saying that the cast is what drives the power of the film.<br/><br/>The film, however, does suffer from a weak screenplay that fails to maintain the interest it should. While the film had a strong start and established the characters effectively, the second act mysteriously lacked the tension and controlled pacing that was present in the first thirty minutes. While the premise of a gangster who allies with the FBI to strengthen is own power is genuinely interesting, the film reminded me how movies that are ""based on a true story"" should be treated with caution. <br/><br/>The other noteworthy, and perhaps admirable, element of Black Mass is its unapologetic tribute to Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. The intersection between criminal activity, family life and the ever-looming threat of the FBI all tread familiar territory, while the values of integrity, camaraderie and fortitude make the film feel like a modern day Goodfellas with differences in plot and cast. While I might question Black Mass's decision not to use contemporary music, I should remind myself of the never-ending difficulties imposed by music copyright. Although I feel like a bit of a nitpicker, I am happy to crown Black Mass as Johnny Depp's absolution from shoddy filmmaking, even if the story fails to match the depth of its cast."

"DavidStewart57","6","1","1","20 October 2015"," Black Mass
","Black Mass is a straightforward and faithful adaptation of Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neil's book on the infamous Boston gangster, James ""Whitey"" Bulger and his partnership with FBI agent, John Connelly. From 1976 to 1994, Bulger and his Winter Hill gang ruled the streets of South Boston with violent intimidation and Irish charm. As Connelly, a childhood chum of Bulger's, takes the credit for taking down the Italian Mafia, Whitey's criminal enterprise grows along with his psychotic tendencies. As the body count grows, so does the suspicion over how deep Bulger has the FBI in his back pocket.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper does a solid job in diverting from the tropes of the Scorsese-styled gangster flick by presenting Boston's criminal underworld with a composed and chilling style similar to Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle. However, the film does veer off into domestic, eye-rolling melodrama reminiscent of Donnie Brasco. Fortunately, the melodrama is overshadowed by the documentary-styled narrative penned by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth along with the crisp and steady cinematography of Masanobu Takayanagi.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a good and non-glamorous performance as Whitey Bulger. Apart from a stake dinner scene reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's flamboyant gangster in The Departed, Depp shies away from a Gonzo- esque performance as he invokes fear with his piercing blue eyes and rough exterior. Australian actor Joel Edgerton swaggers onto the screen as John Connelly with a mix of bravado and paranoia as the FBI agent who made a deal with the devilish Bulger. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Whiteys brother and state senator who tries to look the other way when his brother is in the newspapers. Rounding up the cast are some memorable performances by Jesse Plemons, Peter Sarsgaard, and Rory Cochrane as Whitey's crew. <br/><br/>For publicity leading up to the film, Warner Bros. made Black Mass look like a cross between Heat and The Town, yet the film is calm and reserved to some extent. Even though there's nothing that really jumps off the screen, the film is a solid piece that combines journalistic inquiry into Boston 's criminal underground."
"bartonj2410","6","1","1","17 October 2015"," Johnny Depp shines in this otherwise flat gangster drama
","My final venture to the London Film Festival this year was to see Black Mass and despite hearing not such positive things, I still had high expectations for this film. Unfortunately, Black Mass ends up being another case of a fantastic performance in a not so fantastic film. <br/><br/>James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp) is regarded as one of the most notorious gangsters in United States history and headed the Irish-American Winter Hill Gang in South Boston for a number of years. <br/><br/>In 1975, Bulger struck a deal with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton); a native of South Boston and friend of Bulger and his brother, Senator William Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), to become an informant for the Bureau. <br/><br/>In return, Bulger wanted the FBI to take down his rivals, the Angiulo Brothers, who were connected to the Mafia and formed direct competition over territory for the Winter Hill Gang. <br/><br/>With the film focusing on one of the most notorious gangsters in U.S. history, Black Mass had the chance to be this generation's Goodfellas. It just doesn't feel as if they took full advantage of that opportunity and at times, Scott Cooper's film feels like a Goodfellas wannabe. Then you realise that nobody does Scorsese quite like Scorsese.<br/><br/>Black Mass feels bloated and at two hours long, ends up dragging towards the end. Lacking the style of other gangster films such as Goodfellas or even Legend from earlier in the year, I was a little relieved when the end credits started to roll. Not that Black Mass is by any means a terrible film, because it isn't and there is still a good film to be seen here.<br/><br/>At the centre of the film is a brilliant performance from Johnny Depp. As Bulger, Depp blows away the cobwebs and delivers a performance that might be one of my favourites of the year so far. Depp's filmography has been rather goofy in more recent years but in Black Mass, he more than makes amends for that. Depp, under a load of prosthetic make-up, is intimidating as the the cold-blooded Bulger.<br/><br/>It's a shame though that the only other actor who raises their game in Black Mass is Joel Edgerton as FBI agent Connolly. Considering the cast that Cooper has at his disposal, the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Corey Stoll and Jesse Plemons all feel underused and it plays a part in holding Black Mass back from being great.<br/><br/>The score from Junkie XL a.k.a. Tom Holkenborg is one of note and shows complete contrast to his score for Mad Max: Fury Road earlier in the year, a sign that he has a future in composing film scores for sure. I also really liked the production design by Stefania Cella, her work really bringing 1975 Boston to life amidst Bulger's criminal activities.<br/><br/>While Black Mass is certainly a return to form for Johnny Depp, I can't help but feel a little disappointed when I think about the film as a whole. But please, Mr Depp, more roles like this in the future would be very welcome."
"jadavix","6","1","1","16 October 2015"," This was okay
","Kind of a mob movie by rote. Every killing is telegraphed and the performances are better than they really should be for such tired material. Take away the contact lenses (or was it CGI?) and I wonder how intense and scary Mr Depp really would've been, though. There is very little involvement from the women in this one, which may be a blessing in disguise since they do the typical thing women do in mob movies - actually, make that almost all movies - and just stand around looking worried and begging their husbands to stop doing the Wrong Thing. Hate to see a little variety from female characters in these things, eh? Would it be too much to ask for some actual characters?"
"jtindahouse","6","1","1","15 October 2015"," Not as crisp as Scorsese could have managed but still entertaining
","'Black Mass' is a fascinating story that falls into the trap of having too much to say and not enough time to say it. The original cut was apparently close to 3 hours but was cut down for pacing reasons. Some films can get away with this, others struggle to. This is the latter. The story feels rushed and clunky. There isn't that patience that the likes of Martin Scorsese bring to the table. There isn't that classic scene (""How am I funny?"") that people will remember and reenact for years to come. There isn't even always an explanation as to why a character has disappeared from the story. Having made this point though - that really is the only problem with an otherwise very fine film.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific across the board. Johnny Depp is obviously the stand-out in the lead role. He's as captivating on screen as always and I suspect he will receive an Oscar nomination when January roles around. The only thing that will hold him back from winning it is a lack of punchy dialogue. Every scene he is in is brilliant but feels too similar to the last one. The rest of the cast are faultless and make every scene very enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's a brutal film with no holding back on the violence whatsoever. Director Scott Cooper, in only his third film at the helm, does an adequate job but I can't help but wonder what someone with the class of Scorsese could have done with this script. It's a solid movie there's no doubt about it, but it won't go down in the history books as a classic which is a shame because the story had the potential to do just that."
"yurielsemail","5","1","1","13 October 2015"," A disappointment
","I was excited when I saw the trailer for the movie, being a Johnny Depp fan. What I got was a bitter disappointment. The movie was long, unoriginal and a bit boring.The characters were two-dimensional, clique and just plain unlikable. I did not relate or care about any of them, including Jimmy's young son and girlfriend. The relationships in the movie were undeveloped and did not evoke any emotions whatsoever. The movie did not bring anything new to the audience. It was like ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Departed"" had a baby. It sounds awesome but it's not. It's dull and has already been seen. I expected much more violence and gore, like the trailer implied, another disappointment I guess. The only good part of the movie, is the reason I watched it. Johnny Depp. Although I don't think his character reached his full potential, he still gave a great performance. His character was unsettling and straight-up creepy. Granted the great special effects and makeup did help, his acting was phenomenal. The only emotion I felt, besides disappointment, was actual fear when he was on screen. Overall, I give this movie 5 stars out of 10, solely on Depp's performance. This is a kind of movie you would watch if nothing else was on."
"KineticSeoul","6","1","1","10 October 2015"," Despite it being fast-paced with lot of violence, it becomes repetitious
","The premise of this is actually quite interesting, especially about how the FBI backed up mobsters that turned informants. In order to wipe out and take down other criminals and in return get protection from the FBI through that process. It being based on a true story gives it more of a momentum. However the way the story plays out, becomes quickly repetitious. And sometimes just didn't flow very well with it's inconsistencies. At it's core it's a fairly simple story, I am sure their is more to the actual truth. But when it comes to the plot of this film, it's a simple story. But it sometimes seemed to drag and felt like it was all over the place at times, because of the pacing. It's a fast paced movie, but still seemed to drag. Unlike some other movies that deal with the criminal undergrounds, this one was difficult to get invested in. It was difficult to care about what was going on. All the actors did a good job and Johnny Depp finally after quite some time got to show off his acting chops. As this silent loose cannon, a ticking time bomb you don't know when he is going to go off. Overall, this is a movie that is worth seeing once if you like mafia and crime movies. But it's forgettable and you probably won't view it twice.<br/><br/>6/10"
"autisticreviewers","6","1","1","8 October 2015"," If it wasn't for Depp this movie would have flopped big time!
","Me and Nick were really excited to see this movie! It looked like it had something really unique to offer! And on the plus side, it had Johnny Depp, so what could go so wrong? Sadly, A lot went wrong! The script is just horribly written. It tries too hard to be Goodfellas. Example, it had non stop swearing in it, the stylized violence was the same, and they do it with narration. All the characters are so unlikeable. They all just swear and insult each other, both the gangsters and the cops. There were was just so intelligence put into it at all.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper (who also did Crazy Heart) did an okay job, but I felt at times he just did not know what he was doing. The cinematography was decent, but again, felt extremely rushed.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch, especially by Johnny Depp who plays gangster/criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger. Depp brought so much to this man who he is impersonating. He is both creepy and unpredictable. However, he is also a family man and a gentlemen to the ladies! One scene that was just pure brilliant was when everybody was gathered around the dinner table and a subject of steak turns into a huge, creepy, I am going to kill you scene. That scene truly was the best, because it was showing just how much of a psychopath James 'Whitey' Bulger really was, and sadly it didn't explore it enough! There was just no character development! Overall, Johnny Depp will at least get another Oscar nomination, and hopefully he will win, because this is definitely his best performance and he just shows us that he does not care what we think of him and goes ahead and plays whoever he wants and shows us his true talents! Overall, is it watchable. It is not horrible. But see it for Johnny Depp's performance. He is just brilliant! 6/10."

","""If nobody sees it, it didn't happen."" James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Depp) controls Boston. He runs the most powerful mob in the city and his brother is a powerful state Senator. When he is approached by John Connolly (Edgerton) with an offer of an alliance with the FBI he thinks of it as a business deal. Now, free to do anything he wants, with the protection of the FBI, Bulger rises not only in the mafia power structure, but also to the 2nd most wanted man in the country, behind Osama Bin Laden. This is a movie I was really excited to watch. I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan but the mafia genre is my favorite. About 20 min in I have to say that I was very impressed with Depp and I think this is the best acting I have ever seen him do. For an actor like Depp to disappear totally into a character is difficult to do, but he pulled it off. The contacts helped, but his expressions and actions were unlike anything he has ever done, to the point of it being disturbing. I love all mafia shows but unlike the majority of them (Sopranos, Godfather, Goodfellas) this one makes you root against the main character. Overall, one of the best movies of this type to come out if a very long time. I wouldn't put this on the same level as Godfather or Goodfellas, but I would put it alongside Donnie Brasco and Casino. Not quite as good as The Departed (Nicholson's character was based on Bulger) but it's not too far behind. I really liked this. I give this an A-."
"shadowyx12","7","4","9","23 September 2015"," It was a decent film, but there could have been so much more to it.
","Aside from the brilliant performance given by Johnny Depp, I actually expected many more aspects of this film to be just as excellent. Scott Cooper and his team of screenwriters knew they could have done anything they wanted with the material at hand, but their efforts can only be described as 'decent' at best. Half the time, I felt like I was watching separate segments of a miniseries edited together than a movie with a naturally flowing narrative. Each time a sequence - which is equal to an important event within Whitey Bulger's life - fades to black, the film jumps across a considerable amount of time (usually years) before focusing on the next important event in his life. This same structure can be also found in the film 'Goodfellas', but the only difference is, that film is better paced, and as a result, has a story that feels more coherent and whole.<br/><br/>I also felt that most of the ensemble cast was wasted. Many of the supporting actors are fantastic in their roles, but their screen- time is limited to such a degree that they barely leave any sort of impression on you. It may be easy to say that Depp's performance overshadowed everyone else's, but that doesn't explain why the film cycles through most of its characters without going into much (or any) detail of their lives.<br/><br/>Yet for some reason, the film still feels like it tries to squeeze too much into its runtime. There were times I had trouble trying to follow the plot all because I couldn't keep track of the sheer number of cardboard characters that were seemingly appearing from out of nowhere. That said, 'Black Mass' would have worked much better if had been adapted as a ten-part miniseries than a two-hour film. At least that way, the book would have received the justice it truly deserved."

"PWNYCNY","8","5","13","25 September 2015"," Intense movie.
","Why is this not a great movie? The movie plays up the wrong character. It should have played up Connolly instead of Bulger. That Connolly became corrupted is actually what this movie is about. Connolly is a detestable character. At any given moment, there are people in society committing crimes, some relatively minor and others far more serious. That's a given. Their actions have been depicted in so many movies and television shows that it is no longer novel. But an FBI agent becoming corrupted? That's a completely different, and far more dramatic, story. When that happens, the entire country is placed at risk. The FBI is supposed to be the bastion of law, the country's protector against those who pose a threat to public safety, and when that deterrent gets compromised, as happens in this movie ‚Äì well, the social and political implications should be the story. The movie touches on the subject but does not develop it further, instead choosing to showcase Bulger's violence, which is depicted repeatedly and graphically throughout the movie. That the FBI provides cover for an entire criminal syndicate is alluded to but remains undeveloped. Nevertheless, this movie is good. The story is intense. The acting is powerful, and the movie grabs the audience's attention. Johnny Depp does an excellent job portraying a psychopathic killer. The performances of the rest of the cast is equally excellent, especially that of Joel Edgerton as the corrupted FBI agent."
"Screen_Blitz","8","5","13","20 September 2015"," Gripping biopic complete with an outstanding performance by Johnny Depp
","In the height of Oscar Season, Johnny Depp brings what might be his most outstanding performance of his career in this biopic drama of the one of America's most notorious gangsters in history. Depp plays James ""Whitey"" Bulger, an Irish mob boss in South Boston in the 70s and 80s, who stops at nothing to take down a group of Italian mafias that wreak havoc in this town. His violent duty leads him into jeopardy when he becomes a prime target of the FBI, with no one to trust but his childhood friend John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton) who becomes a prime figure in the FBI. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, his younger brother who works as the state senator. This film also features of the likeness of Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgood, Jesse Plemens, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, and David Harbour. This is directed by Scott Cooper who did Crazy Hear (2009 and Out of The Furnace (2013).<br/><br/>To be honest, this film does not rise in the level of Martin Scorsese's works such as Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), and The Departed (2006), it certainly has the feel of a classic mafia crime- drama film. The movie does its best on giving a gritty and violent portrayal of the gangster life as well as criminal underworld in Boston, similar to what Martin Scorsese showed in The Departed. James Bulger is shown be very violent and unflinchingly ruthless as he murders a large number of people, whether it is from shooting, torturing, or strangling. Nearly everything he does in this movie is unpredictable and shocking. There are many scenes with him that shocked me to the core, then other scenes that left me at the edge of my seat. Bulger is very powerful and mind-blowing character bringing a grim atmosphere to the story, and Johnny Depp is definitely brings him to life. Depp does a fantastic job at adding suspense and chills in this character, and he makes him so believable. I did, however, find the makeup done on his character to be somewhat distracting. While it does make almost unrecognizable, it certainly didn't take away from the outstanding performance he delivers. Joel Edgerton, who plays John Connolly also brings an terrific performance as Bulger's childhood friend who hides the secret of his dirty work. Another great aspect of the film is how it runs at a steady pace and always keeps the story alive, even when the pacing seems to slow down. <br/><br/>Black Mass is certainly isn't a groundbreaking picture for the crime genre, but it is a movie that definitely deserves the attention of many. Johnny Depp's performance is fantastic and has a strong possibility of landing him an Oscar nomination. I believe this film will land several Oscar nomination including Best Picture."
"Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer","8","5","13","19 September 2015"," More like Disgusting, Ugy, Festering Mass
","Black Mass is directed by Scott Cooper and is written by Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk. It stars Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Rory Cochrane, and Benedict Cumberbatch along with Dakota Johnson, and Kevin Bacon.<br/><br/>Black Mass the true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.<br/><br/>What would happen if you mixed Good Fellas, Wolf of Wall Street, Casino and the Departed minus Scorsese plus a non-linear format?- Black Mass.<br/><br/>Black Mass has quite a few strengths under its belt to justify quite a few of the flaws it garners. For one the direction is rock solid. With some inventive shots that I've never seen used in a Gangster flick. For example in the first 30 minutes the camera is placed on the trunk hood of a car, in just the right angle to hide the faces but show the actions of Bulger's gang. Too add on to the direction was a good script that got a ton of support. <br/><br/>But, by far the greatest asset of the movie is its performances. This has got to be the greatest screen ensemble cast of year by a long shot. Everyone was absolutely brilliant. There wasn't a single bad performance in the entire movie. <br/><br/>The best of these is clearly Johnny Depp. He was perfectly cast. Meeting Ian McClellan in brilliance, Depp has become one of the head runners for best actor. He was subtle at times and volatile at others. He portrayed the smarts and nefariousness of the character masterfully and deserves more than some praise for it. He was nuanced to the point in which I thought I was watching a real Gangster at work. From the quite grin that meant lights out to the mournful tears Depp deserves the Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton Was brilliant as well giving a an understated but slippery performance as the infamous F.B.I. agent, John Connolly, who helped Bulger get out of a lot of misdeeds. Along with Edgerton was a beautiful performance by Cumberbatch who through subtle implications showed the audience he was as corrupt as the rest of the bunch. Rory Cochrane gives it his all to portray a sympathetic mobster and largely succeeds. This very well may be his best performance to date. Even side characters like Kevin Bacon and Dakota Johnson give it their all to make their characters as believable as possible.<br/><br/>With all that said I did have ONE major problem with the movie, the non-linear format. I feel that all gangster and con movies should be told in some kind of Chronological order to show the audience the full picture and keep the attention to the central plot. The format in this movie is very if-fie most of the times. Through interviews they successfully make the movie feel like a documentary which is a a good thing and a bad thing. These said Interviews either make the things that Bulger do too small to be noted or inflate them to unbelievably degrees therefore splitting the audiences interest and making the movie duller than it really is.<br/><br/>With Stellar acting, Great Directing, and Good writing Black Mass is one twisted ride but one I recommend taking. Black Mass Gets an A- or an 8/10."
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","10","21 September 2015"," Black Mass was nightmarish. It took the gangster genre to the depths of insanity. A great powerful movie. I love this movie!
","This true crime drama makes for a very well-rounded film. Black Mass shows what happens when you make a pact with the Devil. Directed by Scott Cooper & based on the 2001 non-fiction book, Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob, by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. The film tells the true story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp), one of most notorious gangster in American history -- and his relationship with FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as an informant for the FBI. Can John Connolly control Bulger or will Bulger gain the upper hand? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, I like seeing, the manipulation of the FBI as a means to eradicate crime rivals for control of the Boston underworld. It made for an interesting intense watch. Lots of brutal action, throughout the film. Not for the weak hearted. Johnny Depp is just wicked good as Whitney Bulger. As much, as his make-up work is somewhat distracting, I like how Johnny Depp was able to show a lot of range of emotions with this character. Any other person would probably, play this crucial role, a little way cheesy; with over the top, stereotypical one-dimensional evil, acting. While, the film doesn't shy away from showing Whitey's evil sins, I like how Depp was able to show Bulger's more human side, with the material, given to him. Scenes with his mother, wife & kids, were really necessary to show, that there is a real person, within the criminal mythic. You really do feel a lot of emotional, through his performance. You feel the heartbreak, when the family man side of him, really dies. Don't fear, the movie wasn't going to romanticize him, so needn't worry. It was just nice to see, a bit of that. Scott Cooper was able to show, also Bulger's more Machiavellian side. This movie shows that James Whitney Bulger could teach Satan some new tricks. I just wish, the movie establish more of a connection with his younger brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) & him. I really didn't see, much conflict or stalks, between them. Anyways, Benedict Cumberbatch still, did a great role, even if it was short-lived. Sadly, John Connolly felt more like his brother, than Billy was, in the movie. Edgerton and Depp play wonderfully off each other. Connolly was a great character study that really show, how heroes, can easily be corrupt, when they want power. He has the most tragic of fates. Joel Edgerton is wonderful in this role. Also, his Boston accent, pretty damn shot on. The rest of the actors were pretty alright for the most part. I just didn't like how, some of them, are always being typecast. Good examples are Juno Temple as the prostitution, Deborah Hussey & Jesse Plemons as the criminal, Kevin Weeks. I kinda want them to step up, their game. The best of the minor supporting actors, had to be Kevin Bacon as Charles McGuire. While, his character is a composite of several Boston FBI bosses, he had some of the best harsh verbal exchanges. It was fun, watching him, play off, with Edgerton's character. I'm glad, they cut Sienna Miller as Catherine Grieg from the film, because her scenes weren't really needed. I'm also, glad, they didn't show, too much of senior-citizen, Whitney Bugler, because, the makeup work for age 40's Bugler is outrageous, enough. I glad, they kept, most of the film in the late 1970s/early 1980s. It would be, way too jarring for the film to have longer scenes in 1995 or 2011. For the most part, the movie is pretty accuracy historically. There are few things, worth nitpicking, like not going into much details of how Bulger was able to escape, how he was capture, and how his criminal operation works. Another thing, the movie didn't explain, is why certain people were kill off. I had to do, research on my own, to figure out, who and why John Callahan (Bill Camp) had a hit on him. The movie could had, been better if only the movie dug deeper. I wish, the movie would mention more of Bulger's LSD testing days, the Killeen-Mullen War, or even the Lady of the Dunes rumors. Still, the movie does have good pacing for what it is. I was never bored. While, the movie is grim. It does have some semi-funny moments with its strong language and mean-spirited comments. Some critics have accuse the movie, for trying too hard to be, like 1990's GoodFellas, but I rarely see any similarities, besides the dinner table scene. It didn't borrow, much of anything from Goodfellas. This movie is way more intense and scary than any of Martin Scorsese's gangster films. If any, Scorsese's 2006 film The Departed borrow, way too heavy on Bulger's exploits. While, yes, the plot of the movie is adapted from the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, but you can clearly see many similarities to that film with this. Overall: This gripping and unique crime drama about the duality of undercover work, works. A must-watch. I do recommended."

","This is mayhaps the first film I have seen THIS YEAR with a cast that brought the project from a poor-old clich√©-thing to ann instant success!<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, of course, IS over-rated, but plays well for himself in this film; taking the roll of Jimmy ""Whitey"" Bulger, a crazed, killing mobster back in the middle 1970s. The story follows mainly from his point of view; // making arrangements with his brother, Billy Bulger (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), who is a trusted governmental worker.<br/><br/>It is until an old, childhood friend of theirs, John Connolly (Joel Edgarton), who works for the law, tries to reconnect with Jimmy who is a very cautious recluse; only hangs around with a small amount of friends; people he can trust. He makes a deal with the mobster where he will give away certain high-rollers so that the federal bureau and Bulger's crew can work together and keep each other from getting exposed.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me very much in the style of Martin Scorsese sort of. I mean rooting for the bad guy (Depp) who you love to hate, seems already covered enough in the cinema-world. But none-the-less I really enjoyed this flick. Even though, it was more about the Irish-Americans rather than my Italian-Americans, it was still action- filled and had badass dialogue throughout the who film.<br/><br/>If you guys read my reviews, you would know that I am one who is not about ""action"" in movies, but Black Mass did everything so subtly, and unexacting. I have a real positive experience."

In terms of style and direction, it feels a lot like American Gangster with shades of Donnie Brasco.

His portrayal of Whitey is downright scary and deserves an Oscar.<br/><br/>Now, I've got to say the critical reviews below are ridiculous. I'm reading comments like this movie doesn't bring anything new to the genre of gangster movies. By that logic no movies should have been made after The Godfather or The Goodfellas. This is a true story about Irish gangsters in Boston who colluded with the FBI during the 1970s and 80s. These are scary, unlikable people -- you know, like cold blooded killers actually are.

There's no surprises, no plot twists, and not even much in the way of new information throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Whitey Bulger is a really bad guy and he has some really bad friends as well. There's lots of typical gangland violence, lots of ratting out one's buddies, plea bargaining, and psychopathic personalities and ""Goodfellas"" ripoffs, and only about 20 minutes or so of actual story to tell.<br/><br/>Not awful, just not a lot there."

","Would you write a love story without love? An action movie without action?<br/><br/>Then why do a film about a gangster without crime? Yet this is what Black Mass is. You might see a few murders being committed, but you never see what makes Whitey Bulger a gangster. You never understand what caused him to become one, or how he subsists. A few passing references to vending machines, some nonsense about the street value of loyalty (repeated about 20 times in case you didn't get it the first time) but nothing about the organised crime gang he leads, how its income is generated, the system behind it, its hierarchy. <br/><br/>The classics of this genre all adhered to this principle: show the crime, show the system. Casino, Goodfellas, The Departed, Scarface. What's good enough for them ought to be good enough for Black Mass, which strangely departs from the principle and offers nothing in exchange.<br/><br/>What's left is a disappointing mixture of characters and plots that fail to deliver any dramatic tension. In this context, the mis- casting of Cumberbatch and Bacon is even more blatant ‚Äì but none is worse than that of Depp. He is not terrifying at all and his make-up is a constant distraction.

","The film tells the true story of Whitey Bulger, and there are various strands of it which could have been the focus of that story (his links to his Senator Brother, links to the IRA, etc) , but the one chosen is his partnership with the FBI. This reveals the murky nature of the FBI at that time in which his agent handler is more concerned with using Whitey to further his own career, protecting him as a source, rather than using Whitey as an informant to bring down the Italian Mafia. This is because they grew up togethor. The inter-relationships are sketched out more as politics, and business, rather than personal, and whilst engaging, the lack of that personal element is what keeps this film as a steady film, rather than an outstanding one, despite some excellent acting, and period style."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Black Mass<br/><br/>Depp gives a tour de force performance that reminds you why he was so much fun to watch in the first place. He shows us different sides of Bulger. We see the tender father, the loving son, the loyal friend and brother. But of course we see the cold, violent, psychopathic gangster. Depp's portrayal is by far the best thing he has done for years. Truthfully I expected an Oscar nomination, but it never came. <br/><br/>All the support cast is excellent; especially Joel Edgerton and Benedict Cumberbatch. Also look out for Juno Temple in a scene stealing sequence that begins outside a police station and ends in a deserted house. That's stayed with me, long after the movie ended. Peter Sarsgaardalso has some memorable scenes and I always like to see Kevin Bacon in a movie. <br/><br/>As good as the performances are, I don't love the movie. It's good to watch, but its not got much rewatchability. I don't like gangster/mobster movies in general anyway!! But I can still enjoy a great one. There are no heroes in this one, certainly no-one to root for (No Elliot Ness in Untouchables) except maybe incoming prosecutor Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), who begins the clean up at the FBI. The story is fascinating, although I wish it were done better. <br/><br/>Black Mass grossed $62 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 49th highest grossing movie of 2015. Which is pretty much on par with a movie starring Depp in his pre Captain Jack Sparrow days."

","James ""Whitey"" Bulger ran South Boston's crime scene with an iron fist in the 1970s and 1980s, but for a good part of his reign of terror he harbored quite a secret ‚Äì he was actually an informant for the FBI. In particular, he was an informant for Agent John Connolly ‚Äì although the usefulness of Bulger's intel was often in dispute ‚Äì all the while continuing his violent rampage over the city against anyone who would stand in his way.<br/><br/>The ruthless Bulger is played in Black Mass by Johnny Depp, an actor not really among the first who come to mind when the character of a crime lord is brought up. Depp has long been known for looking the part in each of his disparate roles and avoiding typecasting. But in Black Mass, even though he doesn't look like an Irish mobster ‚Äì he completely embodies one. It's really his finest work, and that's saying something.<br/><br/>The movie is told in flashback, as a member of Bulger's inner circle recounts the whole sordid deal to another FBI agent, including the involvement of Connolly (Joel Edgerton) as well as Bulger's brother, state senator Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). The brutality of Bulger's day-to-day existence isn't tempered; men and women are killed or maimed or harassed for seemingly benign reasons. There seemed to be no middle ground for Bulger. He liked you, you lived. He didn't, you didn't. The movie covers his feud against his Italian rivals in Boston, the Angiulo family, as well as his foray into the high-stakes world of betting on jai-alai in Miami. And how did Bulger get away with so much? Mostly through the protection of Connolly, who used Bulger's (scant) information to further his own career. Crooks protecting crooks. The rabbit hole is deep indeed.<br/><br/>But man, is Depp ever great. I stopped thinking of him as Johnny Depp soon after the movie began. It's funny ‚Äì to look at Bulger in this movie, you probably wouldn't take him for a mob guy. He's wiry, he's balding, he wears glasses. Nothing tough leaps out at you. But the ferocity of Depp's exceptional performance puts that notion to rest. Cumberbatch, as his brother and fellow Boston native, is also very good and with a surprisingly believable accent. Kevin Bacon shows up as an FBI guy; I think this was his third go-around as a Boston-based law-enforcement officer."

","I personally am not aware that much of the real life Whitey Bugler, so can't really vouch for the authenticity or how true it is to the actual story.<br/><br/>As a movie buff, I liked the movie, though it had a strong hangover of Goodfellas, Departed and Donnie Brasco. The movie though not in the league of these gangster classics, is still pretty much a good effort. One of the prime reasons is Johnny Depp, in the main role. Personally, am a big fan of Depp, but of late most of his performances have not really required him to do much, except to wear masks, or wigs and act funny. After quite some time, good to see him in a role that does not require him to clown around( notwithstanding the fake looking prosthetics). As a vicious, pyscopathic gangster he is brilliant, radiating menace, with his presence, a flick of the eye, or his measured way of speaking. Apart from the fact that Bulger seems to care for his son, there is not much that is redeeming about him. He is selfish and opportunistic, he plays along with his friend John Conolly( Joel Edgerton) a Fed agent, promising to help him out, but in reality uses him for his own selfish ends. He is ruthless, and pyscopathic to a level, where he gets rid of people, at the slighest suspicion. Matter of fact, he is the guy who does not even trust his own shadow.<br/><br/>The movie at one level runs as a morality play too, on the dangers of setting a thief to catch a thief. Conolly tries to use Whitey to get to the Mafia, by using him as an informant. However Whitey turns the tables on him, by providing him basically with junk information, and uses it as a cover to get his own with the rival Anguilo gang. In a sense, Conolly causes his own downfall, by getting too cozy with Bugler, maybe it could have been due to his childhood friendship with him. At one level, it could also have been a traditional Irish-Italian rivalry in 70's Boston. Was Conolly soft on Bugler, due to the Irish factor, as well as the community feeling? And what exactly was the relationship between the Irish mob and the IRA? This is where I feel, Black Mass falters somewhat, the performances are good, the scenes are well written, but director Scott Cooper, just tries to pack in everything, without really delving deep. The movie looks more like a montage of elements from earlier gangster movies, dinner table talks where hints are dropped, the brutal in your face violence, the liberal usage of the F-word, the protagonist going into a downward spiral and pulling others along. And the scenes are pretty good too, one particularly good one, where Bugler has a dinner talk with Conolly and his associate Morris, where he almost threatens Morris into fear and then does not. Or the scenes between Whitey and his brother Billy( Benedict Cumberbatch) a senator.<br/><br/>But the rivalry between Bugler and the Anguilo brothers is treated in a pretty sketchy manner. This is an area where so much could have been explored, especially the Irish vs Italian angle, but director Cooper just gives it a very cursory glance. Again the link between Bugler and the IRA is not explored in depth, we really do not know what motivates him to help them out. And due to this, it just remains a middlingly good movie, instead of a classic.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good, apart from Depp, one more great turn is by Joel Edgerton, as the FBI agent who makes a pact with the Devil himself. Benedict Cumberbatch is however wasted in a role that really does not do much justice to his talent."

","Joel Edgerton as usual stepped in front of the camera, and did damage. He is an impressive actor, and is always wonderful to watch. Cumberbatch is always looking to stretch himself somehow, challenge himself as a true artist, and again, thumbs up. An Englishman who pulled off an Irish American accent pretty well, from what I could hear.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing to watch. I'm not really drawn to any of his movies, or the type of roles he plays, so seeing him in something this different, and executing it so well, was a joy to witness.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, especially Jesse Plemons, were also pretty good. However, as good of a performances as every one of the actors achieved, Black Mass feels like a squandered classic. It lacked a certain extra, or necessary thrill, and much of the movie feels a bit too, forgettable.<br/><br/>Black Mass is by no means a bad movie at all, it just, wasn't as good as it was perhaps meant to be. What carried it however, is something that should be a major contributor in any film, and that is the cast. The cast was just, noteworthy.<br/><br/>I would seriously love to give Black Mass a 7/10, but, honestly, it falls a little short because, things are missing in it, and ultimately the film feels like something we've really seen many times before. So, 6.7/10, that I'll reluctantly round up to 7/10."

","Johnny Depp movies are hit or miss. This one is a line up the middle for a base hit. Nothing was really spectacular about the movie, but then again, there wasn't much that hurt the movie too much either. Stick around and see what I really thing.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Based on a true story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, an Irish Mob godfather and FBI informant who had a ""secret trading"" deal with his brother, William ""Billy"" Bulger, a state senator and a Boston public figure, and John Connolly, an FBI agent. They planned to take down the Italian mob and mafia in Boston, which went awry and things turned massively violent. When the credence for each other began fading out, drug dealing, murders, and extortion started to rise, and forced the FBI's Boston office to confirm that Whitey Bulger was one of the most notorious criminals in US history and also one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals. Starring: Johnny Depp Joel Edgerton Director: Scott Cooper<br/><br/>First off, let's get the one thing out of the way that hurt the movie the most. Yes, this is a movie about the entirety of Whitey ""working"" with the FBI. Yes, everyone knows everything that Whitey said was completely false or was fabricated from older reports that lasted from the seventies into the nineties. At least let us know when you change time eras though. They did a couple of times, but for the most part they didn't let us know. I had to look at the clothing, cars, and various other objects to try to figure out when in time the movie was happening. Don't make people guess as to what is going on unless it is a strong mystery. If it is a true story, let people know when things are happening.<br/><br/>The good things of the movie, other than the story which I won't go into, are the actors. Every single person was the right person for the job. The only thing I didn't like was that the age difference between Johnny playing Whitey and Dakota Johnson playing his was completely wrong. I know he used to be married to a woman that is the same age as Dakota, but still. There are better actresses for that type of thing. And I know it's nitpicking, but so what. It's how I feel.<br/><br/>Keeping with the actors, Joel Edgerton is a chameleon when it comes to acting. He can do it all it seems. Has this guy ever made a bad movie? I don't think so. He is just that amazing.<br/><br/>I never heard of Scott Cooper before I saw this movie. When I looked him up, it seemed I have seen a few movies of his, but nothing that stood out. Same goes for this movie. It is just there.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: If you have seen other crime movies that take place in Boston you have them all. Even though this is a true story, it seems that all the crime movies based in Boston take from the Whitey Bulger story. I'm thinking that is why I was not impressed with this movie. Still watchable though.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"

If you can watch this for what it is (based on a real person) and can imagine Johnny Depp in something different than Captain Jack (some argue that's all he does or is able to do right now, which I beg to differ), than you will able to enjoy this.<br/><br/>It's crime and that also has to be something you want to watch.

Now I'm not going to put it up there with the likes of ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" but it was good. I wasn't disappointed, but I will say this, if Martin Scorsese had put his magical touch to this film it would have been better. Johnny Depp put on a nice performance as James 'Whitey' Bulger, almost Oscar worthy, as with Joel Edgerton, who played the role of John Connolly. The only problem I had with this film was Johnny Depp's make up. To me the attempt to make him look like James 'Whitey' Bulger only ended up looking ""Bad Grampa""ish. That really didn't take away from the film but it must have been pretty obvious if my wife noticed it being that she doesn't take movies as serious as I do. ""Black Mass"" is a film about James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp), a violent gangster who becomes an FBI informant in order to take down a Mafia family who is disrupting his criminal activities and at the same time involving John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), an FBI agent. I heard of James 'Whitey' Bulger from documentaries and stories after he got caught. If he was anything like the character Johnny Depp portrayed in this film he should be locked up forever!

","I think some of the negative reviews comparing Black Mass to classics like Goodfellas are being a little unfair.<br/><br/>Classics like The Godfather have already expertly dealt with the lure of power and how it ultimately corrupts, whilst Black Mass isn't in that kind of league, it does offer a fresh perspective.<br/><br/>Depp's character is facilitated by FBI agents, who use him to take down other crime syndicates, whilst turning a blind eye to his dealings. This idea that they created their own monster, believing that the end justifies the means, is an interesting theme, not really explored too much in this genre. Recently, The Departed touched on similar ground, with Jack Nicholson's character actually being inspired by the real-life Whitey Bulger, but Black Mass gives us the full story.<br/><br/>Depp gives a great performance as Whitey, all too often he's dismissed lately as a 'gimmicky' actor, but once again he proves he can deliver in a grown-up movie.

There were many opportunities to develop deep empathy and emotional ties to John Conley, Billy Bulger, and Steve Flemmi. But the writers or film makers just provide a superficial glimpse into their internal conflicts and flaws, and never develop them enough to build a relationship with the audience. The writers also never explore any kind of background on what made Whitey Bulger, Whitey Bulger. He's just a mean criminal thug, and that's it. And it's not for lack of circumstance. South Bronx, brother of a senator, friend of an FBI agent... This could have been so good. Johnny Depp and the make up artists on the other hand deserve Oscar nods or statues. I'd forgotten how good of an actor Johnny Depp was when he's not playing a feminized drunken pirate in every movie even when it's not Pirates of the Caribbean. I forgot this was Johnny Depp so many times, and just some unlikable middle aged Irish thug. Depp's acting and the makeup artists were amazing. Completely believable. But not enough to make this more than an interesting documentary. Oh well. Entertaining enough for streaming, but not for $11 tickets or blu-ray purchase."

","Johnny Depp will forever be one of my favorite actors. I have always been blown away with how he can completely disappear into characters, bringing to life some of the most eccentric, vibrant characters that cinema has seen in quite some time. However, a recent string of disheartening duds left me doubting Depp's acting prowess as he continues aging (I mean, Mortdecai? Seriously?) However, Depp's turn as the murderous Whitey Bulger might possibly be the finest performance of his illustrious career. I forgot that I was watching Johnny Depp once the movie got going, instead focusing on Whitey Bulger himself menacing from the other side of the screen. The best performances are ones that help you see characters, not actors in makeup or wigs. However, the problem with Black Mass as a whole was that aside from Depp's wonderful portrayal of Bulger, there wasn't much here to entertain. The other performances were either unremarkable (Edgerton, Johnson) or too brief to be of any consequence in judging the film (Scott, Harbour, Stoll, Bacon). The story was solid, but at the end of the day, it's simply something that we've seen countless times before. Thus, I recommend at least one watch to see the best performance that Johnny Depp has ever graced us with. The rest you can judge for yourself."

","I've only ever seen Johnny Depp in two roles where I believed he was brilliant. And this is one of them, the other being Captain Jack Sparrow from the first pirates movie. Being in a lot of Tim Burton flicks and occasionally popping up in other things now and then it seemed like Depp needed to find a new voice and I believe he found it here. To be fair I haven't seen many recent films of his but this one truly stands out from the ones I have seen. This is his best film in long while and I wont be surprised if he is nominated for the academy award for it. He gave atmosphere in every scene he was in and gave a less is more performance which worked really well. There are a couple of scenes in particular where it felt like he truly knew who he was playing. He definitely is the reason to see this film <br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, it is pretty decent but not great. Everyone plays their parts well such as Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger and Joel Edgerton as John Connolly. No one seems Miscast for the film. Apart from the performances I cant really think of much more reason to watch the movie. The biggest problem this movie has is that the story (being of true events) seems to be more a template for a character study of James whitey Bulger (Depp). Everything seems brushed over which doesn't give a movie like this justice, especially since this is a movie based on a true story. <br/><br/>The violence is shown in a very gritty and realistic way, and gives it more of a stylised look rather than the other exploitive representation in a lot of gangster movies. The film was shot really nice and a few of the scenes were really nicely composed, it all looked smooth and I saw no issues. The biggest problem is the story as it isn't very informative and really focuses mainly on the main character. If you want to see a character study of a dangerous criminal, then you may enjoy this. Its no Goodfellas but its not a terrible gangster film."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>The true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger, who, in 1970s Boston, quickly rose through the ranks to become the most feared gangster on the scene...with some assistance from the FBI. Bulger's Winter Hill mob are claiming their territory, much to the annoyance of their rivals, who are sure to have them wiped out. But FBI Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who grew up on the same streets as Bulger and his lawyer brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch), but took a rapidly different path, spots a chance to take care of Bulger's adversaries for him, by having him become an FBI informant. However, he underestimates the man's capacity for acquiring power, and before long finds his world crumbling down around him.<br/><br/>It would seem rival gangsters controlling various territories in towns and cities across America was pretty much par for the course for most of the twentieth century, if the depiction on numerous films is to be believed, but the ones that make for the best viewing are the ones that make fact seem stranger than fiction. Out of the Furnace director Scott Cooper has dug this promising but not entirely delivering offering out of the mire. Introducing us to a character in the world we've probably never heard of, but whose exploits were so fantastical it's amazing we didn't, it's too well made to be absolutely awful, but it's faults still make it well less than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>While many haven't raved about the film, they have had a lot of praise for Depp's lead performance, but personally I felt it lacked true conviction, and failed to really unnerve me or come off as cold or calculated as Denzel Washington in American Gangster, or even Michael Shannon in The Iceman. It maybe got a little chillier toward the end, after he's killed a ridiculous amount of people, but on the whole nothing that great, despite the impressive lizard face transformation. A bit more impressive is actually Cumberbatch, who just owns his role a little more and manages a fine Boston accent, while Rick Astley alike Edgerton functions fine as the guy on the right side of the law.<br/><br/>The film has an interesting and complex story to tell, but in all honesty it tries to cram too much in, and it ends up becoming laborious, poorly paced and, as a result, unengaging. While its fine points cannot be ignored, it comes off as a serviceable film rather than a great one. ***"

","Black mass is a good film, unfortunately it could have been great. There's tons of great material to achieve an unforgettable film, but watching black mass is like watching a brand new top of the line airplane that can reach altitudes like no other yet it still only flies cruise altitude. It looks great, but never leaves that level to achieve something that could blow minds. <br/><br/>It is highly entertaining, thrilling, interesting, and it grabs you, but you cant shake that feeling that its missing something, and this is more apparent when the film ends, because it just seems to go by and end in the exactly same level it began rather that achieving a crescendo that would end with a bang. But sadly no. It's easy to resume what the movie is missing to one word: energy. It needed an adrenaline shot. No let me rephrase, two words; Martin Scorsese! He would have done amazing things with this, that is what this film really needed. <br/><br/>The cast is by far the best thing, and this is one of those films, that while, once again, good, it all comes down to the ensemble cast. I think that the academy will have a huge day with this film in the acting categories, because every actor/actress gives an enormous performance. There's two huge main performances, Joel Edgerton, that deserves a supporting nomination, and of course the grandest of them all, the return to form, Johny Depp. This is a leading actor winner right from the first frame with him. And if you really want to resume things, this film is Johny Depp. <br/><br/>The production values are great, but the score could, like the film overall, be more energetic. <br/><br/>Jimmy White Bulger is very easily one of the grandest real life villains of all time, a terrifying person that can put on a smile and say everything is alright in a second and kill you in the worst way possible in the next. The greatest moments of the film is when he kills someone, because each death is more terrifying than the previous and with each death you get to know more of the killer. <br/><br/>And while we see plenty of crime, we never really see what seems to be the best parts of the story, we should have seen more of what this gangs really does, where the money comes from. But all we seem to see is the backstage of one of the biggest crime reigns in America. And this weakens the film a lot, because the story loses some light for not showing what the fuss is all about. You hear he is one of biggest crime lords of all time, that Boston has crime at every corner thanks to him, but you never can quite see this.<br/><br/>In the end this could have been a huge film. There's material for it, because the story is epic. But it doesn't bring anything new, it just is what it is, a common good film, with a grander than life performances."

","The title of Scott Cooper's effective, violent and atmospheric crime drama Black Mass has several meanings. The first is a reference to the Irish-Catholic values of the film's real life subject, the gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, whose violent actions in South Boston from the 1970s to the 1990s were a terrifying contradiction of his religious upbringing. The second meaning is a scientific and philosophical viewpoint, reflecting how matter or mass can never entirely disappear but becomes invisible to the human eye. Invisibility was imperative for Whitey because according to the film, his attitude was that if no one witnessed a crime, particularly a murder, it never happened. The merciless brutality of Whitey is embodied by Johnny Depp, whose wicked performance and hideous transformation ignites a desperate victory for this once inventive character actor. He is matched by a colourful turn from Australian actor Joel Edgerton, who plays self-interested FBI agent John Connolly, a childhood friend of Whitey. Connolly represents another form of darkness. Money and status encourage him to sweep away the devil's crimes, meaning Black Mass is a film that draws from the Old Testament, warning us about how people of power and status succumb to life's temptations. The two lead actors and the complexity of their involvement to each other carried my interest almost entirely throughout an untidy but compelling and gruesome crime opera."

","This is my second review on Black Mass. After having seen the German version and leaving the theatre rather disappointed and empty, I thought I give it another try. And watched the OV in the cinema. So the whole crime story of an unholy alliance between FBI and mobster Bulger again in Boston American English. I must admit, despite much, maybe too much cursing and blood splatter, the film grew on me. Depp's performance as Bulger definitely works for me (despite the original Bulger not being amused about his portrayal). Maybe the whole thing works best when not related too much to some ""true story"". True stories and Hollywood - let's face the facts, it's an oxymoron... Taken as a mere gangster movie, it works. I didn't learn very much about Bulger's character or his motivation. The movie is still a collection of murders, crimes and curses. But the somewhat creepy alliance between James ""Whitey"" Bulger and his boyhood friend John Connolly evolves slowly and subtly from a ""friendly"" cooperation into a misunderstood loyalty and disaster for everyone involved. Loyalty is the glue and the bomb. But while Connolly insists on his loyalty to Bulger, Bulger stays rather loyal to himself... His criminal energy is always present, perfectly embodied by Johnny Depp. The whole cast is brilliant, may it be main characters or supporting actors. Watching the film a second time gave me a better overview and understanding. And more thrills, despite the movie going at a rather slow pace, and still somehow missing a plot. Yes, it's different than the usual Hollywood Bam-Boom-Bang, smart characters, explosions and car chases. But once I got used to the rather narrative, documentary and distant style, I was at times sucked into the film. Maybe I should watch it a third time..."

Events are happening but you don't really feel invested in them. Most of it felt empty. There was no emotional attachment to it. The whole movie had this anti-climatic feel to it. You get scenes with great performances and all but the linkages don't carry out well.

I think the director did an incredible job shooting the film and loved to see the local places on the North Shore outside of Boston where they also filmed scenes from American Hustle. <br/><br/>I've read the book Black Mass and other books on Whitey Bulger, but I found that the books gave a more accurate portrait of Bulger than the film. I also wondered if the movie would be as easy to follow without reading the books and having some background knowledge on the events in the film.<br/><br/>The film scratched the surface of just some of the crimes that Bulger and the Winter Hill gang committed. I was also surprised at the prominence that Whitey's son and his death was given in the film, as it was not talked about much in the books. I'm guessing this was done to dramatize the story and make it more cinematic. <br/><br/>There is a lot more to Bulger's story and the heinous crimes he committed than was shown on the screen."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","0","0","17 October 2015"," Great material delegated to an engaging but generic execution.
","Announced as Johnny Depp's comeback venture en route to Oscar glory, it's a such a shame how underwhelming Depp is in Black Mass. In the past decade since his last best turn in Sweeney Todd, he's often overcooked roles catering to his arsenal of tics. Here he's more restrained, but while the material offers a clear and enticing character arc, Scott Cooper's approach regrettably blunts that down. Black Mass is simply aiming to be a boilerplate Boston crime drama, as carved by Scorsese's The Departed. It's solidly made, but it's more or less a series of neat murders. Makes it hard to really invest in any character. It's otherwise engaging just to watch it unfold despite clich√©s, though it's littered with missed opportunities for how taunt it could have wound things. Depp's Whitey Bulger is often sitting with the enemy, yet it treats it as any other scene.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's just part of the point, as the film operates on the macho code of loyalty, and how fragile that truly can be when crossed. It should just be like any other scene. While that theme comes through, the characters don't. At least it has an interesting structure with how it's framed through men informing on Bulger while the main narrative is Bulger informing for the FBI. Meanwhile, the supporting players far outshine both Depp and Joel Edgerton, who unfortunately overplays his hand while Depp stays relatively reserved. Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane, Juno Temple and the underused Jesse Plemons all make larger marks, leaving Benedict Cumberbatch and Kevin Bacon wishing they tried something else. The production is solid, though the wigs and makeup can be distracting at times, especially when it comes to Depp. Engaging enough, but I'm definitely not visiting Boston anytime soon.<br/><br/>7/10"

The film just had so much potential, the best scene was the one that i had previously seen in the trailer, it was very tense and uncomfortable to watch and left me wanting more. The actual film appears to be lacking this tension. There was also a lot crammed in and i kept finding myself getting a little lost and confused about what was happening and why? (didn't help that i almost dozed off at certain points, that's maybe why?). I think a lot of this is down to the films short run time,but even though the run time was short, for me, i think the film felt long. My husband felt that this story would have worked a lot better as a TV series and i do agree. Now onto Johnny, is he back to acting greatness? HELL YEAH! he was amazing! I can't fault his performance at all. He could flip from friendly to menacing in a second and he played a very believable James ""Whitey"" Bulger. I felt that all of the acting in this film was brilliant but Johnny was definitely the stand out performance for me and i'm hoping that everyone else will agree and Johnny can get back to being that amazing actor that he was always known as. There were also a few camera shots that i thought looked brilliant. So my final verdict is that it was a good movie but i wasn't blown away. I was, by Depp but the film itself not so much.

Why did he want to form the alliance with Bulger, simply for furthering his career or for protecting Bulger since they were childhood friends?

","Another crime drama/gangster film that succeeds in being a well crafted two hour movie, with even a couple of good cues for discussion, but doesn't reach a status to which you can point at anything original, particular or genuinely interesting that will distinguish this from the bunch.<br/><br/>Yet, not to discredit this film, it does have many points to its favor. Firstly all around we have a cast built of well know actors, but at no point you feel like its only for shock value. Everybody is really good, there are a string of well crafted performances. Honestly I have never been the biggest fan of Johnny Depp, his role as Jack Sparrow is something unique in my opinion, but for the rest he never really left my mouth open. Now, this is definitely one of his better performances and a really good one on its own, but it is nothing earth shattering. He manages to give his character a presence on screen that feels the way it should, but there is no heavy weight that really makes you sweat or sit on the edge when he is on screen. The standout is definitely Joel Edgerton and even if this isn't his best work, he proves the talent that he has been accounted for many times. Plus you are treated with a couple of scenes where the actors are just shown playing an interesting setup out and those are where you truly get the creeps, unfortunately there really aren't enough.<br/><br/>Sticking to why the film is actually good, it takes advantage of its story to put forward moral dilemmas and discussions that don't feel forced and are welcome to the conversation. Now, there isn't anything really deep or something that will keep you thinking for days, but the thoughts it stirs whilst playing are captivating and will keep you going through the whole film. At no point you will be shocked, but at many points you will feel a good dose of adrenaline and tension that will keep you sticking with the characters and being interested in the final outcome. It is just a dynamic that works for storytelling and the filmmakers don't get in the way of it with pointless or overly emphasized stuff.<br/><br/>That by the way could also be the big negative the film bears: it simply isn't exciting and it isn't exciting because the filmmakers don't really put a passionate effort into it. It plays as you expect it to and there isn't anything to be found that gives it an interesting beat or a through line for it to be stimulating once it ends. It shamelessly copies, yes copies not imitates or quotes, ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"" in some scenes and the fact that I noticed it so clearly really says something since I am not a fanatic of those films to being with.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the crime-drama genre you will certainly find something to sink your teeth in, but on the other side you will be served a good piece of filmaking with some standout moments and performances, but will leave not sure you got what was promised."

His portrayal of real life Boston mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger is one of his most instantly memorable screen incarnations even though by the films end you feel his turn was underutilised by director Scott Cooper. Whenever Depp's on screen, all menace and fiery from within, Black Mass is elevated to another level. He shares in a few scenes that will make you straighten your back and be glued to the screen. It's an impressive turn but not one I'm convinced will garner the actor his 4th Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Surrounding Depp's turn is a hugely loaded cast that bar Joel Edgerton's FBI agent John Connolly get a pretty short shift of proceedings. Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Saarsgarrd, Corey Stoll and Jesse Plemons all impress but don't get much to do while the females in the picture Julianne Nicholson, Dakota Johnson and Juno Temple get an even shorter straw with mere minutes of screen time in what seems like a boys only adventure.<br/><br/>It's a real shame Cooper couldn't draw more out of this loaded tale and his star studded cast and it's curious that such a thrilling story on paper can at times become such a lacking and uninvolving event on screen. Overall there's a real lack of emotion here that holds back much investment the audience would've otherwise afforded this mobster tale.<br/><br/>It's great to see Depp once more deliver on his talent and there are scenes within Black Mass that rank as some of the year's best but at the end of the day this highly watchable and finely filmed story is a bit of a soulless affair that missed its opportunity to become something truly special.<br/><br/>3 ¬Ω leather jackets out of 5"

","Black Mass, Hollywood's newest mafia entry directed by Scott Cooper, follows the true story of Boston's baleful phantom during the 70's and 80's: Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp). Hearing his name now just chills you to the bone. The film commences with an FBI interrogation with one of Bulger's crewmen, Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), and as the conversation carries on, it slowly builds up to finally saying that name. ""I need to know everything you know about the Winter Hill gang¬Öand, specifically, what you know about your former boss¬Öand now fugitive¬Ö JAMES WHITEY BULGER."" As soon as you hear his name uttered in such a solemn tone‚Äîmixed with Weeks' dour countenance‚Äîthe exact significance behind this legend is impactfully conveyed.<br/><br/>Told through convenient voice-over, we retrace Bulger's beginnings all the way through his rise and, eventually, his downfall. Initially, the film's flaws were drastically more pronounced for me: it was quite unfocused in its direction, telling an overly familiar gangster tale that felt slightly messy and poorly-paced in its execution. Too much screen-time is paid to some of the rather uninteresting elements of this otherwise endlessly fascinating history. What kept me genuinely enthusiastic and engaged though were the incredible performances across the board, the majority of which are unfortunately brief but exceptionally memorable from the likes of Dakota Johnson (as Whitey's wife), Julianne Nicholson, and Peter Sarsgaard in particular. In addition, Joel Edgerton continues to prove his pure thespian prowess; he's just utterly captivating and dedicated in every role, and here, he becomes just as detestable as Matt Damon in The Departed‚Äìa foolish yet manipulative weasel. Of course, the other standout is Johnny Depp's terrifying portrayal of Bulger‚Äìeasily his best showcase in the past five years.<br/><br/>Now, the cast and crew seem to be flip-flopping on their intentions in terms of properly handling this character. Suddenly, they're clarifying that they wanted to humanize Whitey, and that has ultimately become the annoyingly uninspired clich√© of modern biopics and cinema, in general. Everyone has to be humanized; the most despicable figures in our world's history have to be humanized because it makes it oh-so-complex. Regardless of what the filmmakers claim, I saw little to no humanity in Bulger's face‚Äìhis irritated mannerisms and enigmatic contemplations‚Äì which was certainly fitting in this case. It makes for a more unique venture in a genre that always tries to create sympathy and relatability out of the criminals‚Äìyes, he's soulless; he's morally vacant; and he is just as shallow as you would think. And like most biopics, the film is more so a rushed series of events in this subject's life, followed by the usual verbose ""what happened to everyone afterwards?"" outro before the cut to credits, rather than actually thematic and narrative cohesion.<br/><br/>With that being said, it's been six days since I viewed Black Mass but the more I reflected on its substance since, the more eager I've been to write up a review and get some things off my chest. As a result of the frankly unoriginal criticisms that have been thrown at this film (accusing it of simply mimicking Scorsese in a fruitless way), Black Mass's refreshing inventiveness to the genre remains understated. The fact of the matter is that never (or, at least, rarely) do we get to see actual anti-gangster pictures. No, we have Goodfellas and The Godfather and The Departed‚Äìall films that either create amusement and fun out of such twisted individuals or, essentially, turn them into dignified badasses for entertainment sake. ""Man, these guys are so cool; they're alpha-males with so many friends and so much power and bam bam bam!"" Black Mass, however, treats this environment like an unmitigated horror movie. There's nothing romanticized or hilarious about the disturbingly authentic murders here, not to mention the totally demented look on Depp's face‚Äìhis decaying teeth biting his lip, and those frightening deep blue eyes forever widening‚Äìas he mercilessly chokes the life out of a possibly innocent young woman. The powerfully haunting and sinister score by Tom Holkenborg superbly complements the arrantly dreary atmosphere of South Boston in these times.<br/><br/>Much like Foxcatcher was a downright condemnation of (competitive) sports, the similarly morose grayness in the shot compositions here makes Black Mass an undeniable condemnation of this community (even though it's not nearly as thematically profound as the former). There is absolutely nothing cool about these people. Perhaps you'll lambast Depp's overt make-up for making him appear a whole lot like a vampire‚Äì even if that's true, in a way, that's certainly an interesting and effective way to exhibit the sheer eeriness of this unbelievable being; in fact, it might as well parallel the bloodthirstiness of a vampire, lurking in the shadows and prone to attack when you least expect it. Aside from Al Capone, he was the most notorious mobster who actually found his way atop the FBI's Most Wanted list right next to Osama Bin Laden‚Äìa mythic unstoppable figure that signaled dark times for Boston indeed."

","Just got home from seeing it. I thought it was a great flick...but. For me, this is something I would have made a mini series out of. There's so much of the story that was omitted. Which, of course, was how Bulger got by while on the run for all those years. <br/><br/>Given, I don't think Bulger was willing to contribute to the movie. But I would have loved to have seen the story of how he got by while evading law enforcement. Frankly, that probably would have been more fascinating than the story that led up to him leaving. <br/><br/>I don't often say that I got my money's worth, but this was a good flick."

","I saw ""Black Mass"", starring Johnny Depp-Mortdecai, The Lone Ranger_2013; Joel Edgerton-The Gift, Star Wars:Episode 3_Revenge of the Sith; Dakota Johnson-Fifty Shades of Grey, Need For Speed; Benedict Cumberbatch-The Imitation Game, 12 Years a Slave, Oh yeah, he is playing Doctor Strange in 2016 and Kevin Bacon-The Following_tv, X-Men:First Class.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the true story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, who was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for 12 years. Johnny plays James and he does a really good job of it. His make-up, hair and eye contact lenses completely change his looks so much so, that he is fairly unrecognizable. Johnny and Benedict play brothers and Joel is a childhood friend that grew up with both of them in Boston, but they all took different career paths; Johnny as the head of the Irish mob, Benedict as a US senator and Joel as an FBI agent. Kevin plays Joel's boss at the FBI headquarters that wants Joel to crack down on Johnny and Dakota plays Johnny's wife. Johnny starts out as a low level Irish criminal in the 1970's & 80's with the Italian Mafia edging in on his territory. Johnny becomes an informer to the FBI so that they will take out his competition, the Mafia, and gets immunity for his earlier criminal life, in exchange for it. The only problem was that Johnny continued with his criminal life. The FBI did not like being played as fools, so that is when Johnny had to go on the run and became the FBI's most wanted man-his $2 million dollar reward was the highest amount ever offered for a felon, except for Osama bin Laden. The movie is very violent with Johnny changing at the drop of a hat, between being nice and psychotic. As the end credits start, you see pictures and video of the real Bulger and his compatriots and they tell you where they are now and what happened to them or how many years sentences they received. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I would not be surprised if Johnny gets an Oscar for this role. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD."
"malmborgimplano-92-599820","7","3","8","27 September 2015"," I blame Whitey
","One of the friends I saw this with has read two books about Whitey Bulger, and said after seeing it that it was very close to the facts with one exception: in real life, the sequence in which two men are shot to death in a moving vehicle involved one of the men getting away and having to be murdered at a later date. This confirms my overall impression that this film does a pretty good job at representing the reality of Whitey's life of crime within the framework of a Hollywood movie. In fact everything about it is well done, and as my friend observed, the people who designed and applied the prosthetic makeup on Johnny Depp and Benedict Cumberbatch should get all the awards, because it's literally seamless. (I suspect a touch of CGI went into it too.) The story itself is one that deserves to be told, about the FBI's disastrous decision to use the psychopathic Whitey as a tool to take down a rival gangster, which entailed letting him get away with whatever crimes he felt like committing under their protection. The problem is that real psychopaths, unlike Hollywood psychopaths like Hannibal Lecter and Frank Underwood, aren't interesting people. They don't have normal emotions or motivations so it's impossible for a normal person to relate to them. So the story revolves around the complex of people around Whitey who enabled his crime spree, particularly the main FBI agent who personally profited from setting up Whitey as an informant, i.e. another psychopath. I suspect in real life most if not all of the main players in this story were psychopaths to some degree, and I think this is at the heart of why this perfectly well-made film is lacking a certain something. It would take a lightning bolt of inspiration to strike any screenwriter to give them what it would take to make this story about the stupid and mean adventures of a gang of douches thrilling or poignant or mesmerizing. And really, inspiration would be better spent on a more inspiring story than this vile and contemptible shambles of aimless greed and cruelty.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a fine job of conveying the alien psychological state of a psychopathic criminal. Whitey refused Johnny's request to meet with him while he was preparing to play him on screen, so the blame rests on Whitey that Johnny has had to invent his own Whitey rather than model him on the real man. The revelation at the end of the film that Whitey was ultimately brought to justice and rots in prison to this day is the most satisfying thing about it."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","4","13","24 September 2015"," A Depp film as iconic as his role as Jack Sparrow
","Johnny Depp is a well known and praised actor for his work by portraying colorful various characters. However in recent years, many began to think Depp was running out of ideas on how to make his roles unique. A role many loved from his early 2000s was the lead role in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl as Captain Jack Sparrow. Audiences and fans a like began to notice that as time went on, Depp began taking liberties with his acting choices and translating many of Sparrow's mannerisms into his other roles. Although hardcore Depp fans do not mind this, objective critics were not impressed with all the doppelgangers. Then there's this film which completely flips the Depp perception of his usual odd and quirky roles into something that will truly showcase that Depp has more to add. There really isn't much to pull out on the spot for this project. Several of the elements in this production blend so well that it's very difficult to go back and think about what needed work or stood out as bad.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays the Irish fist-throwing/trash-talking Jimmy ""Whitey"" Bulger, a real life small town gangster during the mid 1970s who ended up soaring to the F.B.I.'s most wanted list after the early 1990s. Competently directed by Scott Cooper (Out of the Furnace (2013)) and written by Mark Mallouk (his first credit) and Jez Butterworth (Edge of Tomorrow (2014)), this group of people and the cast tacked on make this story quite the watcher. The writing covers the material as if it were a documentary but does it in such a way that demonstrates to the audience what actually happened other than the people being interviewed giving it all away. It's not incredibly ingenious but it is smart because it gives the viewers a better idea of the people involved and how they dealt with the situation that was erupting during that current time period other than hearing from them decades later. The only thing that is worth mentioning that should've been brought up is how Bulger got his mentality that he was so infamously known for? There is no backstory for Bulger's motivations. Why was he the way he was?<br/><br/>Other than this, everything else works great. Casting wise, Johnny Depp as Jimmy Bulger is jarringly different from recent acting choices and it is a delight to see him as the fouled-mouthed Irishman. Depp's voice is grainy sounding, his receding blonde hairline and cloudy blue eyes really make this something to remember. Even though the background to Bulger's eventual trademark characteristics are not expanded upon, Depp's performance is dumbfoundingly captivating. For such an antagonistic character, the writing and Depp combined are able to give even Bulger small tidbits of humanity that don't even seem possible. The reason why this is almost shocking is because most audiences are not supposed to feel sympathy for such a character. What's weird is that there are times where it seemed as if Bulger did have his soft moments. For example, when Bulger makes a promise about a certain topic, he honestly sounds like he's giving a scout's honor. Then again, it was hard to tell because of how deceitful his personality was. That alone is demonstrated quite early on. This is how devious the writing and the character is.<br/><br/>Along side Depp is Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, an old friend of Bulger who feels he owes him a favor. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Bulger's brother Billy who also knows Connolly and frequently associates with him. Actors Jesse Plemons and Rory Cochrane play Bulger's henchmen who show they are just as loyal to Bulger as is Connolly and Billy. There's also scenes with Peter Sarsgaard, Kevin Bacon, David Harbour and Adam Scott who work along side Connolly in the F.B.I. agency. The majority of these characters get a good dose of character development and each actor performs exceptionally well. The violence although not gruesome, is certainly brutal no doubt. The killings are mostly direct and to the point about what the job is and there are some that will make the viewer hope they don't ever have a run in with a character like Bulger. Not even a can of spinach would save somebody against Bulger; contempt is what he lives on.<br/><br/>The cinematography shot by Masanobu Takayanagi has a skilled visual flare to it as well. Since this film has two methods of story telling, there are also two methods of camera-work. For the documentary style part of the narrative, Takayanagi films those scenes completely still and close up like an interview would. As for the rest of the execution, Takayanagi films the rest of the scenes like other films. Thankfully there are no shaky cam shots, or disorienting continuous rotating 360 shots. Every scene is well lit and is steady no matter where the camera goes. The film score composed by Tom Holkenborg, better known as Junkie XL also brings in some nice cues to the table. It was a little questionable at first because of how Holkenborg likes to mimic several of Hans Zimmer contemporary synthetic type cues but here Holkenborg actually provided a enjoyable listening experience that includes strings and piano that emotionally capture the trouble that goes on throughout this crime thriller. It's tragic and sounds great.<br/><br/>The only thing that sticks out as of needs for improvement was explaining how Jimmy Bulger got his motivations to become what he's known for. That's not much to say though with a talented supporting cast, gritty violence, effective camera-work, tragic sounding music and a defining performance from Johnny Depp that is quite opposite from the majority of his previous roles."
"bardia-moose","9","6","23","16 September 2015"," The Mob Film We've All Been Waiting For
","In 1970s Boston, FBI Agent John Connolly persuades Irish mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger to collaborate with the FBI and eliminate a common enemy: the Italian mob. BLACK MASS tells the story of this unholy alliance, which spiraled out of control, allowing Whitey to become one of the most ruthless gangsters in U.S. history.<br/><br/>Directing can be thought of like this: give a person various ammunition and gunpowder, and see how big of a bang he or she can make. And there's no doubt that the greatest weapon in director Scott Cooper's arsenal is Johnny Depp. His performance as infamous Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger is mesmerizingly haunting. With piercing blue eyes and an apt demonic appearance, the make-up team's magnificent work allowed for Depp to walk in and completely knock it out of the park. <br/><br/>To those who're charging down the streets at 15 miles an hour, screaming, ""Johnny Depp is back!"" at the top of their lungs, I would ask: did he ever really leave? Or has he been here all along, tainted by the less-than-decent films he's appeared in? I'd put my money on the latter because, even with his most atrocious movies, he always loses himself in his characters. And that's what acting is all about.<br/><br/>If there's anyone that can rival Depp's work here it would have to be Joel Edgerton, who actually ends up stealing the spotlight more than a few times and downright nailing it throughout. His character, placed at the center of the plot, is about as sympathetic as a corrupt FBI agent could possibly be, in a movie filled with unlikable characters. <br/><br/>However, Depp and Edgerton aren't the only selling points here; Cooper is a filmmaker who's capable of working exceptionally well with ensembles. And with a cast as impressive as this: Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Corey Stoll just to name a few, it's hard to pinpoint a single weak link. <br/><br/>This is the mob movie that fans of the genre have been waiting forever for; it is brutal, refreshing, and impossible to look away from. The story, however, is quite dense, and the occasional pacing issues didn't help. But the performances are what make it digestible, and what, ultimately, makes BLACK MASS one of the year's best."
"XweAponX","10","2","5","13 February 2016"," ""The Departed"" in Real Life
","That was the first thing I thought when I started watching this very slow-burn take on the life and times of Whitey Bulger.<br/><br/>I have read a few other reviews that seem to agree, this film starts of slow, and pretty much remains slow, but with each new development more corpses are buried under the pier, and you have to ask how can anyone remain clean? ""1000 faces of delusion"" maybe put it the best, ""It's not Goodfellas but in that lineage of unspoken titillation at what people get away with; it seems we'll always want to be flies-in-the-wall in the same room with horrible men"".<br/><br/>And as much as I enjoyed Goodfellas, Casino, The Godfather Trilogy, and even The Departed, those were fantasy stories maybe slightly based on real life figures.<br/><br/>But the image of Whitey Bulger is so unusual that this story is fascinating. And Bulger's own background - This film does not touch on his alleged involvement with the MK-ULTRA Program, but it shows this somewhat charismatic crook in a most realistic manner.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp seems to have been born for this role, he even looks a lot like the man, makeup aside. And what starts out as an idealistic young FBI agent, Joel Edgerton as John Connolly, ends up deluding himself. It all sounded so good, when he met Bulger and proposed a way to take down a rival Mafia gang, but what started out as something ""for the good of all"" (of course, except for the rival gang) ended up as an escalating pile of bodies and a geometrically increasing Body of Lies. In setting up an ambitious alliance with Bulger, Connolly forgot why he was doing it, and from then on was a total loss.<br/><br/>It seems that anyone who became involved with Bulger's business became horribly dead as well. And Bulger did not stop with Business Associates, family and friends were not immune. But we still approach the character as a human being, his relations with his mother and ""little brother"" Billy (Played well with a great accent by Benedict Cumberbatch) are all the same things we all have in common. And the fact that Billy Bulger was somewhat protected from the worse part pf Whitey's activities, seems like what our family members do for us.<br/><br/>Regardless of this, there are no ""Happy Endings"" here, and the bad guys don't get away with it. In the long run, everyone has to account for their actions. I would only hope real life is the same."
"rubenm","8","2","5","4 January 2016"," Impressive crime thriller
","'Black Mass' reminded me of two things.<br/><br/>One: Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed'. Also set in South Boston, also about the ties between the Boston crime scene and law enforcement agencies, also focusing on the characters of two men. The difference is that 'The Departed' is about infiltration, and 'Black Mass' is about cooperation.<br/><br/>Two: the so-called IRT-affair, a scandal that shocked the Netherlands in the nineties. Police forces had knowingly turned a blind eye on large scale cocaine smuggling, hoping to get information in return. After a parliamentary inquiry had uncovered the scandal, investigation methods were changed thoroughly.<br/><br/>In 'Black Mass', the Boston branch of the FBI gets involved in a similar affair. It's based on true events, involving the close ties between FBI agent John Connolly and crime lord James 'Whitey' Bulger. Both men grew up in the streets of South Boston, developing an unwritten code of honour that served them both well.<br/><br/>The movie shows excellently how both men are slowly stretching the limits they are prepared to cross. Connolly knows he goes too far by protecting a murderer and drugs trader, but goes on regardlessly, driven by his code of honour and above all his ego and burning ambition. Bulger, on the other hand, at first is hesitant about cooperating with the FBI, but tells himself it is alright because it is a business alliance instead of an information exchange.<br/><br/>Some reviewers complain that this is a crime movie without crime. That's true, but that is exactly why I liked this film. It is about the psychological development of two men, who are not really friends, but use each other in their mutual interest. The film shows very convincingly how they are slowly but surely digging their own grave.<br/><br/>The performances are great. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the ice cold psychopath and manipulator Bulger is Oscar material. But Joel Edgerton is just as impressive as the streetwise and egotistical FBI agent John Connolly.<br/><br/>The pacing and the structure of the film are just right. There are some interesting side stories, such as Bulger's relationship with his brother, the politician Billy Bulger, and the death of his baby son. Also, the respective wives of Connolly and Bulger get some interesting screen time. But overall, the story keeps focused on the downward spiral, caused by the cooperation between the two men.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper is no Scorsese, of course. But nevertheless, this film is an impressive, well-made and entertaining crime thriller."
"lesleyharris30","9","2","5","11 December 2015"," Terrific Performances all around, but Johnny Depp is the star,
","Black Mass is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a fantastic crime film that dives deep in the life of Whitey Bulger, one of the most infamous criminals there is, revolving around the FBI's struggles to find any proof of him committing a crime, because of his skills with the law, the story is very interesting and you will find it very hard to believe that it is all completely true. The only thing about this film that I felt was missing was more violence, Bulger lived a long life full of crime, and I think making this film 15A was a mistake, because they weren't allowed show as much as regards to the terrible crime himself and his men committed. It pans away for certain scenes or moves forward to the next scene at times when you can tell things are about to get intense, it would have been better off with an 18's rating. All the performances are absolutely outstanding, ranging from top notch acting from the likes of Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons, and even some unexpectedly terrific turns from the likes of Dakota Johnson, Adam Scott and Kevin Bacon. However, none of these great actors can top Johnny Depp in the lead role, he shines in every scene, he lives and breaths Bulger and it is very clear that he went method for his performance, I've never been unimpressed with him in any movie, but this is some of his best work yet. While it may be lacking in thrills at times, Black Mass boasts a terrific story, excellent character development and outstanding performances, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime drama. <br/><br/>The story of real life criminal James ""Whitey"" Bulger, following his long life of crime in Boston, which he was able to keep up after forming a relationship with the FBI. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Johnny Depp"
"videorama-759-859391","8","2","5","28 October 2015"," Depp- a massive performance in greatness
","It's time that we'd had another refreshing mafia pic, although Black Mass is not in the same category as old unforgotten classics. Again, this is based on real characters, Depp at his creepiest, who has his moments, of really making you unsettled, and we love this great actor for it. First off, the acting is superb, no one out of line here, Dakota Johnson looking sexier here than in Fifty Shades, who plays Depp's wife. Whitney Bulger (Depp) was the most feared gangster in Boston, where Depp's obviously done the character justice. Responsible for a supermarket of crime, but impossible to catch. An old friend from the neighborhood, John Connolly (Oz's Edgerton) now, FBI, throws an offer at Depp to be an informant, taking down obvious arch enemy mob figures, Bulger, hates, while maintaining to go on doing what he does. What's truly sad about this arrangement was how John and his partner, got themselves in something way over their head, really copping a tragic blow, by really trying to do good, where Connolly, lucked out most of all with an eye widening and truly unjust sentence. It's the last half an hour, the dangerous situation and predicament of Connolly's and co, that really makes this part of the movie's most engrossing which doesn't ensue as you think it will, as in more blood spattering. There are other frightening moments, and some predictable ones, in this that comes from seeing other mafia pics, but B.M. is another reason, to see a great actor at work, in probably what is his finest hour. Bulger was a despicable figure and there were times, you actually sympathize with him, through his pathetic self, but Depp's performance will leave his mark on ya. Trust me."
"katibrasti","9","2","5","20 October 2015"," Merits to become a classic
","I have read quite a few underwhelming reviews which I think do not do justice to this captivating film. First of all, forget about ""The godfather"" or ""The departed"". It's different, less flashy and maybe also less entertaining, especially for people not used to ""slow"" movies. However I also find it more realistic and thought-provoking. Some of the more critical opinions point out the ""lack of depth of the characters"", however we should not forget that real-life carrier criminals are often in fact, less than complicated and certainly aren't the uber cool guys often depicted on screen. They might be intelligent in some cases, but they are greedy, violent and don't have moral boundaries. Frequently they also show sadistic tendencies, as the protagonist does. I consider it exhilarating that there's no glorification of organized crime and those involved in it, just a quite faithful, as far as I know, adaptation of true events.<br/><br/>The stellar cast is top-notch, even secondary characters give a convincing performance. Depp's acting is certainly Oscar-worthy, he is unrecognizable and really frightening. Edgerton is just perfect as the sleazy, yet loyal in his own twisted way, cop. Cumberbatch is solid as always, I 'd have loved to see more of Kevin Bacon, one of my all- time favorite actors. Furthermore, I was absolutely stunned by Sarsgaard's performance, he really shines in his small part. <br/><br/>I definitively recommend you watch it in the cinema, in order to fully appreciate the style, the musical score and the gloomy atmosphere. I didn't give it a 10/10 rating, because imho the editing should have been slightly tighter, especially during the first third of the film. Otherwise I hope time treats it kindly and puts it among the classics of its genre, as it deserves."

Finally, Depp gets to display his magnificent abilities and conveys the character's quiet menace which redefines cold blooded. Director, Scott Cooper takes a page out of Scorsese's Goodfellas playbook telling the story in narrative style. Joel Edgerton (recently of The Gift) plays the ambitious get- ahead-at-all-costs FBI agent who handles Whitely but gets himself in so deep he has no way out.

"japamo","8","3","10","24 September 2015"," The ""Black Mass"" is James ""Whitey"" Bulger's Soul ‚Äì Assuming He Has One
","Although this time we have an Irish-American gangster protagonist instead of the time-worn Italian-American one, ""Black Mass"" (hereafter BM) follows the usual rise and fall trajectory of all organized crime movies. However, what distinguishes BM from a lot of these ""Crime Really Doesn't Pay"" movies is actor Johnny- Depp's career-zenith performance as that Irish-American gangster protagonist James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Most gangster movies manage to find a smidgen of tenderness and caring in their mob boss heroes. In BM, that humanity is just about missing. With his slicked-back white hair, cold blue eyes, and stone-faced sneer, Depp's Bulger seems to be pure, implacable, death-warmed-over evil with no soul at all, or at best a black chunk of coal for a soul.<br/><br/>During the mid 70's, Bulger and his ""Winter Hill Gang"" consisting of his lieutenant, unshaven and uncouth Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), newbie Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), and equally poker-faced and sloppy peanut-eating hit-man Johnny Martorano (W. Earl Brown) hold sway over South Boston (or South End or Southie). Bulger took care never to let the public see him rub out his enemies (advice he humorously but chillingly gives his young son, Douglas). Bulger justifies these tactics as necessary to ""protect"" Southie from the ambitious mafia-backed North Boston (North End) Italian-American Angiulo Brothers. Of course, it's just a turf war. In this war, Whitey seems to have the edge because he doesn't hesitate to kill not only people who mess with him or betray him, but also people he just SUSPECTS of doing the same. For example, late in the film Bulger strangles Flemmi's prostitute stepdaughter for talking to the cops, even though she swears she didn't squeal on him.<br/><br/>Whitey Bulger is not the only one who wants to take out the Angiulo Brothers. A Southie native son, FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returns home because he is eager to rise in the ranks and thinks that icing the elusive Angiulo Brothers is the way to do it. Thinking Bulger has the ""connections"" to bring them down, Connolly wants Bulger to inform on them to the FBI. Even though Bulger's twisted sense of crime and Irish ethnic loyalty makes him initially refuse Connolly's offer, Connolly craftily appeals to that same loyalty to convince Bulger that being an FBI ""snitch"" is the only way to get rid of the Angiulos.<br/><br/>Slowly and eventually, Connolly realizes that he may have made a deal with a real devil. Bulger blithely and savagely refuses to heed Connolly's warning not to commit crimes and/or kill as he keeps tabs on the Angiulos. On the contrary, Bulger coolly exploits this unholy alliance with the FBI to expand his influence not only in Southie, but even in Miami in a World Jai Alai embezzlement scheme, and as far as Ireland in an IRA (Irish Republican Army) weapons- smuggling operation. Only after Connolly's FBI boss, the demanding Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) rides him, and Connolly in turn rides Bulger does he finally get photographic evidence of the Angiulos' criminal haunts, which allows the FBI to nail the brothers through a wiretap.<br/><br/>Bulger seems to have it made. His main opponents are out of the picture. His senator brother William Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) stays willfully ignorant about Whitey's activities. Helping capture Anguilo should keep the FBI looking the other way. But fate steps in as she always does. Bulger's fragile family life collapses as his son Douglas suffers Reye syndrome, goes into a coma and dies when his mom and Bulger's girlfriend Lindsey (Dakota Johnson) pulls the plug on him despite Whitey's raging opposition. She leave Whitey soon after. Bulger also acts irrationally and threateningly towards Connolly's FBI partner John Morris (David Harbour) in a ""GoodFellas""-inspired ""tell me the recipe"" scene, and in an unbearably tense bedroom scene with Connolly's wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson). Even though Connolly is still in Bulger's corner, Marianne finally gets fed up with his slimy association and locks him out of the house.<br/><br/>The beginning of the end comes for Connolly in the form of blunt, all-business prosecutor Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), who takes over the U.S. Attorney's Office and brusquely refuses Connolly's bribe of Red Sox tickets and basically tells him to stop his bullsh-t connection with Whitey and bring him in. When undercover agent John McIntyre (Brad Carter) blows the lid on the IRA operation, Bulger kills and buries him. Wyshak also learns the ""assistance"" Whitey provided to capture the Angiulo Brothers actually came second-hand from lower-rank informants. In return for immunity, Morris confesses the true relationship that Connolly and Whitey had. When The Boston Globe exposes Whitey's informant activities, the jig is up as the Winter Hill Gang abandons Whitey as a traitor, is arrested, and brings the movie full circle to their taped confessions. Connolly is arrested as well for his conspiratorial crimes. In the epilogue, Whitey becomes a 16-year fugitive, eventually captured by the FBI in 2011.<br/><br/>Though cruising over familiar gangster ground, BM is a smoothly-paced, never-boring, and actually unnerving portrait of an unconventional, psychopathic criminal who achieves his murderous ends not so much through flamboyant anger (though Bulger does lose it from time to time) as through inhuman, selfish, enigmatic, unadulterated evil. Even when he is being ""nice"", like to his son or mother, it's creepy and foreboding. Again, Depp redeems himself after five movie flops to give an Oscar-caliber performance as a soulless guy that seems to have come straight out of hell. Joel Edgerton nearly steals the spotlight from Depp as the unscrupulous agent Connolly who justifies selling HIS soul by touting his Irish-based loyalty and friendship with Bulger and the old adage ""it takes a thief to catch a thief "". Despite Depp's tour-de-force performance, BM makes me wish for a movie prequel detailing Bulger's young, formative years and the events that led to his criminal career, including stints at Leavenworth and Alcatraz. After all, no one is born evil, right?<br/><br/>Right?"
"Ramascreen","9","3","10","18 September 2015"," Johnny Depp, as Whitey Bulger, is scary.
","Scott Cooper, the director who gave us ""Crazy Heart,"" and ""Out Of The Furnace"" came back with this ambitious film, and I say that because Jimmy ""Whitey"" Bulger"" is among the most famous of all gangsters in the entire history of crime families in this country. His name is up there on the same level as Al Capone and the rest of those scums. So it's good that this movie doesn't glorify Whitey Bulger in any way.<br/><br/>As I've said a thousand times before, I'm a sucker for mob stories and police corruption stories because a). they're a perfect example of a villain, acting nice in front of people but doing other wise behind closed doors and b). the unholy alliance between the two like the one depicted in this film is kind that unfortunately will always continue to happen in many other places. It will always exist, no matter how many crime 'heads' you try to cut off.<br/><br/>BLACK MASS takes instruction from Martin Scorsese's manual book, as does any other gangster movie that has been made since ""Goodfellas."" It starts out with a young kid who gets to join the Winter Hill gang, but the focus remains on Whitey Bulger, brilliantly played by Johnny Depp, an actor who I think hasn't been in touch with his dark side since 2007's ""Sweeney Todd,"" (let's forget that whole mess ""Transcendence"" ever happened) so it's nice to have Depp back as the baddie. And boy, as Bulger, Depp immerses himself and strikes fear into the hearts of the people around him. He's like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito in ""Goodfellas"" but times a hundred, BLACK MASS even has Depp's Bulger intimidate a person sitting across from him; that person thinks Bulger is angry at him, reminiscent of Tommy's ""What's so funny?"" scene. This is Depp's best performance in years.<br/><br/>Those of us fans of gangster movies know how the game is played and so does BLACK MASS, you just know when somebody would get whacked, you just know when somebody says the wrong thing to a boss, you just know when the noose is tightening and their empire starts to crumble. In this case, Joel Edgerton plays FBI agent John Connolly who helps Bulger, hoping that Bulger would help him in return but instead Bulger uses him. The way Edgerton plays his character is that he's not your traditional 'dirty' lawman, he's not planted there by winter hill gang. He's a cocky, incompetent lawman, he in way over his head, the kind of guy who'd rather make excuses than face up to his own blunder and it eventually bites him in the butt.<br/><br/>My thing is that if the government has to settle for torture session or if law enforcement has to settle for cooperating with the mob, if those are their last resort, claiming that there's no other choice, then they're actually just lazy and unwilling to put the time and effort in good old detective police work. BLACK MASS gives you a brutal inside look at one of this country's most notorious monsters."
"jmoneyjohal","8","3","10","18 September 2015"," Black Mass is a gritty, dark, biopic on one of the most notorious gangster to ever live,James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Depp is back with a Oscar worthy act!
","I would lie if I said I didn't have huge expectations from a film like Black Mass, the trailer was outstanding, the films cast boasts of actors like Johnny Depp,Joel Edgerton,Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon.The film had everything going for it, it was a masterpiece in the making. And did Black Mass ever meet those expectations,I mean don't get me wrong the film probably is not a masterpiece, but its easily one of the finest films, you will see this year. From the word go a dark eerie atmosphere is created in the film, and its maintained throughout. James ""Whitey"" Bulger easily becomes that one character you hate to love, and its all thanks to Johnny Depp's Oscar worthy performance, he has made a comeback like never before after many flop films, his performance alone is worth the ticket price of the film. I mean Black Mass is not as good but can easily be compared too gangster flicks like the Departed,Goodfellas made by Ace filmmaker Martin Scorsese, and thats saying a lot because those films are masterpieces, decade defining films. Black Mass is a gritty, dark, biopic on one of the most notorious gangster to ever live,James ""Whitey"" Bulger.<br/><br/>Story wise the film is a biopic on the rise and fall of the Irish mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger, better know as Jimmy.Jimmy was involved in almost any criminal activity a person could name, from money laundering, to racketeering,murder, extortion,trafficking drugs, terrorism,etc you name it. The film starts off with members of his Irish mob, the main members turning informants and telling the story of how Jimmy became such a big gangster when at one point he was a nobody. The film talks about how Jimmy's younger brother Billy was a state Senator, a very affluent person in the southern Boston area. An area which Jimmy wanted under his control but the Italian mob was in his way. After a series of events Jimmy is introduced to James Connolly a former childhood friend, now turned FBI agent. He makes a deal with Jimmy that he can continue doing whatever he does, if he provides info on how to arrest the Italian mob, Jimmy looks at this to his advantage, and doesn't consider this snitching because he would not be ratting out anybody he is associated with. This deal somehow leads to James ""Whitey"" Bulger becoming the biggest gangster in America in the 70s, and 80s, and it also lead to him being on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list, how this happened is what forms the rest of the films story.<br/><br/>Acting wise, as I stated before Johnny Depp has given a Oscar worthy performance in Black Mass, as James ""Whitey"" Bulger. He plays the dark character so menacingly, that at times you feel that Johnny is actual Whitey, and thats the highest praise any actor can get. Depp has hit it out of the ball park. On the other hand Joel Edgerton is on a roll with great performances, after the Gift, he has given another amazing act. Benedict Cumberbatch is good in his brief appearance. The rest of the ensemble cast is apt.<br/><br/>Black Mass is a film that doesn't have any huge negatives,I mean you could look at the films pace and say that its slow, but for this type of film you need that type of pace, the screenplay could have been a little more novel, because at times, it does feel like the film is taking the route most gangster films do, but I mean as I mentioned on the onset the film is no masterpiece. However the director Scott Copper needs to applauded for getting the atmosphere right in the film, and never wavering away from the films true story. Nothing is glamorized in the film,Black Mass feels like a real, gritty drama.<br/><br/>Overall I won't say much more other than if you want to see one of the years best films,head to a theater near you because Johnny Depp's performance alone is worth the ticket price the rest is a bonus in Black Mass. A must watch for people who enjoy films about the Mob and gangster flicks.<br/><br/>4/5* or 8.5/10"

It could be better as it tries to reach for the mob classic. It falls slightly short of that because Bulger's true story does not reach as far as the fiction.<br/><br/>Still this one has a good cast, and a young director who is building an impressive resume. <br/><br/>Depp brings something to Bulger which is a more controlled felon. <br/><br/>Is this violent world enjoyable? In a more Blue Collar Type of way. <br/><br/>There is a lot of talk in this but there is not an offer you can not refuse."

","I have never lived in a metropolis-like environment, so I can't say I've had the experience of living in tight corners and nearby Chinese food places. The idea of living in high rises certainly doesn't frighten me or even annoy me, but it's certainly nice to look at a forest rather then brick and steel. The only time in my life that comes close in my one year of schooling in Tucson, but it's more of an extra large town then a metropolis (that's what Phoenix is for). Cityscapes come along with the stereotypes. The bums, the workaholics, the rich yuppies, the underprivileged artists, and of course, the mafia. <br/><br/>One continues plot in many city police stories is going after the mafia. It's rarely set against the Italian mafia or Irish mafia, but just THE mafia. The best movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas and The Departed have drawn exception to these standard in order to project realism. What's frightening is that the more real these gangster movies become, the more your optimism for the city deflates to be replaced by the image of organized crime running the show, What's worse are the stories that show the armed forces involved. Black Mass tells the real story of the Irish mafia in Boston. <br/><br/>The movie is told from the various flashbacks of criminals that have worked for main character, James ""Whitey"" Bulger.<br/><br/>Starting in 1975, Whitey (played by Johnny Depp) is a small town crook in South Boston who has a small crew and works his numbers, but still isn't a kingpin yet. On the other side of the law is John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), an FBI agent who was friends with Whitey as a kid growing up in Boston. Connolly gets the idea of having Whitey coming on board as an informant for the FBI in order to eradicate the Italian mafia. <br/><br/>Whitey's brother William Bulger (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) isn't enthusiastic about the idea and neither is Whitey. The later gets on board to protect his family, though dismisses the idea that he's ""ratting"". Though given rules against killing and committing crimes, Whitey does so any way, but provide enough information just so that he still technically helping the FBI. As Whitey become further detached from his humanity and Connolly brushes off all the violence as ""getting closer to the enemy"", the FBI starts to debate what's ethical to catch brooks with more crooks.<br/><br/>The story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger is an interesting one; so interesting that many movies, including The Departed were inspired by this criminal. Does that mean that there's room for the real life story? Yes, there is. Black Mass is an enjoyable crime thriller that's more about the crimes then so of the character. Johnny Depp still gives it all to play a scary man that would have had me running out of the building. Even though were given a more over-the- top design then an over-the-top personality, he's still fascinating enough of a character to see him as he rises in the crime world. <br/><br/>Now unlike something like Scarface where our criminal is wealthy, Black Mass is more of the workingman's godfather. It's not a bad thing, but since we've received movies like this before, Black Mass feels like it could get lost in an ocean of more iconic criminal stories. I can't feel like that this kind of story has been given to audiences hundreds of times before It's not bad, but it's a movie that came a little late or at least put a different spin to make it stand out more. I'm not sure if the answer were to have gone darker, but it might have helped.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven welcome to Boston signs out of ten. Black Mass isn't good because it's a fantastic gangster story; it works because it's adequate. I think I respect the history more then I do for the final product. If you like gangster or crime thrillers, then you'll probably like this."

","Cooper helms a substantial crime drama based on real events. This film's narrative mirrors the real life documentary based on Bulger's trials in the outstanding documentary, ""Whitey: United States of America V. James J Bulger"" by Academy Award- nominated director Joe Berlinger which adds to the realism and accuracy of this film. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, settings and acting. All artists involved deliver superlative performances. Depp, Edgerton and Cumberbach in particular stand out. However it is Depp that truly commands the screen. The plot revolves around real life infamous gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger who terrorized South Boston as the leader of the 'Winter Hill Gang' and his brother Bill who is a powerful leader in the Massachusetts Senate. Set in Boston during the 1970's, the Irish hoodlum Whitey pursues a life of crime using ruthless and brutal tactics. Eventually he is approached by FBI Agent John Connolly and is convinced to help the agency fight the Italian mob and take out his competition. Soon enough their unholy alliance ends but Whitey continues to increase in power and evade capture becoming one of the most dangerous and deceiptful gangsters in U.S. history. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. This viewer's favorite is when we see how brash, feared and vicious Whitey was when he guns down a victim in broad daylight surrounded by witnesses. He then strolls away without a care in the world as if nothing happened and it's just part of his normal day. The film is duplicitous, gritty, violent, intense, realistic, formidable and has a cathartic ending. The film is mesmerizing, captivating and is one of the better films in it's genre."

","Black Mass is a biographical film that was based on the 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob that was written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill.It stars Johnny Depp together with Joel Edgerton,Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane,Kevin Bacon,Peter Saarsgard, Dakota Johnson, and Corey Stoll.<br/><br/>During the 1970's,FBI Agent John Connolly convinces Irish mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger to collaborate with the agency in order to eliminate the mob.In the process,it leads to Whitey to be able to use his connections to evade the law consistently and become the one of the most feared and ruthless mobster in Boston.He,too is able to provide protection for his family.As the story progressed,we get to see Connolly and the his fellow members of the law get arrested for the illegal schemes they themselves got involved in and with Whitey surprisingly getting arrested as an elderly in 2011.<br/><br/>The film looks really promising to be a great mob film.I was expecting it to become like The Departed.Unfortunately,it did not reach that level as it was basically more like a character study of Whitey and his ability to manipulate the law enforcers.It lacked suspense and the emotional level was somewhat not as intense unlike other great mob movies."
"rmax304823","5","1","2","10 July 2016"," Turgid
","The movie is about James ""Whitey"" Bulger, the notorious Boston mob leader. It ought to be better than it is. The style and subject matter are chiefly from Martin Scorsese, just as the musical score borrows heavily from John Powell's score for ""The Bourne Identity."" There are several of Scorsese's familiar overhead shots of table tops, amusing scenes of Bulger playing gin rummy with his mother, and so forth.<br/><br/>I'll have to guess at why it doesn't entirely clear the bar. It's certainly not the subject matter, which has been a popular movie subject since the beginning of the talkies in the early 30s. Oh, we LOVE gangsters. The casting is flawed, for one thing. Johnny Depp looks rather like Bulger but he's so inexpressive that there's hardly any way of knowing what the character is feeling, especially since he lies so often. He wears the same expression whether he's kissing his son good-night or shooting a traitor in the back of the head.<br/><br/>Dakota Johnson looks sweet beyond comparison but it remains to be seen whether she has chops. The figure who is almost as central to the story as Bulger himself is Joel Edgerton, and he's not very convincing as an FBI agent. It's unpleasant to watch his character and listen to him. The whole movie is unpleasant. The opening shot is a close up of a battered, ugly, snotty, pitted face -- poor Jesse Plemons.<br/><br/>Since this is ""based on a true story,"" we expect the narrative to be messy. That's life, right? But this story is sometimes hard to follow because the continuity is weak. Not by design, I don't think, as it was in Stanley Kubrick's work, but because the script was faulty.<br/><br/>What the movie DOES deliver on is gore. People are battered to death, blood splashing all over the place. People are constantly being shot, sometimes for reasons that are obscure. And they're almost all head shots, except for somebody like Peter Sarsgaard who gets riddled with bullets and dies shrieking with pain, rolling around in a parking lot. (Cf., Joe Pesci beaten to death with baseball bats in Scorsese's ""Casino."") The FBI is involved in all this, one way or another, but they're hardly sympathetic figures.<br/><br/>The reliable Kevin Bacon emerges with his dignity intact as does Sarsgaard. It's curious to see Benedict Cumberbatch in an American movie. He's a fine actor, though his accent sounds generically urban rather than Bostonian. Nice location shooting, by the way.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, not insulting, but it is sluggish and a little dull, uninspired except for the murder scenes."
"leonblackwood","6","1","2","29 March 2016"," Entertaining with great performances! 6/10
","Review: I quite enjoyed this film because I did find Johnny Depp's character, James ""Whitey"" Bulger, quite intriguing and there is a sense of intensity throughout the movie, but it wasn't in the same league as Goodfellas. Johnny Depp played the leading role quite well and his brother, Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a weird choice but he still put in a good performance but it did seem like Whitey bullied his way into the underworld, more than using an intelligent mind to get to the top. Don't get me wrong, he did fool the FBI by giving them old information, so they could get away with there brutal and vicious behaviour but they done a lot of there murders in broad daylight and none of Whitey's team were that loyal. After the death of Whitey's son, he seemed to go a bit of the rails and he was killing random people for any reason. His close friend, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who worked for the FBI, was literally letting Whitey get away with murder and I honestly can't believe that he never thought that he would get caught. What also amazed me, was that everyone became a ""rat"" towards the end and no one seemed to try and hold back any information. Anyway, the make-up department really did give there all, by totally transforming Johnny Depp into a 70's thug. Some of the scenes are very brutal so it's not a movie for the squeamish but there is a lot of political footage, which I found uninteresting. The fact that Whitey was on the run for 16 years whilst being on the FBI's Most Wanted list, is truly amazing and with so many people turning against him, he will be living the rest of his life behind bars as a lonely man. His close brother Billy was an inspiring senator who everyone looked up to but when the FBI found out that he had been in contact with his brother, he sadly lost everything that he had worked hard for. All of his fellow criminals also had to pay the price for Whitey's action, by getting hefty jail sentences, so the question remains, was it really worth it! I suppose the buzz of having loads of power and money can get to your head but when your living on the edge, especially when you don't know when Whitey is going to turn on you, I'm not surprised that they all took the easy way out by confessing to there crimes. Anyway, it's definitely a watchable movie which I found quite interesting but I have seen better films in this genre. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: For Johnny Depp's preparation for this movie, he asked Whitey's lawyer if he could have access to the man himself but he didn't want any connection to the book, which is the basis of this film, so I'm just wondering, how much of it is true. The director, Scott Cooper, did have access to some of Whitey's fellow work mates, who actually showed up on set and the movie was made in Boston, we're a lot of the real events took place, so that will explain the realism that is felt through the film. Anyway, Scott Cooper has only directed 3 movies in his career, including this one, and I must admit, they have been pretty impressive. He first hit the scene in 2009 with the Academy award winning Crazy Heart and he also made Out of the Furnace which starred Christian Bale and Casey Affleck. After playing the leading role in Donnie Brasco and playing John Dillinger in Public Enemies, I'm not surprised that Scott picked Depp for the leading role and you can tell that he was fully committed to the movie but it still felt like there was something missing. It is put together well and the various characters were great but I was left feeling that it could have been better.<br/><br/>Budget: $53million Worldwide Gross: $100million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/crime/drama movies starring Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Adam Scott, David Harbour, Corey Stoll, Juno Temple and Julianne Nicholson. 6/10"
"brchthethird","7","1","2","16 March 2016"," Welcome back, Mr. Depp, we've missed you
","I really don't know a whole lot about James ""Whitey"" Bulger outside of what I got in the documentary about him that came out shortly before this film. Needless to say, he was quite an unsavory character, but interesting movies have been made about those types, even in the gangster genre. BLACK MASS didn't always work as an engaging story, despite combining two of my biggest interests (gangsters and true crime), because it never really focused on a particular aspect of the events and, as such, was a little unwieldy and never really let its characters develop. To be sure, it has an impressive cast and all of them do fine work, but few of them outside of Johnny Depp were given any room to make an impression. Still, this is a well-crafted film from a technical perspective, with excellent camera-work, a good score (courtesy of Junkie XL, no less), and a welcome return to form by Johnny Depp. This is the best I've seen him in years, possibly since DONNIE BRASCO. For all of the faults in the narrative structure, Johnny Depp is what makes this worth watching. There are times when he was legitimately frightening, even though a couple of these moments were partially given away in the trailers. Although BLACK MASS aspires to be in the same company as GOODFELLAS and DONNIE BRASCO, it doesn't quite live up to them, at least in terms of lasting quality and rewatchability. Still, it is a perfectly serviceable true crime tale with a top-notch performance by Depp, itself alone to recommend at least one viewing."
"pc95","6","1","2","12 March 2016"," Good Performances but Ho-Hum, and a bit disappointing
","(spoilers) I was expecting a bit more from director Scott Cooper's ""Black Mass"". It is repetitive in a poor way - featuring murder scene, dialog/exposition, repeat again and again. It hides under real events rather than illuminating them. Acting is satisfactory, but by the end of the movie it didn't matter. The movie was a mild bore. Moreover Johnny Depp's performance is decent, but overrated, and the screenplay is unoriginal - this is no ""Goodfellas"". There is little surprising, interesting, or fresh; and the movie just ends on an epilogue note. The production design, sets, and editing were pretty good but the violence was gratuitous and also repetitive - so altogther a little disappointing, but maybe worth one watch. 6/10"

","Whitey Bulger is one of the most notorious American criminals in history. His story is meant to be recorded on the big screen in order to document the overwhelming power and influence he had on the Boston mafia and on America. Sadly, ""Black Mass"" fails to do so. Even though Johnny Depp gives a cool and menacing portrayal of Bulger, the writing and directing is misplaced, focusing more on the cops than the criminals. If more focus was taken away from the FBi who negotiated and bribed the Boston gangster and was directed towards the man himself, then you'd have a story. Instead you get cop clich√©'s and the same broken record of a story played out that leads just as expected. Bulger's story is unique and dark, great material for a film. It's a shame that opportunity was missed."

","Scott Cooper has me on the outside looking in. I can't seem to get close to the main character, Whitey Bulger. Upon reflection, the director presents a main character whose look is hard to accept. Most everyone else in the film looks normal, but the Bulger character is almost like... maybe Benjamin Button-maybe not that overstated. But after I slept on it I am convinced that this choice holds the film back. A different choice would have been to let Depp just play the part virtually looking like he does in real life. That's the other extreme anyway. As it stands I have trouble approaching this Bulger, so I remain at a distance, watching but never am I inside, immersed. The film as it is leaves a lot of potential untapped."

","Dark Shadow, Transcendence, The Lone Ranger, Into the woods Mortdecai-heck, even Pirate of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides are all related. And they related together as a list of mediocre to universally derided films that A-list actor Johnny Depp has headlined in the past few years. Truth be told, the actor always seem comfortable in eccentric style of acting: playing unserious characters with the strangest of make-ups and costumes. Not to take anything away from the actor, but he has featured in serious roles, which are a far-cry from his comfort zones. But when an audience becomes accustomed to your playful nature in the movies, then it's hard to take you serious even when you are trying to be-exactly the case in (Transcendence) is.<br/><br/>In Black Mass, Johnny plays James ""Whitey"" Bulger: a notorious Boston gangster from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. Boldly, I can say this is one Depp's finest performance in the last five years if not in his whole career. He takes the character and makes it his own. That ""crime"" coating fits his every being and personality. He plays it in such a way that you dread meeting the personality real life: maniacal, dangerous, cold and calculating-his operandi of taking out potential enemies in the film while playing the crime boss of Boston's underworld is riveting. More so because he stares coldly into the eyes of each kill. This is one of those set-ups where the attributes of the real life figure doesn't matter because the person acting it out in front of you has done the most evil to convince you of how far that crime figure is willing to go.<br/><br/>Then, in an opposite demeanour, he seems empathetic. There are several scenes throughout the film where Johnny's character partakes in mob activities and at the same time takes part in playing the father/son/husband/brother figure. In the role of a son, he imbibes loyalty and respect-the role of a father, moral teacher and understanding-the role of a husband appropriate non-violence bouts of naughtiness. But in the underworld, he is ruthless as ever. Basically, the film avoids delving further into the past life of Whitey Bulger like a biopic would-starting only after his freedom after his first incarceration. And from there build upwards into his collaboration with the FBI and how he uses this advantage to gain the upper hand in running his activities uninterrupted.<br/><br/>The old school vibe of the film is solid considering the disco era of the 1970s and the film is not like of those that spotlights on how crime figures live an extravagant lifestyle. In a way, the film is self contained-much more like in a neighbourhood, which only aims to follow a group of friends around: in this case Johnny's character and his entourage, half of whom he kills. The film gave me another perspective on the city of Boston. Severally, the camera narrows in on empty streets and quiet neighbourhoods in a kind of everybody knows everybody when the citizens are shown while promoting their traditional values. No threads are explored. Here, it is all about the character of Whitey and how ironically the city's crime boss is the older brother to the most powerful politician in the state: played by Benedict Cumberbatch: a fascinating story for audience who decide to research the story.<br/><br/>The FBI complicity in the crimes are told through the story of supporting character Billy Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), much like how it happened real life. Furthermore, the supporting cast all get to shine in their own capacities. Dakota Johnson impresses playing Whitey's life-showing she has got range and could excel if given the right material to work with. Corey Stoll represents that no-nonsense lawyer willing to bring down the mob boss. And Benedict Cumberbatch is on that naive character side choosing to ignore his brother's crimes. For a crime drama, Black Mass is sharp, on-edge and spellbinding: an opportunity which Johnny Depp uses to remind us that he's still got talent."
"tomgillespie2002","6","1","2","11 February 2016"," Gets under your skin
","Over his impressively long career, Johnny Depp has adorned make-up and a variety of wigs, contact lenses and outlandish costumes to deliver a plethora of memorable (and not-so-memorable) characters, performed with a trademark flamboyance now simpatico with the actor. The success of these films, which are often seen through the Gothic lens of Tim Burton, makes it easy to forget that there is a good- looking actor capable of a fantastic 'normal' performance in there somewhere. Black Mass shows a bit of both sides. He has once again donned a rather distracting appearance - a set of pale blue eyes, a receding hairline and bulbous nose - to portray James ""Whitey"" Bulger, but there is also a terrific and unseen intensity to Depp here, convincingly scaring the s**t out of anyone he comes across.<br/><br/>Clearly channelling Scorsese visually, director Scott Cooper of Crazy Heart (2009) and Out of the Furnace (2013) fame skips his main character's rise to criminal overlord in favour of showing us just how much of a b*****d Bulger was (and probably still is). His otherworldly appearance, with blotchy skin and a mouth full of wonky brown teeth, is not how the real man looked but instead serves to highlight his monstrous nature. Bulger's activities are recollected by his former gang members Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons) and John Martorano (W. Earl Brown), who all have their own bone to pick with him by the end of their story. His willingness to murder and threaten whether it be for business, pleasure, or to simply stay out of jail led to Bulger becoming one of the most notorious criminals in Boston history.<br/><br/>In the beginning, Bulger is approached by FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a local boy, who offers him a free ticket to the top of the criminal underworld. It's not snitching, but a deal that benefits both sides as Connolly is served rival gang members on a plate, and Bulger gets to carry on with his illegal activities without the prying eyes of federal agents. Only Connolly seems to be enjoying peeking into the criminal high life a bit too much while Bulger gives him diddly squat. Bulger plays him like a fiddle, managing to silence a dinner table with murderous threats thinly disguised as jest in one stand-out scene. And Black Mass is at its best when the film moves into darker territory, cruelly teasing the inevitable brutality to come whenever a disposable minor character shuffles onto the scene.<br/><br/>Narratively, it's all over the place and tends to neglect detail in favour of more conventional biopic storytelling. In the few scenes he has, Benedict Cumberbatch oozes a subtle sliminess as Whitey's Massachusetts State Senate President brother Billy. The vastly different paths these two brothers took could have made for engaging drama and given the film more balance, but strangely Cooper chooses to almost ignore the relationship completely to concentrate on Bulger's dealing with the FBI, so Cumberbatch is criminally under- served. However, as silly as he looks, Depp is genuinely unsettling and, like the film as a whole, gets under your skin. Black Mass sounds like it should be a horror, and as the creepy real-life security footage plays out over the credits, its hard to deny that in many way it is."

","I am well aware of the cult status of Johnny Depp and the millions of fans he has around the world, but honestly, I was well tired of his Captain adventures and Burtonesque characters. The moment I saw his face with a balding head and grey hair, I thought: let's give this a chance. And it proved a great thing to do.<br/><br/>We all have seen mafia movies many times, and this in a way doesn't bring anything too new to that list. Turns out, you sort of expect the all too familiar spaghetti dinners, shots in the back of the head, and a police department that is more corrupt than you could imagine. Still, these elements always work. If they didn't, they would not continue to make movies out of it. Let's make some more really, I still enjoy them, especially if based on real events."
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","2","8 February 2016"," 1000 faces of delusion
","This is the typical gangster film, with rise and fall and a series of tense situations. It's not quite Goodfellas but in that same lineage of unspoken titillation at what sociopaths get away with; it seems we'll always want to be flies-in-the-wall in the same room with horrible men, tiptoe out from our lives of social convention to sneak a peak at a life of gross irresponsibility.<br/><br/>Of the two things that stand out in this peak one is Depp continuing to be our current Lon Chaney Sr; here donning a ghastly new face and glacial stare as Boston mobster who menaces everyone, adding another face to the Depp gallery. I would love to see him as Dr. Mabuse.<br/><br/>It's the usual gangster role since Cagney first delighted us by tearing holes at the life of convention, only with the studied reserve that Depp brings to films. Cagney threw himself at the room, Depp glides cautiously. Whereas others would simply have played a guy, you can tell that he has spent copious time constructing, studying mannerisms and inflections. It seems that he almost always needs the remove of a mask from which to immerse himself.<br/><br/>The other thing that I liked here is that we don't just have crime plots and counterplots but these understood in the light of what gives rise to a profoundly illogical world at large; ours, as we spy shades of it daily in the news.<br/><br/>People come together to create bonds and form alliances, mobsters against another more dominant fraction, mobsters and Feds in cahoots against that faction, mobsters and Florida businessmen skimming together off the top, mobsters and IRA in alliance for the good of a cause, other Feds against the corrupt former ones. We see enough of it to imagine that it goes on forever in myriad guises.<br/><br/>Bonds of this kind being a matter of seeing yourself in a common ground with others, this ground is always constructed on the basis of shared storytelling. It can be loyalty or justice, or having grown up in the same neighborhood. But when this internal logic is upheld against common human sense, that ends up creating deluded human beings and an illogical world, one where a law agency turns a blind eye to crime in one side of the city to quash it in another, only to find the whole city still festered with it.<br/><br/>You'll see tribal allegiances of this kind whenever humanity is beset by violence and oppression, sometimes as response. This is true from mafia and drug cartels to the cartels of financiers and politicians. It's - partly but significantly - why the Middle East is full of rips in the fabric and only held together with brute force.<br/><br/>Interestingly we're shown that all the relevant information that helped them make progress were already available to them in the depositions of informants, Bulger gave them nothing of substance. The whole plot was to no avail, all they needed was in plain sight of them, if only they had looked."
"SquigglyCrunch","8","1","2","26 January 2016"," All Around a Great Movie
","I was interested in seeing this movie, considering it's ratings are the quickest falling ones I've ever seen (going from a 9.5 to a 7.2 in a couple weeks), I was curious as to how good it actually was, and I'm happy to say that it's actually a very impressive film. <br/><br/>The plot is very good. The idea is great, and it actually feels like it could be real. It is based off a true story though, so you'd hope so. It manages to pull off it's plot very well too. It's interesting and although I didn't always know who the minor characters were I always figured out what their importance was, plus they were minor so it didn't matter too much. Despite progressing over the course of 10 years and showing barely any of it, it's still paced relatively well too. <br/><br/>The characters are good. While I couldn't always tell the difference between some characters (two specifically) you knew the ones who were important pretty well. The secondary characters didn't receive a whole lot of development, nor a lot of screen time. It didn't take away from the movie though. The two main characters, Whitey and Connolly, were great. The acting on their parts were fantastic too, especially Johnny Depp. It's to be expected, but he was perfect for the role. He's intimidating, a little scary, but he still makes Whitey feel like a real person that you could almost sympathize with. Joel Edgerton as John Connolly was great too, but Depp was still the star in terms of acting.<br/><br/>While the first hour of the movie is well-paced, the last hour isn't so much. I found myself glancing at the lasting run time often, only to see that only 5-10 minutes had gone by. It wasn't that it was uninteresting, the last hour was fantastic, but it was a little slow. <br/><br/>Going into this movie I thought there'd be a bit of action (gun fights, etc.), but that didn't happen. Normally when a movie isn't the genre that I expected, it ends up not being as enjoyable, but this movie still managed to hold my interest, despite my expectations. <br/><br/>Overall Black Mass is great. It's got a great, well-executed plot, great characters and acting, and decent pacing. Maybe I'll just have to see it again. I'm certainly looking forward to doing so. In the end I would certainly recommend Black Mass to anyone looking for an awesome crime drama, just don't expect a whole lot of fights, because like I said, it's a drama."
"AudioFileZ","6","1","2","13 January 2016"," Too Much Like A 60-Minutes Story With A Big Budget
","After watching Black Mass one has a detached feeling. A feature length film about a real criminal who had a long reign of running a criminal enterprise should seek to invest the viewer into the events as well as the man, Black Mass seems more like a glimpse that never reels one in to the time, the crime, and, most importantly never exposes much about the central figures. You really do not know more than, say, what a 15-minute 60 Minutes expose would reveal.<br/><br/>The frustration begins with the use of Johnny Depp's James ""Whitey"" Bulger character. Depp does an excellent job of creating the image of Bulger, but somewhere the writers seem to gloss over what his reign of crime in Boston was actually costing in depravity and murder. It was a truly bizarre reign with a psychopathic Bulger controlling everything the FBI was pinning on the Mafia. How did a government agency with the power to clean up both The Mafia and Bulger get so used? Whatever was going on was somehow made possible by one John Connolly who for unknown reasons, other than what we're told is Southie loyalty, constructed a false story of Bulger being a high-value informant. One can only deduce Connally was, in reality, also a member of The Winter Hill Gang who idolized Bulger and ruined his life to ""impress"" the man. Joel Edgerton, like Depp, delivers shades of brilliance as Connolly only to be let down by what the writers glossed over. I simply think as viewers we aren't allowed to know these men in any revelatory way. Jesse Plemons portrayal, with limited screen time, as Bulger's lackey Kevin Weeks is far more revealing. We actually feel who he is a rough street kid without anything other than his devotion to Bulger. The same can be said for W. Earl Brown's dumb murdering thug Martorano and David Harbour's FBI agent John Morris as the we know better what kind of men these were even without lengthy development. It makes the omission of what and who Bulger and Connolly were all the more frustrating.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see Depp really bring Bulger to the full light of day you simply won't get that. One feels Depp had the goods, and was in the mindset, to do so, but the writers failed to use him properly. This was just a recreation of an extremely topical overview with A-list talent instead. For those with an avid interest it may still, however, be worth a watch, for others not so much."
"schroeder-gustavo","7","1","2","9 December 2015"," Johnny Depp becomes Whitey Bulger
","This may seem like a bold statement, but this might just be Johnny Depp's best performance of all time. Depp's always been one of my favorite actors and I just loved that he decided to do this movie, because, despite his talent, it just felt to me the characters he portrayed lately are kind of Tim Burton parodied versions of himself or something. But I love that he went for this project, because he absolutely nailed it, big time. His performance is flawless, but let's talk about some of the other actors in the film who are also great. Benedict Cumberbatch nails the Boston accent, surprisingly, he's great. Joel Edgerton is also pretty fantastic in the move, as well. However, the unfortunate reality of Black Mass, is that it's enormously elevated by its performances, particularly Depp's. I wasn't really invested in the story as I should have been and the plot moves achingly slow. What they really should have done is they should have focused almost entirely on Johnny Depp's character, because every scene he's in is pretty much the best scenes in the film. The entire under the table stuff with the FBI simply didn't do it for me, and it's really a shame because it's like the entire second half of the film focuses entirely on that. However, I do think Black Mass is a good movie, it's just not a great one. But it's worth the price of admission simply to see Johnny Depp."
"seanferguson13","6","1","2","30 November 2015"," Something was missing....
","I can't argue with the fact that Black Mass achieved commercial success. It also managed to transform you into the time and place of the setting and wrap you around the prevailing mood. It was good direction in my opinion. The director achieved what he could achieve with the tools he had.<br/><br/>My criticism comes in two broad veins: (1) casting/appearance and (2) script.<br/><br/>Jonny Depp is an excellent actor but the prosthetics used on his face made him look like Jonny Depp but not like Jonny Depp at the same time. And I couldn't help but get distracted by it perpetually. Those blue contact lenses were the worst offender. I was waiting for the point where this piercing ""blueness"" was weaved into the story and the character of Whitey somehow - and whilst subtly this was achieved - it wasn't enough to take away from the distraction. In addition why on earth was Benedict Cumberbatch in this film? He looked woefully out of place. He didn't look like his family in anyway and his role appeared to be to just remind everyone Whitey had a brother who was a politician. Alternatively it was just a name to add to the credits and posters. An unknown would have been perfect for this. The ""pulling power"" of stars like Cumberbatch has its place in cinema (rightly or wrongly) but this was a film about Whitey and the focus should have been on his story. These two issues served to stir you back into reality every now and again and the story (which I'll come to) lost its grasp on you.<br/><br/>The story. I mean it is what it is right? Whitey was a gangster, loved by most of his community, made a pact with the FBI, fell out of favour with the FBI, went on the run, got caught. There's not much variation to work with; but the film was crying out for a big scene or a middle or an end. There were none. In fact I was so surprised that the end of the film arrived that I double checked that people were leaving. It was almost as if production went sh*t - lets end here. There was nothing about his life on the run; nothing about the fates of the major characters (other than the text on screen); the film demanded that. We got no ""fall from grace"" and hardship. Instead we got high life, trouble with the law, the end.<br/><br/>That said, Jonny Depp's performance (prosthetics aside) was fantastic though I wouldn't rank this alongside The Departed, Goodfellas, Godfather etc..."

Also starring Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon, the film provides varieties of five star performances, and scenes.<br/><br/>When you meet Bulger on screen, it's not Johnny Depp it is Whitey Bulger, and he has a danger zone cover his entire body space, one you cross it, you will be in the ground. He's scary, and a nightmare for a neighbour, and if you think that sounds negative, it's completely far from it, if an actor achieves this description in a film, then you know a great performer.<br/><br/>If you want to know more on Boston's gangster history, then Black Mass is a film that will peak your interest, but also make you discuss. Although it not be as acclaimed as classics such as the Godfather, and Goodfellas, this film is still a brilliant biography of a dangerous criminal.<br/><br/>Black Mass is a must see performance by Depp, although maybe not being the absolute must see film of the year, but still a thrilling, magnificent piece of work.

"erinbecker","7","1","2","23 November 2015"," I expected more
","James ""Whitey"" Bulger is one of the most interesting phenomena on the American crime scene. Not only that he is a colorful character, but also his criminal career was quite distinctive, as well as later life. For 20 years he ruled the Boston underworld, and then he spent 16 years on the run. He served as a model for Martin Scorsese for the character of Frank Costello in The Departed, the eccentric mobster who put their his spies in the police, masterfully played by Jack Nicholson. Here we have Black Mass by Scott Cooper with Johnnie Depp in the role of James Bulger. Deep finally has a chance to really play a character. Black Mass is not a boring movie and a movie without style, but it still lacks that certain something. You can find it in few individual scenes, but it was not enough to improve the impression of a film that lasts two hours."

The writing got stagnant and really lacked development at points. As a viewer, I really had a hard time keeping my attention on what was going on as the movie progressed. The supporting cast looks great on paper with Joel Edgerton, Bennedict Cumberbach, Dakota Johnson, and Kevin Bacon. Unfortunately, The rest of the cast underperformed, essentially wasting how great Depp performed. Joel Edgerton was the most disappointing of them all. He overacted on a lot of scenes and really didn't seem to fit the flow of the movie. Bennedict Cumberbach had a chance to really step up for the rest of the cast as well, but just gave an average performance as Whitey's brother. With all this in mind, Johnny really did come through and save an average movie. His performance is worth the watch."
"pyrocitor","7","1","2","4 October 2015"," ""Strictly criminal""
","The gangster film is a notoriously hard nut to crack these days, as there's the constant threat of being in somebody's shadow. In reconciling the juggling act of the inherent fun of criminal transgressions and the necessary solemn Hollywood moralizing hangover from the James Cagney days, do you opt for operatic and lyrical (Coppola), showy, stylized and irreverent (Scorsese), or flinty realism (Michael Mann or The Wire)? Even worse ‚Äì are you audacious enough, in the face of the omnipresent elephant in the room (what is there left to say, apart from the time-worn moral of 'Crime pays until it doesn't'?), to try something new in the pressure to avoid standing on the shoulders of giants, all without cracking under the pressure? Fuggeddaboutit! <br/><br/>Thankfully, director Scott Cooper isn't fussy about trying to turn the genre on its head, focusing less on innovation and more on doing it really well. As such, Black Mass, despite being a tale as old as time, is a steady, solid, immaculately stylistic, and impressively emotive gangster film. Changing the setting to Bahstan (what's The Depahted? This is a fah*kin' TRUE story!) lends fierce energy to the familiar ideologies of family and betrayal in the mob, while structuring the story around retroactive testimonies of Whitey Bulger's former associates lends the film a fresher framework (just don't say it rips off Citizen Kane, if you don't want to be buried under the dahcks). <br/><br/>Cooper is an expert at pacing, injecting bursts of furious violence into innocuous scenes to give a sense of the palpable tension inherent in being in the presence of the temperamentally psychotic Bulger, with everything from offhand comments to bad table manners being grounds for a bullet through the head. Cleverly, however, to counterbalance Bulger's inherent trashiness, Masanobu Takayanagi's crisp cinematography and the engagingly somber musical score by Tom Holkenborg (building off his more bombastic work in this year's Mad Max: Fury Road) lend the film a distinctly classical feel not dissimilar with the title's theological allusions. While the screenplay occasionally dips too liberally into 'trailer sting expositionary one-liners' territory, for the most part, things crackle with enough impressive verisimilitude that, apart from a brief third-act lull, command attention throughout. <br/><br/>Why Cooper decided to shroud Johnny Depp in such distractingly flamboyant makeup and electric blue contact lenses is beyond me (the real Whitey Bulger didn't look that corpse- like¬Ö), but thankfully Depp is a skilled enough performer to own his sallow lizard look, rather than being out-acted by his makeup. Conversely, this is the liveliest and most riveting we've seen Depp in years of drowning in Disney sequels and spinoffs ‚Äì charming (the film's most poignant scene is an unassuming Bulger allowing his mother to win against him at gin, or pressing pause on a heist to help an elderly lady carry her groceries up the stairs), haunted, and savage, sometimes all simultaneously, Depp's Whitey Bulger is an incendiary performance, and it would be a genuine shock to see him go unrecognized at this year's Academy Awards. <br/><br/>Keen to not be overshadowed, the stellar ensemble cast all sell their character vignettes with aplomb. Joel Edgerton offers a deliciously jeer-worthy cocktail of simpering and swagger as the FBI agent who enlists Bulger as an informant out of a misplaced sense of childhood reverence, only to be exploited as Bulger bloats his criminal empire under the FBI's nose (the always excellent Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott add gravitas to the grimacing in these FBI interludes). Slightly hammy Bahstan accent aside, Benedict Cumberbatch is thoroughly charismatic with only a whiff of sleaze as Bulger's senatorial brother, while Dakota Johnson is 50 Shades of assertive here, fuming with increasingly fearful contempt, as Edgerton's wife. Rory Cochrane and Jesse Plemons carry an air of sadness as Bulger's second-in-command confidants, ashamed of what they've been sucked into yet aware that failure to commit would mean death, while even Juno Temple is a heartbreaking (single) scene stealer as Cochrane's underage prostitute girlfriend. Finally, in the overacting department, Peter Sarsgaard quivers with barely grounded manic paranoia as a dimwitted Californian witness testifying against Bulger, while Corey Stoll, still exuding Ant-Man levels of nuance (sarcasm), does more yelling than acting as the DA determined to bring down Bulger. <br/><br/>Don't start throwing out comparisons to more revered gangster pics, or Black Mass will only, inevitably, suffer by comparison. Sometimes, it's enough to take a familiar recipe and marinate it in basic ingredients with consummate skill. Just don't disclose the recipe to Whitey Bulger, or that could get you buried real quick. Just sayin'. <br/><br/>-7.5/10"

","Everyone knew Johnny Depp had talent, but it had been so long since we had a great performance from him, that I think we all started to wonder if he was ever going to return to form. Well, I think Black Mass can put that to rest. Not only is Depp stellar, but the film is actually really well done. I was really impressed by the entire production of the film and it was such a relief to see that the film was well done after months of hoping.<br/><br/>Even though James 'Whitey' Bulger is a real life person, I wasn't too familiar with the story behind his days in South Boston. I had seen what Jack Nicholson had done with his character in The Departed, which is supposedly based on Bulger, but not much else. Depp gives Bulger a less comedic and far more chilling side to him than Nicholson did. I think the more surprising part of the film was the performance of Joel Edgerton as the FBI accomplice, John Connolly, and partner in crime so to speak to Bulger for so many years. <br/><br/>That was the part of the story that really grabbed me more than anything else. The relationship of Connolly and Bulger and just how manipulative the one side was to the other. But also that Connolly looked up to Bulger and got caught up in the lifestyle of getting promotions and going to high profile parties that he lost site of what the mission was. But also, that Bulger wasn't portrayed as an all out monster. I like that we get to see that he was a loving father and even family man. He did some awful things but we can't forget the part that some of the FBI played in allowing things to happen the way they did.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also deserves high praise. It was one of the best ensemble pieces this year. Heck, even Dakota Johnson was terrific in her small but pivotal role. But Scott Cooper, the director, may have been the hero here. The tension and pacing rivaled some of Scorsese's best mob films. I won't be surprised if the film is nominated at the Oscars and Depp is nominated as well. It was a really well done quote on quote biopic. Or at least as close as we will get to knowing what the streets of 'Southie' were like.

"Quinoa1984","7","2","7","1 October 2015"," Depp is scary (and scary great) in this mostly-ensemble crime drama
","There's a scene in Black Mass where James Bulger (aka Whitey, though you just call him Jimmy, of course) wants to find out what's wrong with John Connolly's wife. He's over for dinner and she's upstairs the whole time, supposedly not feeling well (in reality, she hates his guts, and is growingly resentful of her husband for associating with him). He goes up the stairs and knocks on her door - she's reading The Exorcist, by the way, probably unintentionally getting her in the mood for something frightening - and she opens to door to Jimmy. He touches John's wife's face, holds her neck (or, rather, just barely misses choking her) in checking to see if she's warm or hot or whatever. And it's in a moment like this, not the only one but clear as day, that Depp's performance as Bulger turns into something out of a horror movie: his Bulger is scary as f***, and what's most scary is the seeming lack of anything human outside of the darkness of the soul.<br/><br/>It doesn't happen like that form the start, however; Bulger's darkness deepens as the film goes on - in this version of events, going from about 1975 to maybe the mid 90's or the late 80's - due to the deaths of two of his family members. One of them hits him harder than the other, but with each one he smiles less and less (as one of the informants being interviewed - one of the connecting glues of the narrative is the voice-over testimony of those who built up the Bulger case, only the IRA makes him happy), and he even has the look of Nosferatu. The contact lenses, the flaky white skin, the hair pulled back - this is Depp immersing himself and creating a different kind of crime lord.<br/><br/>While he starts off as a guy we've seen in other movies, as the man who won't take s*** from any low-lifes and has no compunction about beating a guy's head in or shooting a man in broad daylight in a parking lot, somehow his presence grows more ominous in Black Mass. Even the title evokes something that Mario Bava might've made in the 1960's, with only a vague connection to religion. To put it another way, at one point he's lying back, resting with his eyes closed, and his arms and hands over his chest give the impression of a vampire inside of a coffin.<br/><br/>This is a crime epic, however, so he is not the only character of note. On the contrary, it may actually be more FBI agent John Connolly's story, here played by Joel Edgerton, as he is the one who is really having to give some more subtle acting here. OK, maybe not all the time - it's often a nervous, forceful performance, and Edgerton, as he's shown in Great Gatsby and (the best parts of) Exodus, has that to spare - but he is a person who starts off trying to use a connection to his advantage. He's know Bulger, and his brother (a local politician played by Cumberbatch), since they were kids, and there's a kind of street-level-South-Boston loyalty there. Also the fact of, you know, not wanting to p-off a volcanic force like Whitey Bulger. So an 'alliance' is made (not to be confused, were told more than once by Connolly, of 'informant'-like procedure) and a plan is hatched that his department reluctantly agrees to: Bulger gives the FBI info on Italian mob gangs and families, they leave Bulger alone.<br/><br/>It's certain the filmmakers had to leave some details out - it's a two hour film covering decades of criminal activity and rocky investigations - and there are one or two moments things get conflated for dramatic effect, like when Kevin Bacon's FBI chief is about to throw out the whole case and at this exact moment a wire-tap with crucial information on the Italians comes through. But what's impressive to me about Black Mass is that director Scott Cooper and his writers are able to make a possibly convoluted story accessible and exciting and absorbing; only a section in the middle, about a scheme involving Jai-Alai, needs some close attention paid (and even there the presence of Peter Sarsgaard as a drug-addled killer makes things pop and entertaining). But with Connolly, there's an emotional core and conflict that helps to offset the hellish backdrop that comes with Bulger; do we feel sorry for this man, or perhaps enjoy his downfall, which we know will come? Edgerton makes him a little more sympathetic, or just understandable in his actions, than if it had been by another actor, though he's one of a piece of what makes the film work well.<br/><br/>Black Mass, with its brutal killings and violence and deaths that come not unexpectedly but not less in a grisly style, doesn't reach greatness overall, but there's a lot of great things that come about it, individual scenes. Watch as Jimmy and his girlfriend argue as to what to do about their son (Dakota Johnson in a small but pivotal performance, like, good God she can act THIS well), or how Bulger taunts an impressionable Agent Moore at a table with a 'joke' over a family secret recipe. Depp is acting his tail off here - surely his best work since Sweeney Todd - but the rest of the cast is so strong that most of the conventional elements or directing decisions can be overlooked. 7.5/10"

","Godfatheresque. Goodfellas: The Joe Pesci Story. A Mystic River makeover. These are the words I would use to describe Black Mass (the flick I'm about to review). Is it my pick for best of the year? So far. Will it sustain Academy Awards momentum right into 2016? That remains to be seen. Either way, it's a knockout, a small-time mob yarn with plenty of attitude. To quote the Standells, ""love that dirty water, oh Boston you're my home"".<br/><br/>The direction in Black Mass is pragmatic and crisp. And although I've never seen Scott Cooper's earlier work, I liked his 2013 release being the Christian Bale vehicle, Out of the Furnace. In ""Furnace"", Cooper made it all about the performances while letting the conveying sensibilities fall into narrow territory. With ""Mass"", he now gets everything just right. There's a flowing timeline from the year 1975 all the way up to 2011. It's safe to say that real-life gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger, gets his rightful, Hollywood due (don't worry folks, this dude is still a despicable human being).<br/><br/>As for the lead, well Mr. Johnny Depp sports hair-raising contact lenses and a grayed-up, receding hairline. He plays the Bulger character the same way Daniel Day Lewis took over the proceedings in There Will Be Blood. Both troupers are in almost every frame, both of them hold the screen as if it's a thimble, and both are larger than life. Truth be told, Depp's been a bad guy in other films but for some reason, this is his most vicious turn I can think of. He's certainly not likable, you don't root for him (you don't really root for anybody in this thing), and when he strangles a teenage prostitute after posing as her confidant, it just breaks your heart. Honestly, Johnny boy goes so far down the rabbit hole with Bulger's intellect that you forgot it's actually him. Good old Edward Scissorhands is too nice of an actor to kill someone and then tell everybody he's about to take a nap. Right?<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Mass"" with its Bostonian setting, its multiple scenes of people dying in broad daylight, and its freewheeling, seventies soundtrack, runs mostly in flashback (this does in fact, work to its advantage). Nobody and I mean nobody, does gloom and doom or dirty and grubby like Scott Cooper. The present day sequences which are inserted throughout, involve FBI interrogations with various members of ""Whitey's"" delinquent crew (they are known as the Winter Hill Gang). Unabashedly, the movie begins in the mid 70's as it chronicles Bulger's rise via the criminal food chain in Southie. He's the upper echelon of savagery, he's a murderer, he's a drug dealer, and he becomes an eventual informant for the Feds. Why you ask? So he can take down a fellow mafia chain trying to cut in on his regional turf.<br/><br/>Now a lot of critics and audience members (around the world) have touted this cinematic conch as quote unquote, ""Johnny Depp's movie"" or ""Johnny Depp's show"". I have to digress. It's much more than that. Many great actors here fade in and out. That in no way diminishes the effect of ""Black's"" stagnant (and straight ahead) entertainment value. Benedict Cumberbatch plays effectively, Bulger's senator brother (William Bulger). Dakota Johnson is solid in a couple of scenes as his girlfriend and mother of his dying child. Then you have Kevin Bacon in rage mode playing a torn FBI boss (Mr. Charles McGuire). Finally, you get a quiet, off-kilter hit-man in Rory Cochrane. As Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi (""Whitey's"" right-hand man), he doesn't say much yet his screen presence gives off apprehension in the worst way.<br/><br/>So for what's it's worth, ""Mass"" has the cojones to kick in the door and possibly kick you in the teeth. It's a gangster pic scaled down to the bare minimum (for my money, that's a good thing). Bottom line: A great cast, a few Scorsese-like exterior shots, a top five performance from Depp, clean editing, and some tasty Massachusetts locales give you the final rub. Yeah it's violent, yeah it's unforgiving, and yeah it's altogether antagonistic. But Black Mass checks in as a winner pretty much the whole way. My rating: 3 and a half stars."

","His Whitey Bulger looks so terrifying it gives you the chills. He is a viper that takes everyone down with him. That's the bottom-line! The crux of the biopic! James Whitey Bulger, the most notorious criminal was doomed, and he took everyone close to him, with him, to hell.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper makes Whitey Bulger an unpredictable psychopathic albino criminal to make him look not only bad-ass but extremely dreadful too. Johnny Depp ensures he nails the character in Cooper's head to perfection. Scott does change a lot of facts and messes with reality to emphasize on his character. In doing so he misses out on a lot of crucial factors to wrap a biopic.<br/><br/>At no point are we introduced to Angiulo or his involvements. What is quite surprising is the fact that Cooper chose to manifest dispensable characters like FBI Agent Robert Fitzpatrickand Lindsey Cyr instead. The editing of the movie isn't that great. You see a lot of characters in the biopic who are built quickly from scratch, but unfortunately are not handed enough. Cameos basically suppressed under Bulger noise!<br/><br/>Who we must not forget in this rad Bulger tale, is the contribution of John Connolly played by Joel Edgerton. He is always there. The backbone of Jimmy's rise. The FBI behind every crime. He saves his ass literally all the time, and fights with Charles Mcguire (Kevin Bacon) and convinces John Morris (David Harbour) into helping him.<br/><br/>There are frightening bits in the movie where Depp turns Jimmy off and then on just like that, characterizing his psychotic and unpredictable nature.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't cash on its screenplay, and is entirely dependent on Jimmy Bulger and things that surround him. The score of the movie is great, as violin breaks the silence with its brilliant depth. Sometimes absent, the music is only played at the right areas for emphasis.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>So Cooper's Bulger isn't exactly smart. He is sleazy and basically rolls on favours of people close to him. The fact that he works under the aegis of John Connolly and Billy Burger, where John is ever ready to save Jimmy's ass is what gives wings and balls to Bulger. The movie doesn't highlight all his murders but depicts two or three. Others are shown being committed by his accomplices.<br/><br/>A lot of fact changing actually steers the movie from a biopic to a fiction. It appears stale if compared to other great crime stories. The introduction and conclusion of Brian Halloran to the story was too distasteful. At one point you almost think, Jimmy has a plan when he asks Brian to take the bag of cash and leave. But then it was just plain talk! It was hard to imagine the character, who you were hoping doesn't do normal, to do the 'simplest of things'.<br/><br/>If we don't look at all the minute details and enjoy the movie with a popcorn, we can see Depp's brilliant acting, Joel Edgerton's persistence and loyalty, Benedict's style and a great criminal story that reeks of perversion the moment it enters the police line. Overall the movie was good. If there was someone who was ensuring that, without much in their baggage, it was Depp and Edgerton all along."

","Just recently saw ""Black Mass"" from director Scott Cooper and I must say that it's a well done and informative look at the life and times of real life Boston criminal Whitey Bulger(played to near perfection by Johnny Depp). The film goes thru three decades starting in the 1970's to showcase the rise and power going up thru the ranks of crime and it's very violent and blunt in the scenes of blood and murder. Yet along the way bad boy Bulger is helped along with his rise to power by being an informant to the police to take down rival street gangs and other Mafia members on other turfs. Slowly but surely South Boston is controlled by Whitey yet the FBI is showcased as corrupt especially agent John Connolly(Joel Edgerton)as he and others look the other way when information about Bulger comes in it's like fear with bribes and payoffs on the side! Overall good film of greed, corruption, violence that tells the rise and fall of one of the most known criminals ever. And thumbs up to Johnny Depp for a kick butt performance."
"paul-allaer","8","2","8","19 September 2015"," Solid mobster crime drama with a stellar Johnny Depp
","""Black Mass"" (2015 release; 122 min.) brings the story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger (played by Johnny Depp), the infamous Boston mobster. As the movie opens, we see one of Bulger's associates strike a deal with the FBI to spill everything (""I want it on record, I'm not a rat"", ha!). We then flash back to ""1975, South Boston"", and we get to know Bulger and his small circle of trusted associates. In a parallel story, we get to know FBI agent John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton), also a 'Southie' who has just returned to Boston. Connolly convinces Bulger to become an FBI informant (which Bulger hopes will help him eliminate the rival mobsters from North Boston). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, the is the latest movie from up-and-coming director Scott Cooper, who earlier brought us the excellent films ""Crazy Heart"" (2009) and ""Out of the Furnace"" (2013). Unlike those movies, he did not write the script for ""Black Mass"" not thought up the story (the film is based on the book of the same name). That does not diminish Cooper's merits with this one, as Cooper strikes the right tone and brings us a gritty and hard-as-nails crime drama. If tough language (the F bomb drops frequently) or violence (yes, people will get hurt and killed), then do yourself a favor and stay away from this. The best part of the movie for me is as we see the noose getting tighter and tighter around Bulger's neck (figuratively speaking) and options are starting to diminish. Second, the performance from Johnny Depp is nothing short of stellar, reconfirming our (ebbing) belief that this is a top notch actor,. It makes you cringe just thinking of some of the other recent movies he's done (""Mordecai"", anyone?). Depp is almost unrecognizable as the infamous mobster. There are a TON of other noteworthy performances, including from Kevin Bacon (as the head of the Boston FBI), but also Adam Scott as another FBI agent, Benedict Cumberbatch as Billy Bulger (the bother who was a state senator), and Dakota Johnson as Bulger's girlfriend. Solid work all around. Kudos as well to the production team for painstakingly recreating the late 70s/early 80s, making the movie a true period piece. Be sure to stick around when the end credits start rolling, as we get a bunch of archive video footage and pictures from the real people, just fascinating.<br/><br/>I had been looking forward to seeing this. The movie opened this weekend and I went to see it right away. the early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was very well attended, somewhat to my surprise, given the tough nature of the movie. With the summer blockbusters in the rearview mirror, maybe people are ready for something completely altogether. ""Black Mass"" surely is that. If you are in the mood for a tough crime drama featuring Johnny Depp at its best, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Black Mass"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"subxerogravity","9","2","9","19 September 2015"," Johnny Depp at his very best!
","It was an fantastic ensemble cast all around with even the smallest role being crafted by a gifted actor.<br/><br/>The narrative was a slow ride filled with intense drama as Black Mass tells the true story of a small time gangster who was able to climb to the top of south Boston's underworld thanks to a deal he had with FBI agent, John Connolly. <br/><br/>Sometimes the Boston accents seemed slightly too much, especially when everyone had the attitude down so well and really set up the gritty environment the movie was portraying. The cinematography even adds to it making every thing not so Hollywood beautiful but very real to the events that happen between 1975 to 1995. <br/><br/>But the real magic in Black Mass is Mr. Depp who showed much depth in his acting. I've seen pictures where Depp would engulf himself into a character, Like with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were he also sports a bald head, but that was a black comedy that exploited his well documented sense of humor, but playing James ""Whitey"" Bulger, met leaving as little as Depp as possible,to become unrecognizable.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp created an outstanding achievement in acting in this generation's version of Good Fellas. it's a must see."

The story of Bulger and Connolly is fascinating in itself and Black Mass succeeds in realistically showing its most interesting aspects and motives of the people involved. Joel Edgerton and Benedict Cumberbatch give solid performances but Johnny Depp deserves all credit for his portrayal of Bulger, one of his best in years. It actually makes you feel why people were terrified of Bulger. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in crime or thrillers."

","Black Mass (2015) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Violent telling of Boston criminal James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) who started as just a small crook but quickly rose to be one of the biggest crime lords out there. A lot of this was due to his childhood friend John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a FBI agent, who began working with the criminal in exchange for information.<br/><br/>BLACK MASS really wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be but there's no question that it's a solid film that managed to features some very good performances. I think the film falls short of being great for a number of reasons but one of the biggest is the fact that we've seen this type of gangster film countless times before and there's really nothing here that separates this film from various others out there.<br/><br/>I will say that the best thing about the film was the performance from Depp who really sinks his teeth into this role. Depp had been criticized for some of his film choices over the past few years but this is certainly him jumping back into the game and showing what he can do. I thought he was extremely good here and especially with that coldness he brought the character. He's surrounding by some nice support from Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard, Rory Cochrane and Dakota Johnson.<br/><br/>The gangster genre has delivered some of the greatest movies ever made and it's created some rather by-the-number films that were quickly forgotten. I wouldn't say this film is going to be forgotten but it's certainly not going to reach the levels of GOODFELLAS, THE GODFATHER or WHITE HEAT. With that said, there's a nice little story here, some great performances and some graphic violence that makes it worth watching."
"dyricci","9","1","3","20 February 2016"," Absolutely Perfect.
","Johnny Depp rarely disappoints and most especially does not here. Scott Cooper has assembled a superb supporting cast, and elicited brilliant performances from them all around. It is absolutely beautifully shot...the lighting, angles, tone...everything. Dark and emotional, yet with an undertone of functional coldness. It mirrors the characters, the emotional tone of the content, as well as the era. Coupled with a poignant score throughout, ranging from funk/disco to classic strings, you are taken on an emotional ride touching all bases. Be advised: this is not an action shoot- 'em-up gangster flick. This is a journey into the mind and soul.<br/><br/>Blood, honor, and loyalty...peppered with more than a touch of psychopathy. Bulger is a complicated and conflicted man and Depp seems to have captured all of him, especially his humanity, flawed as we all can be. I sincerely hope that he sees this film & realizes the honor Johnny has done him in this portrayal."

You're left with a yearning for a 'mov'ie but presented with something akin to stills. <br/><br/>Sure it has one or two moments, but with such an excellent ensemble, you expect good things from the movie and it just fails. <br/><br/>It could have been a great crime drama..look at departed or Donnie Brasco.

"brendandevere","8","1","3","12 October 2015"," Depp is Black!
","James 'Whitey' Bulger is a name that I had been unfamiliar with and even after a quick google search whilst waiting for the film to begin, Boston's most infamous Irish mob boss was still an unknown quantity. My lack of knowledge into the life and crimes of Jimmy Bulger worked in my favour, enabling me to sit back, relax and enjoy the film without the inevitable comparisons that Depp was receiving in his portrayal of the 'Real McCoy'. I made a mental note to allow the film to naturally unfold knowing that most mob/crime genre films are immediately compared unfairly to such classics as 'Goodfellas' and 'The Godfather'.<br/><br/>'Black Mass' deserves a good write-up because it is simply a good film. Depp's impeccable performance as the psychotic Bulger shows the doubters how good an actor he really is when given a character full of meat and less salad. Depp's scary portrayal drives the movie to heights that it otherwise would not have got to with a lesser craftsman. Johnny may have not looked exactly like Bulger but he wasn't far off it and his manner might of reminded us all of Ray Liotta out of 'Goodfellas' but the way in which he delivered his character was nothing short of superb. Depp's blue-eyed stare would have been disturbing for anyone on the receiving end and the ruthless nature that he goes about eliminating anyone that crosses him would have the best of us packing up and flying to a different planet. Johnny Depp may fall short of the ultimate gong at award season time but a nomination would not be unjustified.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) hasn't done his Directing any harm with a film that won't look out of place in its genre. It may not get the same kudos as the mafia classics but it has a sound narrative driven by some outstanding talent. Cooper's main goal was to highlight the ferociousness of one of America's most dangerous men and the alliance he had with the FBI. Bulger becomes an informant for the Fed's so they can bring down rival mobsters that ruled the city of Boston in the 1970's and 80's. For the information that Bulger provides, he and his Winter Hill Gang are able to rise up from Boston's 'Southies' Projects and stake a claim to being the city's number one mobsters. Australia's very own Joel Edgerton plays the corrupt Fed, John Connelly, who is able to keep the aggressive Bulger in business. Edgerton is now at the top of his game in Hollywood and carries himself well along side the tremendous Depp. Benedict Cumberbatch brings star quality to his role as Jimmy Bulger's politically aligned brother, Billy Bulger and Kevin Bacon has a nice solid performance as Charles McGuire, an FBI Taskforce leader who is at loggerheads with Connelly about Bulger's involvement with the law.<br/><br/>Go and see this film for Depp's performance alone. His portrayal is first class all the way down to the idiosyncratic mannerisms. He looks psychotic, sounds psychotic and even feels psychotic. Cooper has given Depp free rein to develop a memorable character and it is backed up by an array of talent that makes 'Black Mass' worth the price of admission."

"emdeecee15","Null","1","3","4 October 2015"," Do I smell an Oscar nomination?
","Johnny Depp has spent the last few years ruining his career with films like ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010), ""Dark Shadows"" (2012) and ""The Lone Ranger"" (2013), his roles in which reduced him to caricatures of his own talent. He's been little more than a novelty as of late, all because he hasn't had a truly legitimate role since he introduced the world to Jack Sparrow in 2003 ‚Äì until ""Black Mass"", that is. <br/><br/>Almost as if the sole purpose of his role was purely to silence his critics, Depp provides arguably the best work of his career in ""Black Mass"", and for those of you who have at least seen the trailer, this should come as no surprise. Depp is completely unrecognizable as Whitey Bulger, the single most notorious gangster to ever come out of Boston. The syrupy voice, those icy blue eyes, the bravado in his gait; every aspect of his performance is the categorical opposite of Depp himself.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I'd put my money on Depp earning an Oscar nomination, and he might just win it depending on the other contenders. But Depp's performance seems to be the only thing people are talking about when it comes to ""Black Mass"". There are other characters and a plot to boot, but even the film itself doesn't really seem interested in much other than showing us just how fantastically talented Depp really is. <br/><br/>As far as modern gangster flicks go, ""Black Mass"" feels pretty familiar. This is in part due to the fact that the film is very much like a documentary. It provides little insight beyond what much of the public already knows, mainly because, like many biopics, it tries to encompass 40 years of Bulger's life in a two-hour runtime: a feat that is rarely achieved gracefully. <br/><br/>Bulger's inner workings are explored, but only briefly, never with any true depth or analysis. We follow him as he runs his business, racketeering, selling drugs and murdering those that get in his way, but most of this information could be found on his Wikipedia page. The real psychology of the man behind the monster is never really discovered. <br/><br/>This is partially because Bulger isn't really the protagonist of ""Black Mass"", which makes sense when considering that he's basically a super villain. Many biopics about the seedier individuals in history will employ this technique; instead of making the biopic's subject the protagonist, we see the whole story through the eyes of one of their close associates. ""Black Mass"" makes an attempt at this method but never really establishes a clear lead character to take the audience through the story. Instead of seeing through the eyes of one character, we are given the perspectives of several, which reduces the clarity of the plot. <br/><br/>This could partially be due to the fact that director Scott Cooper has never dealt with a subject of the same magnitude as Whitey Bulger. His previous works, ""Crazy Heart"" (2009) and ""Out of the Furnace"" (2013), were much simpler stories dealing with love and loss, and even though neither is as taut as they could be, both are more focused and fleshed out than ""Black Mass"". <br/><br/>But I don't mean to be a downer. ""Black Mass"" is definitely a great film from a director on the rise who has proved time and time again that he's capable of pulling out the best in his actors. Thanks to Depp's towering presence, the film contains many incredibly tense scenes and one of the most interesting characters of recent memory. ""Black Mass"" may not be revolutionary but it's certainly worth the price of admission."
"danny-mail-me","10","2","10","21 September 2015"," Johnny Depp at his best!!!
","An awesome take on a real life story of a Gangster. Really good direction. Johnny Depp has nailed it. Such intense acting should fetch him an Oscar! He can be scary and funny at the same time. Hats off to him. All other characters have promptly played the roles and have done justice to their roles. It's a must watch.<br/><br/>After a three-year streak of box office flops and self-parodic performances, it is wonderful to see Depp return to the top of his game, even if this dramatic vehicle he performs so well in goes down many familiar and uninspired roads. ""Black Mass"" is most certainly Depp's film from start to finish. There is not a single second of his screen time where anyone in the audience will be able to resist his magnetic gaze. To see Depp restrain himself is also something of a miracle, since the man has played quirky characters a bit too often, thanks to his success as Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance as Whitey Bulger may not be as memorable as some of his earlier work, but it is without a doubt, one of his best to date."
"cultfilmfan","7","2","10","21 September 2015"," Black Mass
","After a string of critical and box office flops such as The Lone Ranger, Transcendence and Mortdecai, Johnny Depp was in need of a box office and critical hit. Some critics are saying that this new film, Black Mass, will be Depp's comeback role and may even net him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, but I think personally that those critics are being too premature. Thankfully for the most part, I tend to choose what I watch very carefully, so I have avoided those three recent Depp features that I mentioned earlier in this review. However, I have found that in the last 15 years or so, that Depp's roles and the movies that he is being offered are not what they used to be. I know that the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are really popular with fans of all ages and just recently I attempted to watch three of the entries in that film series with having the ultimate outcome of me caring very little for it. Some of the visuals and makeup and effects can be neat enough at times, but that is not what I look for in a movie. To me they are just more or less like big budget action films catered to a younger audience that despite whether critics love them, or hate them, they are going to make a lot of money. As for Depp in the films, I feel that his role as Captain Jack Sparrow is essentially a one note performance and while it may have worked in the first Pirates movie, I now think it is getting old and there is really nothing new, or relevant to say about what has become an iconic character, or films. The films themselves are just mediocre and the performance just feels old now because we have seen it so many times now and I feel there is nothing new, or revitalizing that they can now bring to that franchise. Despite my thoughts another film is currently in the works in that series which is slated to be released next year. I also find that other Depp roles recently have gotten too over the top and almost cartoonish in a way and I feel that it certainly hurts the films themselves and makes Depp often seem annoying, or really trying too hard for no reason. I'll list Tim Burton's failed Alice in Wonderland version as an example of this. I particularly liked Johnny Depp in the 90's where he was in a string of really original films, but gave great performances and depth to the characters as well. Think of films like Edward Scissorhands, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Ed Wood, Dead Man and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas just to name a few films from that time period. These films were actually great films and featured great Depp performances in them as well, but sadly it almost seems as if he is getting away from those smaller yet vastly better films. With, Black Mass it is possible that the film could earn Depp an Academy Award nomination, but for myself I would not nominate him personally. While he is good in the role of real life gangster Whitey Bulger, I feel that often the role is downplayed a bit and when Bulger, should be menacing and almost scary he comes off more subdued and even passive and I think the result of a terrifying and intimidating gangster is not really something the film, or the performance managed to pull off. I appreciated that the film showed different aspects of Bulger's character and not just as a violent psychopath, and I often found that some of the more quiet and personal scenes were more effective in both terms of acting and writing. Another thing I found that I think others will too is the fact that Depp's Bulger seems to be more of a supporting character and doesn't really carry the film in any way and is more of a background character. Whether that was intentional, or not I do not know, but the others characters when they were on screen did not seem to have quite as much screen presence and weren't as interesting to watch. I actually found the best performances in the film to be small supporting performances from typically great performers such as Juno Temple, Peter Sarsgaard and Dakota Johnson. Their roles are quite strong, but I feel are some of the best in the film and I almost wished they could have been in the film longer than they actually were because they were omitting off great performances and because of that they were fascinating to watch and added more to the film that sadly for the rest of it was missing. Black Mass, is not a bad film, but neither is it the great masterpiece I think a lot of people were hoping for. It is just simply an average film in pretty much every way except for a few bright performances which I mentioned above and also some of the cinematography was quite good at times as well. I think another thing that holds this film back is it really doesn't bring anything new to the screen. We have seen these type of mob films before and much better ones, so unfortunately there is nothing to distinguish this one apart from the countless others that have come out before it. It is a film that I think because it plays out like something you have seen before and also because it adds nothing new to the table that after it leaves theatres it will be a film you will see on television now and again, but will quickly be forgotten by a lot of people because there is just nothing really memorable about it."
"ryanmark-57919","10","2","11","22 September 2015"," Black Mass is Phenomenal in Every Way
","I was expecting some great things from this movie and did it ever deliver. This movie is excellent in every way I can think of. I literally have no complaints about this movie so this whole thing is just going to be me talking about how much I enjoyed this film. Scott Cooper directed this piece of excellent cinema and I have to say that I'm really starting to respect this guy. Out of the Furnace and Crazy Heart were both favorites of mine when they came out but this movie is probably my favorite of his yet. I'm a little biased though since I love a good gangster flick.<br/><br/>The story of this movie centers around the life of James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp) in the late seventies to the late eighties. There's a lot more to the entire Whitey Bulger story but this movie tells about his relationship with the FBI and his increasingly violent actions after the death of his son. John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) is an up and coming agent in the FBI who has been given an edict to take down the Italian Mafia in Boston. It just so happens that Whitey is trying to protect his own turf from the Mafia so Connolly makes a deal with Bulger to gain information about the Mafia from Bulger in exchange for certain guarantees from the FBI. This turns out to be a somewhat one sided relationship as Whitey works to solidify his own power base and make more money than anyone in his group thought they could ever make. Bulger's reign of terror includes drugs, murder, stealing, and even providing weapons to terrorists, all while using his informant status with the FBI to protect himself.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great actors in this movie but let's start with the obvious. Johnny Depp absolutely nails the role of Whitey Bulger. This guy is terrifying, dramatic, and even funny at times. The physical transformation is impressive but I forgot that it was actually Johnny Depp after a while. His interactions and everything just yell that this is not a man to be trusted. It's also nice to see Depp take on a more serious role after some of the goofier movies he's been doing. Don't get me wrong, I love goofy movies but Depp has some real talent but it's usually used on pirate or Burton films and it's just nice to see him take on a more serious role that reminds us just how good Depp really is. I'm also happy to see that Joel Edgerton is once again knocking it out of the park with his portrayal of Connolly. It's a little sad how much this guy is willing to do for Whitey, especially since he's an FBI agent. He has this weird obsession with Bulger and ends up becoming basically an active participant in many of his crimes. He doesn't show up and kill people but the information he provides to Whitey basically makes him an accessory to murder. Edgerton really impressed me earlier this year with The Gift and is quickly becoming one of my new favorite actors.<br/><br/>There are so many great actors in this film that I know I'm going to miss a few but I""m going to try to mention the ones that stood out to me. Jesse Plemons is great as Whitey's muscle and enforcer Kevin Weeks and went through quite a bit of a physical transformation himself. He nails the voice and actions perfectly. He's also a Breaking Bad alum which means I'm a bit biased but he really does do a fantastic job. Corey Stoll also gives us a great performance as the stand up Prosecutor Fred Wyshak and it's entertaining to see him put Connolly in his place. Rory Cochrane impressed me with his portrayal of another Bulger enforcer named Steve Flemmi. This guy does some truly horrendous stuff in this film but you get the feeling that he's not happy about what he's doing or what's happening around him. I hate to cut this short since there are so many great performances in this movie but I could probably write one of these on just the actors.<br/><br/>Boston is portrayed as being a bleak and dangerous place and it works perfectly for the narrative the film is going for. The area that so many of these characters was raised in helps us to see how they became the way they are. Even the city seems frightening at times. The music is moody and sets the scenes perfectly. There really isn't anything to complain about.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is absolutely phenomenal and I can't think of any problems that the film has. If I really sat here and tried to nitpick at it then I might be able to come up with something but the movie is just too good for me to sit here and do that. I have a felling we'll be hearing about this movie again come Oscar season. Please, do yourselves a favor and watch this movie. You definitely won't regret it."

","Loved this movie. I was concerned that ""Hollywood"" might have over- dramatized the events and the people involved, but they did not. After a bit of background checking on my part, I would have to say that if anything, Hollywood likely did not include all the gory details of Jimmy Bulger's life and crime spree !! This is also no ""glorification"" of any of the events that occurred, just a straight forward detailing of crime and corruption in Boston in the 70's and 80's. Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable - so I suspect Oscar will be looking for him !! Benedict Cumberbatch does a great turn as a Senator and politico. If there is one character in the story I would feel sorry for, it is John Connolly, the FBI agent who uses his old school connections with the Bulgers to feather his own nest !! He should have known that crime doesn't pay, and the bad guys always get caught - maybe not right away - but they always get caught !!"

What i liked most about this film is Johnny Depp's transformation through the film from the beginning to the end. Trust was a major problem with Johnny Depp and dealing with it in this film defiantly grabs the audiences attention. This being a true story is also a major key in the motion picture because it brings the viewers closer into the film.

I went into this movie expecting it to be pretty good from what I saw from the previews but I didn't expect it to be as good as it actually was. Johnny Depp blew me away. They transformed him into Whitey Bulger. When I say they transformed him I mean he looks so close that it is almost as if they had a time machine and just went back and captured the time perfectly. The acting is amazing and the movie is beautifully shot.<br/><br/>This movie has a little bit of a different feel to it like most modern mafia movies.

Films based on true events are usually enthralling and pull you into it if they are well written and this was an example of great writing coupled with good directing. <br/><br/>The Acting was out of this world, i mean Johnny Depp always pulls an audience but this was a much different role to his normal acting parts and he was the best.

","Black Mass is excellent. I'm not a huge Johnny Depp fan, but this is his best movie EVER. And while some may think it moves slow, etc. this movie is an accurate depiction of Whitey Bulger's life as one of America's most notorious gangsters. Remember 'The Departed?' As you may know, it was 'loosely based' upon Bulger - although many facts were altered. The reason why: Whitey hadn't been caught by the FBI. Martin Scorsese didn't have the stones to use Whitey's name. He called Jack Nicholson 'Frank Costello,' aka the crime boss in New York, circa 1950. Whitey was finally captured in Santa Monica in 2011 by the Fed's. It was only after he was behind bars for life did anyone DARE make a true to life movie based upon him. Can anyone blame Scorsese or anyone else? Whitey was a ruthless, cold-blooded killer. Black Mass shows this in fine detail. In my opinion, while 'Mass' isn't 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' quality, if you know and follow gangster movies as I do, 'Black Mass' is most certainly in my Top 10."

","James ""Whitey"" Bulger, the kingpin leader of the ""Winter Hill"" gang, was a notorious criminal from South Boston responsible for many deaths. He was a fugitive for many years until he was found and arrested in Santa Monica, California in 2011. Bulger was as vulgar as a criminal could get. Bulger was also an FBI informant revealing info on mafia organizations in North Boston, but that didn't stop Bulger from orchestrating his own mass killings. Director Scott Cooper has organized a crime film on the story of Bulger's violent ways in South Boston called ""Black Mass"". The film was a surefire hit with me, and I thought Cooper did a sensational job in orchestrating it. Johnny Depp's performance as Bulger was the best of his career, and you could ""depp"" on it that it will garner him a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Joel Edgerton was also on his game as FBI Agent John Connolly who protected Whitey for selfish career purposes. Peter Sarsgaard provides a scene-stealing performance as a drug-dealer paranoid that Bulger will assassinate him. Benedict Cumberbatch did a nice job imitating a Massachusetts Senator who also happens to be Whitey's brother, ouch! Mark Malluok and and Jez Butterworth's screenplay of the picture was worthy and on its mark with its authentic narrative on the crime world of South Boston and of course Bulger's rise & fall. However, in all, it was Depp who was the biggest hit of the movie, and Johnny being bad was very very good. So witness it for yourself and then tell the masses about ""Black Mass"". ***** Excellent"

","""It's not what you do, it's when and where you do it, and who you do it to or with. If nobody sees it, it didn't happen."" Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) <br/><br/>Black Mass is as amoral as that quote and grim‚Äîa true-story as brutal as the murders committed on the screen. By ""brutal"" I also mean the cinematography (as was the case with director Scott Cooper's ""Out of the Furnace""), which depicts a somber, dark South Boston, where danger comes from every opening a street might have.<br/><br/>The story of notorious gangster Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp) carries much of the darkness, if not all. Whitey's role as kingpin mobster and informant for the FBI requires deftness only actors like Depp can carry off. Yes, as the gangster formula usually has it, he evidences warmth and compassion at moments, but his operative emotion is anger.<br/><br/>Similar to the gangster actors like Pacino and De Niro, Depp brings a quiet menace to the screen, whereby even the audience must respect the boss, Bulger. Depp is far better than he has been in years (no tics, no phony accents, etc.), underplaying a role Pacino might have chewn up along with the scenery. His humanistic interactions like caring for his son or an old lady are few but reveal a nuanced character not just a murderer.<br/><br/>The film gives full characterization to FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) but skimps on others such as Whitey's state senator brother, Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch). Seeing more of the two brothers would have been rich both for the acting and for depicting the unusual power held by two very different brothers. I was working in Southie in the mid-seventies, and the Bulger name was becoming legend. The different power held by each brother was arresting. This film tries to depict that anomaly with limited success.<br/><br/>Among the film's few other weaknesses is the heavy-handed Junkie XL soundtrack, emphasizing each important moment with obvious meaning. Kevin Bacon and Adam Scott as agents are underused, though Scott's role is almost laughably a victim of editing. However, my comment underscores how rich the film is in acting and the right actors to play the parts.<br/><br/>""Take your shot but make it your best. Cause I get up, I eat ya."" Whitey Bulger"

","While his younger brother Bill (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a powerful part of the Massachusetts Senate, small time Irish gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp) continues to live a life of crime during 1970s Boston. Approached by an old childhood acquaintance and FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), he convinces James to align himself with him to help the FBI apprehend the Italian mob of North Boston. As their unorthodox partnership gets out of control, Bulger increases his and his gang's power while also evading capture thus becoming one of the most dangerous gangsters in U.S. history.<br/><br/>When one thinks of great gangster films, you think of The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Departed, etc. While it would be difficult to reach the caliber of those films, this one comes close. I thought the film did a great job at setting up what it would be like in 1970s Boston. From the gloomy and dirty locales, the clothing, etc, the film was very authentic and viewers should get the style quickly. The story was not as deep as I would have liked it to be since all of the gangster-related subject matter was mostly just mentioned and never showed but it did have some great moments that kept me engaged. If I had to use one word to describe it, it would be intense. This is because of the great acting on display in this film, Boston accents and all. But the best of those are Johnny Depp as Bulger and Joel Edgerton as Connolly. Depp is unrecognizable here as Bulger. From the aged look, the receding hairline and those piercing blue eyes, his transformation is a great example of excellent makeup work and manages to never look out of place. He really just disappears within all of the prosthetics. Depp has not had a good run of films recently but he has definitely made a comeback here by giving his best performance since playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the original Pirates of the Caribbean film in which he was nominated for an Oscar. I would be shocked if he wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar for this next year. He transforms himself into the psychopath Bulger was, able to go from charming and charismatic to scary evil and just plain dangerous on a dime. Edgerton was also great as the ambitious agent Connolly. After those two, it does drop considerably, however, as they are the only characters that seem to have some depth. I also found it a little odd that there are no real female roles in this film as the only ones we get to see are relegated to the background. I'm not trying to be a chauvinist but that was what the world was like back then so I didn't mind that too much. Criticisms aside, this is Johnny Depp's film because he is the only one you're paying any attention to since his performance is so great. No this is not like any of the films I mentioned at the beginning but Depp's performance alone is why I would recommend this film.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

","This fascinating true story about Irish gangster Whitey Bulger who is the brother of MA State Senator. Whitey becomes informant to the FBI to help take down the Mafia. In return they turn a blind eye to his shady dealings. The story requires some concentration as there are a lot of characters. The good point is that it's not too jumbled up. It's clear about the 'deal' and the character's motives and the gradual corruption of FBI agent John Connolly Whitey's childhood friend. The screenplay is a bit repetitive about these points and could have spent a little time on his early years and later fugitive years. Not enough of his personal life is shown as well. The focus is too much on the rub outs and the agents. <br/><br/>There are several brutal killings but it's not too graphic by today's standards.<br/><br/>The cast is stellar. Johnny Depp though not very Irish looking is quite convincingly made up and sinister with less hair and bad teeth. He is effective without overacting. Benedict Cumberbatch is a strange choice to play the senator brother, not looking like Depp at all and coming across quite British and reserved. Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons convincingly plays Whitey's sidekick Kevin Weeks. Joel Edgerton is well cast as the FBI childhood friend of Whitey. Corey Stoll has a small but effective role as a good guy who comes in to clean up things. Peter Sarsgaard is suitably druggie as the drug snorting associate. Dakota Johnson as the baby mama is surprisingly effective. More of Whitey's personal relationships could have been shown.<br/><br/>Worth a watch for the fascinating true story."

","'BLACK MASS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Crime biopic based on the life of notorious Irish-American mobster Whitey Bulger; detailing his relations with corrupt FBI members, including an old childhood friend. The film is being called a comeback, for lead actor Johnny Depp (after five box office and critical failures in a row); and he's also now considered the frontrunner, in next year's Academy Awards Best Actor race. The film costars Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, Dakota Johnson, David Harbour, Kevin Bacon, Adam Scott, Corey Stoll, Peter Sarsgaard, W. Earl Brown, Julianne Nicholson and Juno Temple. It was directed by Scott Cooper (who also helmed 'CRAZY HEART' and 'OUT OF THE FURNACE') and written by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth; the screenplay is based on the 2001 novel, by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. I found the film to be a little uneven, and slow-paced, but for the most part enthralling. <br/><br/>The story begins in 1975; when James 'Whitey' Bulger (Depp) was already a well known gangster, and infamous crime boss, in South Boston. He worked closely with his cohorts: Stephen Flemmi (Cochrane), Kevin Weeks (Plemons) and Johnny Martorano (Brown); to organize most of the crime there. Whitey's leadership was challenged though, by another Italian-American crime group (from the North End), called The Angiulo Brothers. So when his old childhood friend, turned FBI agent, John Connolly (Edgerton), returned to town; Whitey reluctantly agreed to an informant partnership, in order to takeout his enemies. The film follows all of the bloody and horrendous events that followed. <br/><br/>The film is very slow paced; but it's also informative, intense and involving. I knew little about the real Whitey Bulger, before seeing the movie, so the story always kept me (at least somewhat) entertained. I'm not a big fan of biopics but it's hard not to find such larger-than-life characters fascinating. Depp's performance is the highlight of the movie (and it's great to see him back in top form) but the supporting cast is all impressive as well (the makeup, on Depp, is superb too). I also really like Cooper, as a director, and have immensely enjoyed all of his (three) films, so far. The movie is definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/a2oJP7OqaOg"

Scott Cooper has brilliantly left few loose ends in the movie, for that's not what he wanted to convey in a complicated subject like this.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp & Joel Edgerton make the screen their very own. The two main characters have been beautifully written and performed. Depp playing his part reminds you about his acting skills from pre Pirates of the Caribbean era. Depp plays the part of the vicious gangster perfectly. When he is at the neighborhood where the locals like their ""southie"" boy to the brutal murderer that made everyone fear him. One dinner scene at John Connolly explains the different shades of Jimmy. <br/><br/>It is the same scene that also highlights Edgerton's performance that shows the mental struggle Edgerton is put through to pull all the strings. Cumberbatch as Senator Billy had nothing to offer in the entire movie. Just appears in bits & pieces. Cooper could have done well had the script had more for him.<br/><br/>On the whole it is a memorable experience you will walk away with.

","Black Mass (2015): Dir: Scott Cooper / Cast: Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Rory Cochrane: True story account about the power of James ""Whitey"" Bulger who, for decades, avoided arrest because of FBI. Agent John Connolly looking for promotion decides to take advantage of his childhood friendship with Bulger and his brother William ""Billy"" Bulger who is now a Senator. John approaches William in hopes of having James be an informant in hopes of bringing down mafia groups. Reluctant, the FBI accepts this notion, but this only opens opportunity for James and his gang to commit further crimes while Connolly turns a blind eye. Directed by Scott Cooper whose credits include Crazy Heart and Out of the Furnace. Here he captures the era of this series of crimes but the problem is that there is no strong central protagonist. Johnny Depp gives a menacing performance as ""Whitey"" whose morals have long decayed. Joel Edgerton as Connolly has crossed the line from FBI to crime associate and struggles to maintain innocence in view of his fearful wife and glaring co-workers. Benedict Cumberbatch as William is torn between being a Senator and his brother's criminal reputation. Dakota Johnson plays Bulger's wife who tearfully decides to pull the plug on their son who is hospitalized. This act plus the death of his mother puts Bulger over the edge. Rory Cochrane plays Bulger's right hand guy Steve Flemmi who even stoops to a situation that results in the murder of his stepdaughter.

"urztrulysooraj","8","1","6","21 September 2015"," Near Classic; Strictly Criminal
","Black Mass is strictly criminal; if Black Mass is a color specimen, then the canvas made out of it will be of grey, black and blue, so dark (read serious) is the movie. And, this seriousness is around the rise and characterization of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, one of the most notorious crime lords in US history and a strange alliance the FBI makes with him, which opens new chapters of loyalty, corruption, greed and betrayal with flavors of thrill.<br/><br/>Getting into the detail, the basic story is interesting, though I thought it to be a usual gangster rise and fall drama, Black Mass opened to be something different, it was more of a crime drama around Boston than a character centered biopic. For the story itself being 'stranger than fiction' stuff, the writers, Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk didn't have to make serious changes in the original plot; still certain things needed clarity. Though the emotional side of infamous agent, Connolly is dealt well, that of Mr. Bulger didn't have that impact; maybe he wasn't worth it. At the making side, Scott Copper paints the movie in grey, a mode of violence without any bloodshed. He was able to offer that generic feel of gangs around Boston in the latter half of 20th century; the presentation was damn too serious, perfectly fitting the narrative. Frames by Masanobu Takayanagi were of superior quality, certain slow paced shots had a classic feel. Music by Tom Holkenborg was matching Copper's narrative style without any heavy stuff; those score in climax were a scream. The movie was technically sound with appropriate color gradient. Dialogues were sharp enough to offer loud ears. The makeup team requires applause for offering that devilish look to Depp.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting side, Johnny Depp offers a high level performance as James ""Whitey"" Bulger; though his flexibility in pulling off different roles is known, this one will stand novel for its brutality of character and flawlessness in presentation. Those scenes where he panic John Morris and threaten Marianne just elevate the genius of an actor in him. While Depp exposes such versatility, there is Joel Edgerton who offers an equally brilliant performance as John Connolly, who too shares an equal space on script. His performance came out as a surprise package and offered an unnoticed emotional inclination for the plot. In addition to them, there is Benedict Cumberbatch as Bill Bulger, a role suiting him very well, though less on screen, he was good. Dakota Johnson, with appealing lips, seemed unused in a smaller role while Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemons and David Harbour did their supportive roles well.<br/><br/>Overall, Scoot Copper's Black Mass is an engaging crime drama that throws light on the mobster activities around Boston in the second half of 20thcentury; though the movie has a slow paced narration, the amount of reality in theme makes the movie an enterprising watch.<br/><br/>Final Line: One of the best movies released this year; must watch for the ones who love serious movies..!"
"maurice_yacowar","8","1","6","19 September 2015"," Boston criminal psychopath exploits FBI connection
","As the title suggests, Black Mass exercises a Satanic evil ‚Äî in a character paradoxically named Whitey. <br/><br/>Like the real-life character, this Whitey Bulger is a killer with reptilian charm whose psychopathology goes far beyond the proffered explanation of LSD experiments at Alcatraz. He's driven to build and secure a criminal empire but relishes torture for its own sake.<br/><br/>While Bulger is careful not to be seen taking a satchel of money, we see him strangle and shoot people. He has a limited fastidiousness. The genre usually has the boss delegate such hands-on work. These graphic scenes connect Whitey to his crimes, even as he's coldly detached from any emotional connections other than his mother and son, who both die early. Even when he offers his young son guidance it's on how to get away with violence not to eschew it. <br/><br/>Whitey hates rats but he can rationalize turning informer for the FBI. it's a business arrangement, by which the feds will help the Irish gang boss wipe out his rival Mafiosa. <br/><br/>The film's central theme is the antithesis of connections and ""pulling the plug."" That phrase recurs. Whitey implicitly pulls the plug on his girlfriend when she explicitly says she'd pull the plug on their brain-dead son. <br/><br/>There's a constant tension between a character's respecting his bond and breaking it. Hence the narrative's structure, reminiscences by his gunsels turning state's witness against him. So, too, Whitey's frequent strategy of pretending to forgive and accept someone immediately before killing him/her.<br/><br/>There's a wide range of connections here. Whitey's brother is a leading state politician who steers completely clear of Whitey's criminal life. But he has to resign from his university chancellorship when he's found to have been in contact with the fugitive Whitey. In that fraternal connection, he failed to pull the plug completely enough.<br/><br/>The third of these childhood friends is FBI agent John Connolly, who uses his old connection to enlist Whitey as informer. For failing to pull the plug he goes down. So does fellow agent John Morris, who moves from tentative conspirator to terrified. Typical of Satanic evil, Buiger has a seductive pull that enables a rationalization of justice to gloss the self-interest. The dapper suit, gold watch and new-found swagger are but signs of Connolly's corruption by his fidelity to his old friend.<br/><br/>The Bulger boys' mother loves both, obviously, and may or may not be guilty of cheating Whitey at gin. But Connolly's wife pulls the plug on their marriage when she's exposed to Whitey's insinuating evil unmasked. As described above, Whitey pulls the plug on his relationship before his girlfriend does.<br/><br/>Whitey and Connolly ‚Äî but not Whitey's legit brother ‚Äî make a big deal out of their old friendship and their connection to the neighbourhood. Here loyalty covers a multitude of sins and moral compromise. So, too, Whitey's brief service to the IRA's cause, an extension of his role of Irish warrior against the Italian gang, the South Side of Boston against the North. Where you're from is a much-touted bond, to compel loyalty, but the truly moral will pull that plug when virtue requires. <br/><br/>Gunsel Steven is connected to his girlfriend's daughter but overextends that connection in their sexual relationship. When the cops probe her connection to Whitey's gang he strangles her. When Whitey turns against Morris for revealing his family's secret marinade recipe, he demonstrates the sinister danger in any connection to such evil. The scene ends with Whitey's even more chilling violation of Connolly's wife. The only healthy character in the house, she pleads illness. <br/><br/>There are two humorous replays of the theme. An end credit promises no profits have resulted from the film's use of cigarettes. That is, nothing is connected to the smoke. And the film's most senior law officer is played by Kevin Bacon, mister six degrees of separation/connection himself.<br/><br/>Obviously the film's subject goes beyond Whitey Bulger to America's knotted and inextricable binding of good and evil, the criminal and the law. One hand washes the other. The film derives not just out of the gangster genre but out of the even more characteristic American tradition, the Western. There American civilization is rooted in the gun and the noose. Gunmen brought ""civilization"" to the wilds and gunmen secure their families and relationships in the urban jungle. <br/><br/>These days that paradox extends even further, to the international tyrants that America befriends and supports in its own thus morally compromised interests. Hello Saudis and Iran. Goodbye, naive confidence in any easy honour."
"PrashunChakraborty","8","1","6","21 September 2015"," A return to form for Depp
","First things first, I am biased towards crime-drama films, I have grown up on Godfather, Goodfellas and Once upon a time in America and they have had a huge influence on my liking for crime movies. So my approach towards Black Mass was already a bit biased to begin with and how did Black Mass fare? It did great, i really liked it. I always note the level of accuracy in a film and this film nails the 70s-80's era, the hairstyles, the suits, the cars and the Boston accent (though Benedict Cumberbatch's Boston accent was a bit distracting). I must say the director Scott Cooper really studied all the Scorsese master crime films before approaching Black Mass and you can see the influence in the shots and sometimes even in the script (has some shades of Scorsese's The Departed, the voice-over narration in a crime film is a style made famous by Scorsese in Goodfellas and a scene is almost ripped straight off from Goodfellas). The film feels very authentic and it did an excellent job of making the audience understand it's backstory and aspects which a non Boston person (like me) could understand and appreciate like the turf war between Irish and the Italian Mafia and their natural hate and dislike for each other. <br/><br/>The lead actors are terrific, Johnny Depp showed some of his old acting chops which I thought he may have lost since he became a pirate; but he is in full form here, truly menacing and if you are in a room with his James ""Whitey"" Bulger, you will be too scared to make an eye contact with him and will try to slip out of the room asap, very intimidating. Joel Edgerton plays the second lead, he is the liaison between Bulger and the FBI so that Bulger gets protection and he gets to nail the Italian mafia, a common enemy of both the FBI and Bulger's Irish Winter Hill Gang. Edgerton's Agent Connolly plays a very interesting character and shows that it's not necessary that a criminal is out there committing crimes, sometimes the criminal is in the system manipulating it to suit his needs. The politics in the FBI maybe the dark horse aspect of this film that only crime drama veterans may appreciate, all the talking and manipulation (aka boring stuff to casual movie goer). Rest of the cast is good and do their roles well but nothing home to write about.<br/><br/>There are some scenes which were a tad bit over the top and some logical loopholes arose but trust me I did some light reading about the film after watching it and yes it is factually correct. It's an imperfect world sometimes even criminals get lucky and catch a break even after taking totally unnecessary risks or murder jobs. Lastly, I made the Scorsese comparison earlier but I don't think this film will have the longevity of Scorsese films, this film has a great script and some good scenes but the shots are never visually rich like Scorsese's, you still remember everyone's death scene from The Departed but Black Mass will not enjoy that long lasting appeal despite having an arguably better story. I can't wait to see the final cut of the film when it will be released, the original movie was nearly half an hour longer."

","Johnny Depp gives a chilling award worthy performance as Whitey Bulger in this violent crime drama.<br/><br/>There's a supporting cast of almost too recognizable stars all competing to do their best Boston accents.

It's a rough time at the movies, but the Depp performance is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Along with acting award recognition, the movie deserves technical awards including make-up.

","Well, I am one of the biggest fan of John Christopher Depp II. So When I was about to watch his next after the disaster 'Transcendence', i was overwhelmed. Little did I know that the star cast is consists of, Benedict Cumberbatch, Joel Edgerton, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard and Corey Stoll.<br/><br/>In a word the movie is fantastico. The way Hollywood keep coming with movies about true stories is a example for the world cinema.<br/><br/>About the story, it's all about how a psychopath small time criminal claimed the ladder to the highest star simply cause FBI let him, especially his childhood friend in FBI played brilliantly by Joel Edgerton. To my opinion, Kevin Becon and Peter Sarsgaard are wasted in the role of FBI chief and small time hit-man respectively.<br/><br/>As for Benedict Cumberbatch, he played his role perfectly as the brother or crook and yet a senator of the states.<br/><br/>At the end, I don't think anybody could play 'James 'Whitey' Bulger' like Johnny Depp did. He is truly a living legend.<br/><br/>So if you like crime drama and if you liked 'Public Enemies' of John, you should be watching this...... Highly recommended."
"sushant0406","8","1","7","24 September 2015"," A average film saved by top-notch acting performances.
","Six years after Public Enemies, Johnny Depp Depp plays infamous Boston Mafioso James ""Whitey"" Bulger, an Irishman who rose from being a petty street thug to being No. 2 on the FBI's most wanted list just behind Osama Bin Laden.This role has once again put him in the limelight for a possible fourth nomination for the Academy Award for the best actor and if, he is lucky; his first and very well deserved win.<br/><br/>Black Mass is a biopic on the life of Bulger ; a ""Southie"" gang-lord who formed an ""Allegience"" with the FBI to eliminate his own personal interests. <br/><br/>There is Oscar buzz surrounding Depp's performance, and understandably so. His Jimmy is equal parts likable, stubborn, and monstrous. Depp captures the Boston accent, walk, and mannerisms we expect of someone in Jimmy's position, but what will leave movie- goers remembering the most are his eyes, which are steely, demonic blue beads. They suggest an omnipresent hardness about Jimmy that fits perfectly with his cryptic smile and sallow complexion. On more than one occasion Jimmy is friendly with someone, then kills the person moments later. It's frightening because it's the worst kind of menace: The kind that smiles to your face and then stabs you in the back, when you least expect it. I don't think we've ever seen Depp this cold and dangerous before.<br/><br/>The screenplay of the movie is decent and keeps you on the edge of your seat for sometime. The direction is good, could have been better, though.Of the supporting cast, Joel Edgerton hits the nail on the head with his portrayal of the disgraced ex-FBI agent , John Conolly who in his attempt to impress his ""friend"" Bulger, ends up being charged for second degree murder. Benedict Cumberbatch as Whitey's kid brother also does an excellent job. It was hard to imagine that a person from England could shed his accent so easily and put on an impeccable Boston accent, one of the hardest to master. Dakota Johnson and Julianne Nicholson, both were fabulous in their respective parts. Kevin Bacon was okay.<br/><br/>Coming back to Depp's performance and his chances of getting an Oscar,it is absolutely clear that this is the best acting performance of the year(YES, i have seen The Revenant,Steve Jobs,Trumbo,Youth,Concussion,The Danish Girl).In my opinion, he deserves the Academy Award, but, the whole whoopla around Leo ""deserving"" it for a one-dimensional role that could have been played by anyone and Depp's eccentric and carefree attitude that is not appreciated by most people,might see him miss this opportunity. <br/><br/>On the whole; Black Mass is definitely a one-time watch. There is no way you can criticize the acting. The only thing that people may come out of the hall, cribbing about is the content of the film. To all the gangster movie lovers, I would like to say: THIS is no Goodfellas. It is very hard to replicate that. But it is right there at the top with the best."
"SpenceTF","8","1","7","22 September 2015"," A deep, dark¬Ö Black Mass
","Black Mass is dark. Interesting name really. I quite like the title. I know it is based on a book, but still ‚Äì really catching and for me just the name invokes mystery and deep thinking. The movie is based on the infamous Boston gangster Jimmy ""Whitey"" Bulger of the notorious Winter Hill Gang. Most of the film takes place between the 70-90s. The reason to see the film: Johnny Depp. Reasons not to see the film: not a super-duper structured narrative some things just happen (like life). And it is quite dark (also like life). But if you would rather have a Nolan-esque/rainbows film, this is not it.<br/><br/>MILD SPOILERS: Black Mass is a pulsating look into the life of a cold-blooded gangster. Most of the film, Whitey seems to be of the same demeanor, but worsening at the death of his son and the death of his mother. At the end of the film, Whitey's closest associate is asked by the FBI in seemingly current year about their relationship, and he remarks, ""It was strictly criminal."" What an intriguing way to describe a human relationship. I guess that is the mobster way of saying it was strictly business. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp was truly incredible in this film. Overall, I like Depp. I think he is an incredible versatile actor (despite personally rebelling from watching any more Pirates of the Caribbean Films after the second film maybe third). I read somewhere that it took over 20 hours to apply the makeup to make Depp look the ghoulish part of Whitey.<br/><br/>In a recent interview, Depp got some flack for ""humanizing"" Whitey too much while he was trying to prepare for the role. Depp stated that Whitey, had a cold heart, but a caring heart. Some of the victim's surviving family members of the real life mobster were quite incensed. But, should anyone have to humanize anyone else. I'm sure even the world's worst gangsters, dictators, and serial killers had fears, loves, dreams, and they wet the bed when they were little. People are human (full stop). Even gangsters. What lead to the creation of such a heinous murderer, which was Whitey Bulger? Who knows.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes (which I used in my second feature film), ""If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"" ‚Äï Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956"
"warrenf_peace","9","1","7","19 September 2015"," ""Black Mass"" Reminds Us Why Depp, Cumberbatch Are So Good
","* SPOILERS *<br/><br/>I saw ""Black Mass"" yesterday at a matin√©e, with no expectations, even though there is some buzz about the film. I wanted to see from an unbiased perspective if Depp still had the brilliance he'd displayed in the early part of his career with films like ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Ed Wood"", and of course, ""Edward Scissorhands"". I was curious if his tent pole films (""Pirates of the Caribbean"") had made him lazy and cynical. The first thing I noticed was his hair (obviously), so turning the heart throb into an older, hardened criminal was completed. But what I then noticed was the subtle way they introduced his predator blue eyes. And as the film ran, his eyes became more and more evil - it was a great makeup job, and the way Depp used them to great affect was chilling.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing about the film is the way they presented Jimmie Bulger at first as a sort of reformed criminal, having ""done a dime at Alcatraz"", and ever the Irish Catholic altar boy, looking after the elderly ladies, with whom he had a fondness for. Seeing him dote on his young son, you could feel his pain after his son's passing, where you almost feel sorry for the guy. But his anger and blood lust just keep on escalating, empowered by his cohorts and FBI friend, and as you watch him strangle the niece of one of his crew, any empathy you had for the man is rapidly torn away. He is an animal, predator, socio- (""or is it psycho-"") path, murderer. <br/><br/>So Depp indeed does show why he deserves his fame - and a good part of the reason is usually due to the director, as his recent performances have shown that a great actor is only as good as his director (what was Wally Pfister thinking in ""Transcendence""?), so part of Depp's success in ""Black Mass"" must be credited to Justin Kurzel. Likewise, Benedict Cumberbatch as Bulger's brother Billie is barely recognizable, and holds to his reputation as one of the finest actors in the current era. The rest of the team is solid, if under-exposed - there are some excellent performances, notable Joel Edgerton as FBI mole John Connolly, and Julianne Nicholson as Connolly's stolid wife. The production design, sound, and other film technicals are ably handled, giving that cold, hard ""Southy"" Boston atmosphere. This was an excellent film, and held my interest throughout. And while the story was fascinating, Depp really shines, giving one of, if not the, the best performances of his career. And though not a lead role, Cumberbatch also really shines (let's face it, he always does..), as does Edgerton. If you are a fan of film, you must see ""Black Mass""."
"DoubleOscar","8","1","7","20 September 2015"," A Gripping Story Anchored by Brilliant Performances From Depp and Edgerton
","Black Mass tells the true tale of James ""Whitey"" Bulger's rise and fall with his gang in the streets of South Boston. In a war for territory, Bulger (Johnny Depp) and FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) create an unlikely alliance to take down an opposing Mafia family. As the story unfolds, each side is tested in how far they are willing to go to keep their relationship with one another.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper brings out the best in all of his actors and perfectly captures not only the cold blooded essence of Bulger, but also the feeling of dread in South Boston during the time. The biggest selling points for this movie are actors Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton, whose performance should easily be deserving of an Academy Award. However, others like Jesse Plemmons, Dakota Johnson, and Benedict Cumberbatch, while underused, manage to make the most of the time given to them.<br/><br/>At roughly 2 hours, Black Mass does not overstay its welcome, in fact I believe it could have been longer and gone even more in depth as to the inner-workings of Jimmy Bulger's mob. From a technical standpoint, the movie was terrific as well. The cinematography was enthralling, the score enhanced the emotion of every scene, the editing was serviceable, but didn't detract from the movie in any way. The last part I will mention is possibly on par with the performances, the script. It was magnetic, and beautifully highlighted every aspect of every character. <br/><br/>The greatest comparison I can make of this move is that of last year's Foxcatcher, brilliantly performed, moving at a deliberate pace, and with horribly detached, yet irresistibly engaging characters. <br/><br/>Overall, while it doesn't reinvent the mob picture like Goodfellas, (nor does it try to) Black Mass is an incredibly solid and flawlessly acted portrayal of one of the United States' most notorious gangsters in history.<br/><br/>""It's not about what you do, it's about where you do it and when."""
"Anurag-Shetty","10","1","7","20 September 2015"," A classic gangster movie.
","Black Mass is a true story of one of the most notorious criminals who operated in South Boston, James 'Whitey' Bulger(Johnny Depp). FBI agent John Conolly(Joel Edgerton), is given a job to take down the Mafia. John Connolly grew up with Whitey Bulger & his brother Billy Bulger(Benedict Cumberbatch), who happens to be a state senator. Agent Connolly thinks it's a good idea to take Whitey Bulger's help, to eradicate the other criminal organizations in Southie(as South Boston is fondly called). His FBI boss, Charles McGuire(Kevin Bacon) & colleagues, FBI Agent Robert Fitzpatrick(Adam Scott) & John Morris(David Harbour) reluctantly agree. However, Whitey Bulger takes advantage of being an FBI informant & soon rises to the top of the Southie crime scene by doing whatever he wants, legal or not. <br/><br/>Black Mass is a flawless film. It's fascinating & terrifying at the same time that, such an unhinged criminal ruled the streets of South Boston for years. The movie, more or less accurately depicts all that happened on the streets of South Boston in the '70s & early '80s. People who are squeamish about excessive violence & gore should not watch this movie. However, for everyone else this film should be a blast! There is not a single dull moment in the film. The script based on the book Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob is incredibly gripping & will keep you on the edge of your seat. Scott Cooper has done a masterful job, directing the movie. Despite everything, the reason Black Mass is a masterpiece, is because of the performances. Johnny Depp steals the show in every scene he's in, as James 'Whitey' Bulger. With heavy prosthetic make up, piercing blue contact lenses & a receding hairline, Depp is almost unrecognizable as Whitey Bulger. Depp transforms from a man who loves his mother, brother, wife & son to a ruthless psycho criminal in seconds, with absolutely no effort. The special effects & make up department have done a good job in making Depp look just like the real James 'Whitey' Bulger. At the end of the day despite great make up, acting gets noticed & Johnny Depp does not disappoint. Depp portrays the various emotions of Whitey Bulger with expertise & panache. Johnny Depp is back & deserves all the award nominations he's going to get for his role. Joel Edgerton is spectacular as John Connolly. Edgerton continues on a winning streak after The Gift(2015), which he directed, wrote & starred in. He is a force to be reckoned with. Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant as Billy Bulger. Cumberbatch superbly recreates a Boston accent. Kevin Bacon is great as Charles McGuire. Jesse Plemons is good as Kevin Weeks. Peter Sarsgaard is awesome as Brian Halloran. Dakota Johnson is impressive as Lindsey Cyr. Corey Stoll is amazing as Fred Wyshak. Adam Scott & David Harbour are effective as FBI Agent Robert Fitzpatrick & John Morris respectively. Julianne Nicholson & Juno Temple are awesome as Marianne Connolly & Deborah Hussey respectively. Rory Cochrane & W. Earl Brown are effective as Steve Flemmi & John Martorano respectively. Mary Clug & Luke Ryan are adorable as Mom Bulger & Douglas Cyr respectively. Black Mass is a must watch, especially for fans of gangster movies & Johnny Depp."

","Being from Boston, I am very familiar with Bulger's history and despicable behavior. I thought this movie was less about Bulger and more about Connelly, which wasn't something I anticipated from reading other reviews, seeing the trailers, etc.<br/><br/>They did show how vile and scary Bulger is, but parts of the story didn't go into enough depth to capture how truly horrible he was - there wasn't enough character build-up to really care about the victims. Even though they reference in passing the number of murders, and how he pushed drugs on teenagers, they didn't show that impact in the movie. This was the first movie about Bulger that vilified Connelly so much - they did a good job with that. <br/><br/>I was distracted by Johnny Depp's hairline and how ugly Jesse Plemons looked - his hair looked like a BAD hairpiece and the dark hair/pale skin/eyebrows gave him a really sickly/bizarre look. He's good at playing bad guys and looked so different than he did in Breaking Bad. <br/><br/>The Boston accents were good - which is something that can ruin a movie or TV show for me.<br/><br/>Everyone talked about how horribly violent the movie was. Maybe I was prepared for worse, but I didn't think it was as bad as the reviews said. More *sounds* when people were being killed, which made it graphic and uncomfortable, but the visuals weren't as bad as I expected. The whole story is violent and brutal - even though I am saying it was less graphic than I expected, it is not a movie that kids should see, it is disturbing - it is based on a true story, these things really happened."

","Black Mass is the best kind of biopic. One that tells a very specific story. It doesn't just exist in order to tell about a person for the mere sake of retelling their life story. We've all seen those before. At the end, you say to yourself that you feel like you know the person, but you're not really sure why you needed to learn about arbitrary snippets from their life.<br/><br/>This film is about Whitey Bulger (Johnny Depp), a Boston crime lord, whom you can assume had some acquired some fairly heady anecdotes over the course of his reign. But Black Mass doesn't just start from his childhood. It focuses mainly on the latter half of his life--after he was already established as a feared man in the city of Boston. The film details how he becomes an FBI informant who helps end the Mafia invasion in his territory of rule. But it never really paints him as a saint. In fact, it shows him more as the villain he is. One who is ruthless and merciless and only cares about his own power. Towards the beginning, before a series of events happen that takes away most of the people he cares about, we see flickers of a loving person. It's after that when he becomes a monster.<br/><br/>There is a secondary lead, John Connelly (Joel Edgerton), who works for the FBI but also grew up with Bulger. He has always been enamored with the criminal and secretly wants to be like him. He is in denial. Things start to change in his life when the FBI becomes fed up with Connelly always creating excuses for Bulger--a trend that may prove to work against him rather than for him.<br/><br/>But Black Mass never chooses a protagonist for us. We root for certain characters, but then realize that they all may very well have faults of their own that make them unrootable.<br/><br/>Depp is seriously phenomenal in his portrayal of Bulger. It may very well be his best performance in years, maybe ever. You forget it's him because it is so far gone from the typical roles that he takes on.<br/><br/>The film is gripping from beginning to end. It proves how there are different levels of nefariousness and depicts Bulger's second tier of villain perfectly.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 96"

","(Rating: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬Ω out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: A standard gangster film that goes above the standard due to a star performance and some fine filmmaking.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+<br/><br/>In Black Mass, Scott Cooper's chilling biography of psychotic killer, James ""Whitey"" Bulger, we follow a bloody trail of gruesome murders and assorted mayhem on the road to his notoriety. The film chronicles Burger's life and killing sprees, from his beginnings as a small-time thug in South Boston to becoming a dangerous mob leader and F.B.I. informant. Johnny Depp plays this central role and he is brilliant (but more on that later) and the film's other cast members are just terrific too.<br/><br/>ÔøºCrime may not pay, but it sure earned Burger a nice living, before being apprehended after 30+ years of being a career criminal, even using the F.B.I. to help his meteoric rise to the Most Wanted list. The screenplay by Jez Butterworth and Mark Mallouk is so well written and researched. Their script focuses on the personal side of Bulger, with his Irish family ties, particularly his close relationship with his Senator brother (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his childhood friendship with F.B.I. agent, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). It also solidly interweaves his business dealings with other partners-in-crime. Dialog has a natural rhythm and all of the characters, both major and minor, are fully developed. <br/><br/>ÔøºThe director creates a realistic world of criminals and lowlifes. Although the story has a been-there-done-that feel and is too derivative of other gangster films, Cooper's vision is fresh and detail-oriented. Scenes bristle with tension and shocking violence, some merely suggested off-camera; others shown in grisly close-ups. (Be forewarned: The film is extremely gruesome.) He has assembled a top-notch ensemble that inhabit these indelible characters in many memorable moments. <br/><br/>ÔøºThis is, by far, one of the year's best acted films of the year. Delivering a break-out performance is the aforementioned Mr. Edgerton as the ambitious and easily corrupted agent and friend, hell-bent on making a professional career at the bureau and using Bulger as any means to accomplish that goal. Benedict Cumberbatch as Burger's loving brother shows his character's range of compassion in his few short scenes. Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, and Peter Saragaard as Bulger's cronies are excellent. Giving strong support in smaller roles are Dakota Johnson as Bulger's girlfriend, Juno Temple as an unfortunate prostitute, Kevin Bacon, Corey Stoll, Adam Scott, and David Harbour as F.B.I. agents, the latter encapsulates a good man caught in the web of corruption. Julianne Nicholson is superb as Connolly's wife, whose uncomfortable and noticeable dislike for Bulger leads to a confrontation scene with Depp that is totally mesmerizing.<br/><br/>ÔøºBut it is Mr. Depp who is a marvel of nuanced acting, so unlike his work in these past years. (One forgets his keen ability and talent as an actor with such debacles as The Lone Ranger, Into the Woods, Transcendence, Dark Shadows, The Tourist, so fresh in one's mind...need I go on.) In this film, his portrayal is more than a mere physical transformation with Depp's icy-blue eyes (contacts) matching his ice-cold bloodlessness. (If the eyes are the window to the soul, this ultimately leads to a man devoid of any humanity.) The actor's mannerisms, posturing, and unflinching stares communicate more than his character's hollow and insincere words. He oozes a creepiness with his balding skeletal facial expressions and exudes menace from every pore. His line delivery is deliberately flippant at times, and other times, hesitant with every calculated pause. He plays Bulger as a predator in search of any victim, trusting no one. It's an Oscar worthy performance.<br/><br/>ÔøºBlack Mass also has wonderful production values. The make-up and prosthetic work on Mr. Depp makes the actor unrecognizable, and while he does not truly resemble the real criminal, he makes this character a terrifying and totally riveting monster. The atmospheric cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi's and concise editing by David Rosenbloom make the film more compelling than most from this genre. There is fine period art direction and costumes by Jeremy Woodward and Kasia Walicka-Maimone, respectively. And Junkie XL's musical score heightens the suspense quite effectively.<br/><br/>ÔøºDespite its conventional narrative structure, Black Mass is one of the best films of the year. Cooper and Depp bring new blood to the old aging gangster genre, even if the blood flows in buckets.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

The introduction of the bar bouncer's scene's dialogue and raw violence creates pace/feel for the entire film. I felt a cold chill from the beginning. Depp portrays a cold and harden criminal to perfection. F B I agent Joel Edgerton Depp's partner walks, acts, feels, like a jaded agent in it for himself. Edgerton should be nominated for best supporting actor. Black Mass's story about an unholy alliance between F B I (Edgerton) and the Irish mob (Depp) where an informant gives information for free rain while eliminating the criminal competition. Hence, the unholy alliance is a black mass which creates the story's title. A chilling true story, One could not make up such fiction. Proof real life is better than fiction. Nine out of ten stars."

This movie progresses through flashbacks of narration from Bulger's former associates, who have already served their time and in witness protection. <br/><br/>BLACK MASS is based on true facts that transpired in the 1970's and '80s. Bulger on the rise as crime boss of Boston's south side ends up in an unholy alliance with FBI agent John Connolly(Joel Edgerton), who grew up admiring ""Whitie"" in the old neighborhood. They both wanted to take down the Italian Mafia controlling crime on Boston's north side. Why not feed each other information. Making the whole situation debatable...was Bulger an FBI informant or not? William Bulger(Benedict Cumberbatch), is a state senator that manages to keep his hands clean of most doings past and present in the old neighborhood. John Martorano(W. Earl Brown)was a go to man, when things had to be taken care of...you know what I mean. Then of course, there were times when it was some ""hands on"" by ""Whitey"". A pressuring FBI boss Charles McQuire(Kevin Bacon) becomes suspicious of Connolly's work...and soon dominoes begin to fall. Out comes deeply buried information concerning racketeering, drug dealing and murder, many murders. James Bulger goes on the run hiding in plain sight.<br/><br/>Brutal violence and thick vulgar language throughout.

","Told through the right hand men of FBI's Most Wanted for 12 years, only being second to Osama Bin Laden and with a capture reward that is as high as it gets. Director Scott Cooper's (Out of the Furnace + Crazy Heart) crime-drama biopic tells the story about three boys of the streets of South Boston that grow up to become the main men that changed the landscape of the city forever. In particular one person, the man that became the most notorious gangster in Americas history, James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp). The ice-cold ruthless killer that led the Irish Mob from South Boston known as ""Southie"" develops from a small time crook to become the true Kingpin of Boston while his brother William ""Billy Boy"" Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) becomes the other most powerful person of the city as State Senator. John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returns in 1981 to Boston as the top FBI agent with a mission to bring down the Cosa Nostra led by the Italian Mafia brothers Angiulo in Boston's North End. Allying with the boy that once saved him out of a fight during their childhood years, and helping his brother Billy run for office years later, while staying loyal to the law of the streets built on trust honor and blood, his respect towards the brothers together with their bond from their younger years creates an unbreakable pack.

"StevePulaski","9","1","10","18 September 2015"," A game of ""cops and robbers"" taken far beyond the playground
","Scott Cooper's ""Black Mass"" features arguably the best ensemble cast of the year, with Johnny Depp at the helm in perhaps his best, most convincing performance of the last decade. Following a string of financial failures and lackluster projects, particularly this year's ""Mortdecai,"" where I proclaimed in my review that if this didn't kill Depp's assortment of eclectic projects, nothing would, Depp, like always, changes costumes and throws himself into yet another role. His performance as the notorious James ""Whitey"" Bulger should go down as one of the year's most haunting.<br/><br/>In ""Black Mass,"" Bulger is a cackling, dead-eyed, ruthless killer, bound to pull the trigger or get one of his goons to do so at the slightest sign of disloyalty in his inner-circle of equally heartless men. He often sits in stone-cold silence, and when he chooses to speak, he never misses a beat, stammers, or retracts on his statements; he's too assured and confident for that. He knows when to talk, he knows how to cover things up, and he knows exactly how to manipulate and stay in control.<br/><br/>This is undoubtedly why he rose to prominence and became the leader of organized crime in South Boston. The brother of Massachusetts Senator Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch), Bulger keeps his brother from having the state government infiltrate and corrupt his turf, in addition to being an FBI informant to help take down rival Mafia families. He provides tips and kickbacks to FBI Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), a lifelong friend of Whitey and Billy's, who shares the same concepts of loyalty that Whitey does. With two divisions that could potentially send his Winter Hill Gang to jail taken care of, Whitey's biggest concern now is managing his team and making sure members of other Mafia families do not attempt to overthrow his power.<br/><br/>In the background are people like Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), Connolly's boss, who is dumbfounded as to why, despite all the effort and work Connolly has put into Bulger, he can't bring him down, Robert Fitzpatrick (Adam Scott), another coworker of Connolly's, Stephen Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), Whitey's right-hand man who usually has a rifle in his hand, Deborah Hussey (Juno Temple), a young prostitute who gets caught up in Stephen and Whitey's business, and Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), a young man who is taken under the wing of Whitey for his diligence and level-headed attitude, and whom eventually came through to the FBI to help bust Whitey in 2011.<br/><br/>Many crime-dramas feel like vignettes of violence, drinking, negotiating, and cursing, and ""Black Mass""'s pacing is a bit more evident of its looseness than other slickly edited pictures of the genre (""Casino"" comes to mind, for one). However, the acting here is a powerhouse display of natural talent on everybody's part, even the lesser players like Scott and Temple, who are almost guaranteed to get minimal to no recognition.<br/><br/>Edgerton's constant balance of working to assist his force and remain loyal to his lifelong pal is one that is shown through his character's high stress levels and constant workaholic nature, an acting challenge he handles beautifully by conveying just what his character feels smothered by. Cumberbatch, while a lesser pawn in this film, no doubt, is another incredibly watchable presence here, who is simply trying to do his job whilst ignoring the brazen criminal activity of his brother. Other supporting players, like Cochrane and Plemons, do a great job at just being very natural and human, thanks to Cooper's observant direction, which I'll get back to, and, finally, there's Kevin Bacon, who talks like a Southie victim to a year's worth of nasal congestion. A gripping performance from Kevin Bacon is hard to come by in this day and age, but he nails his character's attributes all the way through, by sometimes being as argumentative and dictative as the mob bosses he's going after.<br/><br/>Moreover, while much of this acting comes together because of the actors' natural strengths, the film also works because Cooper (who directed 2013's tragically underrated ""Out of the Furnace"") knows how to handle over a dozen different talents at once, and how to showcase them. He takes the inhuman and makes them human, with lingering shots of facial expressions, particularly eyes (consider a key scene that focuses on Cochrane after an almost inevitable, but guilt-ridden death), and careful, mannered movements of his characters. Partly why I feel Depp shines so much in this film is because Cooper knows what to focus on with him when it comes to showing off his skills as an actor, and with that, ""Black Mass"" becomes an observant film of human sensibilities.<br/><br/>""Black Mass"" is a great way to kick off awards season, and its ensemble cast, all of whom at different points in their career, makes the film hold a variety of appeal. Its pacing and structure may be a little loose, but its loose ends are largely held together by the powerhouse display of directorial and acting talent on display at all times here. We're lucky to get one good crime drama a year, and this year, we're very lucky to have gotten ""Black Mass."""

","Black Mass is a completely enthralling biopic about one of the most violent mobsters in Boston history, but even more impressively represents a return to form for Johnny Depp. This film hinges on Depp's performance, if he's not good the film would come across as slow, but even when the film slows down Depp's chilling performance as Whitey Bulger keeps you interested. The film had to compete with the fact that the man James ""Whitey"" Bulger was a heavy inspiration for Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"", however the film did a good job looking at the character in a different angle. Many of the other characters lack development, and the story wears thin at times, but for the most part the film is well constructed, and even better executed. Depps performance, the beautiful cinematography, dark humor, and the perfectly dark tone make Black Mass a really solid Mob drama."

","For some reason I do not remember, I ended up watching this movie in the cinema. As the plot progressed, it became more and more pretentious, something like a failed attempt to copy the work of the great Marty Scorsese. Johnny Depp is an actor with abilities, manages to build a truly sinister character. Joel Edgerton effectively achieves an exasperating character for his idiocy and his pathetic pretense of being a gangster. The story is told in the typical flashback format from the point of view of a former gangster belonging to the Whitey Bulger (Depp) gang. The formula is repeated, we see his rise, his position in the neighborhood, his ally FBI agent John Connolly (Edgerton) who protects him, business with dirty politicians, loose ends, and of course all this converges in the predictable fall of these characters. Nothing new.<br/><br/>Hollywood sometimes gets bored, and it comes up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã producing films with little innovative content, which repeat themselves as can be seen also in ""American Hustle"" (2013), in desperate attempts to emulate the masterful narrative of great films such as ""Goodfellas"" (1990), ""Casino"" (1995), or ""Scarface"" (1983)."
"seymourblack-1","8","0","1","26 March 2017"," A ""Must-See"" For All Gangster Movie Fans
","In this movie, a series of testimonies by a group of criminals tells the story of how the FBI and a mobster in 1970s' Boston entered into an extraordinary alliance to bring down the city's Italian mafia. Both sides co-operated with the aim of eliminating their common enemy but their collusion also resulted in the small-time mobster being given all the latitude he needed to develop into a criminal kingpin.<br/><br/>Jimmy ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp), the leader of South Boston's Winter Hill Gang, was involved in racketeering, extortion, controlling vending machines etc. but was also increasingly troubled by the Italian mafia who were steadily muscling in on his territory. When his childhood friend and FBI agent, John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) was assigned to clean up the city's North End, he immediately targeted the Italian mafia and persuaded his boss, Special Agent Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon), to let him exploit his friendship with Bulger to gather the intelligence they needed to bring an end to the mafia's operations. McGuire reluctantly agreed and a deal was subsequently struck between Connolly and Bulger. As a reward for his co-operation, the deal gave the gangster an assurance that he wouldn't be arrested.<br/><br/>Bulger made good use of the protection he was given to carry on his criminal activities uninterrupted and after supplying Connolly with some useful information about the Italians, the FBI agent was able to bring them to justice. This enhanced Connolly's status within the FBI and removed Bulger's only criminal rivals. Connolly's loyalty to his old friend who, as a child, had protected him from bullies, then led to them socialising together and Connolly becoming ever more corrupt as he ignored or discredited any evidence that he was given against Bulger. Things then changed for the FBI man when a new ""by-the-book"" prosecutor was appointed and Connolly suddenly found that, from that time on, he would have to play strictly by the rules.<br/><br/>Director Scott Cooper does a great job of condensing all the important elements of this true story into a hard-hitting end-product that convincingly recreates the era in which it's set. The dialogue is also economical and sounds very authentic, especially in the FBI interviews with Bulger's closest associates. The action features a great deal of brutality, profanity and corruption and a tremendous number of executions, with many carried out by Bulger himself. He's a terrifying psychopath whose volatility and paranoia provoke him into killing even when his victims don't necessarily present any great danger to him and so it's interesting to see the various passages of the film in which his more human side is depicted. In these scenes, he's shown as a kind father and a loving son who's helpful to old ladies.<br/><br/>It's striking just how strong Connolly's bonds are with the characters that he grew up in the same neighbourhood as him and it's this loyalty that paved the way for an arrangement which gave Bulger's gang the freedom to carry out their criminal activities for so long without any adverse consequences. It's also interesting that Bulger's brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a state senator during the period when the gangster's arrangement with Connolly was in force.<br/><br/>The quality of the cast in this movie is exceptional with everyone providing superb performances and the unrecognisable Johnny Depp absolutely immense in his role as Bulger. ""Black Mass"" did well commercially and is definitely a ""must-see"" for all gangster movie fans."
"danielepinat","Null","0","1","27 February 2017"," Black Mass a film or a documentary film
","Black Mass 2015 directed by Scott Cooper should not be called a movie but a documentary film not on the life of James Whitey Bulger but on the hideous and gruesome murders committed as a true criminal as Stevie would say about Bulger in the film. <br/><br/>Briefly, the spectator is drawn in all the horrendous killings Bulger committed or had other people do for him. Not much is said when it comes to his growing up in South Boston with the Winter Hill gang or his stay in Alcatraz and how everything led to his perverted life as what could be called serial killing.<br/><br/>There are two scenes worth the watching and it is that, first of all, the dinner scene where he will slowly manipulate Morris by showing some form of humanity where friends gather around the table, forgetting for a moment the evil they bathe in when Bulger to Morris says ''You and I gotta have a little sit-down here, only to talk especially about the recipe of making a good marinade steak.<br/><br/>As a spectator, I believed the dinner scene would be some form of escape from the drudgery of their lives as thugs, to bring in some relief of what it is to escape for a moment the life of crime, however , the evilness of who Bulger is, is at its utmost perfection. No humanity exists in the underworld.<br/><br/>The second is how Bulger's murder's Stevie's stepdaughter in front of Stevie himself and not acting to protect her. How can a person stand to see someone who is part of a family even if by alliance like being a stepdaughter not react? Probably, when Stevie begins his confession to the FBI and when asked how he would describe his boss. The camera is focused on Stevie's face and on a closeup shot he replies ''A real criminal''. I assume his inaction towards the killing of his step daughter is one of admiration towards his boss or the fact that he is so involved in murders that now, if he would act against his boss he would act against himself thus leading to his death if discovered. No one knows.<br/><br/>An excellent film, yet, a solid heart is needed to see a film such as this one where almost 2 hours of murders are shown that goes beyond what one can imagine what crime life is all about."

","""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" and ""The Departed"" are probably both better movies about crime in Boston than ""Black Mass."" Johnny Depp's brilliant performance as Whitey Bulger, by itself, raises the level of this movie to equal them. This movie captures the grittiness of many Boston neighborhoods in much the same way ""Mystic River"" did. The story is a cautionary tale about power, in this case as wielded by the FBI, and counts as one of many black marks against an agency that rewards ambition more than integrity. The treatment of Billy Bulger, Whitey's younger brother, who rose to become President of the Massachusetts Senate and President of the University of Massachusetts, is nuanced but perhaps overly kind. I lived in Boston during much of this time, and in Southern California when Whitey was apprehended, so I was aware of much of this story. What I really didn't know was the high proportion of his associates who ultimately turned state's evidence against him."
"brando647","8","0","2","29 October 2016"," One of Johnny Depp's Best/Most Grounded Performances
","BLACK MASS is a valuable reminder that Johnny Depp doesn't need a zany costume and wacky mannerisms to perform. I suppose the last time I saw him in a more grounded role was probably THE RUM DIARY from 2011, and that was none too memorable. His performance as Boston mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger is his best in many years. BLACK MASS tells the story of how FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returned to Boston and convinced his superiors that an alliance with south Boston criminal Bulger would be vital in stamping out Italian mob activities in the area. Bulger begins acting as an informant to the FBI, providing useful information to flush out his competition while building his own criminal empire. Meanwhile, Connolly and his co-conspirator John Morris (David Harbour) work within the FBI to hide evidence of Bulger's activities, allowing him to thrive and providing the them a cushier life than is normally afforded government agents. BLACK MASS chronicles James Bulger's rise to power, the violence and murder that defined his reign as one of America's most dangerous criminals, and his eventual downfall when the FBI began to crack down on their internal corruption, sending Bulger on the run. BLACK MASS is a movie that won't leave you feeling too well, as there's hardly an honorable character in the mix and just about everyone is a villain, but it's engrossing in it's depiction of government corruption left to run wild and the shady individuals it allows to thrive.<br/><br/>When I first saw BLACK MASS, I found myself frustratingly distracted by two things: Depp's makeup as Bulger and Benedict Cumberbatch's Boston accent. Once you get accustomed to those, this movie is pretty cool. It's adapted from the book of the same name, written by the Boston Globe reporters who broke the story in 1997 about Bulger's association with the FBI. It's a dour portrait of one of America's most infamous gangsters, a man who spent more than a decade on the FBI's Most Wanted list. If Depp's performance is anything to go by, the man was not one to be messed with. With his thinning hair, piercing blue eyes, and predatory nature, Bulger struck fear into anyone unfortunate to have had dealings with him. He's a cold, calculating man with a free ticket for violence and murder to establish his empire thanks to the blind eye turned his way. Johnny Depp, who seems at first a weird choice for the role, knocks it out of the park as Bulger. He plays the man like a shark, calm and collected until he smells blood in the water. Then he snaps and you'd just better hope you're not on the receiving end. Depp's Bulger is the focal point of BLACK MASS so the movie really lives or dies based on his performance, and it's easy to forget the man under that hairpiece and contact lenses is the same man famous for eccentric performances like Jack Sparrow or the creepy Willy Wonka.<br/><br/>Depp is supported with a fantastic cast including Edgerton, Harbour, Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Sarsgaard, Jesse Plemons and more. The movie is loaded with serious talent, bringing this story to life. Most of them are nothing more than background dressing, be it Bacon's role as Connolly's FBI superior or Cumberbatch's role as Bulger's brother/Massachusetts senator Billy. Neither does more than serve their limited role in the overall story, but it's great that even the smaller roles were handled with care. The city of Boston is just as much a character in the scope of this movie. Bulger was first and foremost a ""Southie"", a man of Irish heritage born and raised in south Boston. The community played a major role in Bulger's life. People knew him and were loyal to him. The movie makes a point to show Bulger's love for his hometown in a moment when he crosses paths with a little old woman from his past and insists on helping her get her groceries home. BLACK MASS tries to pin a human side to the seemingly inhuman gangster with some background into the death of his young (adopted?) son but any humanity he might have seems to fade when the chains are off and Bulger is given the chance to rule Boston's underworld. BLACK MASS is definitely a ""feel-bad"" movie but it's a good one. It'll blow your mind what the man was able to get away with but at least the movie closes on a positive note with the reminder that Bulger was eventually brought to justice to serve the rest of his life in prison."

","I watched this movie literally minutes after setting down the book 'Whitey Bulger' (Copyright 2013 by Globe Newspaper Company, Inc.), written by Boston Globe reporters Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy. Neither one is credited in the source material for the film, either as writers or for screenplay; that goes to Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill for another book. If I didn't know that it wouldn't have made any difference, since a lot of what appears in the movie was touched on in the one I read with only the very slightest of variations which I'll get to.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this story is that it's actually true, based on the life of Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger. So when you see the local FBI office making a deal with Bulger (Johnny Depp) to provide information on the rival Mafia gang, one can hardly believe it since it seems like it comes from someone's delusional imagination. But this was at a time in the early Seventies when the Bureau's mandate was to get the goods on the Italian Cosa Nostra virtually to the exclusion of any other priorities.<br/><br/>What may be a little difficult to follow are all various scenarios and vignettes that don't seem to be connected in any way, like the death of Bulger's son, his involvement with World Jai Alai, the murder of Stephen Flemmi's (Rory Cochrane) girlfriend's daughter, and the gun running operation to the IRA. The book provides all the background and nuance to these events in a way that better illustrates the relationships of the participating players. What's almost absent in the film is any actual involvement with the Jerry Angiulo crime family, although it's touched on here and there.<br/><br/>Realizing that the film comes in at two hours to begin with, the major missing element to the Bulger story was his relationship with the two main women in his life. For a good part of his mobster life, Bulger lived with a woman by the name of Theresa Stanley and her family during the day, and then reverted to his alternate lover Cathy Grieg by night. When it eventually became necessary for Bulger to make himself scarce, he went on the run, first with Stanley, but she could only take it for a couple of months. Whitey returned her to Boston after receiving word of partner Flemmi's arrest. With Cathy Grieg, he remained a fugitive for the next sixteen years.<br/><br/>Bulger's apprehension and arrest to close out the film story was attributed to an anonymous tip, however his actual undoing came as the result of a chance encounter Cathy Grieg had with a fellow dog lover while living in Santa Monica. After that friend moved to Iceland, she saw a television account of Bulger and Grieg, recognizing them immediately. Calling the Boston office of the FBI, a new detail on the case contacted the Los Angeles FBI and the apprehension was made rather quickly and without incident.<br/><br/>As far as gangster movies goes, I thought this one was adequate, helped by the perspective I had from reading 'Whitey Bulger'. It doesn't stack up to films like ""The Godfather"", ""Scarface"" or ""Miller's Crossing"" in terms of excitement or intensity, but then again, this was a true story. A note of thanks to IMDb reviewer 'TxMike' for an explanation on the title of the movie, as I was wondering about that myself and couldn't figure out what connection it had to Whitey Bulger or the Winter Hill Gang, but now I know."
"sol-","Null","0","1","24 September 2016"," Mind of a Criminal
","Based on the true story of Boston crime lord Whitey Bulger and his longtime not-so-legitimate association with the FBI, 'Black Mass' tells a notable slice of American history. The film is credited as a biography on IMDb, which is not quite right; Johnny Depp is electric as Bulger, but he is more of a supporting character in the tale with emphasis constantly on Joel Edgerton as his FBI contact - a childhood friend who finds himself in a tricky position, torn between loyalty to the Bureau and his a lifetime pal who has looked after him for as long as he can remember. It all seems fine at first, with Edgerton able to offer Depp immunity if he agrees to turn informant, however, as Depp misuses his immunity to take down those around him and become even more ruthless, Edgerton finds himself stuck in a corner. On one hand, all the emphasis on Edgerton does not feel right. With limited room for characterisation, Depp's Bulger is defined in very broad brushstrokes; we are led to believe that his anger over his son's death hardened him as a criminal, but we seldom see how he ticks beneath the tough surface. On the other hand, Edgerton is so great wrestling with his internal conflicts that more emphasis on him may have in fact been better. Either way, the film is quite uneven with all the jumping between characters, but solid acting keeps thing afloat. While Edgerton steals the show, Depp has several excellent moments; his anger over a 'family secret' recipe is a surefire highlight, and the scenes where he bonds with his son shed a lot of light on the way his mind works."

","I had really been looking forward to Scott Cooper's 2015 feature Black Mass. I heard so much positive feedback about Johnny Depp's role, and never finding a reason to enjoy his work, I was hopeful to finally see what I had been missing with this actor. Also starring Joel Edgerton and Benedict Cumberbatch, Black Mass explores the life of infamous crime boss, Whitey Bulger. What was expected to be an interesting look at the life of one of the most elusive criminals in American history, turned into a movie trying too hard to be a Martin Scorsese picture.<br/><br/>James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) Irish mob boss turned F.B.I. informant, was at the top of his game in 1970's Boston. When Bulger's interests began to be threatened in his native Boston by infiltrating Italian mobs, he stopped at nothing to keep his reign. Bulger had a career, if you could call it that, filled with soapbox discussions against those associates of his that expelled information. Yet, when Bulger was threatened, that is exactly what he did, shared information with the F.B.I., became an informant and only protected himself and his interests. Of course, being responsible for the death of dozens of people Bulger is no moral compass, but he quickly abandoned his vow of secrecy when it served him. Black Mass shows Bulger's rise to power, his time as a top crime boss and the many ways that title allowed him to control nearly every aspect of Boston, and his eventual arrest just 5 years ago. <br/><br/>I found most things about this film a terrible miss. So much hype arose around Depp's portrayal of the infamous crime lord, I thought there was no way it could be wrong. Depp's acting was good, but nothing worth changing my opinion of him being a mediocre, yet overrated, actor. I have a notebook's worth of questions for the makeup department responsible for Depp's look in Black Mass. His makeup was atrocious and so overdone that it was distracting every time he was on screen. I would have appreciated more if Depp didn't look exactly like Bulger, and instead looked like he had an actual face. In addition to the horrible makeup, the blue contacts Depp wore looked like something out of a science fiction film. I get it, Bulger has blue eyes and Depp needed blue eyes for the film, but a couple shades lighter on the contacts would have still conveyed Bulger's blue eyes without the unrealistic glow-in-the-dark product we see on screen. I'm almost always a Benedict Cumberbatch fan, but the forced unnatural Boston accent he butchered throughout the film was another horrible distraction throughout. The whole film was off, and I suspect that largely has to do with Scott Cooper's attempts to create something Scorsese-esque. Everything about this film from the cinematography to the characterization of the actors felt like they were trying to imitate Goodfellas. There's only one Goodfellas, and there's only one Scorsese. Black Mass suffered from poor pacing, was lacking in even one character that the audience can attach themselves to, and was just plain boring. No mafia classic in the making here, Black Mass is sure to disappear without a trace."

","James 'Whitey' Bulger (Johnny Depp) is a small time Irish mobster in Southie Boston. FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), from the neighborhood, recruits Whitey to be an informant through his political brother Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch). Connolly and his boss Agent Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) are trying to bring down the Italian mob in Boston. The loyalty of Connolly is in doubt as McGuire demands more from Whitey who starts to become a powerful gangster.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp regains his acting cred. The story is told in a straight forward manner. It's a bit too straight. Connolly is the missing emotional drama element. Edgerton is fine but his character could have been even more epic. In many ways, his character is the mystery and the possible main character study. It's his character that changes throughout the story. It's his character that provides a possible arc. The reveal of his manufacturing of Whitey's information is a dramatic highlight. The question of why is touched on but it could be a whole movie by itself. Connolly would make for a superior main character. That's not saying that the acting from both is anything but top rate."

""It plays in the idea of an unholy alliance.'' <br/><br/>Johnny Depp received a Best Actor nomination for his role as Bulger, complete with prosthetic makeup which, according to those who knew Bulger in the 1970s and 1980s, was eerily reminiscent of Bulger himself. The look, along with Depp's acting, was genuinely menacing to some of the cast members, according to the 12-minute feature on the DVD extras.<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Well yes if you believe that it is primarily factual. As we see in the movie Bulger leaves Boston and travels the world under assumed names until captured some years later and he is now in prison for the rest of his life. He disputes the content of the source book, as do several other key characters. Depp requested, through his lawyer, a face-to-face with Bulger, but was denied, reportedly because Bulger was not happy with the story being presented.<br/><br/>The movie has lots of bloody violence and foul language throughout, as might be expected of ruthless mobsters.

"lavatch","Null","0","1","6 May 2016"," The Shocking Depiction of a Life in Crime
","Johnny Depp's portrayal of Boston crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger must rank among the most repellent characters in recent Hollywood films. Perhaps the film's greatest achievement is to dramatize how Bulger escaped prosecution for blatant lawless, including racketeering and multiple murders for years. Incredibly, he lived undetected for sixteen years in an apartment in Santa Monica, California, prior to his arrest and conviction to two life terms in prison.<br/><br/>One of the themes of the film is the loyalty that existed among the Irish men from South Boston. Bulger had lifelong ties to his childhood friend John Connolly, who became a career FBI agent and protected Bulger for years as a presumed informant. The sleaziness of the FBI agent, the associates of Bulger, and Whitey Bulger himself are a great accomplishment of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>While much care went into the recreation of the period of the 1970s and '80s, the pacing of the film was slow and there were too many extraneous subplots and incidental events portrayed. The editing could have been tighter to focus on Bulger. Except for the depiction of his devotion to his mother and the tragic death of his young son, Bulger's personal life was not fully developed. It was not clear, for example, why he would not be a pallbearer at his mother's funeral.<br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings, the film was a compelling portrayal of a life in crime and the shocking incompetence of the police and the FBI to allow Bulger to create mayhem and madness in Boston for so many years."

It sounds impossible but the tale is true and the director makes sure every detail of every person involved is summarized at film's end. If Mafia type crime films are your cup of tea BLACK MASS will certainly satisfy. For most, despite a huge case of outstanding actors, the story is so fragmented that it seems an ongoing bloodbath and once again we are privy to the corruption within the law enforcement system ‚Äì especially in Boston. <br/><br/>The synopsis pulls it together rather well: 'Based on a true story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger (Johnny Depp), an Irish Mob godfather and FBI informant who had a ""secret trading"" deal with his brother, William ""Billy"" Bulger (Benedict Cumberland), a state senator and a Boston public figure, and John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), an FBI agent. They planned to take down the Italian mob and mafia in Boston, which went awry and things turned massively violent. When the credence for each other began fading out, drug dealing, murders, and extortion started to rise, and forced the FBI's Boston office to confirm that Whitey Bulger was one of the most notorious criminals in US history and also one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List criminals.'<br/><br/>Take a look at the cast ‚Äì Peter Sarsgaard, Kevin Bacon, Dakota Johnson, Juno Temple, and an array of bit part players each with viable varying accents of Boston areas ‚Äì and you can see how this violent evening would work.

","Bolstered by a truly magnificent performance from an actor who has a penchant for playing larger- than-life characters, Black Mass is another entry into last year's long list of biopics and although it paints a gripping portrait of a notorious crime boss, it's also marred by its generic plot & uneventful storytelling.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Black Mass chronicles the criminal life of infamous Irish-American mobster Whitey ""Jimmy"" Bulger and focuses on the years when he became an informant for FBI for his own self-interests and assisted them in eliminating the rival gang while carrying out his crime business under federal protection at the same time.<br/><br/>Directed by Scott Cooper, there isn't really anything worth mentioning about his latest movie other than Depp's show-stealing work which is probably the only thing that keeps this film afloat for the majority of its runtime. It's a shame considering that Depp gives one of his best performances in a very long time and yet everything else in the movie stays on base level.<br/><br/>Production design team does well in recreating the timeline its story is set in, camera-work is finely carried out, Editing isn't that special for the plot unfolds by putting one factual event after another without any sort of build-up or elevation. The background score by Junkie XL also fails to add any excitement to the story and from a technical standpoint, this is mediocre work.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Black Mass packs a terrific ensemble in Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon & others but it's only Depp who leaves a lasting impression. It actually feels good to watch him play an interesting character once again and like his best works in the past, he overshadows everything & everyone. The supporting work, however, is disappointing.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Black Mass isn't by any means a great crime drama or a fascinating biopic but it works as a welcome return to form for Johnny Depp whose career had almost faded into oblivion. While it certainly wasn't as underwhelming as I was led to believe, it's still an empty picture whose only saving grace is the vicious, intimidating & charismatic performance from an actor who was in severe need of a role like this."

","I grew up around this life, first in Queens and later when I moved to Southie to reconnect with the guys that I served with in the Marines. This is about as true as it gets. It misses the dramatic thrill of 'The Departed."" It does not have the compelling power struggle of ""The Godfather"" movies. It is sort of a poor-man's Goodfellas in that the criminals are typical Irish gangsters of their era. They do not wear suits and get all dolled up. They kill, steal, and scheme - in jeans and bad jackets - that is what they do. In this regard, if you are looking for a movie that will end with some extraordinary dramatic flourish, you will be disappointed. The Godfather or the Sopranos are not the real life of these guys or most mobsters - Irish, Italian, or otherwise. The movie sucks you into the day-to-day existence of a guy who many questioned as to whether or not he was more psychopath than sociopath, and it makes you decide which was he. The one issue I have is that it allows other guys to walk away cleanly. Steve Flemmi is especially given a pass, when everyone knows he was a mass murderer and rapist of women. In the movie they make Flemmi out to be a sympathetic figure (probably because he was hired as a consultant). But in the end, you get a real picture of Whitey. He never really had to kill a lot of folks to get ahead because of the Irish Gang wars of the 1960s and 70s left him as the last man standing. Since the Italian mafia was the Federal focus of the time, he gets the deal he wants from the FBI and the local PD - especially in an Irish Boston that hated anyone with a vowel on the wrong side of his name. He sort of plods his way into power and once he is there, he holds it through pure and justifiable fear. In the end, you see what really happens - no drama... Whitey just committed crimes as easily as he breathed. It was natural for him. That is what makes this movie awesome. Johnny Depp really captures the essence of a guy that just kills people - sometimes for no real purpose. If you like the history of Organized Crime, you will love this movie. If you are looking for a two hour shoot 'em out, you will not. If you like your gangsters in suits and ties, you will hate it. If you like your mobsters in their real element, you will love it.

"smodos","7","0","1","29 November 2015"," Perfect 'biopic'? Or teeming with sub-genre pastiches and a protracted plot line? ‚Äì I'll let you decide.
","The classy yet ultra violent gangster biopic, which has become something of a cult classic of late, is fortunate enough to make yet another appearance with the release of Scott Cooper's Black Mass. As an aficionado of the sub-genre, I eagerly anticipated a familiar assemblage of voice-overs, a dynamic non-linear narrative and a reproachable yet oddly admirable focaliser who, come the denouement, is stripped of his political clout and sent to prison to answer for his crimes. Suffice to say I was not disappointed by what I saw. Despite getting a little lost among its midriff, as does so often happen when filming an episodic multi-decade flick, Black Mass holds up as both a confident and dynamic feature with an interesting political backdrop in Bulger's IRA relations. Following his 2013 thriller; Out of the Furnace, Cooper brings us yet another all-star cast in which Johnny Depp's sterling performance steals the show. Depp's stylish yet chilling rendition of James Bulger marks his return to the big screen after what has arguably been a series of clunkers, the likes of which include Mortdecai and Transcendence. Moreover, Depp's take on Boston's unlawful kingpin 'Whitey' Bulger heralds his reappearance in the biopic style and in a role of some familiarity; playing the charismatic John Dillinger in Public Enemy and Joseph D. Pistone or 'Donnie' (his alias) in Donnie Brasco.<br/><br/>For my part, Black Mass seems to be a picture inspired by the Neo-Noirs of the early 1980's. Whether or not I would classify Black Mass as a Neo-Noir, or even a Neo Neo-Noir I am ambivalent, however Scott Cooper's own taste for the stylish Hollywood crime dramas of the time, such as John Huston's Neo-Noir Fat City, have certainly rubbed off on his own film making ideology. The conflicted antihero (Cooper), the striking use of light and shadow, and the low-key lighting are all elements playing homage to the style. Yet Cooper's steady cinematography make it difficult to deem the film a definite Neo-Noir, as some of the distinctive visual elements attributed to the style rely upon unusual camera placement and movement. Rather it makes the film seem a bit more like a documentary; much to the distaste of some viewers. It can be said that Cooper presents us a sense of verisimilitude worthy of a 'biopic', yet wrapped in a Neo-Noir like shell, reflective of his own work as a director and an appreciator of film. Although arguably it is too early in his filmmaking career to tell, Scott Cooper seems to be becoming an auteur, whose work and influences reflect real life themes and events. Both Black Mass and Crazy heart, his 2009 musical drama in which he produced, wrote and directed, are testament to this dogma.<br/><br/>The sense of gravitas ascribed to Black Mass in presenting a more biographic interpretation of South Boston's unholy alliance, is oddly unique and charming. Black Mass exposes us to the cracks that could so easily infiltrate Federal Law Enforcement agencies in the United States during the late 1900's. Personally, I have not seen a film with a better take on the dark side of American community values since Sidney Lumet's Serpico, in which all but one cop in the New York Police Department succumb to the temptations of the job and are twisted by the system's corruption. I remark the charm of Cooper's work because it has become something of a platitude recently to retrofit the 'gangster biopic' with excessive hyperrealism and the natural propensities of its directors. Whilst this can be a good thing, providing an entertaining experience for the viewer, it can sometimes take the 'bio' out of the 'biopic'. Cooper's Black Mass stays true to the sub-genre's codes and in some ways is an example of a perfect 'biopic', with a neat and intriguing blend of classic gangster movie drama and an intimate Bulger biographical experience.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Cooper's depiction of South Boston's crime syndicate is not completely beyond reproach, and for some moviegoers you can be sure that the slow-moving theatrical cut (which is roughly 45 minutes shorter than Cooper's director's cut) will be subject to audience appraisal, critiqued for being a little too realistic a portrait of Bulger's criminal empire. Several other reviews have been quick to denounce Cooper's Black Mass as not only protracted, but largely an imitation of Martin Scorsese's own oeuvre, and I wouldn't totally disagree with this assertion. Typical genre archetypes and a predictable plot line all make the film seem rather unoriginal, and Black Mass's John Connolly, who seems to be merely a more callow pastiche of The Departed's Colin Sullivan, is testament to Cooper's imitation.<br/><br/>Overall, Scott Cooper's Black Mass offers us a stylishly dark package under the umbrella of an intriguing picaresque gangster biopic, in which the collaborative effort between leading cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's and musical producer Tom Holkenborg stand out profusely. Masanobu Takayanagi's moody photography and Tom Holkenborg's tense musical choreography act in congruity, injecting even more insipid and sullen imagery into the disturbing milieu that is South Boston. But even if that doesn't quite do it for you, how can you turn down Cooper's all-star cast! The likes of which I have not seen for quite some time; Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Adam Scott, Joel Edgerton, Dakota Johnson, Peter Sarsgaard¬Ö it seems an endless list to which the movie belonged to Johnny Depp. It is a role that he has had some experience dealing with in the past and it is within this confident framework that Depp does his deepest work in a very long time. Yet whilst Cooper's rendition of James 'Whitey' Bulger and John Connolly's fall from power will certainly win the vote of those looking for a complete 'biographical crime thriller', alas it's run time of 122 minutes, comprising of what some may call sporadic scene jumping, an episodic narrative structure and an amalgam of crime genre pastiches, is certain to question some viewers loyalties."

","The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.<br/><br/>Black Mass is a horribly watchable gangster picture taken from an extraordinary true story and conceived on familiar generic lines. It's the portrait of both men's worlds - in some ways diametrically opposed, in others oddly similar. Each has his own crew. Portraying these men Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton both give richly absorbing performances. In fact, after too many Caribbean holidays, Johnny Depp finally gets back down to some serious business. His mesmerising performance is a return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires. He is the chief selling point of this film. With his nearly bald head, weird icy blue eyes and deep voice like Ray Liota in Goodfellas; he perfectly embodies a fully accredited sociopath. Less is more. Depp more than rises to the occasion, doing career-best work as a man who emerges as complex and an undeniably charismatic figure. <br/><br/>The viewers also experience an oddly tender side of Bulger himself: a devoted son to his mother, a loving sibling to his state-senator brother - Billy (an excellent Benedict Cumberbatch, as per usual) - and a protective father who even indoctrinates his young son in the ways of the streets. Plus, Whitey and Connolly - played with equally impressive skills by Joel Edgerton - share a sentimental sens of Irish neighbourhood loyalty and tribal paranoia. Moreover, Joel Edgerton is superb at showing how his ambitious character is seduced by the decadent gangster lifestyle, his professional ethic muddied by the clan loyalty and street justice that, in some corners of Boston are more sacred than the Constitution. <br/><br/>The script introduces some satisfying nasty twists, turns and shocks. Director Scott Cooper and his screenwriters have something substantial to add to the genre: making the point that gangsters do not arise from nowhere like comic-strip villains. They are the symptoms of political corruptions, parasites created by agencies of the state and by weak, accepting law enforcement officials who are content to sub-contract policing to the bad guys. Lastly, the violence in Black Mass, when it comes, is swift and brutal but nothing here is more startling than a single sudden lock at Bulger eyes across the room. This film isn't just taking place in the late 70's and early 80's, but seems to have been made then also. <br/><br/>Overall Black Mass is a pessimistic tale about how gangsters are nurtured by corruption. This film is both directed and acted with tremendous confidence."
"a.lampert","8","0","1","27 November 2015"," Memorable and riveting, true life gangster drama.
","I've seen some strangely negative reviews on here which are completely baffling to me. I found Black Mass absorbing, not least by it's relentless violence, brilliantly filmed. But it's not the gripping action scenes that hold this together, but the all round superb acting. Johnny Depp is menacing and intimidating as James 'Whitey' Bulger who ended up one of the FBI's 10 'most wanted'. This is maybe Depp's best performance to date in my opinion but I want also to mention Joel Egerton in particular, as a corrupt FBI agent. I haven't really noticed him before, although his name has appeared in a couple of movies I've seen, but here he gives possibly an award winning support performance. Have to wait and see. Surprisingly too, British actor, Benedict Cumberbatch is very convincing as an American senator and Depp's younger brother, who ignores his sibling's criminal ways. Dakota Johnson as Depp's wife and Juno Temple for the ladies, both stand out for me in small support parts. Even Kevin Bacon sneaks in as Egerton's FBI boss. Scott Cooper the director has drawn wonderful performances all round. Maybe he's an actor's director because I've just noticed he directed Jeff Bridges to an Oscar win for Crazy Heart and this is only his third director's movie. The other thing I want to mention is that I could hear every word of dialogue and that is a real luxury in today's movie market. In so many films today, I have to resort to the internet to find out what I've just watched as I can't understand half of what the actors are mumbling. Not so with Black Mass, it's completely coherent. This is and actor's film of the highest calibre and yes, I have seen The Godfather, Goodfellas and The Departed that other people keep comparing it unfavourably to, but then it's not really like those pictures."

","Saw 'Black Mass' today and enjoyed the film very much. I liked Johnny Depp for the first time for a character he chose to perform and showed his real talent and proved that he is a good actor. He has been doing all these crazy Pirates movies and never looked at him as an actor with substance who is careful of picking his roles. But Johnny Depp has proved that he can give a great performance once again. He can be a great antagonist who you can root for. Usually in a movie like this , director forgets that people want to relate to someone. I could totally relate to Whitey Bulger as a father and a guy who loves and gets along with his family including his mother and brother. That made me totally root for him but at the same time I know that this character is a monster and he will meet his fate and get caught. I thought Scott Cooper truly did a great job by bringing all these stories together into a cohesive plot. I could totally relate to the character of young man in the beginning who was hit by a bunch of guys and slowly I was introduced to Whitey. The actor Joel Edgerton totally stole the show. Every scene he was in, he put his heart and soul into it. I know Johnny Depp did a phenomenal job but I thought Joel totally surprised me by his performance. He should be nominated for an Oscar for such a brilliant performance and win.<br/><br/>Scott Cooper! I congratulate you for doing such a great job for making a film which gives me hope that Hollywood can still put money behind good films. Do not pay any attention to all these people who only want to see cinema just in one way. They just want to see one character on the screen all the time and if you don't give them that , they get lost and complain about character development because Hollywood has trained their mind to look at films just in one way. You told the story in such a great way that it all made sense. You brought in the characters into the plot where they were needed and you just gave enough character development so that I could relate to them but at the same time your film kept me glued to my seat with powerful storytelling, stunning cinematography, incredible music and a strong ending."

","Black Mass is a crime drama starring Johnny Depp, Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon. And its a true story about Whitey Bulger, he is a violent criminal that becomes a FBI informant to take down a mafia family invading his own empire. Johnny Depp is amazing in his role, he truly become his character with the make- up and performance. He is a really disgusting man and it proves that he is a leach-like human. Joel Edgerton is also great and he is really showing that he can act really well. Basically all performances are very good. But in its story, there is a hollowness in the script as all of them are bad persons and you really cannot find a good person and root for them.

","Having recently watched the excellent film Legend I was a bit unsure what to expect from this film. By looking at the trailer I was not sure if I would like this film at all. However the performance of Johnny Depp put my worries completely to shame. The same goes for the other actors as well, a quite impressive performance from all.<br/><br/>I kept reminding me that this movie is based on a true story. When you keep that in mind Depp's performance is chilling at times, but to my surprise he is also able to portray a character that is both pure evil and surprisingly caring all in one nice package.<br/><br/>What made me like this film is that I did not notice any fancy CGI effects, the film felt natural and believable and not over the top.

","When this movie came out in September (I'm writing this months later, in Nov.), it never occurred to me to pen a review. If you haven't seen this movie, catch it wherever it is showing. This is a very, very good crime movie. It's extremely brutal but it's due to how horrible a person James ""Whitey"" Bulger was (or still is) and why he was on the FBI most-wanted list for so many years. I can't say enough about Depp without mentioning his co-stars, as Joel Edgerton shines as the corrupted FBI agent Connolly as do everyone else in their respective roles. Depp, however, disappears not only because of excellent make up but some really kick-ass acting that makes one remember why Johnny Depp is so highly acclaimed. He goes from a nice guy to cold-blooded killer in mere seconds. Based upon the book Black Mass, from what I remember, the film does a good job with what it takes from the book. I would have liked to have seen what ended up on the cutting room floor (a scene with one of Whitey's girl friends for one) because that might have warranted a 10 instead of a 9 from me."
"Turfseer","8","0","1","7 November 2015"," A mobster story that flows even if you've seen something like this before
","If you've already seen ""The Departed"", Martin Scorsese's Academy Award- winning film loosely based on the Whitey Bulger story or the excellent documentary by Joe Berlinger, ""Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger,"" you might ask if there's room for just one more film about the notorious criminal who wreaked havoc in South Boston during the 1970s and early 1980s. The answer is that ""Black Mass,"" director Scott Cooper's new entry in the Bulger pantheon, fits the bill pretty well, even if you're already familiar with most of the facts regarding the turf war between Bulger's Winter Hill gang and their notorious rivals, the Angiulo brothers.<br/><br/>Black Mass makes its case against Whitey in the style of a police procedural. It begins with flashbacks set forth in a series of FBI interviews of two Bulger associates, right-hand man Steve Flemmi and neophyte Kevin Weeks (who unfortunately end up with light sentences due to their cooperation in bringing Bulger down). <br/><br/>Bulger's brutality is highlighted almost immediately after he takes revenge on an associate who beat up Weeks up in a confrontation outside a local pub. Soon afterward he murders one of his own enforcers, Tommy King, who disses him while intoxicated inside a favorite watering hole. Johnny Depp finally finds his stride in a welcome bad boy role as Whitey and the script wisely highlights a confounding kind side-- Whitey stops to help carry packages for an old lady in the neighborhood, is attentive to his elderly mother and feels real despair when his young son falls into a coma. He's not all that kind to his wife however, by threatening her when she refers in a moment of grief to the dying child as ""my son,"" and immediately wants to take him off life support.<br/><br/>Bulger the sadistic psychopath is not what makes Black Mass so interesting. It's really the story of renegade FBI agent, John Connolly, winningly played by Joel Edgerton. Connolly was a childhood friend of both Whitey and brother Billy Bulger, who became president of the Massachusetts State Senate. Connolly really shouldn't have become an FBI agent in the first place given his close ties to Whitey and disposition toward the criminal life. The FBI ended up giving Connolly free reign to use Whitey as an informant who eventually convinced Whitey to provide the FBI with a wiretap location for the Angiulo brothers. Seduced by Whitey, Connolly invited him over along with his associates, much to the chagrin of his wife Marianne, who soon became decidedly distressed over her husband's most apparent change in personality.<br/><br/>The tension in the Black Mass plot escalates when Whitey decides to murder the new executive of a Jai Alai arena in Florida who refuses to take kickback money. Whitey pays an associate, Halloran, 20K to keep silent but he ends up going to the FBI who refuse to use his testimony after he refuses a polygraph. After Whitey gets wind of this, Halloran and a friend, are murdered in broad daylight.<br/><br/>The stakes are raised when Bulger questions Flemmi's stepdaughter prostitute girlfriend whether she revealed anything about the Winter Hill gang to the police. In a great scene, the prostitute, Deborah Hussey, seems convincingly innocent when she answers Bulger's questions about her police interrogation. But after taking her home, he strangles her in front of Flemmi, who does a good job at hiding how appalled he is at Bulger's viciousness.<br/><br/>The denouement is set in motion when the informant McIntyre is forced to confess to the rival DEA that he was responsible for the intercepted arms shipment to the IRA, ordered by Bulger. McIntyre is then tortured and murdered by Whitey a la Hannibal Lecter. Pitbull prosecutor Wyshak, along with Connolly associate John Morris, realize that Connolly's ""tips"" are a cut and paste job from past reports of low-level informants.<br/><br/>After Morris spills all the beans to two Boston Globe reporters, the ensuing news expos√© leads to the collapse of Bulger's empire and his subsequent exile. Connolly's arrest is foreshadowed by the scene in which his wife locks him out of their house (preceding this turn of events is the best scene in the film when Whitey both caresses and threatens Connolly's wife after she refuses to join him and his associates at the dinner table).<br/><br/>Some critics complained about a failure of to show how Bulger's empire operated‚Äîthey wanted more scenes involving the shakedowns, etc. Instead what was proffered was simply a short montage. It seems to me that such an abridged gambit was superior to the suggestion of added footage. <br/><br/>All in all, Black Mass is a well-done recapitulation of the story of the twisted relationship between Whitey Bulger and John Connolly. Even if one was familiar with this story from previous attempts at chronicling it, the story as it's told‚Äîa straightforward police procedural of sorts‚Äî keeps one interested to the end. There might be little new here but Black Mass is a narrative that flows in an admirable way."

","Seeing any promotional material will make it clear 'Black Mass' is an obvious award season bandwagon that, thankfully, boasts substance in its a-list cast. Trumping them all, however, Depp is frighteningly captivating. The actor's deep, wide eyes compliment the criminal's more touching moments, such as playing cards with his elderly mother, in addition to several menacing metaphorical speeches that he reminds those around him, including one notably unpredictable scene with Kevin Bacon's Charles McGuire, about the importance of keeping your mouth shut. Validating these moments, Whitey isn't afraid to get his hands dirty ‚Äì strangling enemies with his own bare hands, and even appearing as an exterminator with an assault rifle trying to clean his streets of filthy rats. Depp embodies this newfound R-rated freedom, becoming physically invested in a handful of gruesomely grounded killings, along with a generous supply of f-bombs. This isn't Captain Jack, folks.<br/><br/>Like his counterpart will likely do for lead actor contention, Edgerton will make a compelling argument for supporting cast discussions come February. Subtlety evolving his posture, stride and mannerisms Edgerton does a magnificent job in adjusting Connolly's behavior as his fortune grows. Yet, when his character's confidence is tested, Edgerton shines. In a torrent of noteworthy scenes that catch Connolly conflicted between the morally perplexing obligations of the law or his loyalty to his childhood brother, Edgerton emanates shaky uncertainty by enlisting a stutter that seemingly breeds in authenticity the higher the stakes become. A fantastic third-string cast aids many of these confrontations, illuminated by a fierce Julianne Nicholson adding some welcome femininity to the overbearing testosterone. Jesse Plemons, who I was for some reason convinced was Matt Damon under all that make-up, did a fine job narrating the first act and bringing more depth to his typecast henchman role. And Corey Stoll makes a disappointingly brief appearance as a new FBI head Fred Wyshak, supplying his 'House of Cards' brand of leadership ‚Äì an element that would have livened a climatic confrontation if the narrative continued to follow his pursuit of Bulger and suspicion of Connolly.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/09/18/black-mass-review-indieadam-tiff- 2015/"

","Musing the fact that the 45-year-old director Scott Brooks has only 3 motion pictures to his name, BLACK MASS being the 3rd one, I am lost for words in the effort (please note: I state ""the effort"") that is involved in the biography of Whitey Bulger. Scott Brooks displayed an extensive creative capacity when he teamed up with Christian Bale in 2013 for OUT OF THE FURNACE. Endeavoring to reach further he perhaps may have crafted his best work up to date in BLACK MASS. This biography that unfolds a smidge of opaque American history is a near masterpiece of story telling if the soundtrack to the picture took a more powerful tone. When tales of turf wars are told and when the word mafia comes into play in any context, and if your experience to cinema stretches further than DC & Marvel, then you are now toying with the name Corleone (Which isn't so ‚Äì characters fail to grow around Depp as the screenplay stubbornly clings onto him). Set in violent times BLACK MASS is a gruesome memento of the vehemence and goriness of turf squabbles starting in the early 70s. Johnny Depp is no Marlon Brando. However this is arguably one of the finest bit of acting Johnny Depp has done since his Caribbean ventures. Depp who is unequivocally one of the most adaptable actors of today fits the role of Whitey Bulger like a glove. I can only think of Leonardo Dicaprio, Tim Roth, Ray Liotta & Oscar Isaac who could have even attempted this role apart from Depp. The Irish American convicted criminal and murderer (not at the time the movie is based) is brother to Billy Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) a senator and friend to John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). Connolly who is an FBI agent brings in Whitey as a top echelon informant to the FBI. Whitey on the other hand goes along with this only in the interest of business. Trading secrets to gain turf over the Italian Mafia of Boston and being the top dog is his only interest. <br/><br/>Somewhere in this saturnine screenplay BLACK MASS loses momentum. Characters fall off weakening the plot and the movie as a whole. Kevin Bacons presence is authoritative and concentrated but is felt ill used just as Benedict Cumberbatch keeps popping in and out of the picture (What a waste of characters). Cinematography is poor and has room beyond it ever-even attempts. Shots of Boston, grim insights to what goes on after sunset are key elements that are overlooked. The audiences demand this. We know Whitey does, we wish we see more. Credit is to be given to Depp for he is the glue that keeps BLACK MASS intact.<br/><br/>Went in hoping this is a contender for the big show in February 2016. It wont be!

In the 1900s, America's original ""Title Town"" sports capital was Detroit, MI.

","Black Mass is one of the best movies to hit movie theatres in a long time. It is a gangster style biopic of the famous South Boston crime lord, James ""Whitey"" Bulger.<br/><br/>This movie essentially has two protagonists, Whitey and John Connolly, a lot of side characters, and no clear antagonist, however there are clearly a lot of guys looking to take down Bulger and Connolly. Essentially the storyline puts a lot of emphasis on the relationship of Bulger and Connolly, one being a crime lord and leader of the Winter Hill Gang, and the other an FBI agent. Both of them use and abuse this relationship as Whitey essentially has immunity, and Connolly looks like an all star agent for the info he gets. In the beginning, the alliance is formed to take down the Italian mafia. Eventually they succeed and Connolly is promoted and praised by the FBI, while Bulger wins the street war he had with the Italians. All is well for both sides, until Bulger's son becomes sick. Following the death of his son, he becomes a heartless, cold- blooded, manipulative crime lord. He kills anybody, and for any reason. Naturally this takes a toll on his fellow gang members, particularly his number two man, Steve Flemmi, who has to helplessly watch as Bulger murders his girlfriends daughter, as he watches and then has to ""clean up"". Eventually, the bond is found and both are taken down by the FBI.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was out of this world, and I would not be surprised to see two or three Oscar nods towards the cast, namely Johnny Depp, Dakota Johnson and possibly Benedict Cumberbatch. Johnny Depp has always been my favorite actor, and this is one of his best performances to date. I was extremely surprised to see the casting of Dakota Johnson as Lindsey Cyr, Whitey's girlfriend and mother of his son. I only knew the name because of the 50 shades movie which frankly I had no desire to see. She delivers though, with a breathtakingly emotional performance, and she is believable in every word she says. Joel Edgerton plays John Connolly, and is perfect for the role. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Whitey's brother Billy, a straight edge politician. He again, plays the role to perfection and I believe this is one of his better performances over his already great career. On top of that, Kevin Bacon, Rory Cochrane, Corey Stoll, David Harbour, Adam Scott and Julianne Nicholson are absolutely fantastic and add to the overall enjoyable-ness of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic and deserves to be treated like one. An absolue must watch for anybody."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","0","1","13 October 2015"," Depp excels in a movie that is serviceable but forgettable
","I understand now what everyone means when they say they've come away from Black Mass feeling pretty much nothing. I place blame for that with Scott Cooper, who is the perfect example of ""safe"" director choice. He can pull out great performances and construct solid scenes but he has no flair or trademark to his ability. Just as Crazy Heart was a less interesting rehash of The Wrestler, Black Mass is a less fun, surprisingly less compelling version of Goodfellas. That's not to say Black Mass is bad. It is throughly well put together and honestly I can't point to a flaw, its just that with only one exception, nothing in this movie is particularly memorable. <br/><br/>That exception is the acting. Boy oh boy how happy I am to say that I like Johnny Depp now. After a decade defiling our screens with excruciating melodramas, unwanted Pirates sequels and Tim Burton colour-gasms, his performance as James Whitey Bulger is easily the finest of the year. He wears his dead tooth, slicked back hair and skull makeup like a crown and owns every single scene of this film. He's cold, collected, brutal and completely remorseless. He has no qualms about killing women or coaching his son to assault other children. Not since Javier Bardem's Oscar-winning turn as Anton Chigurh have I been so thankful this guy can't come up and speak to me in real life. I would honestly not know what to do. However, it is the tragically too few scenes in which Cooper lets Depp tap into Bulger's human side (his relationship with his son) that Depp really shines. A look of haunted hope or grief crosses his face very briefly, before he buries it down beneath the surface of evil. Just as Cooper finally won Bridges his Oscar, I think and hope that Depp ascends to the stage next February.<br/><br/>Black Mass is definitely an acting vehicle. Joel Edgerton is also very good here, transforming from FBI nobody to cocky top man as he coasts through the ranks. Dakota Johnson is great in a small role as Jimmy's girlfriend - it takes a lot of skill to look at Depp's Whitey Bulger and show convincing affection and love in your eyes. Julianne Nicholson's holds up her end of the bargain in a scene that allows Depp to really show Bulger's sick mannerisms. Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Saarsgard, Corey Stoll and Jesse Plemons are all great, though I wish Kevin Bacon had been given more to do.<br/><br/>The film's pacing is excruciating, probably the longest two hours of my life. The story of Black Mass is fascinating, but surprisingly I found myself bored by the film's screenplay. We jump from event to event just before each murder or crime is committed, not really understanding why its happening. Its as if Cooper was more interested in showing the murders than explaining why they happened. There's some great dialogue in here, particularly a line about playing cops and robbers in the playground and in real life, but not enough to keep the film moving along at a steady pace. I still love the ""family secret"" scene, although I know is less effective than the one in Goodfellas - and for some reason works less effectively than in the trailer. <br/><br/>Beyond that, though, there's little to criticise about Black Mass. Its serviceable enough to recommend for Depp's performance, and I hope that he and the makeup artists get the recognition they deserve, but beyond that I can't help but feel let down by a film that was in my top three anticipated of the year."

Earl Brown, Bill Camp, Juno Temple. Uneven account of Boston's Public Enemy #1, John ""Whitey"" Bulger (icy good Depp uncannily looking like Ray Liotta) and his connection with the feds including childhood bud John Connelly (Edgerton equally good) who is part of a task force after the Mafia in the 1980s relying on the dubious 'help' of Bulger. The screenplay by Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth (based on Dick Lehr & Gerard O'Neill's book) trips on itself in the fledgling relationship between its two principals but Scott Cooper's Martin Scorsese-lite direction could have used some more urgency to the proceedings at hand. A fine ensemble - some largely wasted (hello, Scott) - make up for the otherwise better-than-average but could've been better movie."

","Johnny Depp... that man can play anyone - anytime - anywhere. Best actor nominee could be a strong possibility. Make-up artists have done their job primely also. Without that - the movie have this amazing story which is featured in an excellent way and thing I liked the most is the fact that in some scenes you have to think really hard - why did that just happen? Why did he do that? Sometimes you figure it out on your own and sometimes the movie tells you the details later. Always nice to watch a movie inspired by interesting, true story and when its so well made - you cant dislike this film. I guess I can call it my crime-mafia type movie favorite and I would strongly suggest You to watch it."
"plwalsh-49-405725","2","0","1","8 October 2015"," Dark and slow
","I was so looking forward to this movie and was so disappointed! Many of the actual events took place within a mile or two of my apartment and one scene was shot a five minute walk away. A dozen or so people I know took part in the filming, which was a big deal in Boston and seemed like a huge amount of fun. But the result is dark, dreay, and really, really slow.<br/><br/>I read the book while the movie was being filmed at found it to be a real page turner. Almost none of the drama and suspense, though, made it off the page. Everything seemed completely predictable, I would think, even to someone who had never heard of Whitey Bulger and his exploits. Even the violence was tedious. The film is less than two hours long and seemed more like six.<br/><br/>The acting was fine. Some of it was even quite good. The cinematography was excellent. But the general effect was gray and lifeless, almost plot less, very odd for a gangster flick. I've actually met Billy Bulger and he is a much more vivid character than appeared in this film, no fault to Cumberbatch so far as I could see. If the book is anything to go by, the other characters were similarly dialed down. The mournfully tasteful, softly sobbing violins of the sound track set a mood that seemed afraid to get above a grayish whisper.<br/><br/>And, aside from a couple of skyline views and City Hall, which incongruously plays FBI Headquarters (the real thing is in an office tower next door), there is almost nothing recognizable as Boston. The gritty, contradictory texture the city had in the '70s, the high contrasts between the old and grand, the glittery new, and the old and just run down are entirely missing. Huge chunks of the original script, including whole days of shooting and many characters, were cut out altogether, allegedly to quicken the pace. Alas, a sacrifice to no end."
"stephendaxter","8","0","1","8 October 2015"," A gripping, intense Johnny Depp performance
","Black Mass is a Biopic, a Crime Drama, that follows infamous crime lord James ""Whitey"" Bulger and his involvement with the FBI during the 70's and 80's that led to him becoming one of the most notorious and violently dangerous mobsters in history. This for me is one of the films that is leading the Oscar race in multiple categories. Maybe not for Best Picture but as of today, this film is a strong contender for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and i reckon even Best Cinematography. It was an incredibly gripping story that was told, it started off a little slow but once it found its feet around 30 minutes in it just got better and better right to the very end. There were occasional moments where it started to look like it wasn't really going anywhere but it quickly gets back on track. It was intense and such an interesting and surreal story that i really knew nothing about. Like i said, there were a couple of moments where it was beginning to lose me a little but there were so many big events packed into this film that if you walked out for even a minute you would miss something. And that just shows a great adaptation of real life events and displaying them in a dramatic way with a very very dark tone that doesn't lighten up at all. <br/><br/>But lets talk about the star of the film, the man who elevates this film so much and gets you so engaged in what is going on, the man who is leading the race for the Best Actor Oscar this year...... Johnny Depp. He is such and absolutely talented actor and this is his best performance in a long time and is one of his best ever because he hits it out of the park in this role. Johnny Depp did such a fantastic job at playing this violent, deranged mobster that 10 minutes into the film you completely forget you are watching Johnny Depp. Almost instantly, he completely disappears into the role and then there is no Depp, only James ""Whitey"" Bulger. He transformed and became this intimidating monster and he really allowed you to see how so many people at the time would fear him and have nightmares about him. An incredible performance and as of today a strong Oscar contender. But why stop there? <br/><br/>If we're giving away Best Actor Nominations, i thing we should give away a Best Supporting Actor Nomination to the amazing Joel Edgerton. He was so great in this film that it is so hard to believe that even with Johnny Depp in the spotlight he manages to shine almost just as brightly. His character was so much more complex than Depp's, he wasn't just crazy, there were so many layers to his character and decisions he has to make and problems he has to overcome that made him an equally interesting character. Just a truly fantastic performance and you cannot help but to be on this guys side for the entire film. Those were the two big guys but then you also had Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Rory Cochrane, and many more all putting on a show. There were so many great performances and they all made for the best parts of the film. <br/><br/>The cinematography was also amazing, very well framed shots captured the tones of the scenes exceptionally well. So well that it may be in the running for Best Cinematography at the end of the year, but we'll have to wait and see. Well an intense story that has its ups and downs in conjunction with some of the best performances of the year puts this film in strong contention for some Oscars. - 7.9"
"dromasca","7","0","2","4 October 2015"," an American anti-hero
","The season for screening films with ambitions for Academy Awards must have started. Black Mass is directed by Scott Cooper - a relative newcomer (this is only his third film) but a rising star among directors at Hollywood if we are to judge the impressing cast he succeeds to enroll - better and better and certainly more expensive from movie to movie. It seems to meet at least a few conditions to enter the competition for Academy nominations. It stars Johnny Depp in a role we barely recognize him which may well get him into the Final 5. It tells a story that captured at some point in time the interest and imagination of big audiences, and it deals with a Big American character. The fact that this character is a despicable gangster, who was in control of one of the lead Mafia gangs ('the Irish one') in Boston in the 80s and early 90s and was responsible for numerous murders and organized crime felonies may eventually matter when the jury will debate. Or maybe not. Until then, let us take our places in the theaters or download from the Internet and watch the movies.<br/><br/>James 'Whitey' Bulger now serving a couple of life sentences is the kind of anti-hero America is fascinated with. The story starts in 1975, when Bulger is enrolled as an informant by the FBI - a status which together with the family ties (his brother played by Benedict Cumberbatch was a state senator) ensured him two decades of immunity and the almost total dominance on the crime industries in the Boston area after eliminating (with the help of the police and justice system) the Italian rival gangs. The story on screen mentions nothing about the still not elucidated episode of the murder of the ""Lady of the Dunes"" that took place a year before, but does include the death of Bulger's only child that actually took place in 1973. From this episode we may or maybe are supposed to understand the motivations of his violence and lack of respect for law or human life? Quite thin for an explanation in my opinion. Despite Depp's fantastic acting the man behind the crimes remains an enigma.<br/><br/>The rest is a 'true crime' story (the film is inspired by a true crime book) with the relations between the boss and his acolytes, the treason and executions of the traitors, the have-heard-it-already rants about the Mafia honor code, with corrupt cops and victimized girlfriends, and with a twist towards Bulger's support for Irish nationalism and terror movements, which was part of the reasons that led to his eventual fall. It started quite confusing to my taste, it improved as the story grew and the relation between characters became more clear (and the number of characters decreased :-) ) but it did not reach any of the peaks of the genre like in Scorsese's films or in Mystic River. Depp's performance is hypnotic, I will try a metaphor and say that he brings death to his hero on screen. Cumberbatch on the other hand will not get another Academy nomination for his role here. I know nothing at this point about the other candidates, but in an average to weak year I would bet for a couple of awards."

","This is such a weird case. I don't really think the film does anything wrong per se. In fact, I guess I kind of enjoyed it. I just have no real opinion towards it one way or another. I do think Johnny Depp is really fantastic though. The trailers for this film made it seem a lot different than it was, and I remember thinking Depp looked to be trying too hard there. He was mighty impressive, totally inhabiting that character and proving that yes, he still has it and he needs to stop making bad films. The film around him, even if with an impressive cast, was just sort of there. I'm not huge on the gangster flick but most at least make me feel something. At the end of the day, this film will only be memorable in my eyes for Depp. But it wasn't bad."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","5","23 September 2015"," Depp is brilliant in a brutal epic.
","The most refreshing thing about Scott Cooper's Black Mass, the new biopic of the rise and fall of South Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger is that for once we get an unromantic view of a psychopath. As much as I love fine films like Silence of the Lambs and Psycho, I must admit that both films ask us to find some measure of admiration with their subjects. That's not the case here. In Bulger, we are in the presence of a human animal, an otherwise reasonable man who sends men and woman to their deaths almost as a part of his daily routine. The real mystery, of course, is how he was able to operate as gangster and terrorist for so long without, at the very least, being sent up the river.<br/><br/>And yet, that's not really the film's trajectory, merely the template. Scott Cooper's film is tricky in that when it's all over we aren't asked to sympathize or admire Bulger, we are given a portrait of the wrecked lives that he has left in his wake. It's about a psychopathic gangster, yes, but it's much more about how his friends, his employees, the FBI, and his immediate family fell under his spell and paid the price. We feel for these people even though we understand that, simply by associating with a cunning gangster, they are the authors of their own broken destiny.<br/><br/>Bulger ruled the underworld of South Boston with his Winter Hill Gang for several decades after a nine year stretch at Alcatraz. Played in a brilliant performance by Johnny Depp, the movie isn't about his rise to power, but about how he bent and manipulated the powers that be in order to stay in power. He became the most infamous criminal in Boston's history and ran his operation throughout the 70s and 80 using his talent for manipulation and his willingness to murder anyone for the smallest of reasons.<br/><br/>In 1981 Bulger struck a deal with the FBI to be an informant, but by being an informant he quietly turned the bureau into his own private army and took down the Italian mob on the north side. It didn't hurt that his FBI contact was a childhood friend John Connolly (Joel Edgerton). The thrill of the relationship between Bulger and Connolly is that Bulger is smarter and quicker, while Connolly is a weak-willed and loyal to a fault. He was an otherwise good man who becomes corrupted by his association with Whitey, in spite of warnings from his wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson) and just about everyone else.<br/><br/>The general outlines of the film are painfully familiar. What makes it special is that director Scott Cooper refuses to glorify or glamorize this story or these people. He knows that Bulger is scum, and he never makes the mistake of romanticizing his acts of violence. Bulger responds to stupidity and acts of disloyalty with the barrel of a gun. A lot of people are shot dead in this movie. Bullets enter the body. There's blood. There's pain. There's death. There is nothing romantic here. The violence is sudden and frightening. Bulger is nothing short of a menace. In his track suits, his Foster Grey glasses (that make his face look like a skull) and his dead tooth that signals the rot from within, he comes off as a cold and vicious figure who buried so many bodies in one place that it became known as ""Bulger Hill."" He has a cold, dead stare and a way of turning and twisting words to turn innocent conversation into a threat. There are so many scenes in the movie when people are shot dead and the violence is sudden, bloody and shocking. Cooper doesn't use any camera tricks or slow-motion. We see the violence as it happens.<br/><br/>The movie's success rests on the shoulders of Johnny Depp. When it was announced that a major studio was making a bio-pic about ""Whitey"" Bulger with Depp in the lead I wasn't exactly jumping for joy. Depp has been at the helm of so many bad movies lately that I had forgotten what a talent he really is. Like Peter Sellers, Lon Chaney, Alec Guinness and Eddie Murphy, Depp joins the short list of actors who can disappear behind heavy make-up. With thinning white hair, a palled complexion, a dead stare and an accent as thick as Boston Clam Chowder, he portrays Bulger as a cold, heartless monster or the devil in disguise. Bulger can make anyone do anything. There's a scary scene late in the film when he questions an FBI man about his grilled stake. The man claims it is a family secret. Bulger insists. The man relents. Then Bulger questions why he would reveal a family secret so easily. The silence that follows is as thick as pea soup.<br/><br/>The film's only weak link is that it often seems too stuffed with characters. There are many players in this story and many of whom never seem to get more than one-dimension. That wouldn't be so unusual except that we get the feeling that their stories exist in some longer cut of the film. At 2 hours, the film does feel a little short, and the movie abruptly skips over what Bulger was doing during the 16 years that he was on the lam (he and his wife were raising pit bulls). But what you take away from this film is that great performance by Johnny Depp who disappears so fully into this character that I wouldn't be surprised if a second Oscar nomination didn't come his way next spring. Even when the movie isn't at its best, Depp is always at the top of his game. In a somewhat flawed but never-the-less entertaining gangster movie, he stands out and gives us a performance of pure evil that lingers in our minds."
