","I am 24 year old fairly macho male,but I love animated movies. Me and my wife went and saw this movie on date night and hands down best Christmas movie of all times. It was full of wonderment,amazement and magic.I teared up at least 4 different times during the movie. It made me feel like a kid again it made me believe. I found myself gasping and laughing at the same parts as the the 3 year old little girl sitting 3 seats away was and any movie that can do that is worth seeing. best holiday movie of all times.<br/><br/>I am the wife :) and I found the movie to be equally moving and evoked emotions about the holidays and that I hadn't felt since I was a child. This may seem like a simple children's movie, but it is so much more than that if you really allow yourself to feel the characters. :) I hope you and your family enjoy the movie as much as we did!"

","Here's a fresh look at old tradition: a tatted-up Russian St. Nick and an Australian kangaroo-looking Easter Bunny. Rise of the Guardians is based on an original children's book series by William Joyce, who produced the film along with Guillermo Del Toro. The books were inspired by the author's 6-year-old daughter when she asked him if Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny knew each other.<br/><br/>Admittedly I was skeptical going in, but the chemistry of personalities works wonderfully. It creates an original formula that goes against certain expectations. Perhaps one improvement in potential sequels would be to focus more centrally on Santa (or ""Nicholas St. North""), but Jack Frost's story is incredibly touching and I found it clever how it parallels the antagonist's motives. The film is slow to start but picks up at a fast pace with non-stop action. By the end, the entire movie theater was in applause.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians is a cute, adventurous, and heartwarming family film that focuses on hanging on to the best thing about childhood: belief."

","This movie is magical and utterly charming. In this film DreamWorks did it all exactly right. Every voice is precisely as it should be. Perfection! Chris Pine, Jude Law, Hugh Jackman, too many to list if you didn't know that was Alec Baldwin doing the Russian accent for Santa, you would never guess it. The characters, all of them, are endearing, totally engaging. Sad moments, glad moments, hilarious moments. I haven't laughed this much in an animated movie since.well, never, actually. As I said, this one is destined to become a classic. A wonderful family movie and best of all it doesn't just appeal to the children, adults will love it too. Every adult in the audience,while I was there, seemed as captivated as the kids. And how many movies do you go to these days where, at the end, people applaud? They did for this one. And rightly so. I know I came out of that theater wishing I could somehow have my own Little Baby Tooth...and the friend I was with wished even more that she could have one of the Feisty Elves. You'll totally understand what I mean after you see this delightful movie. Don't miss this one!"
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","10","60","76","4 December 2012"," An imaginative and epic adventure that exceeded my expectations
","Before the end of the thanksgiving weekend I had with my cousins, I went with my brother to see this particularly in 3D, hoping that it would exceed my expectations as the trailer had promised. Later, after seeing the movie, I couldn't believe that my expectations were raised by not only how interesting it look, but how beautiful it looked. So, are there any flaws? Well, let's just say that there is one for it does drag a bit on the middle, but there isn't anything else to fault this epic adventure with.<br/><br/>Some people may find the story of this movie predictable due to it's good vs evil concept, but for me, I don't think it was that bad. It had it's heart in the right place and has some nice messaging about using your courage and it did got me shedding some tears since it reminded me what it's like to be a child. The dialog is also witty and the script is refreshing and funny. What I also like about the story is how it focused on Jack Frost's origins and how he came to be. I would've like to see the origins on some of the other childhood icons like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy, but I think that Dreamworks Animation is saving those for the sequels if they ever make them. The music from Alexandre Desplat is beautiful, tear-jerking, and whimsical and it's orchestra is well done which makes it one of his best music in a feature length film.<br/><br/>There are some other redeeming aspects of the movie. First, there's the characters which are likable in every way. Jack Frost is a charming lead, Nicholas St. North (or Santa Claus) is a bada** character with his Russian accent and has a sleigh machine, the Sandman is silent, but that's what makes him more interesting and his comedic moments is funny, the Tooth Fairy (or Toothiana) is a beautiful female character and the way she explains her ways of getting all of the children's tooth is well thought out, and Bunnymund, the easter bunny, is a great fighter and by the far the most hilarious character that most people would adore. Pitch, however, steals the show and is a great villain thanks to Jude Law's menacing voice-work. In fact, the voice acting for the character is great especially Alec Baldwin who was a great surprise being here. The fight sequences and the chase scenes are not only amazing, but exhilarating, but the strongest aspect goes to the animation.<br/><br/>It's character animation is well inspired and creative, but what stands out the most about the animation is it's visuals. The places are amazing in scope including the North Pole, the Toothfairy's land, Pitch's evil lair, the Easter Bunny's home with the eggs being the highlight and more. Looks like Dreamworks Animation never fails to amuse me with their beautiful animation.<br/><br/>Overall, Rise of the Guardians is by no means a classic and with all of my heart, this deserves some recommendation to those who haven't seen it yet. Go watch it! It's that good just like Disney's Wreck-It Ralph."
"DICK STEEL","10","97","127","22 November 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Rise of the Guardians
","I thought I was probably in a period of time where it would be difficult to sit back and enjoy what is an animated film aimed squarely at kids, but I was indeed surprised by how Rise of the Guardians, based upon The Guardians of Childhood series created by William Joyce, actually encapsulated all the good stuff, from quality of animation, voice casting and to characterization that was pretty basic but good fun. There are many in the same class of late that tried to be too intellectual, but by keeping things simpler, and never forgetting the fun element, Rise of the Guardians stand out from the pack, and dare I say one of the most enjoyable animated movies of the year.<br/><br/>This is the story of a new Guardian, Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), who's about to join the ranks of other luminaries such as Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), The Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and very silent Mr Sandman, all of whom thrive in today's world being the beacon of hope, and everything good, to all the little children of the world. Chosen by The Man in the Moon, the Guardians and the children form a very symbiotic relationship, that the chosen few are there to safeguard the well being of the young, while the latter fuel the powers of the Guardians through sheer belief in their existence. Lose one, and you lose the other side quite quickly.<br/><br/>The narrative develops at breakneck pace, with introduction to the Guardians, their abilities, and the threat from arch enemy Pitch Black (Jude Law) being the boogeyman personified, thriving on fear and nightmares, and hell bent on snuffing out hope and joy amongst the children. There's a running theme of being alone, and forgotten, that pops up every now and then, being the common thread between antagonist, and the new kid on the block, who is confused as to who he is, and what his destiny lies ahead. It's somewhat of a zero to hero story, about finding one's purpose and calling in life, and the making of sacrifices to get there. Wholesome themes somewhat, for young ones to be able to sit through and enjoy.<br/><br/>We would already be very familiar with the many main characters such as Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny, but what Rise of the Guardians managed to do, is to introduce a little spin of fresh air into these characters, making them unique yet retaining many of their iconic traits that make them who they are. This is something I'd really liked, and had kept me engaged, eagerly waiting for yet another surprise to pop up now and then. Santa Claus complete with tattoos, swords and a thick Russian accent? The Tooth Fairy who is part hummingbird? The Easter Bunny as Australian and with something kept up the sleeve by the story tellers for the final act, and how about The Sandman who's a lot more powerful than he looks? And they offer a lot more in terms of abilities, cause and what they bring to the table, limited only by the powers of the filmmakers' imagination.<br/><br/>It's preaching fun, and never to lose sight of having a little fun in life, and the movie walked the talk by filling itself with plenty of side gags, contributed by the many supporting acts each established Guardian came with, such as Santa's tiny elves, and Tooth Fairy's lovelorn fairies who swoon at the presence of Jack Frost, for his perfect pearly whites of course. You'll never look at Santa's lodge and elves in the same way ever again, nor will you at the Tooth Fairy's and Easter Bunny's operations. These unique perspectives, seen and told through the eyes of the protagonist Jack Frost, makes it a journey that we're emotionally vested into from the start, right until the end, and to me they did not disappoint a bit.<br/><br/>While I hadn't watched this in 3D or IMAX versions, there are enough set action pieces that tried to exploit these formats, which I suppose either format would have enveloped the viewer and provided a more vivid experience, especially with characters being made to pursue and battle each other in the air, or the numerous extravaganza moments where the prowess of the characters will wow. The quality of animation is superb and is the score contributed by Alexandre Desplat, and again, the simple tale, its treatment and development, are refreshing in not biting off more than it can chew.<br/><br/>Director Peter Ramsey has now launched his career with a very solid delivery of a film for children, and balanced this appeal for the adults as well. I'm already all for a sequel should one be created, but as a standalone, this one is definitely for keeps. Highly recommended!"
"angiequidim","10","50","65","23 November 2012"," I would see this again in a second I'm already making plans to take friends to it
","Sean McQuillan www.thatsmye.com <br/><br/>Dreamworks animation has not quite had the success rate of Pixar, but if Rise of the Guardians is any example of where they're heading, they're on a good path. RotG is like a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen of children's fables that band together to protect the children of the world from fear itself. Led by Santa Claus, the Guardians include the Tooth Fairy, The Easter Bunny, and the Sandman. An old evil that thrives on the fear of children is returning, and the powers that be have chosen a new guardian to rise to the occasion, Jack Frost. Can Frost rise to legendary status of his peers? Will he be able to dispel fear and bring joy to the children? It's an amazing ride through fantastic worlds to find out.<br/><br/>The design of the characters really drew me into this one, when I first saw the trailer. Santa is an enormous, tattooed, urshanka wearing, sword wielding, commander of Yetis. Tooth Fairy is designed after a beautiful humming bird, as are her fairy minions. The villain has a sleek design with piercing eyes. I was not disappointed. This movie is beautiful. The set pieces are brilliant and epic, yet subtle. You can see the influence of Pan's Laberynth Director, Gillermo Del Torro, who was an executive producer here. The animation is great, and makes real good use of the 3D, which I fully admit I normally dislike.<br/><br/>The voice casting is superb, Chris Pine holds his own as Jack Frost, while Alec Balwin is almost unrecognizable as North (Santa). The biggest highlight for me is Jude Law as the villain. You can hear a snippet of him in the trailer. The children in the room have young voice actors, but are all greats.<br/><br/>The review might seem a little unbalanced, but I'm really struggling to come up with any big flaws. It is a great film for children and adults alike. Some people say it might be too scary for kids, but at its core the movie is about overcoming fear. It is an epic romp. It's not really a Christmas movie, as much as a winter movie. Go see it! Here's a trailer and character posters to hold you off until it's released."
"silverbillings","9","69","101","23 November 2012"," One of the Best Movies I've Seen in a While
","Rise of the Guardians is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while, besides seeing Wreck It Ralph last weekend (also a must see movie for a blast-to-the-past) I loved this movie, cried during most of Jack's story, I know the feeling of being alone and feeling like I'm invisible/under appreciated/ignored/looked down upon. I would defiantly recommend it to any age, it gives you a total blast to the past of being a kid by bringing together all of the childhood hopes and dreams you had before they were crushed. The animations was excellent, the storyline was so sweet, and I can not wait to hear if there is going to be a second movie or not."
"billygoat1071","8","25","34","3 December 2012"," Endless Wonders
","Rise of the Guardians has a lovely concept about these imaginary childhood legends. It tells a fascinating new mythology about them. It sets out to be highly imaginative and thoroughly heartfelt. With these people making this film, there is no surprise that they succeeded to execute those ambitions. Though, the storytelling is a bit messy with endless action set pieces. Despite of those flaws, it's still whimsically magical and heartwarming.<br/><br/>The story centers a childhood guardian, Jack Frost. Among the guardians, he's the least known and believed by the children. It's pretty interesting since most of us only know very little about him, we intend to intrigue about his story. When it goes to the famous legends, it gets bigger and quicker with plenty of humor. The film is also an action movie. The action scenes are amazingly done and eye candy, but they somehow get excessive causing a bit mess to the storyline. It's charming when they go to their relationship with the children, and it's appealing when it explores to their worlds.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderful enough. The voice performances are great. Chris Pine's performance is charming enough to keep Jack Frost pretty endearing. Alec Baldwin brings plenty of joy to his character. Hugh Jackman uses his Australian accent to the Easter Bunny which really fits to the character. The rest are expectedly delightful.<br/><br/>The visuals are undeniably astonishing. Every scene of the film is spectacular and beautiful to look at, making the experience very magical. The 3D enhances the experience more or less. The character designs are inspired. I bet many would love the Sandman's that looks so lovable. And the music score adds sweetness to the sequences.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians is a little bit disappointing but also a bit satisfying. It has the heart in a right amount but only the half of the film. The rest is all action and having fun, but it's not a bad thing. They just could have moderated the craziness and get a bit of focus to the storyline. The film is still worth watching. It can be a classic if it has a better storytelling but if you don't care then that won't be a problem. Overall, it's filled with excitement and beautiful animation. Rise of the Guardians can be considered one of the great films of the year."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","41","60","2 December 2012"," High expectations lived up to...
","As a big animation fanatic, I was very keen to see Rise of the Guardians as it did look like an very interesting film. I have to say that it was high expectations lived up to. The best animated movie of the year? Not sure, ParaNorman and Frankenweenie were a little better(can't wait for Wreck-It Ralph), but I do think it is in the better end of the movies of the overall year so far. Was there anything that could have been done better? Well, I did think the movie drags a little bit in the middle. However, there is very little to fault anywhere else. The animation was amazing, the characters were well-modelled and the colours and landscapes were really beautifully realised . Alexandre Desplat's music score has the right amount of sparkling adventure and whimsical fantasy. The writing is thoughtful and well-balanced, not coming across as too childish for adults or too confusingly sophisticated for kids. The visual puns were marvellous, Pitch's night-mares(very spooky) and Bunny's egg-plants were the highlights. The story was a winner too, some may find it predictable(the good vs. evil concept is not necessarily new territory) and dull, I didn't think so at all, some of the middle is not as securely paced as the rest but the chase action and battle were exhilarating, it was fun and it does have a refreshing holiday feel as well as a meaningful message. The characters have distinct personalities and have a definite charm to them, hard to decide who was my favourite. The voice acting was terrific, nobody was bad, Jude Law is suave and sinister and Hugh Jackman is very funny. But Alec Baldwin was a huge surprise, partly because he was totally unrecognisable. All in all, a great animated movie that completely lived up to my expectations. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Troy_Campbell","7","33","48","4 December 2012"," Delivers the goods - for kids and adults alike.
","The first major family flick of the holidays, this Avengers-for-children boasts the most epic line-up of characters you're likely to see this Summer: Santa (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Jack Frost (Chris Pine) and the dream-making Sandman going up against fear himself, Pitch Black (Jude Law). It's a neat concept to begin with, but Dreamworks amps up the fun by contorting our preconceptions of these icons – especially the Easter Bunny, here played as an ocker warrior – and delivering the goods in humour, emotion and action. It goes a moralistic touch too far on occasion, and the story is certainly predictable, but the overwhelming sense of giddy excitement running through the movie's veins outweighs any plot contrivances or missteps that occur. A sweet start to the festive season for kids of all ages – including those in adulthood."
"MartinHafer","7","7","8","25 December 2013"," Pretty good--and the star is definitely the animation.
","Before I discuss what I thought of this film, my oldest daughter insists I talk about the film as seen in theaters. She LOVED the animation and when we watched it on Cinemax HD on our large HDTV, it apparently lost a lot according to her. A lot of the wonderful details were lost and the beauty of the film was lost--at least to some extent. Just thought I'd mention this.<br/><br/>As for the film, the plot is quite strange. Among the many fictional characters (though they are real in this film), the Boogeyman is intent on filling the world with awful dreams and driving out all sense of hope or joy. To counter this, Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman all seek out a new guardian--a strange character that will help them fight Mr. Boogey. This character is the hipster-like Jack Frost. Together they do battle to save the children of the world and keep faith in them alive.<br/><br/>Overall, while a gorgeous film, the plot is a bit limp and is more of an excuse to show off the lovely CGI. Not a great movie but worth seeing. I especially liked Alec Baldwin as the Russian version of Santa--what an interesting accent and characterization."
"calgal84","9","9","11","11 October 2014"," This is so much better than Frozen
","I just watched this film by accident. Was just switching channels and happened on the beginning of the movie. I could not stop watching and I'm no child. It's a wonderful animated film. The voice casting is perfect. It is visually stunning. It's story line is interesting enough for adults and enchanting enough for children, with just enough ""scare"" factor in Pitch to intrigue older children but not so scary that smaller children will have one of Pitch's nightmares! It's just lovely and sweet. I even had a few teary movies. It was just so so much better than Frozen, although maybe they should do a movie with Jack Frost and Elsa! This movie was close to perfect as a animated film can get."
"Rectangular_businessman","9","9","11","31 March 2013"," Surprisingly good
","When I saw the first previews of ""Rise of the Guardians"", I thought that it was going to be dumb movie, something like an animated equivalent of films like ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" or ""The Brothers Grimm""...To my surprise, this movie turned out to be much better than I was expecting: The story was fast-paced and entertaining to watch, the characters were likable and interesting and the whole movie had a quite good balance of comedy and seriousness.<br/><br/>The animation was good too. I liked a lot the characters designs, which (in my opinion) were much better than anything that Dreamworks have done before (Specially compared with the ugly designs of ""Bee Movie"" and ""Megamind"") <br/><br/>The main characters had a very appealing appearance which combined a certain level of ""cutesy"" with the ""edgy"" portrayal that they receive in this film. The result was more than satisfying.<br/><br/>Is sad to see how incredibly underrated this movie is, considering the many virtues that it has. Personally, I consider this to be a much better film than stuff like ""Shrek"" or ""How to Train your Dragon"".<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"enrique524","10","22","33","16 November 2012"," Dreamworks Animation expands your imagination, and captures your mind with this clever film for all ages
","Dreamworks Animation has made many great films and some bad ones, some have become popular franchises (Madagascar,Shrek). With their new film Rise of the Guardians based on a book series by William Joyce. This film introduces us to many characters we would believe in at a young age Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, The Easter Bunny and Sandman. The film centers on these characters giving every character their deserved screen time. The films center is based around the character of Jack Frost who for 300 years has been wanting to be seen and believed in. After being chosen as a Guardian by the man in the moon, at first he's reluctant about it but as the film progresses he begins to see his destiny more and more as he joins the existing Guardians to fight a new evil named Pitch(The Boogeyman)who wants to strike fear into the children of the world that way the children stop believing and the Guardians will be nothing. I saw this film cause i got passes to see it. At first i wasn't too sure but it was free. As i walked out, i didn't regret my decision and appreciated what Dreamworks had done. With the right humor needed for a film with some dark elements the film was overall GREAT. Whoever thinks of seeing it , SHOULD they won't regret it as it can help adults remember how in their childhood at one point they believed in these characters. Another thing i should i that when i went to the advanced screening of this film i got to see it in 3D, glad that i did, it makes the film feel more alive and reali hope to go see it again but this time i'd like to see how it feels to experience it in IMAX 3D. But yes 3D is a good choice for this film. Dreamworks hasn't failed me with their use of 3D. Madagascar 3,Monsters vs. Aliens, Kung Fu Panda 2 and Megamind are someof those film. In other words go see this and remember whe you used to believe."
"PippinLink","7","8","10","13 July 2014"," Rise of the Guardians - Because why not have a Russian Santa, Australian Easter Bunny, Hyper Tooth Fairy, Silent Sandman and a Depressed Jack Frost?
","Rise of the Guardians, by DreamWorks Animation SKG, is a fun and exhilarating film, set in the world of children's beliefs.<br/><br/>Jack Frost is the fun and ""icy"" protagonist in this film, who has always sought out the answers as to why he is like he is - A guy that no one can see, except the Guardians, North, Sandman, Tooth, Bunny, and the bogeyman, Pitch. He soon finds out that the Man in the Moon has chosen Jack to be a new guardian to protect the children of the world, but refuses, but soon learns that sometimes friendship and a little responsibility goes a long way.<br/><br/>This is a great film, for starters, and I especially love the opening part, where Jack is sitting in the moon. This film has great special effects that wowed me when I first saw this film. Everything from the ice, to the fur on Bunny. This film is definitely pretty. But, the film has great voice talents, suiting the characters very well, and they suite the personality of each character well too. Viewers can tell that a lot of hard work had gone into the film, as everything, even the relationships between the characters, has been well established.<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat is the music composer for this film, and has designed the music very well to fit the moods and areas of each part of the film. But, despite what a good job he did, I believe that John Powell may have done a better job, but, I understand that he was most probably working on the musical score for How To Train Your Dragon 2 at the time this movie was being developed/created.<br/><br/>This film is perfect for kids in the stages of believing in Santa, Tooth Fairy etc. as it is bubbly fun with these well known childhood figures.<br/><br/>Though this is an enjoyable film, it is aimed more towards younger audiences, and is more bubbly and fun than serious, and does not show as much of a lesson about friendship etc. as some of DreamWorks' other films, such as How To Train Your Dragon. I also believe they should have developed more on Pitch's character, especially around the time between when the guardians came, and the main part of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film 7/10 Stars, as I believe it is enjoyable, but could maybe have more of a moral to show for, and maybe suite all audiences better, rather than young ones."

"ivern-326-711636","8","7","9","30 November 2012"," Avengers for Kids!
","Rise of the Guardians is about how the myths and legends that we've heard of when we were kids all live in a parallel dimension that bring joy, dreams and protection for the children of the world. And if those children believe in these so-called guardians, these legends can interact with that world and they will get stronger. So one day, the Boogeyman, finds a way to manipulate the guardians and make them lose their powers and the children's' belief in them. That's as far as I'll care to go I guess.<br/><br/>I've been really looking forward to this movie ever since last year. First it was called ""The Guardians of Childhood"". Then it was called just ""The Guardians"". And then it was eventually named ""Rise of the Guardians"". Anyway, the reason I was looking forward to this movie was because I liked the idea of taking these light-hearted characters we all knew and loved, and putting them in a more gritty and serious movie. Also, after watching the trailer, I started looking forward to the animation, especially. Ever since How to Train Your Dragon, DreamWorks have started to reach the level of Pixar in animation, so I was really looking forward to them making an action fantasy movie.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, most of the time. The movie starts out really great, but then the story starts going a bit downhill. But while the story gets worse and worse as the movie progresses, the animation and the world we're introduced to keep on impressing. It's really clever how they explain why the ones that don't believe in these guardians, don't see them, and so on.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed at how the action scenes weren't as long as I'd hoped for, and there was barely any scenes where all the guardians worked together in a battle. Also, the final battle was pretty pathetic. It's near the end of the movie where the movie has become so light-hearted that it doesn't do any of those awesome action scenes with spectacular effects and great character movement, and instead pulls of a typical kids movie slapstick battle with lots of kids humor and stuff. That was really disappointing.<br/><br/>But don't get the wrong idea, this movie was very good. The animation, the characters and the landscapes were all animated beautifully.<br/><br/>The movie also had a lot of heart to it. At some points, it felt a bit too light-hearted, and I sometimes wished it would go back to the dark and more serious tone that was found in the first act.<br/><br/>The characters were very interesting, and the main character was well-developed. But some of the characters were a bit underdeveloped, and the kids could sometimes get on my nerves. Both in the movie, and the theater.<br/><br/>The 3D was great. I'm not a big fan of 3D. I usually go out of a 3D movie saying ""I'll never see a 3D movie again, most likely"". Do you remember that The Avengers was in 3D? No, I don't either, but my ticket says so. But I'll most likely remember this movie's 3D, and this is also the best 3D movie of the year ... at least so far. Go see it."

Jack Frost was my first crush and I was only 12 back then, I watched it again today after many years, and I gotta say I don't blame myself. :))
Only I have lost so much believes. this movie reminds of a time I was so full of hope and thought he cold be real.
how many times I sat in the yard listening to the silence of a snowy night and looked at the snow flakes falling down when all the city was asleep..
it was so magical and I can only remember that time by watching this now.
specially that we had no snow in my country this year :(
Animations today aren't so rememberable anymore and mostly doesn't have any meaning that sticks with you as you grow up.
I'm pretty up-to-date about animations and movies and unfortunately the last animation that stayed with me like this was Turbo.
I think it's because people control kids way too much and so animations gotta be so perfectly appropriate.Just as the movies goes the opposite way.
This limits the magic these shows need.Always trying to make a good, appropriate point so kids learn that something is good and something isn't..:/ don't we have enough of those already?!"

","Rise of the Guardians is capable of giving both adults and their kids a wonderful time at the theatre. I am from a culture that does not ascribe to all the characters from this exceptionally beguiling animation nevertheless even I fell for its charm. That goes to say that people from all cultures, irrespective of their age group could walk into the theatre and be amazed at the awakening of their inner child. Jack Frost was my personal favourite in the cartoon and his story is one that could touch your heart. Many might even be able to identify with him and the trouble that plagues him which is resolved at the end of the story- 'to be invisible'to others. The liberty the creators of this animation took with the 'Guardians' especially the way Jack Frost was depicted,was a delight to me because I had always imagined him to be a a old man with a blue sheen to his skin and a wicked glint in his eyes. Jack Frost in the Rise of the Guardians on the other hand- well go catch it at the theatre and you will know what I am talking about. All in all, it is a heart- warming story with non-stop action, certain scenes to get you to crack up and a message that is very much familiar to most of us but still one worth being reminded of- have faith and belief!!!"

","I seen this in the cinemas 3 years ago with my cousin and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I happened to be watching it last night on TV as it was on so on to the review.<br/><br/>Rise Of The Guardians is a Dreamworks Animation movie that tells the tale of Jack Frost(voiced by Into The Woods star Chris Pine)who isn't believed in with the kids as they don't know him as much as the other guardians. One day however and he happens to be chosen by the guardians and he teams up with Santa Clause(voiced by Alec Baldwin with a Russian Accent who is from 30 Rock),Tooth Fairy(voiced by The Great Gatsby's Isla Fisher),the Sandman who doesn't talk,and an Aussie Easter Bunny(voiced by X-Men star and Aussie Actor Hugh Jackman). Together they try and defeat the evil bogeyman named Pitch Black(voiced by The Holiday's Jude Law) who like Jack isn't believed in either and wants the rest of the guardians to suffer just like him. So can the guardians make the kids believe in them and stop Pitch Black from ruining the children's dreams and imaginations forever?<br/><br/>Bottom line I enjoyed it the first time I watched it and again last night after 3 years watching it last. The story was very well done,the voice acting is great(it was nice to hear Hugh Jackman use his own accent and not to be putting on another accent as he doesn't use his own accent that much in his films)but the real surprise was Alec Baldwin as Santa Clause with a Russian accent. He really nailed it as his charcther in the movie. Chris Pine sounded very old for Jack Frost but he did a good job since this was his first animated debut.<br/><br/>If you love animation like me and want a feel-good movie to watch then check it out. Roll on ROTG II."

","This movie deserves every possible star. I don't even know where to begin on how amazing it is. I have been watching it a lot recently since work wants me to be Jack from this film. Going to schools and entertaining and reading to kids dressed as Jack frost? Pretty cool. Well any way. This is a movie that needed to be made. There was no severe violence, no cursing, no blood...except for Tooth fairy trying to play with Sophie. This is the kind of kids movie that needed to be made. More movies like this need to be made. The animation was a marvel. The writing was fun. Humor was placed at the right times. The characters where unique but you knew who they where and you where going to remember them."

","Rise of the Guardians is a delightful film for the whole family, telling the story of how Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman protect children and they thrive on children's beliefs. But when an old threat awakens the group needs to find a new guardian to help them, Jack Frost (Chris Pine).<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians is a wonderfully animated film from first time director Peter Ramsey perfectly mixes the comedy, drama and action. The animation is fast and fluid they is great detail all of the scenes. They are great little designs such as the Christmas Elves and the Tooth Fairies.<br/><br/>The comedy is strong, being very physical and visual whiles also have some little jokes and character moments. It is a film that provides plenty moments that will bring a smile to people's faces. It is all weighted with the drama and the darkness of the villain, Pitch (Jude Law). Screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire clearly follows the Hero With Thousand Faces template as a reluctant hero having a destiny thrust upon him and has to prove himself as well find out about his past whiles Pitch reflect of what Jack Frost could become.<br/><br/>The film assembles a great voice cast with Pine being perfectly cast as the cocky, fearless Jack Frost whiles playing the character. Combined with the visuals it is easy to feel for Jack's plight as he longs to be seen by the world. Law gave a sinister performance as the voice, also playing it straight and Alec Baldwin was having fun being a Russian accented Santa.<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat supplies another excellent music, giving the film both an epic score for scale of the action and giving the seasonal sound when needed.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians will certainly make Christmas viewing, working as a fantasy drama and a comedy and it is easy for the young and the young at heart can enjoy.<br/><br/>I saw the 3D Blu-ray version and the 3D effort were very score."
"cherold","8","6","8","12 June 2013"," Stunning animation, entertaining situations
","The first thing I have to say is that the animation is stunning. When watching movies on TV, I often let my eyes wander, checking facebook for a minute, getting up to do some exercises while I watch, but I didn't do that for Rise of the Guardian, because every second of film was worth watching. Imagery is very densely packed and things happen very quickly.<br/><br/>I also found the movie quite funny in that same quick, overstuffed way. <br/><br/>And yet, there is something about the movie's story that kind of bothers me. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but then I read a review of it that described it as seeming like it was written by committee, and I thought, yeah, that could be it. There is something calculated and safe about the story that made me unable to entirely connect with it. But it was still a fantastic experience."

","Very good movie! Actually want to read the books now! The animation is wonderful and I think Sandman was a total bad mamma jamma! Tooth fairy looked a little odd but pretty cool. Looooooooooved Russian Santa! Doesn't sound like Alec Baldwin at all! Have never heard Hugh Jackman actually do his Australian either!!! That was neat! Each of the different places they lived were pretty awesome too! Tooth Palace, Bunny Warren, and Santa's Lodge were all very well done.<br/><br/>Only question: Is there a reason Jack isn't dead? All the Gaurdians start disappearing/disintegrating/reverting when the kids stop believing. So why does Jack still exist? Maybe I just missed it. :-/"

","When I first saw the preview at the movies, all I saw were the big four, so I said, ""Looks terrible, I'm not going to see it."" But then I saw the 2nd one and realized there was to it than there seemed. The movie follows the view of Jack Frost, the spirit of winter who wakes with no memory and finds no one can see him. For the next three hundred years he is alone.... until Pitch comes back to destroy the Guardians and therefore is chosen by the Man in Moon to join them. From there, an instant rivalry takes place between him and bunny, so when the latter insults Jack and his current status, North takes him to his room and tells him to find his center. Not long afterward, they find that Pitch stole everything Tooth had and try to stop the former. There he finds out he had a past life he had been unaware about and begins to yearn for more information. Later when he takes home Sophie Bennet after preparing for Easter, he hears a familiar voice and decides to follow it to Pitch's Lair. He there finds his memories but is mocked by Pitch. In an attempt to attack him, Jack is led out of the lair to find that Easter had been ruined. When he finds the guardians, bunny was no longer seen by children and they would not let him explain what happened but broke their trust. Horrified, He turned and left, as belief growing short. When he arrived in Antarctica, he is confronted by Pitch to join him. When Jack refuses, he sends him into isolation in the cliffs. There Jack looks through his memories and finds why he is chosen to be a guardian, for saving his sister's life before he died. After he left, he found that there was only one believer left, a boy he knew named Jamie Bennet. Jack flies to him finds Jamie at a crossroads of belief. As it begins to fade, Jack tries to convince the Guardians were real, and ended up gaining the first person to see him. Later, the guardians band together to stop Pitch with Jamie and his friends. In the process, the children bring back Sandy who had supposedly 'died' earlier in the movie. Together they stop Pitch and Jack Frost becomes the Guardian of Fun. I liked this movie because it not only applied to kids, but adults as well. Often in the movie, people can relate to Jack's feelings of loneliness and his mischievous personality. The characters are seen in a modern way that is the first to be expressed. It has truly become a delight and enjoyable movie for everyone."

","I very much enjoyed watching Rise Of The Guardians. It's a wonderful computer-animated film. It does play like The Avengers (2012) for the kids, but its intelligent story and humor make it a fun time for the whole family. The animation here is gorgeous, surpassing most efforts by Pixar and Disney. And the influence of Japanese animation greats like Spirited Away (2001) is more obvious. The film has an interesting fresh take on each of the five Guardians, who are beautifully designed. When they do battle they have a variety of skills to thrill with. The antagonist, Pitch the Boogeyman, is a complex character just like the Guardians who, it turns out, has some similarities with the protagonist Jack Frost, the Guardian of Fun. The excellent voice cast features Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Hugh Jackman, Isla Fisher and Jude Law. Rise Of The Guardians is an entertaining fantasy-adventure by director Peter Ramsey, but it's still a well-meaning film from which children can learn a good deal. The icing on the cake is that it makes excellent use of 3D. I highly recommend watching it, and I won't be surprised if it becomes a holiday classic."

","What can I say about this movie that explains how amazing it is? I don't think words can even describe how amazing this movie is. I am a 15 year old boy and love animated movies. I can't get enough of them. I love what Dreamworks has done in the last 4 years. They have stepped up and brought us Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and now Rise of the Guardians. I think they really captured each character perfectly. Jack Frost, Santa (North), Easter Bunny, Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy. This movie made me believe in these characters and made me feel like a kid again. It was dark a certain parts, but that is what is different about Dreamworks movies. They always have a sense of darkness in their new movies, that I really love. I don't really call them kids movies, I call them just animated movies. Labeling them as kids movies to me would be wrong. The story in Rise of the Guardians was fantastic and sad at times. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say be prepared to be surprised and shocked. This movie was visually stunning in 3D. If you are going to go see it, see it in 3D if you can. You will not be disappointed. The voice acting is brilliant and each actor and actress fits the role perfect. Many people thought Chris Pine's voice would not fit Jack Frost, but I think it fit perfectly. All the actors brought the characters alive and gave them a since of realize that make you believe they are even more real. Why do I give it a 10 out of 10, well because it deserves the best rating for making me believe and feel like a kid again. Not any other movie has ever done that before. Go see it for sure, even if you don't have kids to bring with you."

","I know that Rise of the Guardians has been the talk of the movie world because of it's net losses and how it is one of DreamWorks Animation's lowest-grossing films. But this happens to be a fun, briskly-paced animated film that is kind of like the Avengers, but for children. I know kids will like this because this unites all their childhood heroes. As for adults, this is entertaining enough because of the zany brightness and visuals, the action-packed story, and the short running time.<br/><br/>Peter Ramsey directed a film that brings together Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, Sandman, and Jack Frost as they join forces as Guardians to protect the innocence and dreams of children that the evil Pitch, known as Boogeyman is trying to take away.<br/><br/>This film has a solid voice-cast which adds personality to each character. Chris Pine makes a solid, adventurous Jack Frost. Jude Law is really good as the villainous Pitch. Isla Fisher makes for a good Tooth Fairy and Alec Baldwin surprisingly, is a solid Santa.<br/><br/>Overall, Rise of the Guardians is a rather fun, action-packed adventure for kids and adults alike. It's not the greatest in the story department, but this still adds up for a fun time. It has great themes regarding in being believed in and hope and that is always good to teach the kids. I rate this film 9/10."
"Mike-DD","10","3","4","26 March 2014"," A movie that appeals to both kids and adults
","This is one of those rare animated (so-called) children's movies that will appeal to both kids and adults. At least *I* was totally captivated by it. You won't feel out of place watching this with your friends without kids in tow, though there'll probably be many around.<br/><br/>The Boogeyman has come to threaten the whole world's children's belief in the ""Big 4"" figures called Guardians here - Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman, and it's up to a new reluctant and disillusioned guy, Jack Frost, to save them all. I loved how Santa's portrayed as Russian-like, the Easter Bunny is a militant were-rabbit- like giant with an Australian accent and the Sandman is a cute golden pudgy fellow who's apparently the most powerful of the 4. The characterisations of the tooth fairy and Jack Frost seemed appropriate to me.<br/><br/>The story reminded me of Neil Gaiman's ""American Gods"" - the Guardians derive their power and, to a large extent, their being, from the believing children. I think of it as a metaphor too - the world is a darker place without hope. And the adults and mature kids will find deeper meaning in some of the dialogue - Santa/Christmas being about wonder, Easter being about new life, etc.<br/><br/>The humor employed was appropriate and well-done. Sure, there's the occasional physical humor, but there're also the funnily-biting insults and quick comebacks. I thought the animation was top-notch - not in terms of realism or its technical aspects, but in generating the appropriate atmosphere and mood of each scene.<br/><br/>And yes, there are the touching moments. ""Jack, he sees you!"" is one that almost brought tears to my eyes. I'm not a sappy person, but anyone who's experienced loneliness and ostracism before will understand the feeling.<br/><br/>I really loved this film. It is one of the few films which managed to bring me back to my childhood, remembering the innocent years when I believed in fairies and Santa Claus, and now reminding me to keep wondering (as in awe, not puzzlement), believing, and hoping."

"contact-huntj","8","3","4","25 February 2014"," Dreamworks are off the 'Naughty' list.
","Sadly overlooked during the Christmas period of 2012, 'Rise Of The Guardians' is a sorely underrated of example of Dreamworks operating outside their comfort zone of toilet humour and pop culture references. <br/><br/>Jack Frost is seemingly brought to life beneath a sheet of ice in the black of night, with no purpose or sense of direction, and invisible to the inhabitants of the world he finds himself wandering. After many years of wreaking playful havoc on Earth with his ability to manipulate snow and ice, Jack is summoned to join the ranks of the 'Guardians', an elite group of child minders including the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny, and even Santa Clause. Much to everyone's surprise, it is presumed that Frost is to play a vital role in defending the children of the world from the growing threat of the Boogeyman, a malevolent entity who aims to infest civilisation with nothing but nightmares.<br/><br/>'Rise of the Guardians' is not a festive film, but its use of the Santa Claus legend and the focus on wintry weather leave it gravitating towards a holiday atmosphere. Visually splendid in a creative sense, not just in the quality of the animation, the film is one that Dreamworks can proudly place by the side of their most important works. Its themes of hope and dreams are universal, regardless of the time of year, and this achievement is especially more profound when you appreciate how the writers wove in the messages of the Easter and Christmas holidays without preaching the corresponding religious values. It isn't very often Dreamworks give characters a genuine arc to explore, but Jack's is not only such a journey, but also a very touching, humble one.<br/><br/>Despite the fairly short running time, their is a minor lack of development for some characters, whose importance is therefore realised too late. Simply, however, the film is a pure delight, and 'Rise Of The Guardians' certainly deserves to be lauded. It isn't groundbreaking in any sense, but it is proof that Dreamworks might have finally found their centre."

"Stompgal_87","9","4","6","27 April 2014"," The best Dreamworks film since the Shrek franchise, albeit its confusing title
","When I first heard of this film, I got it confused with 'Legend of the Guardians,' a live-action fantasy film about owls. Due to my passion for animation, this appealed to me more when I saw this trailer, which had the most impressive character designs since those from the 'Shrek' franchise, particularly those of the guardians themselves.<br/><br/>The animation quality is on par with that from the 'Shrek' franchise with intricate character designs, pretty special effects and atmospheric backgrounds if some were a little too dark. The musical score is powerful, epic, poignant and magical while the closing credits song is absolutely beautiful. As for the story and dialogue, they both have a fine mix of excitement, sadness and humour while the story is adventurous and uses representations of Jack Frost, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny in an entirely new and unique way. The funniest characters for me are the elves (they reminded me of the minions in the 'Despicable Me' franchise if they were not quite as humorous), the Easter Bunny and the furry creatures with moustaches. With regard to the main characters, Jack Frost is ambitious, Tooth is bubbly, Sandy is an effective communicator by expressing himself through facial expressions, body language and various sand symbols floating above his head and surprisingly comes back to life towards the end of the film, North is supportive, the Easter Bunny (I love his accent) is cynical yet comical and Pitch, while reminiscent of Voldemort from the Harry Potter series and Maltazard from 'Arthur and the Invisibles,' is threatening yet suave. The child characters are sweet and full of fun, especially Jamie Bennett and his little sister Sophie. Moving on to the voice acting, Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin (despite his Russian accent making his voice as unrecognisable as Steve Carrel's voice for Gru in the 'Despicable Me' films), Isla Fisher and Hugh Jackman all provided a brilliant variety of voices to their characters while Jude Law provided Pitch with a chilling combination of intimidation and menace.<br/><br/>To conclude, 'Rise of the Guardians' is a stunning fantastical adventure that is better than 'Shrek the Third' and 'Shrek Forever After' and nearly as good as the first two 'Shrek' films. 9/10."

Better yet, it's appealing to people of all ages. Not just children.<br/><br/>Just because it's a children's movie does not mean it's just for children. I loved this movie and pray it does the best it can. <br/><br/>This movie took things we believed as children and made them alive, gave them personality, characterization and a voice. If that doesn't make you at least like it a little bit, then i'm honestly a little sad.<br/><br/>But, just give it another chance. I know every child I have talked to loved it.

","Now this isn't a great CGI animated movie but it's a entertaining one that the whole family can enjoy. Except maybe the people that gets really offended by others believing in myth and holiday character. What this is, is basically a superhero movie for kids with myth and holiday characters. Such as Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman and the new recruit Jack Frost. I won't get too detailed with the plot but it seemed like the makers put quite a bit of thought into it. Although there is a bit of plot-holes than and there. So Jack Frost is the new recruit that is all about fun and games and he is asked to join the Guardians a group of myth and holiday characters that watch over and protect the children. So it's basically about a guy that thinks he can't do anything put up against a big task. Basically to stop the Boogieman from harming the children. This similar premise has been done before a lot and it goes in a pretty predictable direction. But it does try to bring out some emotions and it works alright. But the thing is this movie just doesn't leave an impact or has that flare to really make it stand out. The 3D was sorta fun and it is used quite a bit in this but I personally wasn't super immersed into the movie. The action sequences is cool and it did seem like it had the right formula but it just seemed to have missed some special ingredients. It just about had all the elements to be a great movie but it missed out by some margin. It felt like watching a cool Saturday morning cartoon except with amazing animation.

","The Guardians here are not the owls of Ga'hoole, nor Green Lantern's Oans, but rather fairy-tale creatures from Earthly legend — Santa Claus (here called North and Russian from the sound of him), Bunny (guess which holiday, and sporting an Australian accent and golden boomerangs), Tooth (leader of, and only adult in, a veritable air corps of fairies), and Sandy (the Sandman, where they saved on casting costs by giving him no dialog) — and the thing they're supposed to guard is, I guess, the innocent sense of wonder of the world's children. Standing in opposition to this is the boogeyman Pitch Black. Since my attention wandered often during the movie, I imagined a method actor approaching the director (Peter Ramsey, in case you care) and asking ""What's my motivation here?"", because ole Pitch is out to replace all children's dreams with nightmares for no obvious reason other than that's his thing.<br/><br/>Invited into this mix by the Man in the Moon (who seems to pull a lot of strings without ever saying a word) is Jack Frost, a young guy who walks around barefoot on frozen lakes and has been doing so for 3 centuries without any idea of who he used to be or why he got stuck with the job of frostifying stuff. He's kind of lonely, since humans can't see him and occasionally walk right thru him, but the MitM has him tabbed as the next Guardian, so the current lot can see him just fine. Tooth (voiced by Isla Fisher, who even SOUNDS adorable) even takes kind of a shine to him. Only they don't know if he's got what it takes to stand up to Pitch.<br/><br/>Standing in as representatives of all humanity's children is a small group of playmates from some anonymous small town in the US, led by Jamie, the most credulous kid on Earth, who still believes in all the Guardians even after everyone else has given up on them as a result of Pitch's machinations. His delightful little sister Sophie made me smile every time she came on screen.<br/><br/>There are several manufactured crises, the temporary triumph of the bad guy (ho-hum), a moment or 2 of self-revelation, and the Tinker Bell clap at the end that saves the day for sweetness and innocence. Santa's helpers (the elves literally IN their pointed hats and the big, gruff yeti) were kind of charming visual comic relief, and North and Bun were refreshingly grumpy and irritable, so credit to the screenwriters for not surrendering to convention. But the movie was both literally and figuratively dark and didn't offer much in the line of holiday merriment. Are these really the kind of folx you'd have wanted to hang out with when you were a kid? Nope. They're not such good company for adults, either."
"TheSquiss","5","14","33","31 December 2012"," Charming, fun, predictable, forgettable.
","When Pitch aka The boogeyman attacks Earth in a bid to be remembered  and feared by the world's children, the Immortal Guardians (North/Santa  Claus, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny) stand together to fight  his onslaught but even united they are too weak and so the man in the  moon adds another guardian to their list: Jack Frost.  Rise of the Guardians opens with a wink to The Bourne Identity with  Jack Frost (Chris Pine) floating in water before springing to life and  extricating himself from the frozen lake and spending the next three  hundred years wreaking havoc with his talents and generally kicking  about the world like a mildly rebellious, bored teenager until called  upon by the big boss.  It's a fun introduction during which we see some beautiful effects as  he frosts windows, freezes trees and causes snowball fights and other  snow fun. Then Rise of the Guardians becomes cluttered and looses some  of its magic. It's an obvious plot where good must triumph over evil  and the reluctant hero must work out what is at his centre (my seven  year old niece, Teah, worked that out the moment it was mentioned in  the film and a good hour before Jack Frost managed to, which says a  great deal about the laziness of the scripting) in order to release the  full power he holds.  There are some charming moments but largely they are due to the  animation rather than the action. In a lovely touch, Sandman is mute  and communicates with sandy icons that appear above his head and though  physically he is a bland, child-friendly interpretation, the animation  of his sandy strings that crisscross around the world carrying dreams  to children are beautifully crafted. Likewise, Tooth (Isla Fisher)  brings colour and warm beauty to the screen that contrasts fabulously  with the nightmarish images that swirl around Pitch.  But, important though the animation is, it doesn't count for much if  the story isn't there. It is all fairly predictable with a resolution  that cheats (without wishing to spoil the plot, a significant  character's situation is reversed without explanation) and is lazy (the  children are the key) and renders much of what went before as  pointless.  There were fears that Avengers Assemble would throw too many characters  together with insufficient time or material for many of them to have an  impact. Somehow Avengers Assemble managed to juggle them pretty  smoothly but I'm not sure Rise of the Guardians fares as well. Each  character has his/her own plot thread and moment in the limelight but  do they really bring anything significant to the film?  There is some fine vocal work from Alec Baldwin (North) and Jude Law  has fun with his Rufus Sewell impression as Pitch but Hugh Jackman  brings nothing substantial to the party as Bunny and at what point did  it become okay to swear in a film watched by very young children? Yes,  it may be only a couple of barks of 'bloody' but in a children's  animated film? Really? It's not offensive or shocking but it is  unnecessary.  More problematic for the audience was that Rise of the Guardians just  isn't terribly good. I'll give the final word to Teah, though I'm  overruling her.   ""I'll give it seven. I liked it but it wasn't the best."""

","DreamWorks new animated adventure ""Rise of the Guardians"" comes packaged as a rip-snorting adventure yarn about beloved childhood icons like Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny and Jack Frost who act as a kind of superhero action team defending kids who, in these dark times, are finding less and less to believe in – most especially because it would put the icons out of work. Putting away childhood things is a natural process of growing up, but The Guardians are determined to make sure that their P.R. never dies.<br/><br/>That also means that what started out as a genial and lovingly drawn book by William Joyce has been infused with all manner of 21st century technology and simple-minded storytelling (i.e. chases and fights). On the basis of premise, it works. On the basis of story, it resembles the same idea you've seen in dozens of other kids movies.<br/><br/>The story centers on Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine) who wakes up in a frozen lake with no memories and is suddenly thrust into the bosom of a superhero action squad that monitors children's beliefs. We see Santa Claus (voice of Alec Baldwin), The Easter Bunny (voice of Hugh Jackman) and The Tooth Fairy (voice of Isla Fisher). Also around is The Sandman, a genial rotund cute little fella who only speaks through emblems that he makes out of sand. None of these childhood icons are mentioned by proper names, they are called North, Bunny, Tooth and Sandy. They are an interesting lot, just imagine if Hallmark rewrote ""The Avengers"" and you get the idea.<br/><br/>The story begins with Jack waking up in that cold lake and taking up the mantle of ice and snow. He is given his assignment by The Man in the Moon (yes . . . The Man in the Moon) who places him into the Guardians to help them out. Jack doesn't remember anything of his past, but learns of his new powers. He can whip around ice and snow and make some very creative snow days. His problem: kids these days don't even know who Jack Frost is. In fact, most of us never really give old Jack a second thought except for a brief mention in that old Christmas song, do we? The drama is provided by a villain, a nightmarish boogie man named Pitch (voiced by Jude Law), who enters children's dreams and gives them nightmares. His mission is to get rid of the Guardians so kids will stop believing. Pitch is an interesting character. He is seen as all black with an oddly shaped head that reminds us a little of the creature from ""Pan's Labyrinth"", only without the goat legs.<br/><br/>The best things about the movie are the redesigns of characters that we have grown up with. Santa has the physique of a professional wrestler and speaks with a Russian accent. The Easter Bunny has a chiseled chest and sports an Australian accent (one nice touch is that he is mistaken for a kangaroo). The tooth fairy is designed more like a bird and, in fact, has a host of bird-like little friends who help her out. But the most interesting is The Sandman, who can whip up almost anything made out of sand. He's the best character in the movie, but sadly stays off-screen most of the time. He is so interesting, he deserves his own movie.<br/><br/>The plot is heavily about the idea of believing. We are told to believe in Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, The Sandman and Jack Frost. Yet there's an underlying issue that goes unresolved. Two of the heroes – Santa and The Easter Bunny – are attached to holidays with religious themes, specifically the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus. The Bunny comes close to explaining the meaning of his holiday by reminding Jack that ""Easter is about new beginnings"", but he stops short of getting deeper than that. It seems rather cheap to ask kids to hold on to their faith in Santa and The Tooth Fairy but makes no mention of God. What's the message there? Give us chases and fight scenes, but don't ask us for anything more. That seems rather false.<br/><br/>Now the million dollar question: will kids enjoy it? Likely, but it will probably appeal more to the kids than to the parents. It is a fun movie with lots of bright colors and colorful characters and fun chase scenes. The villain meets an inevitable fate and the heroes are united as one. All your basic stuff. It's a good movie, an entertaining movie, but not one that is likely to be handed down through the generations. Although, be warned, The Easter Bunny sports a boomerang and your kids may want one for Christmas."

","Who doesn't want to watch a movie about characters we all know and love? Santa? The Easter Bunny? The Tooth Fairy? It all sounds all very endearing... until you see this movie. Honestly, I was shocked just how boring this was. The characters should've been really interesting, and this movie should've been written way better. When action scenes make me yawn (a first!), something's not quite right. Chris Pine, Hugh Jackman, Jude Law, Alec Baldwin are all good in their own right, but when a movie is just ""off"", there's no saving it. As I mentioned, I was terrifically bored but the story and writing, so much so that great visuals and 3D couldn't save it. And I know, studio heads don't want to overwhelm audiences with a high level of graphics and a convoluted, confusing story, but this was just a pure yawnfest.<br/><br/>What I liked: The actors (in their own right), the visuals, and the 3D was good.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: As I repeat, the story, the dialogue, and the length. It just didn't mesh for me, and I even went in with an open heart and interest despite crummy reviews and box office opening.<br/><br/>I suggest, search for something better for the kids, like a Pixar movie, or practically any *other* Dreamworks animated film. 4/10"

","Jude Law goes all camp and wants all the children in the world to stop believing in Isla Fisher, the Easter Kangaroo, and Alec Baldwin as the slightly aggressive Santa with a non-specific but hilarious accent.<br/><br/>Jack Frost comes to save the say by causing near fatal accidents on our usual safe conscious roads.<br/><br/>Hilarity should ensue. <br/><br/>The first thing you realise about this film is the lack of love and care it has compared to other Dreamworks projects of recent years.<br/><br/>It feels rushed, the animation isn't up to much, and it's main crime is that it's boring. Its been claimed by many that this is the Avengers of local legends, which sounds enticing for sure, but when it comes to a head, the most interesting characters are sidelined in order for Jack Frost to be the hero.<br/><br/>The character has been done a dozen times before, the cheeky young lad who doesn't remember his past, causes lots of trouble and yet redeems himself at the end. Yawn.<br/><br/>Jackman and Baldwin are left to nothing more than support, and this is a shame, as they could have been something that livened up the film.<br/><br/>Law is easily the best thing in this movie, and in fact his Pitch is a great animated villain of recent memory, like the Hans Gruber of the animated world.<br/><br/>Other than Law, the film is a complete stinker, mechanical right down to the rusty cogs and soulless.<br/><br/>Dreamworks have really sold out with this.<br/><br/>No fun."
"torfarrells","6","5","11","12 December 2012"," An OK movie, not Christmas nor classic
","First of all, if you are looking for a classic Christmas movie to watch, skip this one. It is neither a classic nor a Christmas movie. Yes there is Santa but Christmas does not take place in this. Easter does though. In this, yetis make the toys, and the elves are midgets dressed like a jingle hat you might find at the dollar store. Next we have Santa, but he is named North in this movie, he is a Russian version, but the voice of the character was Alec Baldwin. We then have tooth fairy, who looks like a green and blue version of the girl with the dragon tattoo, except with wings and she doesn't collect the teeth, mini fairies do. We then come to the speechless Sandman and finally, the Easter Bunny, who looks like a burglar in grey fur. We then have Pitch, an evil boogeyman, and poor old Jack Frost. All he does is mess with people in his town and nobody sees him. Before I continue, I would like to say that I have mainly gotten the things that bothered me from this movie, we can now come to the things I loved about this movie. Like I said, it is not a classic, but is pretty good. The animation was great, with the mist of sand and yetis building toys. Not many laughs in this, but there are a few. It is sort simple storyline, and I thought the animators could make the evil pitch look even more evil. I did like the fact that teeth tell memories from the past, and soon enough, we find Jack's past. I did like the scene in which the guardians collect teeth from children and fight to have the greatest amount of teeth. I don't like how the Jamie, a little boy who ends being the only person in the world who believes in the guardians suddenly became a hero. One minute he is terrified, the next, he tells the guardians to get behind him, he will protect them. But, I enjoyed this movie a lot, and the 3D made it better. B+."
"john-cheeseman-43446","9","2","3","31 May 2019"," Love this film!
","Honestly one of the greatest cartoons made. Loved it from start to finish! Jude law as a baddie his voice is perfect for this!"
"Angels_Review","9","2","3","19 May 2014"," Sort of like another one of their shows
","This was actually a rather good movie showing a child's hopes and dreams. It's interesting how they created the show to be a story of children's hopes and dreams. It's a beautiful idea when you see the basics but then there are some things I have questions about. One is that of the other characters besides Jack and their background. One of these days, I would like them to show what the backgrounds were of them and how they became who they are. Another thing is that the idea of no one seeing Jack even though a lot of the frost was placed where it probably shouldn't have been. It wasn't everywhere like frost tends to go but in special areas. I can understand it for the movie and this might be me just trying and failing to make logic but that's how I am. On the plus side, I don't think I will ever look at a colorful hummingbird again without thinking that it is probably a little fairy. Yes, that was a joke but still, the textures and how they told the story was pretty well done.<br/><br/>The problems that I have with the story do not outweigh the good that the story has to offer but they do make me think of giving a little bit of a lower score. I feel sad that DreamWorks decided to use the same idea of Jack Frost talking about his name and giving a small narration in the beginning and near the end just as Hiccup did in How To Train Your Dragon. To me, it felt like they were just trying to make a copy of the story with how the characters were created and acted. Santa like Hiccup's Dad, Tooth Fairy like Astrid, Easter Bunny like Snotlout, Sand Man like Fishlegs and so on. I mean, sure they had a big success with How To Train Your Dragon but they didn't have to make a copy of it just to get money coming in. On the other side, they didn't copy it fully with a different bad guy and the fact that the action was throughout most of the film. I love twisted tales of characters I came to love but I still could not get over the strange feeling I was watching a lower version of something else I saw.<br/><br/>The designs of the characters are amazing. There are some that you pretty much know what they look like, Santa with his large belly, Easter Bunny pretty much a bunny but then they add things to it. They change the design a little only to make it fun and playful enough for the show. I love their take on the Tooth Fairy though. Her bright and colorful feathers would have been something that I would never have thought of myself, being as I never really thought of the Tooth Fairy looking like a southern colorful bird. The textures that were given to the show was stunning as always with bright colors against dark colors though it just seems like they use that a bit to much. One day, I want to see a bad guy who is bright and colorful instead of gray tones.<br/><br/>Voices were rather good and fit the characters almost to a tee. I especially loved Hugh Jackman playing the Easter Bunny because of just how Australian he made the character. Each character played their role pretty well with instrumental tracks to complement it. If I can say one thing, its that the voices and music were done rather well and held the show together."
"SnoopyStyle","7","2","3","5 September 2013"," classic characters not quite a classic
","The Man in the Moon has selected Jack Frost to be the Guardian to do battle with the evil Pitch Black. Jack Frost is joined by the Toothfairy, Sandman, Easter Bunny, and Santa Claus.<br/><br/>This is a DreamWorks Animation, and it looks good. Certainly it's not groundbreaking, and the selection of classic characters just adds to its feels of unoriginalness. It feels like a slightly different take on the same old stories. And it doesn't help that the characters seems to have powers coming out of the blue. The rules of the movie are never laid out solidly.<br/><br/>There is a sub-story of the need for kids to believe. I think it is the bigger theme that needed to be put up front and center. The kids needed to be the lead especially the last one to believe. As it stands, the movie is a nice story. But I doubt it will be a classic years from now."

The end of the movie is emotional and interesting and the whole movie is just awesome the way kids help the guardians to get their powers back is awesome. The death of sandman and the returning of sandman is very exciting. The end of Pitch is also exciting. The new guardian Jack Frost is very interesting and naughty. I am a fan of animated movies and this one is one of the best animated movies. The acting of Santa is really amazing. And the Tooth fairy is also very beautiful and the baby tooth are really cute.

","""We are very busy bringing joy to children, we don't have time... ... for children.""<br/><br/>Dreamworks animation continue to build up a decent body work, and keeping chomping at the heels of Pixar studios. This Avengers style Children's yarn. Has a decent message on the importance of belief in one's self and others.<br/><br/>The story is Pitch aka ""The Bogeyman"" has returned to destroy hope and dreams of children the world over. The Guardian's, Santa, Easter Bunny, etc. must fight back and recruit the help of a less known legend of Jack Frost. The animation is fantastic through out, with some particular highlights involving the Sandman character. The characters are likable, well rounded, and inspire some decent comic moments.<br/><br/>The story idea is generally quite good, but the film is lacking in that the concentration on the animation. Has led to them forgetting about making a decent villain. Pitch as he is known has a quite despicable goal. But he never truly feels like he is a legitimate threat, and at times with characters back story i actually begin to feel sorry for him at times.<br/><br/>Only a real Scrooge McDuck will 100% hate this move. But kids should love it."
"Hello-Beautiful","9","2","3","1 April 2013"," Purely Original Bedtime Treasure
","You'll find this little gem a bit more cultured than the average kiddie flick. It's an adorable, yet purely original twist on all the classic bedtime legends which makes it uniquely entertaining & satisfying for both the kiddies & adults watching.<br/><br/>The top reasons to watch this movie though, are really all in the hilarious & original characters it collaborates...<br/><br/>Bye bye jolly Saint Nick & hello tattooed, gruff, fur hatted, sword wielding, cookie-eating Russian Santa who's a bit rough around the edges. The Easter bunny has an Australian accent & wields a boomerang ... can you say adorable ?! Also, the Yetis have handlebar mustaches & are the perfectionists who actually make all the toys! It just so happens the elves are just mischievous little hats with goofy faces & feet who's only purpose is to look cute. Lastly, the tooth fairy (only lady Guardian) has mini-fairies as assistants that are tiny little hummingbirds who might just bring back images of the beloved Fern Gully.<br/><br/>As far as voices go....Chris Pine (from Star Trek) adds a bit of a sultry tone to his skinny Jack Frost character, while Jude Law voices of the Boogeyman (I'm sure women watching this will still pickup on his sexy accent & tone though.) Alec Baldwin also doesn't disappoint with his gruff portrayal of a Russian Santa's voice.<br/><br/>All in all, this flick has a non-materialistic, dreamy glow that makes it a special treat for family movie night."
"cnycitylady","8","2","3","23 March 2013"," This movie was a BLAST!!
","Rise of the Guardians was pure childhood, hopeful and wondrous fun. The characters were honest and cute and the script was touching and comedic. Dreamworks has finally made a film that rivals it's previous gem, ""Shrek.""<br/><br/>The story is action packed but with enough time in between to just relax and watch how these myths and legends go about their business. You get great magical fight scenes between the Guardians and the Boogyman. You also get to see them just kick back and have fun. The characterization is pretty well developed so that from the five guardians and the one bad guy you have ample supply to choose a favorite.<br/><br/>My personal favorite was the Tooth Fairy. Isla Fisher's feisty voice brought the character to life in a way that outshone the others. She was the tender care that you put into raising a child and the unconditional love you give them. Of course all of the voice actors brought their own pizazz to what the myths of childhood represented. Alec Baldwin's Santa was big and silly, Jackman's Bunny was very protective and of course Jack Frost (Chris Pine) was the young adventurer that is in every child. Jude Law's Boogyman was very scary indeed --if a little pathetic-- but then, aren't all bad guys who pick on children?<br/><br/>This movie will make you believe in the Sandman and Santa again. It will make you wish you had a tooth to hide under your pillow and an egg to place in a basket. This touching tale will make you laugh, cry and just want to be a kid again. Very well done Dreamworks, I give you super props for putting a story about childhood legends together so well. 8.3/10"
"captainbanana16","6","2","3","14 January 2013"," Good, but also bad...
","So this film had a brilliant premise, with lots of promise and some good characters; unfortunately it was let down by a lot of film and plot clichés that showed they hadn't really gone much further than ""Lets have a film with mythical beings."" There were plenty of times where I was agonising in my seat because of the overused, predictable nature of the scene, such as when Pitch tried to convert Jack, (which was obviously not going to happen but they tried to make it dramatic anyway) with the all-too classic ""villain on shoulders, hero turns away with troubled expression routine."" There were many moments in this film like that. However, saying that, there were many highly hysterical moments, that literally made me laugh out load scattered about, so to say it was completely bad is wrong. It felt more like they'd obtained a decent premise, stuffed in a generic plot, then sprinkled it with a mixture of highly inventive scenes and highly uninventive drivel. Go watch this film, you may be able to look past the glaring cliché, and your child most certainly will (Unless he's been raised in a home full of those ""kinds of films"") and enjoy the very beautiful visuals."

","Rise of the Guardians is an interesting take on some of the major beliefs of children, some of which are geared toward capitalist consumerism. That being said, their spin caught me a bit off-guard. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the preview. It was a very pleasant surprise, especially for Santa Claus. He rocks! The Easter Bunny... well, he's interesting, but his world, not so much. I guess they spent more time on the northman. The others are somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Now, there's a few weak moment in the movie, where the script gets too predictable and the dialogs a bit lame. If they could have applied themselves to the whole movie and each of the characters as they did on the North Pole and its denizen, we'd have had a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I must admit though, that they did a good work on the animation style. Even though it's not highly polished, it has flair, and a certain personality, so there's some good there. It's also touching at time.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good movie to watch.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","1","8 March 2019"," An action-packed film with great, well-known characters and stunning visuals.
","While the idea of the holidays being connected isn't a new idea (see The Nightmare Before Chrismas (1993) for another take on it), there is something intrinsically interesting with making the respective figureheads of their representative mythos come together in an Avenger-esque fashion against a common enemy. Rise of the Guardians (2012) certainly does a good job of this, even if only two of its characters have anything to do with holidays at all. In its essence, the fanciful characters from our childhood banding together to fight evil personified is based on the belief that we all have something to believe in.<br/><br/>What I particularly like about Rise of the Guardians is the surprising depth of the characters chosen to fight for the belief of all children around the world. From a Russian-themed Santa Claus to the Australian Easter Bunny (expertly voiced by Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman, respectively), these added details to beloved childhood figures just adds to their personalities. Even the Boogeyman's ability to hide and utilize shadows merely emphasizes that each of these characters has abilities and strengths commensurate to their basic attributes, thus fleshing them out into well-rounded characters instead of just 2-dimensional bedtime stories.<br/><br/>Because of these colorful and unique characters, their interactions in this interesting plot were merely accentuated by the imaginative artistic style that Dreamworks animators have used for years. That being said, the human children characters looked quite ugly, so I can't completely give the team full marks for their effort. Still, the visuals of the main characters were used to create a fanciful and fun world which was expertly contrasted by the ""under the bed"" realm of the Boogeyman. And while this film might not necessarily be a ""Christmas"" film (it's events actually take place closer to Easter), I think it's a good counterpoint to other ""cold"" animated films like ""Frozen"", especially for the young boys who might not be interested in Disney princesses.<br/><br/>An action-packed film with great, well-known characters and stunning visuals, I give Rise of the Guardians 4.5 stars out of 5."

He questioned why he was there and what he was suppose to do. He didn't get an answer. Learning to fly amused him. He was happy! He then walked into a small village and started being friendly with the people but he doesn't realize they can't hear him until one of them walks through him. That's when the moon told him his name was Jack Frost. That was all he was ever told.<br/><br/>The next scenes show North noticing an imbalance on the globe. He immediately sets off the alarm to call all of his fellow Guardians to the North Pole to have a meeting because the children are in danger. Soon Sandy, Tooth, and Bunny appear. North tells them about the darkness that is looming. They don't believe him. They argue and then the Man in the Moon appears. He tells them that it is time to get a new guardian. It is revealed that it is Jack Frost. Bunny is in total disagreement. Jack Frost is known for his wild antics and his ornery attitude. Bunny doesn't believe he can protect the children from the danger that is coming.<br/><br/>Santa sends his helpers to grab Jack and they transport him to the North Pole. Jack is confused and is trying to figure out his place. They announce that he is now a Guardian. Jack shuts down the celebration because he doesn't want to be a Guardian. Tooth tries to explain the job of protecting the children and then they tell him about Pitch coming to hurt all the children and all their innocent beliefs. That isn't convincing enough so North decides to give him a tour of the North Pole. North's pep talk gives Jack something to think about. Jack agrees to help just this once to defeat Pitch to save the children from terror. <br/><br/>Pitch decides to take on each character one by one so the children will stop believing in them. He starts with Tooth and then moves on to making Sandy disappear. Tooth becomes very weak to battle, so all that is left is North, Bunny, and Jack. Pitch then ruins Easter so Bunny then becomes too weak to battle. The final battle is between Jack and Pitch. Jack enlists some neighborhood kids that still believe in the Guardians. Their strength helps Jack and together they defeat Pitch. Pitch ends up being forced to go back under the bed where he is trapped and forced to stay away from all of the children.<br/><br/>The lessons in this movie are simple. There is always going to be good and evil in life. As a child, you believe in both. As an adult, good and evil are still a part of life but in very different ways. One can always choose to believe in good or evil. Evil will take away happiness every time. The theme of this movie shows how believing in good can make your life wonderful."

After summoning fellow Guardians the Tooth Fairy (Tooth), the Easter Bunny (E.

Pitch declares his intention to destroy children's faith in the Guardians in revenge for his own disbelieved-in state, beginning with Tooth, who immediately begins weakening as children stop believing in her. To avert this, the Guardians perform her teeth-collection themselves for the interim, with a promise to find Jack's teeth to recover his previous life's memories. A young boy named Jamie is delighted to discover them in his room, as he believes in all of them except Jack, which renders Jack still invisible. Pitch learns of the Guardians' resistance and attacks Jack and Sandy; despite Jack's great efforts to save him, Sandy is overwhelmed by Pitch and seemingly destroyed. The Guardians' spirit broken, a despondent Jack departs in disgrace to Antarctica. There, Pitch tempts him to join forces, but Jack again refuses, as he wants to be loved, not feared. In response, Pitch reveals he has Baby-Tooth, and threatens to kill her unless Jack relinquishes the source of his power, his staff. Jack submits, but Pitch reneges and the resulting fight leaves Jack trapped in a crevasse with Baby-Tooth while Pitch breaks his staff. To counter Jack's despair, Baby-Tooth convinces Jack to unlock his memories, which reveal he was a mortal boy who died saving his sister from falling through ice, and because of that heroism was changed into a winter spirit and chosen as a Guardian by the Man in the Moon. Inspired at this revelation, Jack is able to restore his staff and his power. The Guardians and Pitch learn there is only one believing child left: Jamie. Jack races to the boy and not only confirms Jamie's faith in the Guardians, but also instills a belief in Jack Frost, enabling Jamie to finally see him. The diminished and weakened Guardians arrive to join him as they confront Pitch, while Jamie gathers his friends to support them. Pitch's seemingly overwhelming power of nightmare proves no match against the children's faith, which restores the Guardians' full power to battle the villain. Sandman is resurrected by this belief, and joins the fight, leaving Pitch defeated and children's faith restored, as well as in Jack Frost. Pitch is taken down by his own fear and is forced back into his lair. At this victory, Jack is finally sworn in as a Guardian and resolves to protect the world's children with his new friends. this is movie is really interesting but some part is copy from frozen."
"TxMike","Null","1","1","19 October 2014"," The story of how Jack became Jack Frost and the newest guardian.
","I just got around to seeing this movie, as my public library just added it to their BluRay collection. The video and sound are great, and has selected very deep bass tones where appropriate, putting a powered subwoofer to good display. Also the animation comes very close to seeming real, all in all a very well done animated movie. One of the better ones in recent years.<br/><br/>The guardians are the ones who watch over the good of the children, like Santa, Tooth Fairy, Sandman (who gives children pleasant dreams), and Easter Bunny. In this movie their names are simply North, Tooth, Sandy, and Bunny. But as the movie opens we see a boy floating to the surface of a frozen pond, his name is Jack and he soon finds that he is in fact Jack Frost. He is the one who makes ""snow days"" possible for the school children.<br/><br/>But there is an evil force in this story, it is Pitch Black who wants to take control of the children, and instead of nice dreams make them have nightmares. Defeating him and also getting Jack Frost legitimate, where children believe in him like they do the others, is part of the story arc.<br/><br/>My wife abandoned it after 30 minutes, it isn't her kind of entertainment. But I found the whole movie very entertaining with a good story and a good resolution.<br/><br/>Main voice actors are Chris Pine as Jack Frost, Alec Baldwin as North, Jude Law as Pitch, Isla Fisher as Tooth, Hugh Jackman as Bunny. Sandy could not make any sounds so he didn't have a voice!"
"Soul4673","10","1","1","23 December 2013"," such a WONDERful film.
","I've been wanting to watch this film for a while. I've never gotten a chance til now. I was expecting it to be good.....I was not expecting that. I love Hugh Jackman and Jude Law and Chris Pine and Isla Fisher....who doesn't right? But I was expecting a cheesy lined filled, exaggerated film with un-realistically ""apple pie"" characters and in-human animation.<br/><br/>None of that was true. NONE. The animation first of was absolutely incredible. It was intricate and magical and...just amazing and it made me believe these characters were real. The eyes were the most incredible part to me. The strands in Jack's blue eyes and then his brown eyes make him feel so real. It was absolutely incredible. <br/><br/>OK the ""apple pie"" characters. First of Jack. He could not be further from an ""apple pie"" character. He was resentful and confused and had NO idea who he was or who he was meant to be but then again as North says he's got layers- he was strong and impulsive and fun and kind and caring and SO protective of the kids- especially of Jamie. He was SO admirable and amazing and human. Chris Pine's voice was perfect as well. He truly brought Jack to life. He was a beautiful character. OK Jamie. Jamie was the ""cliched"" kid who believes. He was fun and adorable and also beautiful. He made me cry happily SO many times. In complete honesty- he was me. Except for gender- wise. He believed no matter what anyone said. I loved his character. The bunny....the funniest part of his character was how he was with jack and the the fact that he was an Austrailian. My mum said that jack and bunny reminded her of Gimli and Arrogorn from Lord of the Rings...competitive but working towards the same goal. The bunny in my opinion had the most layers. He was competitive and brave and stubborn but he loved what he stood for and he loved being believed in and he loved the kids. He was awesome in fact. And now North or Santa....the teacher, the father, the leader. He taught Jack about layers...about how a person can be more than just scary and powerful....he can be wonder-full. He can see the world in a million ways. He can look at anything and can find the happiness in it. His character was very deep and I loved him. <br/><br/>OK now the story- the idea is that a kid who just ""appeared"" out of nowhere under the ice. All he knew was his name- ""Jack Frost"" and that the moon told him this. He then discovers his powers and stumbles upon a town of people but they can't see him and they just walk right through him literally. They can't see him. They don't believe in him....yeah it's depressing. We then skip to 300 years later and we meet the 4 guardians- Tooth, North, Sandy and Bunny. They guard children. They guard their beliefs and they prove to them that magic is real. Very admirable and beautiful. There is a globe in the room with tiny lights shining on different countries. This earlier was covered with shadows....the shadow of Pitch Black or the bogeyman who is trying to get the world to believe in him through fear. He's their enemy. The moon then chooses to announce a new guardian....yeah it's Jack. The guardians then find jack and chuck him in a sack and transport him to the North pole. I'm not gonna kill everything so I'll just leave it there. :-P the storyline is so intricate and the scripting is snappy and beautiful and hilarious.<br/><br/>Truthfully I don't know why this film hasn't done better. It's probably coz of people like me who wanted to see it but didn't. I sincerely apologise for that actually. I desperately wish I'd seen it at the cinema now. I'm sure it would've been magnificent. I'm so sorry. <br/><br/>This is a beautiful film that made me feel like I was 6 years old again....very cheesy I know but I promise you this film is absolutely wonderful and full of adorable characters and fun and magic and I couldn't love it more. You know a film's good when you can watch it twice within the same 4 hours and still cry the second time. Just watch it and enjoy it. You won't regret it."

","Do you believe in fairy tales? In creeps and ghouls and ghosts and boogymen? Do you believe in hope? And joy and love and other things, like children do? If you say no, you will love The rise of the guardians. If you say yes, you will definitely love The rise of the guardians. <br/><br/>Dreamworks has pulled out all the stops with this super adorable animated film. It has a great cast voicing the characters but that is not enough is it? So guess what, the film has an awesome story line and some well done graphics as well.<br/><br/>For an hour and thirty seven minutes the film twists and turns through fear, sorrow, magic, joy and hope. There is not a single boring minute and for once, for what seems like after a really long time, I found a film completely unpredictable until the very end. <br/><br/>Bringing in a concept of what is sadly true, the fact that childhood is dying and with it is hope and faith and childlike belief of whimsical characters like Santa and the Easter Bunny, the Rise of the Guardians gets one thinking about the metaphorical fears and dangers threatening mankind, showcased throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>Animation lovers will especially enjoy the final few minutes of the film where there is an obvious interpretation from a scene in The Lion King staring Scar (Let me know if you can find the correlation just like I did ). <br/><br/>Bottomline - A must watch for children and adults of all ages."
"CountVladDracula","10","1","1","11 December 2013"," Surprisingly wonderful
","Rise of the Guardians is a sweet, strange, and highly imaginative movie for people of any age. My one regret is not seeing it when it was in the cinema last year. It's not at all what I expected. It has action but no real violence. It talks of the importance of childhood virtues such as wonder, hope, dreams, memories and fun. And there seems to be a surprisingly spiritual overtone. There is humor and ample creativity. The film was beautifully made and Jack Frost is a sweet and endearing protagonist. I think this is a highly under-rated movie that deserves more attention than it has received. And if you like it the film is based on the children's' book series The Guardians of Childhood."

","splendid animation. but that is not a really surprise because technique tools solves all. but this case is very, very special. because more important than spectacular images remains its soul. and the soul is a state of joy who remains, after the end of film, fresh a long time. it is the skill of director, the merit of actors, the talent of entire team. but , in same measure, it is the merit of public expectation to discover a so rich gift, too long time expected. the best review about it is not complicated - must see it ! for the flavor of childhood, for a real watchmaker/jeweler work, for the remember authentic heroes in a period of many super heroes. and for understand than animation is a mixture between precise science and art to remind the fragile beauty, the powerful force of miracles."

You can't help but love the characters, (or in Pitch's case, hate them.) There are also plenty of cute and funny little moments scattered through the film. Santa's elves are great comic relief characters, as they are always getting into some type of mischief! I also loved the development of Jack Frost's character as he meets the guardians, battles Pitch Black, and finally understand what it means to be a guardian.

"mcpme","8","1","1","23 July 2013"," Really good, but just missing a couple of things
","There's so many other great reviews here, but I'd just like to add couple of things I didn't read.<br/><br/>We bought this film and have played it many times much to our 3 year old's delight, and like many animated features there's plenty here for adults to like as well. I love this type of film, it takes everyone's favorite childhood characters and puts them together in a thrilling story of goodies vs baddies.<br/><br/>But I felt it was missing a couple of things. First of all, the dialogue is pretty weak in places - children won't care, but adults would enjoy it more if the dialogue was just a bit slicker. And secondly the animation was a little under par by today's standards. At first I wondered if it was a style choice, but more than likely it was a budget thing. Textures and fine details (like hair movement etc) look more programmatic than animatic.<br/><br/>But all of the other good things mentioned in the 10 out of 10 reviews still apply though, my score is an 8, because I think some of those finer details are what makes a really good film really great."
"kosmasp","9","1","1","5 July 2013"," Guardians Assemble
","To have so many (let's call them) interesting characters pushed into one movie, is quite a feat. And it is very well done indeed. Something a friend of mine kept telling me. He had seen a trailer for this movie and made me anticipate this almost as much as he did. And the movie did not disappoint! Quite the contrary, I had a lot of fun watching it and laughing throughout.<br/><br/>I'm guessing everyone will have a favorite character, which is a great thing for an animated picture like this. A movie that not only works for kids, but also for adults. Maybe it does wake up the child in them a little bit, but that is not a bad thing now, is it? The story as it is, is not completely new (the arc of the story that is), but it does work nicely and you have a great ensemble of people with great talent. If you don't hate animated movies, you have to watch this one"
"livyatnair","9","1","1","15 May 2013"," Brings back childhood memories
","When you watch the movie and the entire range of characters - it hits you suddenly and makes you think of all the characters you grew up with. The Sandman, Jack Frost, Easter Bunny -- and makes you sit down and call your best friend and say ""OMG do you remember this character and this one and this one!???"". That was my reaction when I watched The Rise of the Guardians. Dreamworks has really got a winner with this one. <br/><br/>The characters come to life and make you believe in them. You remember how you used to put your tooth, without fail, under your pillow waiting for the Tooth Fairy to visit you. All this comes back to you when you watch this movie. <br/><br/>The movie brings all the characters together in their fight to keep children's dreams and hopes alive. It also shows you the vulnerability of these characters and how they need the children just as children need them.<br/><br/>The movie has some very cool visuals including the lovely globe that shows all the children who believe in the Guardians. You come away from the movie wondering what your center actually is . Just like North says--You just have to find your center and your place in the world and believe in the Guardians."
"ChristianUnchained","8","1","1","23 April 2013"," A Flawed, yet enjoyable experience
","A rock solid animated flick that will have kids wildly entertained, but there is also some great action, whip-fast writing and incredible animation there for an older audience to enjoy, granted that they're willing to sift through the more cliché ""kids-movie"" tropes. <br/><br/>Firstly of note is the stellar voice work. Chris Pine leads, while Hugh Jackman and Alec Baldwin accompanies him in this wild adventure while he fights Pitch, played by Jude Law. Pine is extraordinarily refreshing, contrasting the annoying and whiny voices of most animated movies today with a deep and mature voice. The characters are all pretty familiar, but have their own creative and amusing spin put on them. Santa is a Russian, spouting exclamations like ""Korsakov!"" and ""Shostakovich!"" (which is fairly amusing, me being a music guy and all) and Bunny is an Australian boomerang wielding boss (no doubt a play on his voice actor Jackman) are among the better of the cast. It's an undoubtedly strong voice crew, and it truly shows. <br/><br/>The animation is stellar, featuring some beautiful effects and sharp details that bring the world alive. It's too bad though, that it's so short, because just an extra 30 minutes would've really allowed the audience to more deeply explore and absorb the goofy yet enjoyable world of the Guardians. Alexandre Desplat also composes yet another enjoyable score for RotG. The guy can churn out score after score, he's becoming the new John Williams! <br/><br/>The pacing is crazy fast, to say the least, but it manages to get the story across well enough. Speaking of which, the Rise of the Guardian's biggest strength and weakness is its story. It begins so mysteriously, which really hooked me at the beginning. When the inevitable twist comes along it's clever, but after that the film loses that mysterious and magical quality that made the first half of the film so great in favor for a simple second half. The end is cute and fun, but it's to ""Yeah! Yay!"" happy-cheery, which proves that Rise of the Guardians has a classic case of identity crisis, where one section is strong, dark, and even mature while the other is childish, simple, and cliché. It's too bad, because the majority of the film is original, enticing and incredibly entertaining.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians has great characters, music, and animation and an awesome first half to boot, but it ends up ending too fast and plays it too safe. It's still an entertaining ride with some spectacular action and interesting creativity on display, so let's hope they use their obvious creative ability throughout the whole film instead of opting out for a casual ending for the inevitable sequel."
"MoodyB84","6","1","1","22 March 2013"," A pleasant surprise!
","As soon as I was aware of ROTG I immediately thought Avengers for children, and I know many others have said this. Well, this is kind of the case as there is of course obvious comparisons but it is best not to dwell on those comparisons, but ROTG is in my opinion a great concept, especially for children, and is tremendous fun. What proves very effective about this concept is the non-traditional depiction of these very traditional characters. Santa, called 'North' as a tattooed sword wielding Russian and The Easter Bunny as a sarcastic Australian warrior. Jack Frost himself is a very cocky upstart and the interaction between these characters proves very entertaining to watch, with plenty of jokes.<br/><br/>The animation and the action itself looks spectacular, the winter setting proving a real spectacle that dazzles on screen. For children, I can imagine this is a great watch as there is a perfect balance of heart, action and humour. For adults too, this is a great watch as it is a poignant reminder of the feeling of believing in these characters and of the magic associated with these seasons. There are plenty of themes within the narrative that add feeling and involvement such as finding your own identity, belonging and learning to have faith in others.<br/><br/>As much fun as ROTG is, there is still a slight feeling of unrealised potential. For me, there could have been so much more fun to be had with these characters and maybe a stronger script could have provided more laughs for children and adults alike. The story is a little too predictable, even for a kids film, and at times the moralistic messages feel a little too preachy and in your face when a viewer of any age would have already got the message, but this only rarely detracts from what is otherwise tremendous fun."
"Foux_du_Fafa","7","1","1","14 January 2013"," Decent but not amazing animated film
","""Rise of the Guardians"" seems to have underperformed at the box-office, particularly when judged against the majority of Dreamworks animated films. While I'm not a regular follower of Dreamworks animated films (at least compared to how I am with Disney and Pixar), I did catch this one. Something regarding ""Rise of the Guardians"" that stuck with me was that it did come across as a bit childish and saccharine at times, especially in the scenes involving Jack Frost and others interacting with a group of child characters. However, the animation and art direction is fabulous, richly detailed and haunting. I also liked the imaginative renderings of the stock legendary characters, even if the difficult relationship between Jack Frost and the Easter Bunny seemed to scream of cliché. Though hardly the best animated film of the year, it's still worth a watch."
"moviexclusive","Null","4","9","19 November 2012"," With spectacular 3D visuals, inventive takes on classic childhood figures and an delightfully enthralling story, this revisionist fantasy is a truly magical experience
","Almost without fail, every holiday season brings an animated film that bears the iconic character of Santa Claus with the candy-coated Hollywood message of embracing your inner childlike sense of wonder. This year's honour belongs to DreamWorks Animation's 'Rise of the Guardians'- the first big screen adaptation of children's author William Joyce's book series 'The Guardians of Childhood' – but instead of just relying on Santa, 'Guardians' brings along with it other mythical childhood figures like Tooth Fairy, Sandman and Easter Bunny to reinforce the message.<br/><br/>To be sure, the Santa here isn't your typical bearded old man in a red suit; instead, this Santa (voiced by Alec Baldwin) is a burly muscular Norse god-like figure with 'Naughty' tattooed on one forearm and 'Nice' on the other. For that matter, none of the other figures are depicted quite the way you would expect them to be – Bunny (voiced by Hugh Jackman) looks almost like a kangaroo with a perpetually gruff attitude; Sandman is gold, tubby and always smiley; and Fairy (voiced by Isla Fisher) resembles a hummingbird with a chirpy delightful demeanour.<br/><br/>Even more surprising perhaps is how none of these aforementioned characters are in fact the lead; that goes to Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), a less well-known figure in this part of the world who is most commonly associated with his ability to turn anything he touches into snow. The playwright and occasional screenwriter David Lindsay- Abaire opens the movie with Jack's voice-over, as he wakes up to consciousness staring at the moon to discover that he has magical powers. His origins prior to waking up as an immortal creature is not only key to his journey from mischief-maker to hero, but also form the crux of the movie's emotional core.<br/><br/>Admittedly, that journey pretty much follows the standard Hollywood formula of an irresponsible miscreant discovering his destiny as a noble hero, so much so that you can predict that Jack will fall out with the rest of the Guardians before finally emerging at the end to prove his worth. Nonetheless, Jack's transformation that begins when he is chosen by the Man on the Moon to help the existing Guardians fight the scourge of fear and disbelief is still a thoroughly magical one- thanks to Abaire's deft scripting and some gorgeous visuals that look absolutely stunning in 3D.<br/><br/>Under the helm of first-time feature filmmaker Peter Ramsey, both the former and the latter perfectly complement each other. Using Abaire's liberties with the characters as a starting point, Ramsey creates a unique fantasy world utterly impressive in its detail. Instead of elves being Santa's reliable toymakers, the Yetis are in fact the ones in his workshop, with the former decked out in pointy hats acting as mere minions not unlike those in 'Despicable Me'. Assisting the Tooth Fairy are innumerable tiny fairies modelled after hummingbirds in both size and speed; and the Easter Bunny's lair is one colourful garden guarded by giant stone eggs and filled with little eggs with legs of their own - oh and did we mention these eggs can candy colour coat themselves to become his gifts to children?<br/><br/>But most visually striking is Sandman, both in the way he glides around with trails of golden sand behind him and in the way he conjures up whips of gold against the blackness that is Pitch (voiced by Jude Law) - the diabolical figure depicted in shades of black whose plan to overthrow the Guardians is to get the children of the world to stop believing in them. The contrast of black and gold is breath-taking (especially under the guidance of veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins who is billed here as visual consultant), and the amount of imagination and thought that has gone into each frame is simply amazing.<br/><br/>The amalgamation of the magical and the human world must also have gotten a definitive boost from executive producer Guillermo del Toro, borne out particularly in the exhilarating action sequences. Notwithstanding the fact that each one feels like a theme park roller-coaster ride in itself, what astounds is how each never fails to be a distinctive visual spectacle in itself, brimming with its own singular details and colour palette. It is nothing short of a pure feast for the eyes, and totally worthy of the extra dollars just to enjoy the aesthetics in the third dimension. <br/><br/>Yet the cornucopia isn't meant as a distraction from the storytelling; rather, it elicits beautifully the power of belief, of hope and of wonder that is sure to resonate with young tots, as well as the lesson of conquering one's fears for the more mature of audiences. A note of caution to parents though – there will be some imagery which may frighten the little ones, but the use of light and shadows to depict the fight between good and evil is so compelling that it will ultimately leave them ecstatic. Revisionist fairy tales rarely come as lively and inspired as this, and this one that reimagines Santa, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, Sandman and Jack Frost as guardians of childlike hope and wonder is a definitive holiday classic. <br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"
"Fluke_Skywalker","6","3","6","1 October 2013"," ""Guardians"" rises just above mediocrity
","It seems like the gap between Pixar and DreamWorks Animation has closed a smidge of late. I don't know if that's because Pixar's last few films ('Cars 2', 'Brave' and 'Monsters University') have been beneath their usual standards, or if it's because DreamWorks has upped their game. Perhaps it's a bit of both.<br/><br/>'Rise Of The Guardians' isn't anywhere close to the excellence of DeramWorks best animated film, 'How To Train Your Dragon', but it's more or less on par with their more mediocre efforts like the 'Kung-Fu Panda' films and 'Monsters vs. Aliens'. Sort of a Jr. 'Avengers', kids under the age of ten should enjoy it."
"RainDogJr","9","3","6","8 December 2012"," One of the best animated movies of the year for sure
","First we had classic monsters together (HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA); later video game characters (WRECK-IT RALPH); and finally this, with classic folklore characters that the kids believe in. 2012 was like the year for doing a crossover in animation (hell, not only in animation since we had THE AVENGERS too!) and RISE OF THE GUARDIANS is definitely the best one, therefore one of the very best animated pictures of the year; alongside FRANKENWEENIE, BRAVE and PARANORMAN. <br/><br/>Part of the success, I think, comes directly from having really good characters. The key character of the story is Jack Frost (voice of Chris Pine) – we learn everything about him and his background (why he became Jack Frost) is so great you just want to learn everything about the rest of the characters. All of them, as you already know, are traditional characters that most people, especially in Europe and the United States, know since their childhood; we have Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, Sandman, the Easter Bunny and the already mentioned Jack Frost (as well as the bogeyman). <br/><br/>The film deals with the thing of being a kid that still believes in those characters. Who can't relate to that? Yes, I'm from Mexico and as a kid didn't give a damn for Santa but I did for the equivalent (los Reyes Magos) – the believing thing is universal and is really well used here and definitely brings freshness to the same old story of ""evil threatening the world and heroes saving it"". It's a soulful fantasy for kids that will get 'em in the most emotive mood for Christmas. <br/><br/>*Watched it on 01 December, 2012"
"cattjones","10","3","6","27 November 2012"," Great Film!!
","This film was truly enjoyable. Peter Ramsey who is known mostly for his story boarding work did a fantastic job with this film. I think that of all the guardians, the one that I really understood first as a child was the Sandman. In Germany when the sandman came on television, it was time to go to bed. There was no discussion to be had. You simply got up, kissed your parents good night and went to bed. How much simpler life would be for parents of young children if the sandman was still around. The story pretty much centers around Pitch Black or the Boogie Man (Jude Law) wanting to take over the minds of little children and making them forget about all the good images in their lives. North or Santa Clause (Alec Baldwin) is the apparent leader of the guardians and must assemble the group in order to fight Pitch. I am not sure why North has a Russian accent, but I think it worked well. Jack Frost (Chris Pine) is a carefree spirit who is all about having fun and playing in the snow and ice. He is reluctantly recruited by the Man in the Moon as the newest addition to the guardian clan. Jack and Bunny (Hugh Jackman) seem to have a tumultuous relationship which adds the charm of this film. Bunny turns out to be from Australia and welds a mean set of boomerangs. Tooth (Isla Fisher) is endearing and is all about dental hygiene. I particularly liked her helpers; especially baby tooth. The additional elements in the film such as the Yetis (only way I can think to describe them) who are responsible for making the toys and the elves who are responsible for seemingly nothing, adds additional comic relief to the film. I think that one of the things that I liked most about this film is that it kind of explains how all the characters make it around the globe in such a short amount of time. I also like the fact that you got to see where all the characters live (not just Santa). I think that kids (and adults) will enjoy this film and definitely leave the theater with a smile on their face. I am not sure if the 3D is really necessary, but for the extra thrills, go ahead an upgrade. I give this film a celebratory green light."
"EmmaDinkins","8","3","6","25 November 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Jack Frost has got it going on!
","Rise of the Guardians is the story of legendary characters identified with various Holidays and events working together against a common foe who wants to perpetuate fear. There are four Guardians starting with Santa Claus, who is certainly a Santa for a new generation, with tattoos and a thumb ring North (Alec Baldwin) is an OG (original gangsta) Santa. This story was great PR for Jack Frost (Chris Pine) who has been chosen as the newest Guardian recruit, but he has an issue with belief in him. All that should change as a result of this gem of a tale, and just in time for winter. Of course Jack is a reluctant hero, but those make the best kind. This is now my favorite Jack Frost film and it is much more fun than that live action characterization of him in the Santa Clause 3, which kind of sucked and don't even get me started with that crazy Jack Frost reincarnated fallen father snowman flick, I digress. It was amusing to watch the friendly rivalry between Jack and the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth (Isla Fisher) Fairy was a bit freaky looking, and everybody was more interesting than the Sand Man, which rounds out the crew. That brings me to their nemesis, Pitch Black (Jude Law) who was a not so scary at all Boogey Man. I snickered a bit every time his name was mentioned because sometimes it sounded like a 'B' rather than a 'P' so it was like ""Don't make me slap a Pitch"" or That Pitch needs to chillax."" ROTG was one of the most action packed films that I've seen all year, you don't really keep in mind that it is animated as the pace and the intensity heightens. Speaking of the animation it was so delightful with imagery so colorful that small children will love the look of it even if they did not completely grasp the depth of the story with the Guardians fighting for hope, wonder, fund memories and fun. This is a great story of the battle of good versus evil with an iconic team working together to prevent fear from taking hold in the hearts of children, oh and in 3D. There were so many magical moments in this film that I could think of only one thing that would have made the experience better for me and that is if I had seen it with my awesome grandsons, Three and Aries. I give this remarkable film a bright green light.<br/><br/>Note: I was really digging Jack's platinum blond do."
"Gods-gurlevr","10","3","6","22 November 2012"," BEST PG RATED MOVIE EVER (warning some Spoilers)
","I watched this with my best friend, Liz, and she and I both fell in love with Jack in the previews. <br/><br/>Watching the movie in 3D was definitely worth the extra price. I have never seen a movie that has as brilliant 3D appearances before in my life. I absolutely adored this movie! <br/><br/>From stories of Bunny's that hide eggs, to fairies that take teeth that have come out and leave money, to a man that comes into your house by chimney and leaves gifts for every child naughty or nice, to a man that brings you dreams of lollipops and dancing dolphins. To the tale of Jack Frost, the man that few believe in and even less know about. A boy that wants nothing more then to be seen and be believed in, as much as the others. <br/><br/>When he is chosen as the next member of the Guardians (a team of legends the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Santa Claus) he doesn't want to be that, he wants to still be a kid. To play with others, as a normal kid would. <br/><br/>But when he finds out that the evil Pitch (aka the Boogeyman) has stolen his teeth from when he was a child, and that those teeth hold the secret to his life before he was Jack Frost. He sets out on a quest to save his memories and help some unexpected friends along the way.<br/><br/>Great for the family and fantastic to see in 3D. I WILL definitely be buying this movie!"
"allforanime24","10","3","6","22 November 2012"," Amazing!
","I took both of my kids to see this, my 17 year old son and 14 year old daughter. We all agreed it was one of the top five animated movies we'd ever seen. My son didn't even want to see it, but as we were leaving the theater he said ""we've got to buy this when it comes out!"" Definitely worth seeing in 3D. We've been pretty disappointed with the 3D offerings in the past few years, most of them just weren't worth it, but this one far surpasses any other. The animation was beautiful and the 3D made it seem like you were in the movie with the snow falling all around you. The characters were so interesting,and very different from what we've grown to expect from Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman and Jack Frost. We're thinking about going back tomorrow to see it again. Don't miss this one!"

","Two of our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics reviewed it. See below: Morgan Bertsch - Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=o28lnEuBM6Q<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of movies, and this movie had the most amazing graphics and best 3-D I have ever seen. I felt like I was in the same room as the scenes. The snowflakes come right at you and make you feel like it is really snowing on you. The Man in the Moon needs the help of The Guardians to defeat the evil Pitch. The Guardians are amazing. The animators and writers did a stupendous job of creating believable characters. <br/><br/>The Guardians consist of Santa, who is from Russia. He is jolly and lives in an amazing castle. He has the cutest elves with jingle bells on their heads. They are very funny and helpful. The Easter Bunny is tough. He's from Australia and has a boomerang. His adorable eggs actually have legs and can run around. <br/><br/>The Tooth fairy is very different. She is a bird. She has pink wings and blue and green feathers. Her baby birds that help her are the sweetest little creatures. The Sandman is the one who makes all your dreams come true while you are sleeping. The graphics for his amazing talents were fabulous.<br/><br/>Jack Frost was one of my favorites. Everything he touches turn into frost. The animation of the frost covering everything was absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>Pitch wants the world to be dark and sad and to lose all hope. The children keep the world safe by having hope. Santa has a magic globe, which is bright with lights as long as the children believe, but once they stop believing their light goes out.<br/><br/>The intricate design of the scenery was the best I have ever seen. Everything, from the smallest detail to the large wandering dinosaurs, is breathtaking. <br/><br/>This movie is humorous, adorable and magical. My favorite scenes are when the Easter Bunny goes on a sleigh ride with Santa Clause and also when the baby eggs are running around. The sandman's magic makes your heart glow. The message is to stop and find out what makes you special. You have to find out what it is that you do best and find your center so you know how to make yourself and others happy.<br/><br/>I love this movie. It mixes up holidays, so you can watch it year around and get into the mood for the seasons.<br/><br/>I recommend this for ages 6 and up. Pitch is frightening. The over-sized Santa might be too much for the little ones because — I am not joking — he looks like you are right next to him.<br/><br/>I give this movie five *****out of five twinkling stars.<br/><br/>Review by Cheyenne Nguyen - Video review: http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=-PS_XegUGC0<br/><br/>This is a magical movie with all the favorite childhood guardians comes together to protect the children. This is another great movie from DreamWorks. Santa Clause (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jack man), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) are chosen by the man in the moon to guard the children. They make sure that all children have wonderful dreams and faith. The more the children believe in the guardians the more power they have.<br/><br/>However, the Boogie man (Jude Law) rise to take over the sweet dreams and create nightmares. Children are beginning to lose faith in the guardians. Without faith or believes, the guardians will disappear and the lights will turn off and the earth will be filled with darkness. This is when the guardians join forces to fight the Boogie man. <br/><br/>However, Jack Frost did not join forces to fight. He just wanted to have fun and not worry about anything. <br/><br/>There are so many funny lines in this movie. My favorite part of the movie is when the Tooth Fairy looks at the collection of teeth; she knows which one flosses and who it belongs to. <br/><br/>The part I did not like is the Boogie man seems so real and I don't want to see him when I sleep.<br/><br/>The 3D special effects in this movie are so clear it is unbelievable. When Jack Frost is flying it feels like you flying with him and actually feels the cold air. The rivers of colors are so bright and clear. However, the music is so and so, not very exciting. <br/><br/>The lesson in this movie is finding your passion and you will know your purpose in life. The customs are so awesome. Especially the Fairies and Santa and his elves. The message in this movie is joining forces can be more powerful than being by yourself.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Jack Frost. He's very fun to be around. I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 and up."
"sddavis63","5","4","10","18 December 2012"," Chock Full Of Messages And A Few Cutesy Moments
","I get the message from this, or, maybe I should say the messages. There's more than one. There's the power of belief and the importance of believing. Then there's the heartache of being the one who blends in and never gets noticed. Little children can make a big difference. I get all that, and they're fine messages. And yet, with all those fine messages packed in, I thought this was at best a very average movie; not one that captivated me.<br/><br/>It uses a variety of legendary beings (including Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sand Man) and turn them into super-hero sorts, whose role as ""Guardians"" is to protect little children. But the source of their power is the belief of the children, and if the children stop believing, then the Guardians are helpless. Into the mix at the beginning of the movie comes Jack Frost. We don't know where he comes from. He just rises out of a frozen pond as the movie starts; a boy without a past called - to something. He finds his purpose (and his past) when the Boogey Man shows up to wreak havoc and to destroy the belief of the world's children, and we end up with a titanic battle between Jack Frost and the Boogey Man to climax the movie, with the other Guardians and the world's children playing supporting roles in the battle.<br/><br/>It was OK. In addition to the good messages there were the requisite ""cutesy"" moments - most revolving around Santa's somewhat gnome-like elves, but also around the Easter Bunny when he's reduced to a mere baby. Jack's past (when it's finally revealed) is also rather sad and at the same time, strangely, happy. This didn't really captivate me, and it won't qualify as a classic to me. (5/10)"
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","5","5","14","24 November 2012"," Lots of Explaining to do
","The true meaning and/or reasons behind every holiday are one thing, but those mythological mascots we've become accustomed to are all that matters in RISE OF THE GUARDIANS. Thanks to the Man on the Moon (God with a face), the Guardians were given the chance to bring happiness to children – protecting them from that terrible thing called Fear. But we're skipping ahead. First let's introduce the characters at hand...<br/><br/>Santa Claus we all know; but you've never seen him like this. Big, boisterous and tattooed, this Russian Chris Kringle seems like a tavern bouncer and he's the leader of the pack, mainly because of his strength and girth, but he's got the vehicle to get everyone around. The reindeer-driven sled is something of a bionic jalopy with a hyper-drive option.<br/><br/>The Easter Bunny, more of a jackrabbit on steroids... with an Australian accent and the bravado of an intrepid mercenary... has a lot more guts than brains and thinks too highly of his Egg-painted holiday, which everyone knows – including himself, deep down – pales to a White Christmas.<br/><br/>There's the Tooth Fairy, a pointy nosed Tinkerbell dressed like a lizard imitating a colorful bird, with plenty of tiny fairy soldiers, who not only collect teeth in exchange for money but those teeth hold every child's inner thoughts and dreams, or something weird like that.<br/><br/>Then the Sandman: a cute fat little guy whose small size is made up for in strength and purpose: He's the one who puts kids to sleep with sweet dreams... But not all dreams are sweet...<br/><br/>Enter the villain, Pitch, a tall shadowy dude wielding literal Night Mares (ominous black horses) to scare the wits out of children worldwide. He wants to rule the world for no other reason than the story needing a formidable antagonist to get the group together.<br/><br/>And now for the main character, and how the story begins...<br/><br/>A teenager (resembling Peter Pan with white hair), floating up through a dark freezing lake, rises onto the surface and realizes his frolicking power is to turn everything into ice and snow. His name is Jack Frost and no one can see him, nor do they believe in him (let's just say kids take the weather for granite).<br/><br/>But Jack is the key here and the only hope to save the world. His backstory is something we wait for, providing him an edge over the others: he becomes the hero going up against the Nightmare Machine practically on his own... At least for a little while.<br/><br/>The main problem with RISE OF THE GUARDIANS is how long it takes for what turns out a very simple battle – the Guardians verses Pitch – to occur. There's so much expository dialog about the characters and their purpose for each holiday and/or ritual thereof, kids in the audience might need their own Cliff's Notes to understand exactly what's going on.<br/><br/>It takes a few action sequences, like the sled taking off from the North Pole in a freestyle toboggan slope, to make up for over-explaining the basic theme: children needing ""imaginary"" heroes to fight their fears, without which there's little hope.<br/><br/>If anything, the actual RISE itself isn't all that important. It takes too long to happen and can be downright tedious, especially with a villain lacking substantial purpose or motivation.<br/><br/>The inevitable fight against that dark foe is what really matters, but make sure your kids are prepared because the depiction of nightmares possibly taking over the world may cause real ones.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","I heard when this one bombed it nearly took dream works with it. It's not that bad. It's quite enjoyable. I assume it was just bad timing when it was released. It was up against the likes Brave and Wreck It Ralph that year. Which are all time classics in my house. Give it a go. My kids 6 and 9 were hooked all the way through. It's not a classic. But it's more fun than The Good Dinosaur. Even though the film features Santa, it's not specifically a Christmas movie. At times it kind of feels like you're watching cut scenes from a kids computer game. But another good solid kids film from the company. I've seen people saying it's the best film ever. That seems a bit extreme. I suppose it all depends on your taste."
"pennyelenabooks","4","2","4","30 July 2015"," Good enough
","After Pitch threatens to smash every hope and dream from the children, the moon names as a new guardian Jack Frost despite the dismay of the four other guardians. A movie with Santa Clause and easter bunny as super heroes couldn't be anything like the previous ones, even though it manly focuses on Jack Frost. To be honest, I found that at some points the movie got confusing, but it quickly recovered, with enough action to keep the interest high till the end. The constance reminder of the importance of the kids was a little off for me, but, as it is a children movie, I guess it was appropriate. So I give the rise of the guardians a 4 out of 10."

","Now this is not the kind of film you see everyday.

","Yes folks, this is the future outlook of our youth... Santa Claus is a heavily tattooed muscleman and his army of Yetis, not elves, make the toys. The Easter Bunny is Australian, pretty handy with a boomerang and can create magic burrows to everywhere. The Sandman and The Tooth Fairy are similarly different to what legend tells us. But our main character Jack Frost... well, he's something else. Here we have a boyband reject who likes to create slides and snowball fights for kids... what he calls 'fun' others would describe as 'irresponsible'. There's a problem though... No-one believes in him, so no-one can see him. AND he has a tortured past that he isn't aware of himself. You just knew they'd slip some teenage angst in there somewhere.<br/><br/>The bad guy is the Boogeyman, and I actually found myself sympathising with his plight. I mean, who wouldn't want to rebel against a elite group made up of good-two-shoes, lead by a man who lives in the moon? And give me dreams about dark stallions rather than frolicking unicorns anyday. As you can tell, there's a very fertile imagination on display here, and nearly every scene is packed full of detail making the movie a visual treat. The thing is though, at least for this jaded viewer, the proceedings were too soppy by half and all this stuff about 'the magic of children' and 'having faith in what you can't see' didn't sit right with my breakfast. And it could have been a bit funnier, too.<br/><br/>Still, it was a decent enough effort to make it worth watching at least once.

The wits, Santa;s jokes, Sandman's sheen & everything makes this movie look even more appealing. Not being a kid anymore, I still loved this than Brave or ParaNorman. Although the story is not new here, the animation is innovative & when music clings your ears like bamm! then whoa, it stays with you for sometime. All the lights, colors & sweet little wonderment involved makes you go gaga over it. A little emotional towards the end, funny through the middle & suspense at the beginning is what this is all about. A must watch for the deep excavation of the childhood fantasies'/delusions' innards & their habitats! Truly magnificent!<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Every animation lover should go watch this in 3D because it is DreamWorks & hell, aren't they genius?<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

With the Tooth Fairy already fading, the guardians, along with a human  boy (Dakota Goyo), paint eggs in a vain attempt to keep the Easter  Bunny from evaporating from children's imagination.

Anyway, I loved this take on the holiday characters with Santa (or North as he's referred here) is depicted as Russian and the Easter Bunny is Austrailian with an attitude (he's the only one I recognized by voice as Hugh Jackman was so familiar to me). And the way the Jack Frost character was initially reluctant before eventually agreeing to join was well handled. Nice mixture of laughs, scariness, and sentiment throughout and me and my friend both highly enjoyed it. So on that note, yes, that's a recommendation of Rise of the Guardians. P.S. It's now a few hours later and I just found out the final score was 23-13, Atlanta."

"rgkarim","8","2","4","21 November 2012"," Dare to Believe?
","When you hear the name DreamWorks, most likely you think animated fun? With films like Madagascar, How to Train your Dragon, and Shrek, the animation squad seems to have plenty of life in their studios to continue pumping these CGI hits out. This week, DreamWorks dived into the world of mythological gift givers in their film Rise Of The Guardians. When this trailer premiered about a year ago, I was happy with the promise this film offered. However, as we've seen happen plenty of times, I always have the worry that the trailer designers have fooled me once again. What's my verdict on their latest movie? Please read on to find out. <br/><br/>Rise of The Guardians focuses on the big four protectors of children: Santa Clause aka North (Alec Baldwin), Sandman, Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), and the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman). These four are in charge of bringing happiness to the world in their own way, though most of the attempts through bribery in some shape or form. Yet when the happiness of children is threatened by the Boogie Man, now named Pitch Black (Jude Law), the four must call on another to help them face their challenge. This new contender is Jack Frost (Chris Pine) a spirit in charge of snow days who has a case of amnesia. What will this spirit who has a big case of ADHD be able to contribute, and what will he gain as a reward for his services? I can't tell you that.<br/><br/>What I can tell you though are some of the qualities about this movie that made it a fun afternoon. The biggest compliment I have for the film is the animation. Once again DreamWorks staff has done their homework, finding ways to capture the movement of humans, animals, and mythological in a way that is fluid and smooth. Whether they are sliding down tunnels, flying magic sleighs, or fighting off the dark sands of Pitch, the characters don't lag, glitch, or fail to impress this reviewer. However, the characters design is also well done as it mirrored the personality of each Guardian yet gave them an edge over their classic renditions. In particular Santa's Lumberjack meets biker look was a welcome change, alongside the colorful display of feathers and scales that made up the Tooth Fairy. This edgy style was a welcome change and should be entertaining to both kids and adults alike. Yet what's an animated movie without good voice work to help add more character to this cast. Baldwin might have taken my vote for the best voice work, using his talents to give North a variety of emotions. At times he was cheerful and upbeat making some funny jokes and raising the audience spirits, while other times he dropped to a more serious and hard tone used to express the direness of the situation. The others of course did a great job with Fisher's bubbly air syncing with the Tooth Fairy, while Law's charming English voice darkened the already nightmare infused Pitch. As for Sandy, well despite lacking any real dialog, the little guy has a lot pizazz to his character. Of all the guardians he might be my favorite character. <br/><br/>Aside from the animation though, there were some other things about this movie worth mentioning. The story, although fairly simple, is very entertaining and cute to both kids and adults. There are a few twists in the movie that keep it fun, mostly pertaining to Jack, but for the most part the story is linear and easy to follow, which is good for a kid's movie. While it lacks the jokes that Shrek has, Rise of The Guardians has other qualities that make up for it. The magic for instance is brilliantly brought to life in an array of flashy colors, bright lights, and clever shapes that are sure to wow the audience. Rather than just showing off though, the magic was integrated into both bringing happiness and fighting off Pitch's dark sands. Although somewhat limited, the action in this film was still enjoyable and suspenseful. North's blade wielding, Bunny's boomerang throwing, and Sandman's manipulation magic, will surely have you laughing, smiling, or at least a little applause from the well edited scenes. Action aside though, there are numerous points in the movie where the inner child from within is awaken once again. Rise of the Guardians strongest emotion is the power to believe, something that many have lost as they grew up. Those who long ago forgot the feelings of excitement wonder, and believing in magic may find themselves once again feeling the spirit reviving in them. There were a couple of times I felt my heart melt at the speeches the guardians gave. Yet if you never really got into the believing spirit, your heart might melt at some of the cuter aspects of this movie. The tooth fairies helpers and elves in particular are sure to make some squeal in delight, or at least say awwwwww.<br/><br/>Rise Of The Guardians is another successful chapter in the DreamWorks animation studio book. With a nice balance of action, some fun comedic lines, great voice work, and some decent character development, this movie has just about everything for most fans. My only suggestions are to add some more action in the next installment, and continue to develop the other characters as well; whose pasts still remain a mystery. Even if you're not a fan of the story, or have never gotten into the holiday thing, at least go see it for the fantastic animation the team has put together. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I say yes. Is it worth a 3-D, I can't say, but the 2-D showing was pretty good. Should you decide not to go the theater though, definitely check this film out on Netflix. Animation/Adventure/Family: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7-7.5"
"IssyFishyy","7","0","0","2 July 2020"," An underrated movie and my personal pick for favorite animated film
","'Rise of the Guardians' may seem like another animated kiddie flick but for me, it's more than what meets the eye, this movie tackles themes such as overcoming your fears, keeping your faith and childhood innocence.<br/><br/>Firstly, i would like to praise the fantastic score by Alexandre Desplat (who is also the one who composed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows score which was amazing as well), and the theme song is undoubtedly the best part of this movie.<br/><br/>The story follows our protagonist, Jack Frost who is invisible to the outside world because no one knows nor believes in him, and somehow gets chosen as a Guardian by Man in the Moon (who is supposedly the creator of everything).<br/><br/>The voice acting was nonetheless adequately acted, though the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and Tooth Fairy (Isla FIsher) particularly stand out as they both capture the personalities of each character well, such as the Easter Bunny being the tough and masculine rabbit and the Tooth Fairy being the sweet and motherly kind. Chris Pine as Jack Frost was melodramatic at times (such as his scream when Sandy dies, it did sound pretty forced), though he does get better later in the film.<br/><br/>However, this film is obviously nowhere near perfection as it does have some flaws and plot holes like how Jack is the only one without his memories, and in the end, director Peter Ramsey also seemed to get lazy since he just brought back Sandman which made his death less impactful, and how underwhelming it was when Sandy was brought back. It also does suffer from a few cliches such as the typical villain speech and the classic 'betrayed by henchmen' cliche.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good time and just a nice film to watch while relaxing, then perhaps Rise of the Guardians is a great pick, but in the end, this is still a decent film with flaws which leaves to my rating of 7/10."

","I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.<br/><br/>Going into it I had fears of it being one of the many hollow and rushed animated movies that often go to theaters.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Rise of the Guardians, was clearly a beloved work that the creators put time and thought into. They appeared to truly care that they were creating a nice piece of art, and through that attention to detail, they did!<br/><br/>The writing and story is great; the dialogue also surprisingly complex. They do a good job at weaving in quality messages for younger audiences across a variety of themes from things more practical like self-worth, to more fantastical and fun things for kids like belief(in Santa etc). It's very tastefully done and they even add some original amendments to some common North American childhood story traditions that my girlfriend and I loved.<br/><br/>The animation looks pretty disappointing at the start of the movie(but this was 2012 to be fair), but it clearly becomes of better and more notable quality as the film goes on, with the exception of a scene or two that appeared to return to this lower budget animation(perhaps last minute additions to the film that they didn't have time to polish). There are many fantastically animated sequences that are very eye catching and pleasing to watch owing to the well choreographed movements on screen and attention to visual detail. The individual characters are well designed and bring their own unique visual and functional aspects to the movie.<br/><br/>The voice acting fits in par with the rest of the film. Very glad they pulled together a great cast to do justice to the other fine qualities of this movie.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is probably that some of the smaller plot arcs that take place building up to the main climax, are a bit lack luster and less exciting to me in their nature, but they still managed to create fairly entertaining portions of the movies out of them nonetheless.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to adults looking to watch a wholesome animation, and would highly recommend it for any younger viewers or families in general.<br/><br/>This movie is a very strong 7. I'd give it a 7.5/10 if I could."

"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","4 January 2019"," Fantastic characters, so-and-so storytelling
","I adore these stories where all myths are true at the same time, inhabiting the same world and mythos. In this particular instance, all your childhood stories are real, from Santa Claus to Tooth Fairy, from Easter Bunny to our protagonist, Jack Frost. Unfortunately, the darker sides of our childhood stories are also real.<br/><br/>I also like that they didn't make these characters be in any way generic. Santa is still very recognizably Santa, but he has a Russian accent, swings around swords and has the words Naughty and Nice tattooed on his forearms. I mean, kudos for originality. The same applies to all the characters, with the possible exception of Jack Frost, but he is the audience surrogate in any case so it makes sense not to make him too exotic.<br/><br/>The animation is also fluid, looks suitably festive, keeping with the theme of holidays, and has a great sense of movement and energy. It has aged perhaps a little bit since then, but not by much and the overall design is such that it can withstand time.<br/><br/>What keeps the film from being a truly great holiday classic is the fact that the story is a jumbled mess. The beginning and the introduction to the idea is done well enough, but then the film cannot keep it together. We have no idea who the villain is, no idea what he is doing to reduce the power of the eponymous Guardians, what it even means when he captures one of the good guys, and so on. Things happen on the screen, but they have no reason or rhythm behind them. Perhaps the original novel, The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce, explains it better, but if it does, the movie totally fails in conveying that to its viewers.<br/><br/>Still, it's an enjoyable movie. Aggravatingly vague in its world-building, but enjoyable nonetheless."

","First of all, the animation in this film is stunning. The animators of this film worked really hard to make everything in this film to look realistic and it worked. All the voice actors were perfectly cast for their respected roles. The main standouts though for me were Chirs Pine and Jude Law. They both brought so much depth to their characters in a great way. Chris Pine made Jack Frost seem vulnerable at some points and a strong-willed character the next. While Jude Law made an already terrifying character even more terrifying. The cinematography in this film was stunning in each and every shot. They used the lighting in this film to help show each of the different areas and how they contrast each other. The music in this film, scored by Alexandre Desplat, was spectacular. Every song in this film was well fit for each situation that you see the characters in. Mainly during the climax do you get to hear how amazing the music is in this film. Finally, the pacing in this film is surprisingly great. Like none of the scenes felt to drag out or cut too short. Everything in this film was well paced from people just talking to the action shots in this film. On that note don't do walking into this movie thinking it'll be a massively funny movie when there are a few jokes here and there but it's mainly an action movie with heart to it. In the end Rise of the Guardians is a well-paced animated action movie that you should definitely check out."

","There's no denying that ""The Avengers"" really made a huge splash in pop culture back in 2012. With the film setting a massive box office record, it basically paved the way for epic crossover movies in Hollywood, both good and bad. Near the end of 2012, we got animated movie in veins to Avengers known as ""Rise of the Guardians"". Based on books written by Oscar winner William Joyce, it teams up childhood icons like Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy and Sandman to have them fight against the Boogeyman. For what I got, I was pretty impressed. Granted it does have some problems, but it was still a very exciting movie that definitely had a lot of great things to it.<br/><br/>Trouble is starting to brew around the world when Pitch Black, aka the Boogeyman (Jude Law) is starting to return to spread nightmares around the world and into the minds of children everywhere. Seeing the danger, North, {Santa Claus} (Alec Baldwin) recruits the help of his fellow Guardians, Bunnymund {Easter Bunny} (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) and Sandy {Sandman}. Who are the Guardians you may ask? They are the ones that spread joy to the children of the world and protect them from dangers brought about. Realizing the dangers, the Guardians learn from the Man in the Moon that a new Guardian has been picked. The new Guardian is Jack Frost (Chris Pine), a mischievous teenaged spirit who has been creating fun winter magic without being guided by the rules. Initially Jack is reluctant to help until he realizes that his lost memories can be found if helped. Together, the Guardians must stop Pitch from spreading his nightmares around the world and worse, making the children forget the Guardians.<br/><br/>The story while good is definitely the weakest element of the movie. It is very predictable at times and doesn't have a lot of surprises, but it's still fun. I was invested in seeing the worlds of the film and loved seeing how the magic of the Guardians worked, but maybe having a little more of it would have made me really love this movie even more. The animation is outstanding. Coming from DreamWorks, this is some of the best stuff I've seen from them that's on par with the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" films. The colors were so rich and warm and everything was so vastly detailed and huge that it sucked me right in. The imagination seen in this movie is what animation was created for. I just simply adored it. As for the characters, they were also pretty fantastic. The casting of the characters is really what completely sold them for me though. Chris Pine playing the cocky Jack Frost was great, I also loved Isla Fisher's charming personality as the Tooth Fairy, and Alec Baldwin was also surprising as North doing a Russian spin on the Santa Claus character that actually really worked. Sandy was also a delight as he relied on visual acting for his performance rather than dialogue. However, Hugh Jackman as Bunnymund was the real scene stealer. He was really funny having a tough attitude and a thick Australian accent and I don't think anyone could have played it better than him. Apart from the story being a little predictable, I think my only major complaint was that it did feel a little too long. I was highly invested in the movie and excited to see where it was going, but the ending did drag on a bit and it did get me a little impatient. That's really my major complaint with this movie.<br/><br/>""Rise of the Guardians"" still was a lot of fun. Despite a rather predictable story, the animation was still outstanding and the character are definitely ones to remember. I think this is definitely a fun movie for children and parents might also have a fun time watching it. Maybe it could've been a tad better more original, but for what I got, I'm more than satisfied."

","This movie has been out for 6 years and despite hearing about it here and there, it never crossed my mind to go watch it. I honestly thought it was some lame ass attempt to make superheroes out of Santa and the Easter bunny. Boy was I wrong!<br/><br/>Every single scene is riddled with emotion and there was something every minute that left me in awe. I don't think I have seen many movies where every single character - and i mean every one- even if they are an extra that is in frame for 2 seconds - has a such an expressive, charismatic appearance. It made me feel all the feels and more! 
Messages about hope, facing your fears, magic, believing in yourself and in miracles are brought to you in a way that hits home. I'm a sucker for animated movies with a lot of heart and this one wrapped my heart in a warm cuddly blanket. There are so many moments that make you go ""awww"" and the first half of the movie is so incredible endearing and charming, while the second half gets more serious and really engaging. 
The villian here - the Boogyman - is protrayed like a real devil. Sly, charming, cunning, dark but intriguing. You even think at one point that his reasons for doing his evil are justified. He's not a 100% villian, he tries to get on your gullible good side, and that is exactly what a devil does. Outstanding character in every way!
Making Santa a big, tough Russian cuddle-tank was a daring move but it worked like a charm. His facial expressions can speak novels within a single shot.... the animation department gave full attention to the characters' emotions and they nailed it!

The characters from the movie are all linked to traditions and mythology that still lives on in the minds of children everywhere including Cambodia because they only know Santa. The action is also handled well, and the color, the designs, and the voice casting are so awesome. The choices for the character of this movie were also really interesting: Easter bunny with boomerang throwing skill, Santa Claus that can fight, The Tooth Fairy that cannot use magic, The Sandman that cannot talk, and Jack Frost that don't have his memories at the beginning. They work so well. The story even felt original duty of each character, which is hard to do but you guy can make a movie by combine their legend together that is so awesome.

","Who would dispute that Rise of the Guardians is a gorgeously made animated film, with some awesome characters, fun, adventure and some heart? If so, then you don't believe and you're part of the(ir) problem.<br/><br/>I kid. And, in reality, I didn't want to see this. The trailers didn't interest me, the idea of the ""guardians"" didn't strike me as original and I really got animated out the last couple of years. BoyI was wrong.<br/><br/>Now, it certainly had its downsides – Santa, er, ""North"" – was really a (omitted, because, well, uh, this is a children's movie) at times, and probably landed on my bottom five of all Santa's I've seen in movies. (The Easter Bunny was no spring picnic, himself, either.) The heart was there, but it was overshadowed by the adventure and graphics, which, again, were spectacular, but the story always needs to shine above cinematography. And I wanted to like the main star, Jack Frost, more, but he certainly went through the same ole motions of ""that reluctant hero"" until the very end.<br/><br/>That all said – and I wanted to get that out of the way, I really had a great time during this and did laugh a lot – especially with the elves and Sandy. Will it be an endless animated holiday classic? (Which one, you ask? Eh, pick one.) Don't think so. I certainly believe The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Polar Express trumps this movie, but that doesn't mean it stands alone away from the holidays as a highly exciting adventure.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, we see the origins of Jack Frost and how good he is. I immediately got into his story, because, somehow, I thought he was going to be the villain. I think The Santa Clause 3 warped my fragile little mind on that character. But, alas, after fast-forwarding 300 years, he's still a good and ""just wanna have fun"" kind of guy. He plays the ""where's my place"" card and is summoned to join ""The Guardians"" – a band of childhood fantasy characters whose job is less protection of children as they claim and more focused on making sure children still believe in them. I think Freddy Krueger has played this card more than once<br/><br/>Meanwhile, and the reason of Jack's calling, we have the deliciously fun Pitch, who has the hardest time trying to distinguish himself from Hades of Disney's Hercules from those who grew up on the pre-Pixar animated Disney fare. He's bent on instilling fear into children – oh, he's the Boogeyman, by the way – and casting doubt on the Guardians.<br/><br/>He's a pretty decent villain with some great truths – my kind of cinema bad guy. Despite his charisma, will confused Jack join him, or stick with the Guardians to bring joy to all the children who believe? I repeat: this is a children's movie. So draw your own conclusion.<br/><br/>2012's animated films had their highs and way lows. Rise of the Guardians is certainly in the top portion, and I am sorry I didn't see it in theatres. But, then again, I get burnt out on how many there are and usually suckered into the bottom portion cartoons.<br/><br/>This is a must-see, and if possible, on BluRay. It's absolutely stunning."

","Okay so I went to watch this movie because before this my friend had been to see it with her boyfriend and said it was really good. I have to agree with her that the film was excellent. The movie however lacks so much inside it though. Parts of the movie are so forgettably since these areas lack great parts. In an area where Jack Frost magic scepter is destroyed the slight fight makes it forgettable easy. However it may entertain younger children better. Overall I believe the animation is brilliant, much like the Lorex (another good movie)their eyes are brilliantly created to you remember how good it looks. It was beyond amazing which makes it better. However I believe that Tooth should have been toned down slightly due the the bright colours throwing her off base from other characters. However this is a good film and should be watched."

","Familiar fairytale mythologies gets a hippie makeover in RISE OF THE GUARDIANS, a holiday-themed animated feature that brilliantly incorporated superhero genre into the fairytale elements (think THE AVENGERS for the kiddies). No doubt it's a killer concept to see such beloved fairytale characters of Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Jack Frost and Sandman combined together into one movie. The result is imaginative and visually dazzling fairytale adventure that dares to be different.<br/><br/>Based on a book ""The Guardians of Childhood"" by William Joyce, the story reimagines a world where fairytale characters such as Santa Claus, named North (voice of Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny, named Bunnymund (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy, named Tooth (Isla Fisher), and the silent Sandman, named Sandy -- are all exist as the Guardians to protect the children everywhere from darkness and despair. When North is busy preparing all the gifts for the Christmas season in his workshop at the North Pole, something evil is about to happen -- a resident boogeyman named Pitch (Jude Law) is threatened to bring darkness to the world and determined to make all the children lost their beliefs on these Guardians. North quickly assembles his fellow Guardians to help defeat Pitch.<br/><br/>However, the Man in the Moon (which functions as a lunar prophecy of sorts) has suddenly reveals that a new Guardian has been chosen to join them in a battle. To their surprise, the new Guardian turns out to be a mischief maker named Jack Frost (Chris Pine), a lonely spirit who possesses a powerful staff capable to freeze everything he touches. Unlike the rest of the Guardians, Jack Frost isn't a popular fairytale figure among the children and because nobody believe in him, he is viewed as an invisible person. Fortunately, those Guardians able to see him. At first, Jack doesn't think himself as a savior. But throughout the course of getting to know the fellow Guardians better, he slowly embraces his newfound destiny and eventually agrees to help them stop Pitch's devious plan once and for all.<br/><br/>As a veteran storyboard artist who used to work with some of Hollywood's top-tier filmmakers including Francis Ford Coppola, Barry Sonnenfeld, David Fincher and Steven Spielberg, first-time director Peter Ramsey sure knows how to captivate his viewers with spectacular visual. Aided by acclaimed cinematographer Roger Deakins (who worked as a visual consultant here) and mesmerizing art direction by Max Boas, RISE OF THE GUARDIANS is undeniably a visual feast. The movie is also exceptionally fast-paced, while the action sequences are amazingly fluid and well-staged with all the swooping camera angles (the early scene involving a hair-raising sleigh ride zigzag along the road filled with vehicular traffic is among the prime example here).<br/><br/>No doubt the visual have enough ""wow"" factor to capture the viewer's interest. But deep down, the movie falls short in term of its storyline. Adapted by acclaimed playwright and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire (RABBIT HOLE), the story is perfunctory at best while the movie is surprisingly lack of genuine emotion. At times, it's easy to blame that the movie concerns more about showy entertainment akin to a theme-park attraction than anything else matters. Then there's the unconventional character designs, which are strangely off-putting and might take some time to get used of them.<br/><br/>But despite all those unappealing character designs, the movie is lucky enough to bless with strong vocal performances. Chris Pine gives an enthusiastic turn as a rebellious Jack Frost, while Alec Baldwin, whose intimidating Russian accent and playful attitude, is engaging as North. Hugh Jackman delivers a whole lot of attitude and fun to his Aussie-accented Easter Bunny and Isla Fisher is wonderful as the Tooth Fairy. But the standout here goes to Jude Law, whose silky-sinister British accent, gives his Pitch character a memorably menacing villain.<br/><br/>www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"
"tommystans","2","5","19","21 July 2013"," Not great
","I'm a fan of Dreamwork's films since I saw Shrek and think that they were great. But after Madagascar 3 and with the Shrek series coming to a close and that there is a wait for another Kung Fu Panda sequel, I think their films are going down hill and that began with this movie. <br/><br/>I understand Jack's feelings of being alone and feeling unappreciated but the acting was very bland and sound more like it's for a pretty boy rather then a whimsical character. I think Alec Baldwin as a Russian Santa was really good as he had put on some great voices for some characters, like his Fat Controller/Sir Topham Hatt voice in the 5th and 6th season of Thomas the Tank Engine in 1998 and 2002. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Hugh Jackman's acting, I find him bland and him as the easter bunny was bland and stupid as he sounds like an Australian bogan. The voice for the character should've gone to Chris Hernsworth, he has a booming voice that sound so bad ass for him. Hugh Jackman is no bad ass, not even him in Wolverine make me want to see it. The villain was bland and not even fearsome to look at and sandman's revival was never explained in the end of the film. I don't like this film and it's not worth watching."
"hansabegum12","10","2","5","20 February 2013"," Even the word amazing does not do this film justice!
","What a great film. Films these days are either terrible, bad, good or really good. Most these days are nothing special. Well this one is an exception to the rule, it is GREAT AND SPECIAL. What a wonderful and spectacular film. If ever there was a film that was magical, it would be this one. <br/><br/>The animation is above the level of every animation last year and better than most if not all i have ever seen. It is mystifying! A really excellent job done. Great characters, an absolutely lovable and tear inducing lead. He was awesome (Jack Frost). The other characters, great as well.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD: When Jaimie saw Jack for the first time, i cried. And Jacks back story is tear inducing i am telling you. <br/><br/>It had me crying like a baby in certain parts and in stitches in many. It was the perfect blend of emotional, hilarious and thrilling. PERFECT! A festive treat destined to become a classic. I will have to get it on DVD.<br/><br/>It may have not done really well at the box office but that is no indicator of how good it is. So many movies don't leave a mark at the box office but they still are some of the best movies ever made. Twilight which is TERRIBLE did well so obviously bad movies do well at the box office. Don't judge this movie by box office performance because if you do, then you are missing a real treat. Take my word and those of the bulk of reviewers here and go watch it, it is amazing, well beyond that even."

","Lacking in a good story, the fun you get from seeing this flick is the fast pace action and the fun effects when light (Sandy) takes on darkness (Pitch). The movie's fast pace is filled with some fun dialogues, but the story does lack in the area of suspense, so at any time there is always a telling of how it was going to end. The voice acting is not bad also, Alec Baldwin pulled off a nice Russian accent in his role as Santa.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians is a movie filled with so much excitement all arousing from a good screenplay and the action scenes are the best, the special effects used to depict both Pitch and Sandy is exceptional, and stands out all through the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a short film named The Man in the Moon a CG animated short film done in 2005 by Aimesworth Amusements a computer animation company. The short film was based on a book series called The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce (art designer for Toy Story (1995) and A Bug's Life (1998)). The short film was the foundation and basis of this film Rise of the Guardians. Dreamworks bought the right to the film from Aimesworth in 2008 and William Joyce was on board as an executive producer.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians is a 2012 3D computer animated fantasy adventure film, which was set 200 years after the books stories. The movie's plot is about the Guardians which were North or Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Bunnymund or the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), and the Sandman. The Guardians were facing an evil spirit known as Pitch (Jude Law) who wanted to take over the world by coating it with fear.<br/><br/>The Guardians then had to join forces to take on their common enemy who wanted to wipe them off the board by making children stop believing in them, to do this he clouded their minds with fear. The Guardians then enlisted Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to help stop Pitch. Frost is 300 years old in the business of being frost and he seemed to be the only spirit that seemed to be able to match Pitch.<br/><br/>The movie is more like an introductory story to who Jack Frost was before he became Jack Frost, and what his driving force is.<br/><br/>There are possibilities of a sequel which could be a journey showing us the genesis of each of the other Guardians, but the making of such depends heavily on the box office performance of this one. The movie is fun to watch and is a good one to go see with your family.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"tad-cornell-com","1","7","33","12 April 2013"," A disappointing film SPOILERS
","The movie has many things that I really didn't like. Many of the voice acting did not fit the characters and the plot was silly. The mystical beings in the film strayed far, far from the mystical beings in pop culture. In this film there was a violent Santa Claus, a bird tooth fairy, an Easter Bunny that was just terrible over all, and a Sand man that looked more fit to play the sun. The defeating of the villain was also very disappointing. The villain was defeated in a matter of seconds and immanently after there were random sand dinosaurs wandering all over the place. It's just a mess. It ends with Jack Frost saying that the moon told him he was a guardian and so whenever the moon tells you something, you should listen. This makes absolutely no sense. To be fair, I did walk in and only see the last ten minutes of the movie, but from just those ten minutes I could see this was a nightmare. It is a kids movie, this does not excuse the poor quality of the film."
"estreet-eva","4","3","11","1 April 2013"," Tired characters run around
","Had ""The Santa Clause 3"" not recently employed Jack Frost as the antagonist, ""Guardians"" might feel quite as tired as it does. Unfortunately, Martin Short's uncomfortably creepy (seriously little girl, don't go into the snow globe room alone with him!) but admittedly memorable turn does make it tough for this film to feature him not as the heavy. Instead Jack must battle what looks like the minority version of Rene Auberjonious' character in ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" who is trying to make a comeback in a word where kids really are frightened of anything anymore (as noted in ""Monsters, Inc.). Jack's costars aren't much help in building a sense of relatedness. Alec Baldwin sticks a thick Russian accent on Santa Clause. Not to offend our Euroasian, formerly Soviet, brethren but Russia isn't exactly known for being giving and certainly not for being jolly. Hugh Jackman lays the Australian accent on the Easter Bunny equally as thick and between that and his animated twitchiness one wonders how any kid ever sat on his lap. To round out the team, there is a Tooth Fairy drawn in that nebulous region explored by ""30 Rock"" between being too realistic and too unrealistic so that the effect just comes out hard to look at. There's also the Sandman who speaks in icons and has putting people to sleep as his one easily replicated (see ""The Whitney Show"") superpower. All of the shopworn characters spend the moving running around in quick cut Technicolor trying to restore the dreams of children or some such other plot cribbed from Rankin Bass. In short, wait for Christmas and then watch ""The Year without Santa Clause"" instead (the Cold Miser could kick Jack's frosty ass)."
"judywalker2","7","2","6","23 November 2012"," Nice animation but not the best story
","I saw this movie with my daughters and grandchildren and I really liked the animation but the story was a little silly. A movie like this definitely depends on its animation and like I already stated they did a really great job with that. But it also depends on its story and it was an imaginative take on some of Holiday's Mythical characters ie the tooth fairy, Easter bunny, Santa and Jack Frost (who by the way doesn't have a Holiday)and kind of a Avengers light premise. These type of story's also depend a lot on there villain and though Judd Law's voice is great and the Booeyman aka Pitch starts off interesting in the end they didn't really darken his ending as much as they could have."
"dfa120374","6","1","2","24 September 2014"," Another Enjoyable DreamWorks Animation
","The Sandman, The Tooth Fairy, The Easter Bunny, Santa Claus and Jack Frost. All must join forces to stop the dreaded Boogie Man from taking over children's dreams and causing them endless nightmares.<br/><br/>Now, as with a lot of DreamWorks animated movies, the animation in Rise Of The Guardians is absolutely superb and is really amazing to see, especially on Blu-Ray. Unfortunately, the movie itself isn't as good as the animation, BUT in saying that it's still a very decent, enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch. Also, while it's not your typical ""roll about the ground laughing"" kind of animation there are still some good funny moments, of which a good few involve Santa's elves.<br/><br/>I have to say as well that the way the movie makers have portrayed each of The Guardians was pretty impressive, from the big, tattooed, imposing figure of Santa Claus and the wise-cracking Aussie Easter Bunny, to the dark, scary & mean Boogie Man. There isn't a single character in the movie that you will feel any annoyance or dislike towards (well, apart from the obvious one of The Boogie Man). Even the big Abominable Snowmen that help Santa Claus are likable and somewhat funny.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Boogie Man, there are some scenes that may possibly scare a younger audience (ages of about 5 or 6), but in all honesty there's nothing too bad here that will give them nightmares, and they will more than likely enjoy the movie regardless of any scares they may get from watching the Boogie Man.<br/><br/>All in all, while it's not DreamWorks best feature, Rise Of The Guardians is, as I said earlier, still a very enjoyable movie to watch."
"TrueEssence","8","1","2","12 August 2013"," Best animated film I've seen in a long time
","I remember seeing the posters for this movie while I was abroad in London. There were only posters of Jack, Tooth and Bunny. I remember going ""wow, that looks pretty cool"" and I've been meaning to watch it. I finally watched it before I came back to school and oh my goodness, I have no idea why it took me so long to watch this movie. It is a beautiful, beautiful movie. Because Jack Frost is the main character, his characterization is absolutely amazing. He's always portrayed as the villain or just this spirit that brings on winter, he's never really been fleshed out like this before. Not even Martin Short's Jack Frost was this great. Having him be a late teenager was a great idea because even though he's been around for 300 years he still loves to have fun. I also think that Chris Pine was a great choice for his voice acting, being his first animated film, I thought he provided enough charm, energy and emotion to this character to make him so lovable. I'm glad they didn't pick someone younger.<br/><br/>The Big Four were also amazing. North was Russian! Santa Clause is Russian! How awesome is that?? I'm not familiar with all of the origins of these legendary figures but the ones I'm used too went right out of the window with this movie. Santa being this Russian, sword wielding spirit was brilliant. I also loved the bit with their ""centers"" what are they guardians of? That is truly the heart of the film. The Easter Bunny played by Hugh Jackman in his usual accent was great, he was second favorite character in the movie. The animation for both The Tooth Fairy and Sandman was breathtaking. Never have I seen such detail like that on one character.<br/><br/>I believe that people misjudge movies like this because it's whimsical, it's a movie for all ages because it makes you not only feel sympathy for the characters, even the villain Pitch Black (the boogeyman), played by Jude Law, but you start to reflect on what your center (purpose) is. What is that you put out into the world? These five guardians, all put something into the world and they protect what they put out within the children. As you get older, this sort of thing doesn't particularly matter anymore once you start to get extremely involved in the real world but as a child, we relish in these things, in these figures: The Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause, The Easter Bunny, The Sandman, The Boogeyman, and Jack Frost. This movie puts them out here, giving them actual reasons for being legendary other than the selfish reasons that we might come up with (we get something from them), they protect our childhood. This movie may not be perfect but it is the best animated film I have seen in a while and I adore it."

","Kids are loosing their faith in both the Easter Bunny and Santa Clause. In the meanwhile are the villain Pitch and his phantom horses from under the bed on the loose. So now it's up to Jack Frost in the form of a youthful Jack Frost and his friends to save the Holidays. Some of the other characters are a big tall Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and a pumped up Santa Clause called North. Watch this on a big screen as words can't describe what you will see. Dreamworks is back after underrated movies like Over the Hedge and Shrek the Third. But I have seen better Dreamworks movies. It's a Winter Holiday movie to watch all years long.<br/><br/>7/10"
"danielleyee","10","1","2","19 April 2013"," We want a sequel, now!
","This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched and is way up there with How to Train Your Dragon. Besides the breath-taking scenery, heart-warming moments and brilliant humour, the characters (especially Jack Frost) are extremely easy on the eyes and can absolutely appeal to everyone from the age of 0 to 300. We need a sequel, now! Unfortunately, the production company had to do a write-down of 83 million and lay off 350 workers due to the lack of admissions (viewers) and as such, the chances of a sequel are slim. It would be such a waste if such a lovely animation were to be a one-off due to this issue so I do hope more people will give this movie a try and fall in love with it, as I literally did. Head over heels. A sequel in the future is a Christmas present in itself to many around the world."
"Teddy69666","10","1","2","2 April 2013"," Makes me want to believe again
","I watched Rise of the Guardians the weekend it was released on DVD and I couldn't wait to see it. I wasn't disappointed at all. From the beginning the animations were amazing. Jack Frost was probably one of the coolest Jack Frosts' I've ever seen. All the other characters, including Pitch, were just great. The comedy involving the elves and the yetis was hilarious in my opinion, and the action sequences involving the Sandman were my favorite in the whole movie. Easter bunny and North were portrayed in a manner that I have NEVER seen before and I got to say, I didn't dislike one bit of it. So far I think I've watched the movie at least 5 days out of the 7 that I've had it. The movie had a heart moving quality to it just like Brave had and I believe I got teary eyed maybe once during the whole movie. It made me think of my childhood memories of Santa Claus and everyone and it was great to re-visit those memories again as a 20 year old. I saw a lot of negative reviews and would like to advise anyone reading them to NOT listen to them. Rent or buy the movie and I promise you, you won't regret it. Fantastic movie and I will continue to watch it. 10 stars out of 10 for me."
"FairlyAnonymous","5","1","2","30 March 2013"," Visually spectacular... but that's about it
","I can say that I really had high expectations for this movie and I was actually kind of excited for Dreamworks to do a movie that was more drama/action oriented than their usually comedies... but this isn't what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>The movie establishes the main character as Jack Frost, who is just your average... holiday? Ummm... pagan deity? Random being that no one ever believed in? It's never really established what Jack Frost is other than a dude who wants to be believed in. Since nobody believes in Jack Frost, that also means that no one can see him. However, Jack Frost is chosen by the ""Guardians"" which are apparently... a group of holiday figures and kids' stories that... protect kids... I guess. The Guardians are chosen by the moon and apparently the Man on the Moon is the almighty deity/being that decides everything... as you can see things aren't really explained in this movie too clearly. The moon never talks yet everyone talks to it which just kind of comes off as odd.<br/><br/>Either way the Boogey Man (also known as Pitch Black) is returning and is jealous that all of the Guardians get so much attention and yet he doesn't so he decides to rule over the world in a reign of fear and terror. He does this by... making kids scared and not believe in the Guardians so that then the Guardians become weak and powerless. Now this concept actually sounds pretty interesting, BUT the awkwardness and rushed manner of this movie kind of ruins it.<br/><br/>Let me clarify a bit more: As I mentioned earlier a lot of stuff happens without much explanation like who is the Man on the Moon and why does he choose Guardians and holiday figures, or why is the device used to choose Guardians is obviously the Haakskeekah ritual, how come Pitch Black's powers and abilities increase and decrease at random for the sake of making the movie fair, why do important scenes flash by quickly and unimportant 3D spectacle scenes get so much attention? Don't get me wrong, this movie had a lot of potential and it looks absolutely wonderful, but everything that makes a good movie is pretty much missing.<br/><br/>The action: I'm not going to lie, I was really disappointed by the action in this movie. The movie promised action in the commercials and maybe some intense fights but pretty much every fight in this movie is over within a minute if even that. All of the action is rushed and kind of dull. For example Sandman had a lot of potential for some cool action and yet he only uses these tiny sand whips. This didn't make much sense because Sandman is supposed to be a sort of counterpart of Pitch Black. When Pitch Black is weak then Sandman is strong... but he isn't! Also in the end of the movie *spoilers* Pitch Black has a giant army of darkness that is really impressive but then one kid touches it and a piece of the darkness turns into hope... but what about the rest of the sea of darkness? It just disappears from one shot to the next with no explanation or visual of where it went. To add to that, Pitch Black's defeat didn't make any sense. It would've been clever if the movie had explained that his Nightmare's hunt fear, but that was never established in the movie. In the movie he creates Nightmare's to scare people, not to hunt down their fears.<br/><br/>There are some other issues such as there being multiple scenes in the movie which are there just for the 3D effects. What makes it more annoying is that most of the movie's time comes from these ""spectacle"" scenes, so while I'm sure it was cool in the theaters it just doesn't really translate well onto the TV. The movie puts a strange emphasis on a group of kids who we see many times and this is one of the most annoying things about the movie is that the plot relies on us understanding some pretty cliché and generic kids. What makes it even worse is that since none of the kids are the main characters it also means that we don't get to know them other than the plot devices that they are... it's like having a main character who isn't the main character.<br/><br/>All in all Rise of the Guardians isn't a terrible movie but it is definitely a weak movie. The plot is rushed, many things aren't explained, a lot of the characters are hard to get interested in, the dialogue is so so, the action is okay, the movie focuses a lot on spectacles to progress the plot, and in the end the movie just seems like another ""holiday"" movie. The plot isn't strong and the movie isn't great yet people will still watch it and enjoy it... oh yeah and the movie has that whole ""believe"" message that all holiday movies have. If there was one thing I liked it was that in the beginning of the movie Santa Claus is listening to the Stravinsky's Firebird Suite and throughout the movie his interjections are usually the names of Russian composers."

","I have registered myself only cause I felt that I wanted to write this review for a movie that could be amongst one of the best of its kind, but it was so pity that it failed, for very specific reasons.<br/><br/>The backbone of the story was excellent, especially for the kids and Jack Frost was also, plus it had nice effects. But the goods stop there.<br/><br/>Problems: 1. The bad guy captures large part of the movie and for small kids he is frightening, more than I would tolerate for a kid. I know that he was supposed to be, but...he could be less darker and capture smaller proportion of the film.<br/><br/>2. The design of at least two of the guardians, personally to me, was bad, could not think worst. Santa Claus was very ""Russian"" and did not appear even close to kids stereotype. So was also the tooth fairy, i this case the result was totally bad. For Sandman and Easter Bunny I cannot say, as I had not expectations.<br/><br/>3. There was a sad part in the story, that I did not find the best thing the kids to see and think of during X-mas.<br/><br/>4. The movie here was like abandoned by the distributor or whoever is in charge of this. There was none multiplex chain playing it, one could see it only small peripheral independent cinemas.<br/><br/>As another reviewer said, this had so large potential, it could be some kind of avengers for kids and even better, the core idea was a brilliant diamond, however was wasted (I don't know the reason)."

"StevePulaski","6","1","2","18 December 2012"," Arguably the best Jack Frost ever portrayed on film, but...
","Perhaps my long-term interest in horror films involving Santa Claus that predicate off of the fear of the holiday season is my reason for not enjoying Rise of the Guardians as much as I believe I should've. It's a pretty movie, with lively colors, familiar characters, and beautifully created scenery, but pairing iconic figures such as the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and, more or less, Jack Frost and the Sandman, together seemed to be a creative idea that didn't gel well on screen.<br/><br/>This is largely due to the direction of the film, which takes the story with a grain of salt, not providing enough true imagination into the settings and the characters in general, and making its leads, especially the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus, into drab, cynical beings with very few characteristics that can be redeemed in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>The story concerns the spirit of winter himself, Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), who recounts his eternal life that began centuries ago after being summoned by the Man in the Moon. It then goes into the details on how Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), leader of the Guardians along with the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), and the Sandman, is at a loss to try and defeat Pitch the Bogeyman (Jude Law), and appoints Jack Frost as the new Guardian to help the four attempt to defeat the force of darkness/evil.<br/><br/>This storyline is a little less than compelling to say the least. Often times, the film is distracted by manic chase sequences that show off the colors of the film rather than its depth and characters. Rise of the Guardians is The Avengers for the little-ones, but the film seldom treats the material as anything more than a simple timewaster. Yet the film has some wonderfully animated sequences, such as the sequence where the Guardians are swerving on the sleigh, or even when they are all paired together in a little boy's room, hoping to make it out of their alive.<br/><br/>Certain little instances that punctuate the ninety-seven minute excursion are fun and lively, but the story as a whole is comprised of parts that don't fit so perfectly well. Kids may like it, although they may need to hit that five and up level before seeking this one out. It's mildly amusing and occasionally impressive visually, but it's unfortunate that the characters here are presented in such a gloomy, uninspired tone. Think about it; why must the Easter Bunny be portrayed as an Aussie warrior with a dreary outlook on life? Voiced by: Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Hugh Jackman, Isla Fisher, and Jude Law. Directed by: Peter Ramsey."

This movie is quite a departure for DreamWorks Animation due to the fact that there are no pop-culture references or crass potty humor whosoever.

","I have to say this movie is one of those that is not going to bore me if i watch it over and over again. Movies like the Avengers, Dark Knight Rises are great movies...but not as awesome as this one.<br/><br/>The concept was great! I loved how they made all the good characters mash up and fight together. Everyone was so cute and so brave. I kind of wished I was part of the guardians! HAHAHAH!!!<br/><br/>It is worth watching and I hope they have come up with a decision to make it a sequel. This is definitely my movie of the year! I swear that is how much it meant to me!! I'm telling you, there has to be another movie of this. I don't mind seeing these cute heroes in action AGAIN!!! :)"
"brianrichardswarehouse13","10","1","2","10 December 2012"," Amazing movie
","I loved this movie thoroughly. I didn't get to hear much before i saw the movie, but I was extremely impressed by what I saw. Everything was done beautifully and I have gone numerous times since my first viewing. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend this as a must see. You should go see it before it gets out of theaters, as not enough people have seen it for it to get as much as it costs in the box office yet. This movie hasn't been recognized and is a great movie for people of all ages.<br/><br/>I give it a strong 10/10. You may not have heard much about it because of all the movies released near the same time that people were waiting for, but it really is an amazing movie and a must see."
"loveroflolcats","10","1","2","9 December 2012"," I loved this movie!
","This movie was excellent. I give it 10/10 stars. The main problem is that not enough people are talking about it. Yes, it's an issue that it was released along with a lot of great and well awaited movies like Skyfall and Breaking Dawn part 2 (which is not my cup of tea), but it really is a great movie. When you first look at it, you probably think it's just some new kid movie. But it's NOT. Rise of the Guardians, not only a great story and plot, also was done to have people of all ages find something in it they can enjoy. All the characters were done in interesting and enticing ways, and the whole movie warms your heart and has you cheering on for the characters. People who think this is a child's movie are wrong. This movie really captures the hearts of almost everyone who watches it. Beautifully done, those who haven't seen it really should."
"amieeklem","8","1","2","30 November 2012"," Much better than the trailer lets on! Fast paced but also moving.
","I was not impressed with the trailers for The Guardians, so I thought the movie was nothing special. I only went to see it because a friend and her daughter invited my daughter and I. I'm happy to say, I'm very glad we went! It had everything I ask for in a family film; an interesting story, good character development, emotion, action, a mystery, some scary parts, several funny parts, and a happy ending. My daughter loved it and so did I. It was not the pinnacle for kids films, but it was really good and definitely worth catching in the theater. The animation was very good, the characters all had very distinct and charming personalities, I thought the cast was great and was actually moved to tears a couple times. If I had to compare it to other movies, I would say it's sits in between Polar Express and Toy Story, but a little scarier. NOTE: It may be disturbing or too intense for younger children. The villain's horses are quite spooky and threatening. Even I was tense a few times (okay, I'm easy to scare, I'll admit it!). I rarely right reviews, but I don't know if this movie is getting the buzz it deserves, and so I thought I'd share my thoughts, since I was so pleasantly surprised."
"anaconda-40658","3","2","8","15 December 2015"," Rise of the Bullshit.
","Rise of the Guardians (2012): Dir: Peter Ramsey / Voices: Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Hugh Jackman, Isla Fisher, Jude Law: Corrupt holiday family animated candy coated crap with a title that references the promise of goodness emerging from each holiday. It is like a holiday version of The Avengers only instead of the Hulk, Thor and Captain America we have Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny. The problem is that the super heroes are intended for action and a certain amount of violence but these holiday theme characters are faulted with unlikely qualities. We have Santa Claus brandishing swords. We have a feisty Easter Bunny with an Australian accent throwing boomerangs. We have the lady Tooth Fairy who protects the memories of teeth. Finally we have Jack Frost whom kids cannot see because they do not believe in him. The one interesting character is Frost who desires to learn where he came from. He is recruited to assist the other Guardians in battling the Boogeyman / Pitch Black. He creates nightmares and aims to make children not believe in the guardians. Director Peter Ramsey is backed with dazzling animation but the story is preposterous. The movie seems fitted for its action and violence and that seems to go against the theme of the characters. The cast would do better starring live in a better film as oppose to wasting their voices in this holiday farce. It just seems that the only guardians who should rise are the parents who should really demonstrate the good nature of these characters and not subject their children to this holiday rubbish. Score: 3 ½ / 10"
"fahadmunir7","2","2","8","4 January 2013"," Utterly Disappointing Movie, BORING as hell!
","I saw this movie hoping to see a good animation flick after so many positive reviews on IMDb. I went with 3 of my mates, we had planned to see another movie & were late to see it so we ended up seeing this movie. My bad luck that I saw this movie opening in 10 minutes so I thought this one has good reviews lets go see this one. <br/><br/>Long story short, it was a really boring snooze-fest, we came out half way through (although we were seeing it in 3D). It was really childish. The kids in the hall were enjoying it for sure. I didn't think before going in that maximum age limit to enjoy this movie is 10. From the that day onward, my friends mock me everyday that 'WHY' did you tell us watch Rise of the Guardians. It was a waste of time & money. Not a bit interesting. There was only one Action sequence in the whole movie and it was only for 5 minutes, other than a really boring movie. All the reviewers that are saying it moved me or the characters were very interesting.... blah blah.... are totally lying. <br/><br/>Please don't waste your money. Go watch something else. Even the new Nicolas cage movie was more fun than Rise of the Guardians."
"jaxbubba","5","2","8","2 December 2012"," 'Wreck It, Ralph' is better!!!!
","A really interesting concept for a movie, with an incredible ensemble of talent to provide the voices; however, this film pales in comparison to other animated films currently in the theaters. I enjoyed this film; however, 'Wreck It, Ralph' was far more superior on almost every scale imaginable (plot, humor, content, graphics, nostalgia, etc).<br/><br/>The ""Guardians"" are a group of immortals comprised of North (Santa Claus) voiced by Alec Baldwin, Bunny (The Easter Bunny) voiced by Hugh Jackman, Tooth (The Tooth Fairy) voiced by Isla Fisher, and Sandy (The Sandman) who gestures rather than speaks. Their whole existence on the planet is the protection the children of the planet; however, they can only exist if the children of the world still believe in them. Once the children no longer believe that a Guardian is real, their facade, magical powers and abilities will diminish, and start to fade away.<br/><br/>The villain of this film is Pitch Black (voiced by Jude Law). He is the keeper of nightmares. He once reigned supreme during the Dark Ages; however, the 'Guardians' have been able to keep him under control for several centuries. Pitch has been able to strengthen his powers by manipulating the dream powers of Sandy, The Sandman. His goal is to methodically zap the powers of each 'Guardian' one-by-one, by having the children of the world start to doubt their existence; while simultaneously getting his presence into their mindset thus making him a stronger force to be reckon with. Once Pitch Black destroys the 'Guardian' alliance, the children of the world will be at his mercy.<br/><br/>Perhaps the two (2) best things that this film has going it are Santa (North) and the Easter Bunny (Bunny). Both are great characters. The scenes showing North, his Yeti staff (which actually do all the work at the North Pole), and his incompetent elves (which I just adored); is simply genius. The rivalry between North and Bunny is great comedic levity, and adds much candor to the storyline and plot. Making Bunny a 6-foot tall, boomerang-throwing Australian accented entity was an interesting choice.<br/><br/>The decision of Dreamworks to release this first film during the Holiday Season is questionable at best, because this film is in no way a holiday movie. The timeframe for this film is three (3) days prior to Easter I can only assume that Dreamworks felt that having a movie poster featuring Santa on it would lure family audiences into the theater seats. So be warned, this film really has nothing to do with Christmas!!!! Again, this is not a bad film; however, it's not a great film either. I would wait, and save seeing this film for home viewing. I'd much rather pay to see 'Wreck It, Ralph' a second time than suggest that you spend your hard earned money to pay and see 'Rise of the Guardians' in theaters. Just my personal opinion.<br/><br/>See more of my Reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel"""

"kinniththekrazy","1","3","15","2 November 2014"," Wasted Opportunities and Plot Holes
","Let me preface this by saying the 4 might be a bit of an overreaction because I just got done watching the movie so emotions are running high.<br/><br/>That being said I believe the writers for this had a really good general idea for a story, and then mucked it all up. I love the main story but I felt there were so many plot holes and the dialogue was hit or miss (more hit than miss but for a big movie there shouldn't be many misses). In getting in the spirit to write a kids movies the writers clearly thought like a child when writing the characters, and as such the characters make awful decisions most of the time and ignore obvious signs of things. There was also a massively wasted opportunity towards the end that could have been used to teach a GREAT lesson but they chose a more basic and less inspiring ending in my opinion.<br/><br/>This movie had amazing execution, great animation, great voice acting, great general idea, but I just could not get past the stupidity of all the characters in their decisions, the constant plot holes, and the big wasted opportunity at the end."
"lisaofshades","10","1","3","12 April 2013"," Absolutely magnificent.
","I just finished watching and I will again and again.<br/><br/>When I read that it was made by the creators of ""How to train your dragon"" I couldn't help but to have very high expectations and this can ruin a great movie because there is a huge difference between imagination and concretization... but that movie left me in UTTER AWE. (But don't raise your expectations). You can tell a good animation by the body language, the characters are all very expressive, to a degree that I rarely have the pleasure to see <br/><br/>I'm probably spoiling things just by telling you how cool the characters are:<br/><br/>The way Jack moves is painted with emotions, you forget that it's pixels as it feels more alive than real. The way he makes frost is with poetic grace, my heart was captured with every curls, my breath was taken away. I liked how Frost isn't all goody, he's neutral and looking for who he is... he doesn't know which sides to turn to and can understand both... He understood the distressed of not being believed in and forgotten... I understand that all too well...<br/><br/>The characters are well developed. Santa has tattoos!!! My jaw dropped for how cool they were, it was against everything I was expecting and told. He even managed to make me believe in his spirit. One of his perfectionist workers made me think about myself, how dedication can backfire on you. It made me smile since my clients put me through a similar distress.<br/><br/>The tooth fairy isn't what I've expected... her colorfulness and a very subtle neurotic obsessive side, even a bit morbid because she loves absolutely everything about her job... makes what could have been an annoyingly cheerful character absolutely lovable.<br/><br/>The easter bunny is grumpy... probably because he takes his job very seriously... I never seen any importance in easter, but he explained that it's the coming of spring that brings a new beginning, a new hope... I'm feeling very dark and depressed today and nothing seems to reach me... but that movie lifted my spirit.<br/><br/>The sandman is not the kind of character that I thought I'd like, but he's very endearing. The people who made his art really gave everything they had and more. There's nothing I love more than snow, but it was breath taking. Better than fireworks and he did those too...<br/><br/>The bad guy... he really got to my heart. He was nasty but had the same motivations as the main character, just more desperate and determined about it. I would have loved for a different ending... even if it was pure perfection... the evil guy gets his but kicked as you would expect... I liked how... it was poetic... I like the double edge sword kind of things...<br/><br/>But this is what I'd like to tell to the boogie man: you don't have to hide under beds, you're a star in so many movies. We love being scared, it's exciting, we love you, we all believe in you. Everyday. We're always terrified of everything, even the most trivial things. We're scared to fail. Because of fear we can grow courage. This is your center, your purpose, not to inflict pain. That's why you didn't hurt a single fairy, not really, when you could have used them to stuff yourself a nice pillow; you only took them out of your way. You succeeded to make the whole world feel fear, against a whole team, and each members having a whole team behind them... but you out powered them all... and you did it... all alone. That took a lot of guts! In the dark ages people used your name not to teach despair to their children, but to be careful. Trusting blindly people who seem nice and wanting to give you gifts is dangerous... A lesson that must be learn to protect them from harm... so in your own way, you are a guardian. It must be so confusing for you: if you succeed to terrify children, you fail your purpose, and if they out power your fear, you succeed. A thankless job, even hated. But spoiled children grow selfish and heartless... It's easy to dream and have hope when everything is easy and handed to you. You teach children to be strong. It takes a balance of both... I guess that if you try to break that you deserve to have your ass kicked But you still have an important job to do, just like the other guardians. So take a break and enjoy a snow fight, you earned it, look how courageous you made the kids.<br/><br/>I wish the movie said that clearly, and broke completely free from the usual white vs black... the world isn't like that... they showed Pitch's struggles... subtle emotions of loneliness, hurt and despair before he tried to hide them in anger he wasn't bad by sadism, but so desperately lonely that he was ready to conquer the whole world just to be known by one person... Frost understood that but he didn't help him find a better way... I wish he could have been understood and found his place too. <br/><br/>That movie really got to me... there isn't a second of boredom, even in plain moments of silence, everything is delightful... I feel better after watching this movie, I even feel like a better person. <br/><br/>The theme is like ""How you train your dragon"" wanting to find who they are, their purpose and place in the world This movie was even more filled with wonder... I didn't think it could possibly be better, and I can't believe it, but it might actually be.<br/><br/>Thank you to everyone who brought such perfection into the world. It made it a better place to live in."
"ishouldsay","10","1","3","15 March 2013"," Believe!
","Fear is the opposite of faith, and ""Rise of the Guardians"" is a perfect example of this. We get so caught up in the what-ifs of life that are scary. We spend so much energy choosing to be afraid. I appreciate how this movie shows the concept of belief in such a revealing way. ""Rise of the Guardians"" should have been nominated for an Academy Award. The good news though, is, it won many Annie awards as well as others.<br/><br/>The voice acting was emotionally diverse, the characters were multi-dimensional, and the animation was top notch.<br/><br/>Some images could be scary for very small children, but it is a wonderful springboard for discussion with older children (and adults for that matter)."

","This movie looked fine to me at the start. When first hearing what it was about, I was in. Not totally excited, but it had some promise. However, when I saw the first trailer, it seemed too....dark and boring. I didn't understand the significance of Pitch. However, once I saw the movie, I realized he played a role in children's lives just as the Guardians did; he gives them nightmares. That was my only quarrel with the film previous to seeing it. Now onto the good stuff! The characters are great, not just their personalities, but their extremely new and creative designs. They take a children's dreamland to a whole new level, and it's wonderful to watch. I always like a good balance between fun and drama, and, while this was a little more on the drama side, it did end up being a good balance. Enough drama to keep you engaged and enough fun to keep you enjoying yourself. I would definitely recommend it!"

This film manages to stir up very many emotions and tugs at your heartstrings. Its simple and yet beautiful messages really made this a fantastic film. The animation was very stunning, very well executed. Kudos go to Dreamworks Studios for this outstanding film. If such high caliber films are to be expected from Dreamworks in the future, then all i can say is that Pixar had better look out. The lead character, Jack Frost, his journey and internal struggles, depth and personality really made him an outstanding lead. And the action packed Avengersesque scenes were marvelous. The movie had many of us in the cinema, self included, in tears at various parts and bursting with laughter at others.

"coiffuremixte","10","1","3","9 December 2012"," Jack Frost melts hearts
","From its first moments The Rise of The Guardians is clearly something special. The birth of a super-hero is exquisitely rendered; Jack Frost's introduction is a truly poignant moment. <br/><br/>This animated feature begins brilliantly and then struggles a little in trying to keep the younger audience members hooked while establishing its characters and story. In the first half there are times when the pace is somewhat frenetic although it remains constantly enjoyable, but in the second half it pulls out all the stops to confirm itself as a heartbreakingly wonderful film about faith, hope and friendship. <br/><br/>What sets Guardians apart from other movies of its genre is the depth and originality present in the story-telling and characters. The emotions are tender and everything seems personal and real; close to the bone and human.<br/><br/>Watching Guardians you realize how even the best family entertainment relies on manipulative and predictable story-telling. Guardians is a breath of fresh air, you can watch with fresh eyes like a child unpolluted by expected dramatic cues sign-posted as they arrive. It is also often like going on a roller-coaster ride, visually the 3D is used to best effect without feeling like a gimmick. The shots supervised by the great Roger Deakins are out of this world. Music by Alexandre Desplat, brilliant as ever. The animation state-of-the-art, serving the story perfectly. <br/><br/>A great movie which pays off marvelously. (grown men will cry, I did!)"
"lrishJoe78","8","1","3","9 December 2012"," Dreamworks deliver Avengers-esque tale for all the family
","The premise here is that four legendary characters - Santa Claus, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny - are a team of 'Guardians' protecting the world's children. We learn that they were brought together by the Man in the Moon, and it is he who introduces a fifth member in the form of Jack Frost to help them when the Boogeyman attacks. This is based on William Joyce's ongoing ""Guardians of Childhood"" book series, apparently inspired by his six year old daughter when she asked if Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny knew each other. The setup has a lot of obvious parallels with the Avengers, though aimed at a broader/younger audience.<br/><br/>The movie characters are clever re-imaginings of the traditional personae, with Bunny being a tough Australian more kangaroo than a rabbit and Santa (""Nicholas St. North"") a tattooed smart leader for the group. Jack is the outsider protagonist, and Pitch Black is the spurned Boogeyman, and the similarity in their motives adds an extra plot layer that works well. The voices are great too without exception, though Alec Baldwin was especially good as North.<br/><br/>The animation is brilliant, the best quality I've seen in a while, especially the sand as it morphs into different shapes, objects, and animals. This was well worth seeing on the big screen in 3D as some of the effects are really impressive; the kids actually let out a few involuntary ooohs at the snowflakes floating off the screen.<br/><br/>I can imagine this spawning a sequel or two, and I think the characters are strong enough to carry it too.<br/><br/>All in all a great family movie for Christmas, or Easter, or any time really!"

","Movies made for children, should be first of all, fun and magical, grab Your imagination and send it out to explore. And also it dose not hurt, if it teach something about the world, and whats being human about. And the way I see it Rise of The Guardian have all from the list above. It will leave You with a warm, relaxed feeling afterwards. So the perfect holiday movie for any family. I just gonna point out few things which I liked about it. <br/><br/>1) Characters, and there development: Each of them are very well written, and build up. They are different from each other. And though they are fairy tale characters, on the other hand they are very human as well. I love how they interact with each other, and react to situations they face. Also they have a natural exemplary attitude, which is not like ""You vomit sunshine. Oh we get it. Your the good guy."" type of push down a message in our truth thing. But more like very human way, they all have there little imperfection, but they put it a side when things get serious. For example, the scene where they explain Jacks ""core"" and the way he handles his frighten sister. This type of behaviors which I meant earlier with ""teach something"". <br/><br/>1/B) Great actors. Its kinda link to the first point, since its not enough if You write great characters. But they needs to be bring alive by the right person. So however cast the crew for the film made a good job with selecting the actors. And of course the actors did a good job.<br/><br/>2) Great story, very well done re-imagining the characters and the world they live in. Even if its not pure new, since there where movies before featuring Santa, saving x-mas, good vs bad, the movie has a very fresh twist on it. I love how they explain the ""core"" of what Santa is. I love what they tell about why this guardians exist, and what they do. Like why the tooth fairy collects teeth. And each headquarter look amazing. <br/><br/>3) the humor. I Liked that it was child friendly mature humor. And not ""oh he felt on his face"" ""He got a cake in his face"" ""burp"" ""fart""...etc . Not this cheap stuff. This and the great writing sets up a good chance, that the hole family will enjoy this movie. <br/><br/>So if You want to have a relaxing fairy tale go and see Rise of the Guardians. Its worth it."

The voice acting was a very sagacious risk by the producer who mixes cultures & accents; something parochial American audiences always tend to detest. ""OMG.. There's other people on this planet other than us? This is an American film.. it should keep US-only cast.. Boo Hoo""! Get over yourselves!! It works a treat in this film & they all worked rather well accept.. well, sandman! Luckily they kill this podgy Ewok Lemon off quite soon so we don't have to keep making allowances for him. He's later restored, which doesn't work really. We don't care. Never missed him in the first place! <br/><br/>Matt Smith plays a devastatingly convincing role as the Bad Guy in this I must say! Jude Law fills in for one of his horses too! <br/><br/>Now the cons! <br/><br/>The music. It fits well.. Yarrr.. like how wind fits into a good view maybe? the point I'm making is that it is bland. ALL the cues, All the instrumentation, chord combinations, & sounds used are completely STOCK. It has but ONE melody for the fleeting title card, but this isn't even vaguely captivating. And once again, it seems that all the boring combinations of tenor range performances make for a very forgettable transparent mix. There's the usual LOW drones for the Bad Guy, nice mallets & mellifluous plucks for the ice scenes, & action simply requires brass stabs & everything else just blares together to reach volume that is inevitably pushed down with compression anyway. This kind of film required something MUCH more bold & contemporary. A whimsical vocal choir of just a few female sopranos, some avant-garde string sweeps, some synth-sculpted icicles along with a foreboding distorted villain theme perhaps? The possibilities are endless! But NO. It's just another score. Yawn. Composed on a PC with VSTi no doubt. Uninspired & tame. <br/><br/>This film has a very serious back-story with a lot of emotion at it's core. It even takes it's somewhere with Jack's past life - heavy stuff that could have worked very well. He could have considered Pitch's offer & joined him for a while. And they should have had a 1 on 1 duel at the end without the silly slapstick. But I guess it was too dark? <br/><br/>The problem we have with these films is that they are far too frivolous without the contrasting seriousness to them. Pixar gets away with it because they make them memorable with poignancy & sentimentality. You can't remember something frivolous. and although it makes you laugh, it's an extremely temporary feeling. This film could have been a triumph if the parties involved allowed it to be intelligent, sophisticated, a bit more mature, & yes.. ADULT. Pan's labyrinth & Water Ship Down are rare breeds; one of a kind. Because money is the focus here. Not the film. <br/><br/>It's still an enjoyable film even if it is disposable. And I like how they added some adult content. But it really needed lifting to the next level & treated seriously to balance out the humour. <br/><br/>Close! But no cigar!"

","I liked some things about the movie but overall i am disappointed. I like animated movies but this one just failed to impress. It seems to me that the movie could have been much better. It has a good plot but the characters were a let down.<br/><br/>It has the same old concept of Good vs Evil. But it is not the bad part of the movie.<br/><br/>Santa is just weird. He fights with swords and has a some kinda European accent. Also the other characters, none of them is funny or likable.<br/><br/>Biggest problem with this movie is that it lacks funny part of animation movies. It hardly succeeds at making you just smile couple of times. If it had some good laughs it would have been a much better movie."
"avsroxbronxfan","7","1","4","27 November 2012"," Good flick, but very confusing too
","I believe Rise of the Guardians is an entertaining film and many can like it, but I would say it has its problems. Anyway, let's talk about the story. The story is a bunch of holiday characters (Santa, Easter Bunny, etc.) who actually protect the earth from harm while still doing their holiday duties. I find this kinda interesting, but weird at the same time. They get a new guardian ion the group, Jack Frost. Jack's goal is to have kids believe in him, and to find his memories. While that's going on, the boogie man, who actually is named Pitch, wants to get rid of the guardians and have kids believe in him. He's tired of the kids not thinking he's real, and wants to change that. With that being said, let's go over my pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros: -I LOVE this villain. He has a great motive, and is a huge threat. It's a fantastic setup for this guy. I would say this is the best part of the film. -It has funny moments. - It's pretty big. The film reminds me of The Avengers. In that film, a bunch of superheros team up to stop the bad guy. In this one, a bunch of holiday characters who are already teamed up stop the bad guy.<br/><br/>Cons: -It can be very confusing at times. One reason I say that is because apparently the teeth of kids contains memories or makes them believe in them or something like that. There's also one part where the Sandman actually dies, but gets revived somehow later on. He just magically returns somehow. The movie has some more confusing things in it, like the moon choosing certain guardians. Is that supposed to be a god or something? In conclusion, this is a good flick, but I don't love this film. But if you want something big and entertaining to watch, this one should be good for you."
"WatchedAllMovies","4","2","13","25 April 2013"," Lame fairy tale
","This movie reinvents several well known characters like Santa Claus, jack frost, tooth fairy, easter bunny, etc.<br/><br/>I don't like how these characters are depicted. For example, Santa should be a jolly old man, but in this movie he wields two large blades and can teleport. The easter bunny should be a cute bunny but he looks like a kangaroo with two boomerangs, and can travel by creating holes in the ground.<br/><br/>The plot is just as silly. Apparently they get weaker if fewer children believe in them.<br/><br/>I quit watching the movie half way but due to boredom, I finished watching the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a lame plot and unlovable characters."

","This film is about a young man, who can turn anything into ice, being recruited into a team of guardians to protect the world from evil.<br/><br/>In recent years, animations have elements to entertain adults even though they are aimed at children. However, ""Rise of the Guardians"" does not have any elements to entertain adults. I found the plot very boring and childish. The main characters don't look nice or cuddly, in fact the Santa Claus and the Easte bunny look unwelcoming! The plot's central idea is to make children believe, and I found it so hard to get into the film as the central plot is based on something not true. The plot drags on without jokes or emotional climax. I was thoroughly bored by ""Rise of the Guardians""."

","It comes around like clockwork every year, and 2012 is no exception. As the holiday season draws nearer, so too does the avalanche of Christmas films for the kiddies. <br/><br/>Leading the charge this year is Rise of the Guardians, a film that ambitiously teams up Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), the Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) in their fight to banish the Boogeyman (Jude Law) from the nightmares of children the world over.<br/><br/>The A-list voice acting is commendable. The entire cast clearly has fun hamming up their performance, none more so than Baldwin as a re-imagined, tough-as-nails Saint Nick. The film is visually breathtaking, making superb use of 3D and deftly showcasing just how immersive the medium can be when applied properly. <br/><br/>Plot-wise, it's certainly all been seen before. The concept of a reluctant hero has been done to death, particularly in this genre, but Frost is infused with a stubborn cynicism that at least gives his character a touch more depth than expected. The film tailors itself for all ages with an inherently non-threatening baddie, with just the right amount of villainy to ensure the target audience will antagonise him, but not lose any sleep over himÂ…quite literally.<br/><br/>With Rise Of The Guardians, DreamWorks has again stumbled in its punch-for-punch battle with rival Pixar, delivering a film devoid of the alluring enchantment of its primetime opponent, but one that furthers the company's niche of providing a forgettable but passable piece of family entertainment. <br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"being-abee","9","0","1","14 March 2013"," ""Be fearless and believe in Divine.""
","Today I watched Dreamworks Rise of the Guardians. Well, to be honest when I read(or came to know) about this movie then I imagined a similar kinda story of Legends of Guardians (The Owl's version, 2010) movie, which was a terrible flop(though It's effects were awesome). But after watching' it I seriously make myself to admit as a big fool and a fast (but false) decision maker. This movie indeed is one of the best animated movies I've seen so far. Before just come to the storyline, I'd make it sure to count this movie as my all-time favorite Disney type classical (may be!) animated feature film with mind blowing special effects but more greatly heart touching story(Here, I'll praise for ""Wreck It Ralph"" as well). As far as concerned to its story, This movie is based on An 'After Life' of a boy named Jack Frost (Who died at a young age) and becomes an (Ignorant) Guardian with some special powers and a mysterious past. When an ignorant, beasty and lofty ""Boogieman"" comes back with his evil powers to make Children's dreams a nightmare and to take his revenge from all the great four (existed) Guardians, then who'd come up as a beam of hope (with an ice stick) but Jack Frost. Basically, if I ignore it's all fantasy characters then this story tells a Moral of "" Be fearless and believe in divine."" I myself hate to watch Kiddish fantasy movies based upon senseless traditional rumors & fake stories but this movie, with such a great storyline and appreciable special effects make me wrong as a (so-called) Gentleman thinker.<br/><br/>I'll rate this movie 9/10. Which I think is digestible, though background music was just OK and screenplay was not so impressive (Mind you! That's not a Drama movie). So overall It's a must watch movie if not for all time then at least on Christmas. And Yeah, It's a bit inspired from ""Harry Potter"" series, like fight b/w Evil & Truth. But I like it and hope so would you.<br/><br/><ul><li>Abhi S.</li></ul>"

","Title Rise of the guardian Setting This takes place started in the north pole in Santa's workshop, village and Santa's sleigh. The guardians names are Sandman,Tooth fairy,Easter bunny. Plot Guardian have to protect the sandman because shadow of dark comes around his machine. Pitch was back so he went to call the guardians. And the moon was telling there was a new guardian called jack frost. He was a guardian because he saved his sister so it is his chance to save more of children. so they went to look for jack and they found him and throw him into a sack so he was with sandman, tooth fairy, easter kangaroo the easter bunny said am a bunny and the easter bunny and Santa claws. they went to look for teeth but one of the children were awake so the sandman threw a sleeping ball at him. Sandman came to get rid of his nightmare but they didn't stand a chance against Pitch and then sandman was shoot by an arrow of darkness and sandman disappeared so jack forest shoot the nightmares My favorite was when jack frost shoot all the nightmares and when Santa can feel Pitch in his bell. Recommendation you should watch this because it is surprising because it has new guardians. C.

"illbebackreviews","8","0","1","1 March 2013"," It is official now! DreamWorks has completely blown me away and has ensured that I don't give up on new animation movies
","Since the release of 'Cars 2' Pixar has really lost and seems that they will lose it in 2013 with Monsters University. Pixar being the king of animations, I had for a while given up on new animation movies but this wonderful little gem ensures that I will check out as many animation films in 2013 as possible! 2012 has being a rather brilliant year for me in movies with the releases of Django Unchained, Dark Knight Rises, 007, The Hobbit, Life of Pi, Wreck it Ralph, ParaNorman and now....Rise of the Guardians 'Rise of the Guardians' elegentally and magically tells us the story of a group of fairy tale characters such as Santa Claus, Jack Frost (being the central focus of the story) Sandman, the Tooth Fairy and the evil Pitch. As Pitch gains control and power over the world, The Moon re-unites these fairy tale characters and together they must bring down Pitch.<br/><br/>There is every right reason for me to just love this movie: The animations look amazing; just amazing! Every single shot has such beauty and is so elegant and is simply a treat to the eye. The voice acting is just superb by everyone, the way the characters were written is superb, the amount of back story and emotion given to Jack Frost is amazing! The directing in the movie is great and the pacing is superb, no scene feeling too long and no part of the movie feeling a bit tedious.<br/><br/>The story is told extremely well in just a way that makes you wish you were a kid. Dazzling visual animations, characters and story along with some hilarious moments make this truly an experience worth watching and a golden movie of 2012."

","I went to see this with my husband, my daughter and her two friends.<br/><br/>Im a big fan of these newer animated movies (brave, toy story 3 etc.) and this didn't let me down! The typical characters are freshly done, with a modern or different twist.<br/><br/>Santa is called North (Baldwin), has tattoos, an accent and doesn't seem quiet so jolly when he is holding two swords! He is the leader, and not quiet as ho- ho as you would expect for a kids movie.<br/><br/>The Easter bunny is 6 feet tall, can open portals with a tap of his foot, carries boomerangs on him at all times. Oh and he has an Australian accent (finally, a movie i get to hear Hugh Jackmans true accent in). Oh and he gets competitive with North.<br/><br/>The tooth fairy appears to be a humming bird with a strange fixation on teeth, blood and gums. I thought the back story as to why she collects teeth was well thought out.<br/><br/>Jack frost appears to be a kid, even though he was voiced by Chris pine who is 30 or something like that, it didn't detract, and it was a well done job. (the girls LOVED him ahem ahem). Deep, troubled, and self doubting, but with a good heart, its not hard to see why, My favorite was Sand man, whose power is way cool to watch.<br/><br/>Pitch the main evil bad guy in this was done by Jude Law. Very well done as well.<br/><br/>This movie has all sorts of messages; don't give up, believe in yourself, and that sometimes adults need help too.it also shows what happens between 2 people with similar feelings, and how if you don't get them under control, you can turn bad.<br/><br/>The kids were totally enamored. I was too. It didn't feel long, it was the perfect length.<br/><br/>Masterfully told, action packed and super cute moments as well. I love the yeti's!"

","It's been awhile since Disney has put out a good movie. Wreck it Ralph was funny, was cutesy, but wasn't enough to redeem Disney, who's been ruining our childhoods by greedily re-releasing movies in 3D. <br/><br/>Shrek was funny, and I enjoyed it. That's probably the one DW picture that caught my eye. So when I went to see ROTG I was a bit wary... I, however, was in for a surprise. The animation was great, beautiful, and bright. The characters were exciting new takes! Heck, Tooth Fairy's part hummingbird! My favourite was Jack though. His tale was interesting, and the fact that his story paralleled Pitch's was interesting. <br/><br/>(Here's the spoiler) I just wish that Jack showed more feeling when he learned about who his family was. He showed absolutely no grief after finding out he lost his sister and mother. <br/><br/>So yes, I enjoyed it. It's fun, exciting and entertaining. Finally, something bold to hit the Children's genre. I can't wait 'till it comes out on DVD, it's a definite add to your movie collection. <br/><br/>9/10"
"octavaluna","10","0","2","1 January 2013"," One of the best movies ever
","I wanted so see Rise of the Guardians since I saw the trailer two months before the release. Generally when you have so hight expectations about a film at the end it never reaches them. But Rise of the Guardians was magnificent since the beginning to the end. <br/><br/>The characters are endearing, the story line quite original and it's very funny (with jokes that often are aimed for adults more than children) It makes you laugh, cry, and believe in magic. <br/><br/>But the most brilliant is the visual part and the characters design. All the typical mythological characters that we ever imagined were modified to surprise even the most boring of watchers. It changes your perception forever. <br/><br/>However, the most impressive part of the movie is the quality. To see it in the cinema is an experience like any other. The colours are vivid, the textures are almost touchable, and the amount of detail.... you can see every grain of the DreamMaker's sand, every feather and every snowflake. <br/><br/>The best animated film of the decade."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","0","1","28 December 2012"," It's an absolute delight. An imaginative holiday treat I look forward to watching again.
","Happy Holidays, everybody! Well, it won't be long until Christmas day finally comes, and boy, am I excited! One of my favorite traditions this time of year is the numerous Christmas movies and specials that come out leading up to the day itself. With that in mind, one movie that I decided to lend my attention to was Dreamworks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. Does it meet the high standards of How to Train Your Dragon, or, even worse, does it prove to be just as boring and stale as Madagascar 3? I'm leaning towards the former, because this holiday treat brought me nothing but enjoyment.<br/><br/>Sort of an Avengers for childhood icons, the movie mixes together Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), The Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), and the Sandman all together as guardians, those who protect the youth of the world from fear. However, fear is about to fight back, as the menacing Boogeyman Pitch (Jude Law) wages war against the four, tired of no one acknowledging his existence. They need extra help. That comes from newly appointed guardian, the mischievous Jack Frost (Chris Pine), who resents the idea of joining their ranks, but is eventually convinced to do it, hoping he'll find answers to his past life along the way.<br/><br/>The main talking points I want to bring up will be divided into four sections.<br/><br/>1. The eclectic voice cast assembled for these characters is just wonderful. All of them give just the right amount of what their characters need, fleshing them out as authentic and fully dimensional. Pine is energetic and sincere, Baldwin is virtually unrecognizable, Jackman is tough and hilarious, Fisher is sweet and funny, and Law brings just the right amount of underlying terror. As for the Sandman, he doesn't speak, but his simple expressions do all the acting he needs. I honestly love how character driven it feels.<br/><br/>2. The way this movie looks is nothing if not breathtaking. Say what you will about the majority of Dreamworks movies, but their animation is always a highlight. The design, color palettes, and surrounding ambiance of the visited cities, and the individual worlds of the Guardians, rival some of the best production designs of any live action feature. And don't get me started on the beautiful glowing textures of the dreamsand.<br/><br/>3. The sound is also done quite well. The sound design and mix, though not that fantastic, is professionally done, as you'd expect, but now we get to the movie's best aspect. The music heard in this movie is not only Alexandre Desplat's best score of 2012 (and one of the best scores of the year), it may very well be the best score he's ever done, plain and simple. The themes, moods, and varied orchestral flavors he brings to the table is unique all in its own.<br/><br/>4. The story in this movie may not be anything that special, and it has been done better, but at least they manage to put a creative new spin on it. There is simply so much passion, so much creativity, and so much imagination in this movie, and considering it comes from the mind of William Joyce, such a thing shouldn't surprise me. I really admire the issues of lost identity, the longing of purpose, and of faith that the movie explores, the latter of which draws comparisons to aspects of Christianity. The balance between the action, humor, heart, and development may not always be smooth, but it does the job well enough, and it's beautifully paced.<br/><br/>All I know is that I'd recommend this movie to anyone in a heartbeat. While it may not be Dreamworks' best movie, it's certainly one of their finest films, and one of the best animated films of the year.<br/><br/>****1/2 / *****"

","I must say that among all the animation movies that I watched, Rise of the Guardians is probably one of the best, after Ice Age. To be honest, I never thought that the action for this movie will be so brilliant, interesting and I enjoyed throughout the whole movie. The voice actors and actresses were perfect for the different characters in the movie. I feel that this movie is not just for kids, but it's for everyone. Among all the action movies that I watched, regardless of whether it's animation or real people acting, Rise of the Guardians is the best. One thing I like about the trailer is where there's one part where they say 'When darkness falls, the guardians will rise.' And including all the soundtracks in this movie, Rise of the Guardians is not just an awesome movie, it's like an epic action movie. The soundtracks were great and amazing, it really suits the different scenes in the movie. If you have not watch Rise of the Guardians, I must say that among all the great animation movies that I watched and that I have yet to watch, Rise of the Guardians definitely should be one of those movies you shouldn't miss. It's a movie that you'll remember for a long time and you'll never regret watching it. Probably this is another animation movie that I'm hoping for a sequel in it :)"

"joben-525-633946","7","0","1","24 December 2012"," Original and exciting, this is a Fine, Festive Flick!
","Dreamworks' 'Rise of the Guardians' is the animation to watch this festive season as the special occasion stereotypes gather together in a bid to tackle dark forces that threaten humanity.<br/><br/>When villainous being Pitch (voiced by Jude Law) originated a dangerous attack on Earth and its children, guardians North (Santa, voiced by Alec Baldwin), Tooth (Tooth fairy, voiced by Isla Fisher), Bunny (Easter Bunny, voiced by Hugh Jackman) and the Sandman (no voice). However, they are told by the moon they are unable to defeat Pitch alone - he is too powerful. They are forced to join forces with the mysterious Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), a being who is known for his mischievousness and for the fact that he cannot be seen by an ordinary human being - unlike the others. As Jack attempts to discover the truth about his past, Pitch looks to gain the upper hand in his villainous scheme of poisoning children's minds with nightmares.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning and certainly on a par with almost any polished off modern day animation; it makes it a thoroughly entertaining and smooth viewing with Jack Frost scenes particularly impressive.<br/><br/>Other positives include Alec Baldwin's Santa with a Russian accent and Hugh Jackman's general accent to portray an Aussie Bunny.<br/><br/>The negatives are perhaps that it doesn't quite have the emotional punch of a film in the genre such as 'Toy Story 3' for instance.<br/><br/>Also, its humour isn't as frequent as you may perceive beforehand. Though funny, it could be a little more humorous although this may detract from the ambiance of the film which isn't too serious nor too ridiculous.<br/><br/>As I've stated in my summary - despite its flaws and ease to overlook - 'Rise of the Guardians' is a fine, festive flick!"
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","22 December 2012"," Pure family entertainment
","I was hooked from the moment I saw the trailers with crisp and colourful images, Santa with a Slavic accent and an Easter Bunny voiced by Hugh Jackman. That's a recipe for success and the movie doesn't disappoint. It's very solid film from Dreamworks Animation, losing just slightly to Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>What I liked the most are the characters. Santa is easily my favourite with his booming voice, his accent, his tattoos and he's workshop full of yetis. But the rest are equally as entertaining, each with their own quirks and personalities. Though personality-wise the character of Sandman is something of a disappointment, mostly because he has no dialogue, and the film fails to convey him through his expressions and little sand images. He has his moments, but he gets lost in the background while the rest of the character talk with each other.<br/><br/>The other slight disappointment was the villain, Pitch (Jude Law), who was just so smarmy and clichéd with his drawling speeches and megalomaniac posing. At least he avoids the worst pit fall by having a motivation for his actions against the Guardians. Granted, the motivation isn't the most exciting ever, but it works in a pinch. Still, the character just isn't unique enough to fully satisfy the viewers. Especially when the Guardians, with the exception of Sandman, are such unique versions of their fairytale origins. Santa has tattoos, Easter Bunny is a badass warrior, Tooth Fairy is a hummingbird... while the villain is just a dark man in a cape. You can see the problem here, right? <br/><br/>The protagonist, Jack Frost (Chris Pine), isn't quite on par with the rest of the Guardians as far as uniqueness goes, but he is given a lot more backstory, and he's the audience surrogate in any case. While I do think that some of that backstory was slightly clichéd and overly sentimental, I can't deny that it doesn't do its job. Jack is a good character and you sympathize with his problems and can thus understand when he falters and struggles. Plus he's just plain fun to watch.<br/><br/>On the technical side of things, this film looks amazing. The textures are amazingly detailed, the backgrounds look awesome, the locations are entertaining to observe and study, the character designs fit the characters' personalities and are equally intriguing. Everything moves with smooth grace, which makes the film very easy to follow and enjoy.<br/><br/>As a whole this is a great film from Dreamworks. It isn't their greatest movie to date, but it's up there with the best. It's a good family adventure, while being mature and wise enough to appeal to adults just as well. Entertainment in its greatest form."
"kubo600","8","0","1","17 December 2012"," One of the most breathtaking !
","There were so many movies that interest me. ""Rise of the Guardians"" did, too. Not to mention how cool those characters were, I was really attracted by The Easter Bunny. His outfit alongside remarkable voice of Hugh Jackman turned The Bunny into the special one of The Guardians, which somehow replaced a little cute rabbit brought Easter eggs for children in Thanksgiving day!<br/><br/>Jack Frost, literally, touched me by his pathetic origins. Though the storyline about someone tries to get his/her memories back is too familiar, which was not in Jack's journey. He used to be invisible, ignored and did not ring any bell of children. It, partially, happened to me when I was a child. Anyway, finally he was seen by Jamie as a result from Jack's hard try to find out what lies inside him called ""the center"". It was a meaning lesson!<br/><br/>In a word, this movie is recommended by all the audiences who was fascinated by the very different mighty Guardians. To me, it's worth enjoying Rise of the Guardians as a memorable event for the time of year- end coming."

","Rise of the Guardians (2012)<br/><br/>Voice Cast: Chris Pine, Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, Isla Fisher and Hugh Jackman <br/><br/>Synopsis: When Pitch (Jude Law) the bogeyman uses fear to make all the children of the world scared by turning dreams into nightmares, trying to make them forget about the good things in life including the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy and Sandman however these are sworn guardians and protectors of all children of the world with the help of new recruit Jack Frost (Chris Pine) will try and stop Pitch's plan. <br/><br/>Review: You'd have heard, like I had that this is an animation equivalent to 'Marvels Avengers', is that a bad thing really? There are a lot more film references throughout the movie from Bourne Identity to Crocodile Dundee purely to keep the adults entertained when they take a child to see this movie, It's a trick not needed the movie is a solid 97 minute film that will make anyone of any age remember their inner child.<br/><br/>Jude Law as the villain of the film does steal a lot of best scenes and I understand the American reasoning in this movie in using a British actor as a villain. However for me I enjoyed the re-workings of some well-known characters, Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) is a six foot tall rabbit that as a very competitive side and travels the world through underground tunnels that can be created with a tap of the foot. North (Alec Baldwin) a strong build Santa Claus with 'naughty & nice' swords and tattoo's and not only using his sleigh to travel he can create portals through snow globes, Tooth (Isla Fisher) only real stereotype as a fairy actually gets the children's teeth via an army of tooth-fairies. Sandman is actually made from his own sand and can create any shape he needs, creating the dreams all children have. <br/><br/>When Pitch plan becomes known to the Guardians, they will try to recruit a new member in Jack Frost, who's a playful spirit with a love for making snow-days, freezing water and letting children have fun but never having any responsibility or having any self-confidence, before he can become a Guardian he'll need to find the truth about how he came to be and try to find his confidence. Not a hugely original movie you'll spot most of the high and low points as they happen however a fun movie that'll leave you feeling good and keep you entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Avengers' similarities for me, and if the Guardians are the Avengers then: The 'Yeti's' are 'Shield agents', 'North Pole' is the 'Helicarrier', 'Pitch' is 'Loki', 'Nick Fury' is 'The Moon'<br/><br/>Watch this if you liked: Avengers, Toy Story, and Despicable Me<br/><br/>Verdict: Highly entertaining with a feel good factor, best animation on the cinema since Toy Story 3."

","I went to see this movie the first time because I think Chris Pine is an amazingly versatile actor, even if it was only his voice I was going to hear. I must admit that I did not get the movie at all that first viewing. But I decided to see it again and the second time I absolutely loved everything about it. The characters were warm, delightfully charming and I was able to follow the story better. The message of love, hope, and believing and having faith in the guardians and each other was precious. Jude Law was appropriately scary and yet turned out to be a rather sympathetic bad guy. Jack was both a 'bad boy' ala young Jim Kirk, and sweetly vulnerable and very much someone children and adults can identify with. Pitch and Jack Frost had a lot in common but chose clearly different paths. Anyway, for all those who like me sometimes need to see a movie a second time to 'get it' I hope you will take the time to see this movie again, especially if you didn't have a favorable impression the first time. I'm actually going to see it in 3-D tonight for my 3rd viewing. I am not a fan of 3-D for live films; it's more a distraction than an enhancement of the story experience, but I think since the movie is visually stunning that I will enjoy the 3-D in this one. I hope this movie wins lots of awards. Happy Holiday Season everyone."

","Pitch Black, the Bogeyman, is using nightmares to destroy kids' belief in the essentials of childhood, so North (aka Father Christmas) gathers together the guardians of those essentials - the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, the Sandman and a newly appointed Jack Frost- to protect them.<br/><br/>This CGI movie is aimed at children, but has a lot in it to please adults. The story is essentially a straightforward good-vs-evil affair, but the script is good and has heart. The characters are all well conceived and designed, and the voice talent is solid (Hugh Jackman's aggressively Australian Easter Bunny is the most obvious attention-getter, but all the characters are done well.<br/><br/>The animation and look of the film is terrific, and the 3D is superb - seeing this in 3D is recommended.<br/><br/>This is an excellent family film."

","Carrying on the recent ensemble novelty in films, one that saw classic action stars team up for The Expendables and its sequel and superheroes assemble for the mega-smash The Avengers, DreamWorks' Rise of the Guardians tosses together a slew of childhood memories drenched in mythos and lore and twists them into a gang off ass-kicking protectors of children – uhh, I mean butt-kicking, sorry kids.<br/><br/>Creativity is certainly abound in this animated effort and even though it doesn't always delve deeply enough into this fantasy world to be a classic worthy of wide-eyed worship, the strong voice work, punchy animation and that aforementioned creative spark combine into a intelligent diversion.<br/><br/>Going one step further than simply amassing notable beings of legend, director Peter Ramsey and writer David Lindsay-Abaire (based on the William Joyce book) transform our preconceived notions of the characters that inhabit this tale. Santa Claus is a sword-wielding Russian known as North, the Easter Bunny is laden with boomerangs and heralds from ""The Land Down Under"" and the Sandman stands as a very real entity known as Hush. Also, a member of the guardians is ""Tooth"" (of the fairy variety) and the newcomer to the troupe is the film's hero: the bratty but fun- loving Jack Frost.<br/><br/>Chosen for duty by The Man in the Moon, each guardian is picked not only to carry on his or her presumed duties (deliver presents, hide eggs, etc), but also have a role in preserving a certain facet of childhood. North, for instance, has a role ""at his core"" (as the man in red puts it) to keep wonder alive in the eyes of children. With Jack Frost called to arms against the sinister Pitch (as in ""Pitch Black,"" as in The Boogeyman), who is regaining his strength following a fall from power after the dark ages ended, he must stop the evil from spreading and find what his true role is in life.<br/><br/>Of these legendary individuals, the most fascinating is actually Tooth, a member upon first glance who seems a bit out of place when talking about a clique of war-ready mythological beings. Plus, you know, touching a bunch of teeth for a living is kind of gross. You see Tooth's role has had far more wide-reaching repercussions for the youth of the world: each tooth she collects represents a memory – a pure thought or moment that can be used later in that individual's life when they need an epiphany, grounding, humbling or, perhaps a smile — most.<br/><br/>Both hero and antagonist are also gifted with more background than you'll see in your average film (of any medium) and both are actually quite tragic in their own right, though for decidedly different reasons. The circumstances that first made Jack into the harbinger of winter is deeply sad but later compels him to become the guardian he needs to be, and for Pitch his centuries of pseudo exile for doing only what his core drives him to do. Pitch is the type of villain where it is easy to understand his motivations, even if you thoroughly disagree with them.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians is certainly one of the least funny DreamWorks products in recent memory, perhaps of all time. When Pitch isn't infiltrating the dreams of kids with insidious-looking spirits, characters are being killed and intense action sequences are put on display. This is certainly not a film for young, young children. <br/><br/>This slant of maturity as it turns out is the film's biggest fault, in that its reliance on action to drive home the immensity of the threat and the continued strife in general takes us out of this fascinating universe. In the end, it offers only a little bit more than a skin-deep peak into the world of the guardians. <br/><br/>However, Rise of the Guardians is a film destined to age wonderfully, especially for those who first experience it at the proper age. Adults should find this offering more to their taste over most in the genre and the tidbits of humor and the gorgeous rendering of it all will stand only as a bonus.<br/><br/>On a final (and refreshing note), though there is absolutely sequel potential now that this team has been assembled, Rise of the Guardians is a solely isolated tale with a clear-cut beginning and end, thankfully sidestepping the curse of the (always blatant and embarrassing) open ending. Whether or not the guardians will return, DreamWorks has in a way stepped outside its comfort zone and delivered a fun and cultured Holiday-themed animated fable."

","""When you put all these childhood legends together in one film some of the tension works but when it takes the dramatic turn it turns into an OK film"" <br/><br/>Based on the William Joyce series of books this film just throws you into the universe and not tell us much about the characters. It is almost a continuation of the books than an adaptation. Jack Frost (Chris Pine) has been frost for hundreds of years and kids do not believe in him leaving him invisible. When he chosen as a a guardian along with North (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), Tooth (Isla Fisher) and the Sandman. They all must fight together when Pitch Black (Jude Law) has become fed up with being unknown like Jack so try's to put the world into pure darkness and fear.<br/><br/>The film mainly is about Jack Frost and his journey to be accepted by children and his fellow guardians when some question him being apart of the gang. Jack is an interesting character and near the end of the film after having a mystery of his past we learn about how he became who he was and I did not like the direction they took to tell his past because I did not believe it was entirely interesting. The story can be boring at times but it is backed up by some great animation images mainly in the way the design of sand either dark or light is great to see because it just moves so well on the screen. Each of the characters has their own separate design and I like the way these well known characters have been given such different personalities especially with an Australian Bunny and Russian Santa.<br/><br/>Chris Pine voices Jack Frost and he is fine. He is the centre of the film and because he does a fine job that is my overall image of the movie because the character of Jack just was not as entertaining as his fellow characters who add some light moments to this tale. Alec Baldwin choose to give Santa a Russian accent and even though it's different I just did not like where the character went because he started off interesting but near the end he just became a fighter and most of Alec's voice is just Russian noises not words. Hugh Jackman adds the comedy to the film as the Bunny with an Australian accent. He usually gets the one liners and Jackman sells them so well. Jude Law voices the villain of the film and he is OK as a British voiced villain but the character seemed just to one note to me because his start and end just did turned me off him.<br/><br/>The film overall relied on it's images to get me through this standard tale of evil versus good. The only difference is that we are looking at some of our favourite childhood legends fighting against evil. My favourite part was when Sandy was on screen but he goes away for some time only coming back near the end and during his absence I found it hard to watch this film as it mostly revolved around Jack Frost.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: D (MVP: Hugh Jackman)"

","¨It is our job to protect the children of the world. For as long as they believe in us, we will guard them with our lives.¨ Rise of the Guardians is the latest animated film brought to us by Dreamworks (the studio that created Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon) and directed by Peter Ramsey. This is Ramsey's first film as a director as he is mostly known for his work as a storyboard artist for films like Fight Club, Men in Black, and Independence Day. Rise of the Guardians is probably not up to par with other Dreamworks projects, but it still manages to be a very entertaining animated film, and one kids will enjoy. The art direction is perhaps the best part of the movie, as the story and characters lack better development. There are a lot of action scenes that the children will enjoy, and plenty of funny moments as well. Rise of the Guardians is a fun movie, it just doesn't reach the same level How to Train Your Dragon or Kung Fu Panda did. The animated film was adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from William Joyce's book. Children will really love this film because it has well known characters and the movie sort of has a Avengers look to it as these heroes assemble together to protect the Earth from a dangerous villain- Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine) is the main character of the story is a mischievous kid who can turn anything into ice with his stick. The only problem is that no one seems to know he exists. The kids all seem to love North (Alec Baldwin) aka as Santa, Tooth (Isla Fisher) aka the Tooth Fairy, Bunny (Hugh Jackman) aka the Easter Bunny, and Sandman, but they don't know of the existence of Jack Frost. These four guardians protect the children and ensure that their light always shine with amazement and dreams. Jack Frost on the other hand is always fooling around and doesn't seem to have any responsibility whatsoever, but his life will change when the evil Pitch (Jude Law) begins to threaten the children and scare them off with nightmares. The four guardians discover that they will need the help of Jack Frost in order to protect the kids from this evil nemesis. The dreams and happiness of the children around the world are at stake.<br/><br/>Rise of the Guardians is a pretty inventive film, using these beloved characters from our childhood and turning them into superheroes that not only bring joy to the children in the holidays, but also protect and guard them from the darkness. I had a fun time with this movie, but I don't think I would want to watch it again. I probably wouldn't enjoy a sequel either, but nonetheless I had a good time with this animated feature. Kids will probably enjoy this more than adults.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","Over a year ago Dreamworks make the announcement for this movie. When I saw the cast and the character that they were playing I got very excited about this. Imagine my disappointment when this movie didn't full my expectations.<br/><br/>The animation is great. All characters look really cool, especially Bunnybund, Sandman and Jack Frost hear. But I can't understand why ever since 3D gets into the theaters all 3D movies are darker than usual. If you are going to make a movie that take action during night time, why are you making it in 3D when 3D gets better with bright not dark. I will never understand why the hell filmmakers do something like that, buy they do.<br/><br/>What really happens with this movie is that even when all characters are cool including Pitch played by Jude Law, the story isn't deep enough. Almost every Pixar movies are powerful dramas on the roots, brought to us in a way that kids will like. Like ""Toy Story"", ""Wall-e"" and ""Up"". Even ""How to Train Your Dragon"", that is also from Dreamworks, work based on a intensive drama (a father that don't accept his own son as he is). But Jack Frost on this move don't have a strong issue. He can't understand WHY he is on this planet or why do people can't see him. But all the answers to that question is something like MEH, we already know it. Even worse, the reason why he is on Earth as a ""ghost"" is something he already does. A protagonist needs to change during the movie. All that Jack do is realize that he was doing it right. It's just dump.<br/><br/>Other thing that I hated is the score. I can't understand why Alexandre Desplat has been nominated to 4 Oscar. He might be a good musician, but he doesn't deliver emotion to the scenes. Action scenes need cool fast music that make the audience feel inspired. A sad emotional scene needs a melody that takes the tears out of your eyes just by listening to it. More important, every movie (especially the kids ones), need a theme song. Everybody know the theme song of Toy Story, the 60's melody of Monsters Inc. or the beautiful/Oscar nominated score created for How to Train Your Dragon. What is the theme song of Rise of the Guardians? It doesn't have one, because Desplat fails every time on doing this.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie you won't get bored. Kids will love it. I bet is better than Twilight now playing on theaters. But go without expecting something deep and powerful that will make you believe in fairy tales again, because you will go out disappointed."
"mat-mcnaughton-254-33257","6","0","4","19 November 2012"," I love this Easter Bunny a ton.
","Don't be misled, the characters in this movie aren't what you are used to. The Tooth Fairy is part hummingbird, the Easter Bunny is (awesomely) Australian, and Santa, who goes by 'North', has tattoos, swords, and a super-strong Russian accent. (Not even joking, he pronounced ""Pitch"" like ""bitch"" and it was soo off-putting.) The Sandman was adorably nonspeaking and emoted by symbols above his head. And Pitch Black (The Boogeyman) was voiced by Jude Law, but I could have sworn that it was Rufus Sewell. What I did see were characters which were /almost/ carbon copies from other movies though. The two that stuck out the most were the elves being exactly like the Minions from ""Despicable Me"" and Jack Frost acting suspiciously like Frozone from ""The Incredibles"". <br/><br/>My father thought that this trivialized the religious backgrounds of Easter and Christmas, but meh. It is a kid's movie after all, so you shouldn't be /too/ heavy-handed with such things. While this might be a change for some people, the morals of the story are very child-friendly and the theater full of kids I watched it with really seemed to like it. And they can sell it better than I ever could."
