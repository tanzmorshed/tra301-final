","The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently). One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.<br/><br/>I watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.<br/><br/>I found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.<br/><br/>I don't get how people even compare this movie to ""Aliens""; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good."

","I've been reading reviews of this movie and it seemed many people didn't like it because they thought this carbon/water based creature was unrealistic. Nothing can survive the vacuum of space, extreme cold and extreme heat, no water and food for years, etc... but there IS an organism that can do that. It's called a ""tardigrade"" - this little creature can survive lethal amounts of radiation, 1 degree above absolute zero temperature, it can turn its body into glass to survive extreme dehydration, it can survive the vacuum of space and the pressure of many hundreds of meters underwater and survive above boiling temperature.<br/><br/>Coincidentally, shortly after learning about this fascinating creature I came across the movie ""Life"", and that's probably why I love it so much. What would happen if a hostile alien with the durability of a tardigrade and a lethality of a xenomorph decided to hunt us down? I was thrilled at the prospect! Although some will fault some of the poor choices of the characters, I found them on par with the choices of ""Alien:Covenant"" characters, but I wasn't going to fault the movie because the premise intrigued me so much. I for one, found it an exciting and thrilling movie!!"
"djgoutsmart","4","504","753","23 March 2017"," Good looking movie with unbelievable plot and mediocre characters
","The Good:<br/><br/>Believable, big budget special effects. Some decent jump scares and squirm-in-your-seat horror.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>The characters were generic and boring. The acting was often spotty and not consistent with the situation (more poor direction than bad acting I think). The Martian creature came from the soil on Mars where it had to hibernate to survive, yet it could survive freezing cold, burning heat, no oxygen, space vacuum and everything else the crew could throw at it. And it pretty much ate everything (including cooling fluid). Lazy science to aid lazy plot sequences.<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>Unrealistic behavior from professional astronauts and scientists. Every scene seemed to be a result of a poor decision putting the crew at risk. Everything seemed predictable and there was little-to-no tension.<br/><br/>Unlike the brilliant Alien - where you felt the protagonist (Ripley) and crew did everything right, yet fell victim to a horrifyingly believable alien (except for Ripley and the cat of course) - the crew in Life pretty much seemed to randomly do things, forget things, then remember things, and generally make the worst of the situation, while terrorized by the ""super-alien-jellyfish"" thing. I spent most of the movie thinking ""wait... what? why?"". Mediocre film from a mediocre Director."

","Great start and I was riveted for the first 20 or so minutes...then the plot fell over from a lack of logic and slid further and further away from reality.<br/><br/>If the whole story was crap from the start, just from the filming and acting, I might have given this a 3 or even 5...but for something so promising to turn bad from just before the half way mark was extremely disappointing and frustrating.<br/><br/>As said...the beginning was nice and though there were some misplaced work ethics and contradictions, it was acceptable and we can put them down to human character flaws...<br/><br/>Some examples of what killed it for me...spoiler ahead...<br/><br/>The commander decided to not come back in to the station and instead leave the creature outside...why didn't she just push herself away...she should know that in space...a light push will keep her going forever...instead, she allowed the creature a chance to cling back onto the space station...heroic maybe, but not smart (a non-scientific-minded commander of a space station?).<br/><br/>Miranda and David found out that they can track the creature's movement. At that same time, Sho is still hiding in the sleep pod and to them, he is still missing and without comms...wouldn't the immediate normal human (team)reaction is to find and bring back the third last surviving member of the group? They trapped the creature in one area. Shouldn't, wouldn't they try to 'kill' it when it is trapped? No...doing something would be more taxing than just chatting with each other.<br/><br/>The part where Sho opened the door to the 'rescue' shuttle and air started rushing out...all three of them looked like they were hanging on for dear life not to be 'sucked' away...yet once they decide that Sho is dead and lost, the two of them can scramble away like normal zero gravity...huh?? Were they just acting out the struggle with rushing air? In the same scene...many people have died and their anger and repulsion for the creature is well known...yet, when the creature crawled from Sho to Miranda, she kept on holding him to allow it to crawl onto her...try that with a rat or a spider and we all know that it is not normal for a person repulsed by something to keep holding on like that... Instead, Sho must act the hero to rip the creature back onto himself to save her...if he had wanted to save her, he should have let go when he realised he couldn't shake the creature...<br/><br/>The creature was floating around outside the space station for quite a long time...but they decide at the end that it needed oxygen to survive (like humans? can we float around outside a space station for more than 2 minutes- even assuming we can handle the decompression like the creature can???) and in fact would hug an oxygen producer is laughable...please...before filming start...decide if the creature needs oxygen!!! (or love oxygen in fact) <br/><br/>David put the escape pod into manual mode so that he can fly himself and the creature out to deep space...and while I understand the creature is very smart and learns quickly...but so quickly that it can fly the escape pod back for a re-entry? Wow...a half degree off would either skip the pod back out to space or dive too steeply and incinerate the pod...but it did the improbable...perfect re-entry control without lessons or prior practise....frigging brilliant...<br/><br/>There were many more like these but I lost interest not much later after the commander died and the rest preferred to cry instead of dealing a serious problem...so didn't register much of the less glaring...<br/><br/>A possible Alien level movie failed by poor scripting and story...could have been a real classic...but sadly no...Hollywood's thinking that we must like space movies because the CGI is impressive needs to change...they should have a re-look at Alien, Sunshine, Moon and The Martian and understand that space can be a great movies backdrop but logic MUST still be strictly earth-bound if it involves humans...<br/><br/>Not yet offensive to the intellect but just sad and unrealistic."

","I've seen a loooot of bad reviews for this movie, the primary reason for the hate being that the plot was 'unrealistic' or 'implausible'........ uhm.........what the f**k, haters? If you want to watch a sci-fi alien monster movie that's 'realistic', go watch some NASA documentaries, don't come to the cinemas.<br/><br/>Another reason for all the bad reviews seems to be that it 'tries to imitate Alien but fails'. Well, f**k, then no one else should ever try to make another space monster movie ever! Lets just keep watching the 1979 'Alien' again and again........seriously.....<br/><br/>So, why do i think this movie is so much better than all the negative press it is getting ? Well for a change it's set on the ISS, not a fictional planet or space-ship floating around 100s of light-years away.....(implausible they say). It has people who seem to be astronauts, dealing with a growing life form, rather than space heroes shooting space guns at space monsters (unrealistic, they say). The horror, suspense and intrigue (which critics say stems for unrealistic situations) is in my opinion a near-perfect example of Murphy's law in action. Then, the acting (another prickly point for the critics) is actually very well done given the situations the characters find themselves in. Reynolds, Gylenhaal & Ferguson all deliver solid performances in an era where all the 'acting' talent is reserved for sentimental Oscar-bait movies. As for the plot? strong, fast-paced yet coherent enough for us uninitiated every-day astronauts. And a SOLID twist at the very end.<br/><br/>So, all-in-all, ignore the hate and give this movie a try \m/"
"daddyxj-1","7","82","119","12 August 2017"," Originality Vs. Execution
","When I first heard of this movie the first thing that came to mind was a list of movies that had the same similar concept of Ridley Scott's original Alien. They are... CREATURE, FORBIDDEN WORLD, GALAXY OF TERROR, CONTAMINATION, INSEMIOID, LIFEFORCE, ROOTS SEARCH, STAR CHRYSTAL, DEEPSTAR SIX, PARASITE, SPECIES, LEVETHIN, 51, EVENT HORIZON, PANDORUM, PITCH BLACK, DARK UNIVERSE, OUTLANDER, EUROPA REPORT, and let's throw in SUPERNOVA and SUNSHINE for good measure. My point is all these moves have pretty much ripped off Alien in some way or another... A crew is on a mission in a remote area (space, underwater, a city or the frontier) and they come across a creature that kills them off one by one. SO what did LIFE bring to the table that was new? What did LIFE cover that none of these other films cover? What made major stars Ryan Renolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Rebecca Ferguson want to star in a movie whose concept was done many times before? Those questions were the reason I had to see this movie and the answer is...the execution.<br/><br/>The movie's originality is in its realism of the concept. What if a situation like this REALLY happened. How would astronauts on the ISS in space deal with it. With the odds against them like a confined space, no weapons and most importantly NO Gravity. And there my friends is the catch. If I were reading the script and I discovered that this creature can maneuver in zero G's like a fish in water then yes I would be hooked. And It doesn't hurt that you have good actors to carry you along. You feel their desperation and their struggle and pain. And with clever direction from Danial Espinosa, you get a good movie that is executed well. No it's not a new concept, and yes we have seen this story before but when you execute it well it becomes original. <br/><br/>""POSSIBLE SPOILER""<br/><br/>Oh, and the alien itself was original too. This monster is pretty not menacing and ugly but approachable. Like a small cute dog you want to pet but look out, it bites...hard. The creature was made for a zero g environment which puts the victims at a disadvantage. They can't run down corridors like in Alien they have to float and push...slowly. Chills yet?<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good movie and the ending does lead itself to possibly have a squeal but I hope it doesn't because it won't capture the magic this film did with the environment it created. At times this movie reminded me of Gravity but with an alien in it. This movie goes on my list as one of the best Alien knock-offs. LIFE is not original but it is executed well."
"danieltemesvari","1","679","1101","1 April 2017"," God-awful movie that makes Prometheus look like a brilliant sci-fi movie
","This has to be the worst sci-fi movie I have ever seen (and trust me I have seen a lot). It is an insult to anyone with just half a brain. But let me give you a little taste of this gem:<br/><br/>It starts off with a capsule with a soil probe from Mars on its way to Earth that is out of control due to a crash with little meteorites. The ISS, where the probe should be processed, has to catch it manually, which they do by means of an extendable arm. Okay. I wont go into the physics off this, but if you have ever seen how much energy is set free when a car crashes into something with 100km/h relative velocity, you should know that such a catching maneuver is bound to go south (not even talking about the problem of maintaining a space station in geostationary orbit with nothing but little jet nozzles whilst trying to get it into a configuration such that it has low relative velocity with respect to a capsule that is headed straight for Earth with something like 20000km/h). Mind you, at this point we are 5 minutes into the movie and the science was already thrown out of the window.<br/><br/>Fast forward. We are in the CDC approved lab, which is a plexiglass shielded section of the ISS with nothing but a plexiglass door without any further safety precautions. Inside this section is a glove box, where they keep the probe. Turns out the probe contains life which has been idle for about 4 billion years without decaying (obviously entropy doesn't apply to aliens). Well, how about we try to wake it without further investigation? Yeah, let's do that.<br/><br/>Fast forward. It has grown to a hand-sized organism, but has fallen into a slumber again. It's still inside the glove box and attacks the biologist who tried to wake it by electrocuting it. It breaks his tool and his hand, which causes him to faint, and leads to its escape from the box by means of using the broken tool to cut open the glove of the glove box. (yeah, it only took earth's organisms like 3 billion years to learn to use tools, this thing does it in less than 12 hours). But fear not, whilst the life form is busy eating a rat, a colleague hops in the lab and pulls the biologist out. Surprise, surprise, the organism latches on him, so that the other guys have to seal him into the lab. He tries to burn the organism with an oxygen torch and with a flame thrower (which they obviously have ready to use on a space station, ofc). Welp, it doesn't help, this carbon-water-based organism is immune to fire (hey, because chemistry doesn't apply to aliens, didn't you know?). Subsequently, the organism kills him and eats him from the inside. The fire has caused the air vents to open, which somehow can only be closed one by one, and gives the organism time to flee.<br/><br/>Jup, we are not even 20 minutes into this masterpiece but the stupidity is mind-boggling. I could keep on writing about a lot more of this utterly dumb movie (like the organism being able to survive in space for prolonged times, the space station being out of fuel just at a time where it is convenient for the ""plot"", the organism drinking toxic liquid coolant, the space station going on a descent right after it has been pushed outward on an ascending course (because screw logic), etc.), but let me finish by saying that in the end of the movie this organism has figured out how to read instruments in an escape pod, how to steer said escape pod and how to safely reenter it into earth's atmosphere, all whilst fighting the astronaut in the escape pod. (Which was tried to be masked as plot twist. but you could see that one from a mile away). And although it has killed every astronaut basically on sight, it decided to leave this last one in the escape pod alive with itself latched to him. Wanna know why? Because it has anticipated that, despite it successfully completing the landing of a space ship, it won't be able to open the door of the escape pod and someone on the outside has to do it for it. Which some fisher men actually do, despite the fact that they can clearly see that inside the pod there is a bloody, heavily injured astronaut with a man-sized alien octopus attached to it.<br/><br/>I urge you to not go to watch this movie. Waste of time and money. I have suffered through it. No need for you to suffer too."
"austin0731","6","84","125","2 July 2017"," Solid alien/horror film
","Life was a solid horror/alien movie with a wonderful cast and well shot visuals. It is not a masterpiece especially considering the genre's many great entries, including the alien which seemed to be something that this film has modelled after. <br/><br/>I liked how this film in contrast to Alien seemed very plausible and realistic, focusing on the 'science' part of sci-fi. The mission in search of extra terrestrial living organisms is a very interesting topic and this film made the possibilities of this seem so much more plausible. At the same time Life also brings up an interesting idea of how little we know about the universe that we live in and how inexperienced we are. How alien life form could be so different to our expectations and hence the debate of whether we should explore and the consequences of human curiosity. <br/><br/>It carried a good amount of intensity and suspense and was gory and terrifying at times.The performances were quite good, the cast is pretty great though so there was no surprise there but it did fall flat in writing though, not that it was poor but it's a very straight forwards and rather clichéd trope that we've seen many times even though it was indeed well done."
"crazylegscain","2","350","582","25 March 2017"," Oh dear! More stupid, dumb, gullible ""professionals"" in space!
","First let me get something out of the way, I apologise for the cretins who compare this film with such masterpieces as Alien, Aliens or any of the first 4 Alien films which are vastly superior to this piece of tripe. This film should be compared to the equally disturbing and lame ""Prometheus"", but those bunch of retards, sorry ""astronauts"" in that film obviously went to the same space academy as this sorry bunch of losers. My jaw just hit the floor from the very start of this pathetic effort. Catching containers from Mars like you were fishing for Sticklebacks in a pond? Are you ****in kidding me? Then scientist guy starts playing with an ALIEN life form like he's just picked a bogey out of his nose! While wearing kitchen gloves! I don't know about you but that thing was doing some freaky sheet and these are just a few things that would of concerned me: Does it bite, stab, explode, give off gases, radiate any sort of energy, could it control your brain? Before that thing started turning into a mini transformer and going for a mooch I would of been long gone and phoning home for a ticket back. When little alien called ""Calvin"" ...... (No I'm not making this up!) Decides to grab scientists arm and act all hostile (Due to Calvin having a nap, to be rudely woken up by being ELECTROCUTED) another of the brain dead astronauts wants to go in and rescue him! Later on Calvin is crawling all over Jap guy and two fellow crew are trying to pull him towards them into their part of the station? WHY? Just so much of this awful logic defying stuff is going on that I just couldn't take anymore. I was just wishing for Calvin to finish off these goons as soon as possible and I had a chuckle to myself every time one bit the dust. I vote 2 because the ending was so satisfying. If these bunch of sad goons represent the pinnacle of human achievement, the whole species can die. I would call this film ""Prometheus 2 - squid takes out pathetic humans again"""
"Paynebyname","8","476","809","24 March 2017"," Good quality sci fi horror
","Just got back from seeing this and I have to say that I thought it was a really good film.<br/><br/>I see that RT only has it at 65% and it's being made out to be a cheap Alien clone but I think that is doing it a dis-service. I felt it was intelligently made, set characters and situations well and created a palpable sense of tension. Criticism that it's a blatant re-run of Alien are unjustified. Granted, it's about an alien life form in space but that to me is where the similarity ends.<br/><br/>Alien isn't the only scary film set in space that is allowed to be made and if Prometheus is anything to go by, Ridley has no right to be the only person allowed to make sci-fi horror films. It captured well the excitement of discovery, the wonder of space and the precariousness of facing any problems up there.<br/><br/>The effects were good, you could see what was going on, there was unease and dread and it kept me thoroughly absorbed and entertained. I don't want to elaborate anymore for fear of giving away spoilers but if you like a bit of tension with your sci-fi, it's worth checking out. Try to avoid the critic reviews if you can as I think going in a little blind will help your enjoyment."
"petra_ste","7","40","59","17 July 2017"," Goodnight Alien
","A crew of astronauts faces a first-encounter scenario with a hostile alien life-form, which picks them off one by one.<br/><br/>Sounds familiar? Let's get right to it: it's impossible to discuss this without mentioning Alien (so SPOILERS for that film as well), because Daniel Espinosa' movie borrows so heavily from Ridley Scott's classic that it becomes the proverbial elephant (er, xenomorph?) in the room.<br/><br/>Alien is a milestone of horror/science-fiction where every element – Scott's elegant direction, O'Bannon's taut script, solid performances, phenomenal creature and set design – worked together to create a masterpiece of cinematic dread. It may not be a pleasant watching experience – it's an oppressive, nightmarish film, unlike James Cameron less disturbing but breezier sequel – but it's up there in any serious Top 100 movie list.<br/><br/>How does Life fare against the 1979 titan? Well, Alien is obviously light years above it, but Life does not embarrass itself either. It's better than Prometheus, which was much more ambitious and therefore more awkward in its failure. <br/><br/>Life is... passable. The first forty minutes or so are actually excellent, with an effective build-up of tension as the scientists retrieve samples from Mars' soil and study a fast-growing organism (which they name ""Calvin"") found in it. Direction, production values, performances and characterization are all above adequate; incidentally, Ariyon Bakare's paraplegic biologist, who sees all his dreams come true before they blow up in his face, would have been a more interesting main character. Also, I would pay money to listen to Rebecca Ferguson read aloud even a History of Fourteenth Century Clavichords.<br/><br/>Then the movie degenerates to an extent. Why is that? <br/><br/>Again, Alien is the key to understand this. Less is more. We see way too much of starfish/octopus-like Calvin once its killing spree begins. When re-watching Alien, it's striking how little we see of the Xenomorph after the chest-bursting scene. I don't think its various on-screen appearances last more than a minute until the climax, and, with one exception and a deleted scene, we never see what he does to its victims. In Life, Calvin keeps bouncing around like an evil CGI rubber ball, dispatching characters in gruesome detail (also, it grows a cobra-like mug to grin at its preys, which was a really silly design choice). As a result, it's far less creepy.<br/><br/>Also less creepy is the location, although that was an inevitable problem once you go for the modern day setting, with a realistically cramped space station. Alien's colossal Nostromo was a haunted house in space, with plenty of dark rooms to explore and darker corridors for the creature to crawl in.<br/><br/>But the real horror of Alien was how it implied a Lovecraftian universe full of mysterious threats well beyond mankind's understanding (that was before Prometheus came out and started putting tags on them, thanks a lot). Here everything is neatly explained and spelled out. That's the organism which caused mass extinction on Mars, a nasty bugger which eats everything, is nearly invulnerable and as smart as the plot needs it to be.<br/><br/>Speaking of that, it's amusing in a meta kind of way how Life follows the tone of Alien's original ending (when the script was still called Star Beast), complete with Diabolus Ex Machina. Watching Life, it's clear the choice to tone down the Xenomorph's powers at the end of Alien was a smart one - unlike Calvin here, who instantly knows how every piece of machinery works, much like the genius sharks in Deep Blue Sea. It may be intelligent, but intelligence doesn't work like that; a space octopus which two hours ago was no bigger than an Escherichia Coli cannot simply glance at the cockpit of a spaceship and know how to pilot it, sorry.<br/><br/>While I can appreciate a dark twist as much as any horror fan, I appreciate it more when it feels a little less contrived and smugly ""wah-wah!"" - something more creepily ambiguous, like in Carpenter's The Thing, which remains the gold standard for this kind of endings.<br/><br/>6,5/10"

Why is she not doing the obvious? Why are the astronauts emphasising proper procedures, then five seconds later breaking their own rules? How come a former soldier is breaking the chain of command? There is nothing realistic about the behaviour of these characters. In the end, I just hated them. I do not believe that there is a demographic that likes movies like this.

"iamxuhao","1","475","830","24 March 2017"," Unbearable to watch if you still has any common sense
","It is rare for me to do a complete password reset to write a short movie review. I do hope that my little effort and many others' effort can alert the Hollywood that this world, the audience, still need a well written script that make sense.<br/><br/>This movie is a total loss and is unbearable to watch. It lacks the very basic (minimal) scientific reasoning about almost every single scene. I will list them as follows:<br/><br/>1. NASA and other space agency across the global are completely out of their mind in selecting astronauts. Every single people in the international space station (ISS) seem to be extremely emotional, unprofessional, and lack the very basic science knowledge. It is awful to hear that many of them have the ""Dr."" title. It is such a decry to the scientific professionals. These characters do not represent the people with a Phd, and the diligent people working on sending people to Mars, for real.<br/><br/>2. The ridiculous lab setting is a failure even for researching known disease on earth soil. There is a character who is from CDC in the movie. However, I wonder any CDC expert would ever consider attending a mission that is so cutting edge and full of unknown, with the knowledge that the lab is not as good as the ones they used to treat ZIKA in Africa. Those ZIKA labs(tents actually) has better breach protocols and protection than the 200 Billion ISS described in the movie. <br/><br/>3. The life form is too ridiculous. If the producer wants to make a ""Alien"" like creature, then please do not make a movie that uses the real life as story background. The life form consume water and is carbon based. Yet, it does not boil or explode in the bare space? I do not know if such creature exists, but it is definitely not carbon based. So, please get a scientific consultant before even considering make this movie.<br/><br/>I like watching super hero movies, since they just don't try to hint you to attempt making sense of the movie. It is OK to make a movie that is nonsense, as long as you do not try to deliver it as if it make sense.<br/><br/>I like watching science fictions, since they will at least follow some basic rules. Martians and Interstellar are pretty stretch on scientific mind. However, there is a way for you to at least explain the story. It is very boundary case, but it can make sense. I think this is the very basic principal for a science fiction movie that try to use real world as context.<br/><br/>The final word is that ""how did this movie end up getting the ridiculous rating?"" When I check the rating, even the rotten tomato puts it to 61%. This is too beyond my sense."

","If you want to experience what the world's most stupid space crew would do when they encounter alien life, then this is the movie for you. You will be spoiled with one idiotic decision after the other, making you wonder if the alien life-form also has telepathic powers, using it to dumb down it's prey. <br/><br/>At the start of the movie the crew is besides themselves with joy when they manage to reanimate a single alien cell that has been dead for billions of years. Even when it starts to replicate and grow very fast, none of them feels any sense of possible danger.<br/><br/>After the alien life-form attacks the scientist, there still seems to be no hurry to just shoot the lab into space. After all, it's just mankind's future that is at stake. No, the most important thing is to save the scientist. This crew would have benefited from a sociopath in their midst or a protocol obsessed captain. That would have saved them many times. <br/><br/>To make matters worse, a huge chunk of the dialogue is redundant. You see that the creature has grown, then somebody says ""Wow, it has grown"". You see the alien make a fast escape, somebody says ""Wow, it is fast"". You see the alien being smart, you hear someone say ""How smart is this thing?"". You see the alien look for air holes, you hear someone say ""It is looking for air holes"" you get the picture. Who on earth would write a script like that and not notice the stupendous redundancy? <br/><br/>The movie does have some great tense and gory moments that work well. There just is not enough of them to make it work as a good horror movie. The alien itself starts out very realistic, but looks increasingly CGI during the movie and the many close-ups don't help. It looks too surreal to be threatening. <br/><br/>All in all, it was a huge disappointment to me. With a star cast like that, you would expect more than just a very bland space thriller."
"eparazak","8","214","368","26 March 2017"," Bonechilling, frightening and unexpecting with...empty characters?
","I'm starting to notice a trend in movies throughout the beginning of the year. Ever since January, we've been getting quite a few different horror/thriller films this year. The results have been mixed to generally positive; Split and Get Out have received positive attention for instance. And now we have Life.<br/><br/>Life is about a group of six astronauts who discover a single cell on Mars. They all research it for a while, the cell grows into a life form, and they discover that the life form is very deadly, and the astronauts must work together to keep it from reaching earth.<br/><br/>I'm going to start with what I didn't like about the movie. My main issue with it has to be the characters. For the most part, they feel very dry and empty. So much so that I couldn't remember a thing about them. There were only two characters who felt like they had any sense of character. The two I'm talking about are Ariyon Bakare's character since he is a scientist and holds a lot of focus in the beginning as the main researcher. Then there's Hiroyuki Sanada's role. His reasoning for wanting to go back to earth makes him the only character I wanted to root for. Aside from that, it's hard for me to care about the movie's characters.<br/><br/>If I were to talk about the things I liked about it, I would like to start with the overall feeling of the movie. After the first act, everything begins to feel tense. There are many tense scenes that have left me feeling horrified, and that's what I believe is the main strength of the movie. If you're going into a thriller movie, you'll expect many intense moments. That's what you get throughout the movie. Something I find very impressive throughout it is that almost the entirety of the film takes place in a space vessel. It's amazing how well it plays into the movie and how well the director, actors and cameraworkers perform their duties and how the movie works so well in such a small, boxed in area. I had my doubts walking in, but what works works really well. Another thing I liked about it was how it ended. I'm not gonna go in-depth with it because that would lead into spoiler territory.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this movie was very frightening and unexpecting. It had many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, the movie's weakness would have to be the characters. But I can forgive that with its gripping and thrilling plot."

At the beginning, one of the scientist chased it in the isolation room and hit it with a blowtorch multiple times. The alien did not even slow down a bit, but directly attacked back without seemingly having any wound. Knowing that only very few materials can resist heat above a couple of hundred degrees, that seems to be very unreasonable.<br/><br/><ul><li>The communication system broke down right at the beginning. No secondary system available in the whole ISS! ! A ""radio"" cannot cost that much in the age of telecommunication so designers of ISS would not build one or more backups of this essential tool into ISS. And that notion that the communication system would need special coolant ... Does not make sense at all.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Scientist are mourning a lost crew member for seemingly a long time while having an all resistant and all powerful alien roaming in their tiny space station putting them in immediate mortal danger. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""genius"" biologist let himself to be sucked dry and endangered the entire crew and the entire Earth, by smuggling the alien on his leg. Just because he thought the alien is not evil and just trying to survive.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Whatever the crew did worked in favour of the alien. Like if an unseen hand (lame script) wanted to raise tension by always helping the alien. Trying to burn the alien in the tubes, the Soyuz capsule which was meant to push the ISS away from Earth, all pushed the station closer to Earth! Nothing happened benefiting the crew. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The female scientist sacrificed herself for nothing. It was evident that the alien can jump with quite an accuracy, so it just jumped back from her dead body to the space station as could be easily anticipated even by me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fuel just run out at the wrong time. It seemed that if the fuel would last a bit longer, the alien would suffocate. Surprisingly the entire space station lost all the fuel just before the alien died, so it could enter the space station again.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Around the end all system failures worked against the humans and for the alien. The 2 escape pods went just the wrong direction. Of course they hit the debris around the space station causing both to take the opposite course the pilots wanted. Kevin (the alien) seemingly learnt on the fly how to navigate a human space capsule safely back to Earth while subduing the scientist in it. He learnt how the control works, what would be the correct entry path, how human system work on the fly. HOW? Moreover the astronaut in the capsule did not anticipate that if the autopilot is let run, than the alien would end up back on Earth. He clicked buttons, took the controls but these were not enough the diver the capsule away from the correct entry course. Could not even go on a burn up or skim off course at least....</li></ul><br/><br/>There were lot more of these in the movie. Basically the movie had rarely anything logical in it. Even in movie Alien people were not these ""unlucky"" or movie script so lame. They fought back, they had their moments, the universe (script) did not conspire to destroy them no matter what."

Yes the plot seems to be a copy of other Sci-Fi movies that have come before, especially, well you know which one, but this movie still manages to feel fresh and ends up doing some things better then what it set out to copy.

"grobertaguilar","1","252","455","24 March 2017"," Great idea poorly executed
","Alien-esk, but that is not what pisses me off. <br/><br/>Great cinematography. Wonderful concept. Believable sets. Good actors. Horrible execution and completely contrived plot line and plot drivers. I will get to the point..... The creature escapes the lab by escaping into a fire suppression vent!! Assuming it could fit into the 1/2-1/4 inch steel tubing (capable of containing several thousand psi) it would have dead-ended into a steel or carbon fiber cylinder (again capable of containing several thousand psi). The alien would have effectively trapped itself inside a completely sealed system and unable to escape. Movie over, destroy life form at earliest convenient opportunity. <br/><br/>It would have been much more believable and sustained the plot line if the alien could have just escaped out the door when Rory went in to rescue Huge (who causes ALL the problems with his maternal instinct - he calls it ""my child"" wha WHAT?! - and love for the creature completely at the expense of the lives of his crew mates). Don't even start me on when he hides in his pants - not a party in there either. <br/><br/>I'm done.... there are just too many holes in the construction of the plot for me to even believe that such a creature could exist or enjoy the sinister nature of the creature. Any critic who likes this must have no basic eye for detail such as the solid state of matter and how complex machines such as space craft would be constructed to keep the vacuum of space out side the craft. This space ship is obviously a sieve. this terrible movie disgusts me and I want my money back.<br/><br/>Yuck"

This movie appeared to be way more stressful! I was nervous almost all the time and some moments were even disgusting. It was nice in a way, because it really catches attention and you are super curious about what will happen next. On the other hand, some moments were just too much. I felt like this movie was more about the emotions rather then having some deep sense.<br/><br/>Still, my 8 goes to unexpected moments and catching plot.

"Leofwine_draca","7","15","21","7 August 2017"," One of the only recent Hollywood films to scare me
","LIFE is the latest Hollywood sci-fi horror movie that owes a debt of inspiration to ALIEN. Once again a space crew are exposed to a malignant alien life form, with the twist that this time around the action takes place a lot closer to home - on the International Space Station, orbiting Earth. LIFE tells a familiar story in a familiar way, but I really enjoyed it, and it's one of the few films to actually get my heart going; I experienced genuine fear, for the first time in a long time, in the early sequences in which the alien is trying to escape. I put this down to the sterling job done by director Daniel Espinosa, of EASY MONEY fame.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good for a film like this, with the actors giving subdued performances for the most part. Jake Gyllenhaal echoes NIGHTCRAWLER with his haunted turn while Ryan Reynolds has mercifully little running time. Rebecca Ferguson is okay and a darn sight better than Sandra Bullock was in GRAVITY. Best of the lot is the great former Japanese action star Hiroyuki Sanada, once again acting the socks off everybody else in support. The film is sufficiently gruesome in the horror stakes, and the CGI effects are up to the job too. It's different enough from ALIEN to enjoy, and the suspense is consistent. Add in a good twist ending and you have a thoroughly enjoyable movie."

","I thought this was such a good movie! I LOVE horror movies and I'm normally disappointed by how lame hey are, how dumb the characters are or how they end. I didn't have high hopes for this because I thought Alien Covenant (2017) was one of the worst films I've ever seen. However! I thought this was so good! It was gory (way gorier than I thought it would be!), scary and had my actually squirming when I was watching it!

","55 year old female here (I wish folks would write their age and sex when then review) For at least half the film I was fully engaged in this alien horror film. I was scared, more than once, turning away or covering my eyes. There are intense, scary moments. For a while, it absolutely reminded me of a remake of Alien. But distracting ridiculousness kicked in. I found myself turning to my husband saying Wait, what was that? How is this happening? Where did that come from? I thought it needed oxygen to live...... etc. We walked away saying it was a good movie, but predictable and turned silly towards the end. Not as smart & intelligent as Alien, but not a waste of time. The end is supposed to be a twist, but is almost expected and opens the door for a sequel, which I'm sure they'll do. It won't be any good."
"jsmith-59317","7","43","71","30 August 2017"," An OK film,better than Prometheus and its sequel - Spoilers to Prometheus and Life
","Before watching this. I only watched two alien movies Prometheus and Alien:Covenant. I would say that Life is much better than those two. The personalities of characters are not distinctly portrayed, but this should at least partially result from the nature of the movie: People dying one after another. Thus give very little time for the character that died early. The character in the film are reasonable and heroic compared to the characters in Prometheus. At least they have the ""firewall"" in their mind and the captain made right decision to abandon crew at times, in contrast to the behavior of characters in Prometheus to let infected crew into the spacecraft. <br/><br/>Some reviews criticized the behavior of Hugh Derry of poking the alien life with hand. I too think it's not the most wise move. But as other comments pointed out. This is a carbon-based creature that shares similarity with us. Maybe Hugh just hadn't imagined that that creature could have been so powerful considering its thin and small form factor.But Dr.Hugh still looked stupid to me in the entire film. Especially when he try to cover for the alien life on his leg. <br/><br/>Maybe it's the unsurpassable stupidity of crews in Prometheus and Alien:Covenant made me immune to stupidity. The rest of the crew looked normal to me. The captain sometimes makes contrary decisions on whether a crew should be abandoned on similar situation. But I think it is understandable given the pressure and continuous death of other crew members. <br/><br/>The ending is not new in the history of alien movies, but it's much better than a ""human being saved"" cliché in my opinion."

","*Spoiler alert* So it all starts pretty OK on a space station that is about to receive some earth samples from Mars. We get to meet the crew and some of them are top cast as Ryan Renolds and Jake Gyllenhal. And off course it strikes me that at least one of these are the main character. But that thought passed as soon as Ryan Renolds dies after only 10 minutes in the most stupid way. So the movie starts, I'm awfully confused of who the main characters are, what kind of team they are. Who should I like? Why is Jake Gyllenhal so quiet? Why is the biologist so naive and the questions go on forever. The story line is as thin as the air in space and as simple as a one cell organism. Basically you are watching a indestructible starfish kill one by one in a gory way until everybody is dead. The end is so unoriginal that a 5 year old could make something better."

Well, I still decided to watch the movie and there was not a single moment, when a had a smile on my face, thinking - what a nonsense! Maybe there were some logical errors in the plot, but I don't think about things like that when I know I'm watching a movie about aliens, and not some sort of wildlife documentary. Aliens, Carl! Things that don't exist! (Well, maybe they do, but that's another subject). If you work at NASA and you've had a really bad day and now you're just searching for some incentive to start smashing your TV in order to release all that bad energy - this movie might do the trick. But if you just want to watch a good movie about space and stuff - there's quite a big chance you'll like it! Just remember - this is not a math test you have to correct.

","Life is the kind of horror that relies on the viewer buying into the idea that supposedly brilliant people will all suddenly choose to to incredibly stupid things.<br/><br/>The movie fails so spectacularly after trying so hard to be realistic in it's portrayal of space travel that it fails to be anything more than a comedy with a few gratuitous jump scares.<br/><br/>At the core of this movie's failings is it's constant need to get it's alien antagonist to places it shouldn't be.<br/><br/>To make the point about brilliant people doing stupid things, barely half an hour in, a supposedly highly trained astronaut decides it would be a great idea to enter the lab containing an escaped and clearly dangerous alien to try and rescue a trapped colleague. This, of course, required opening the single door separating the dangerous alien which just severely injured on crew member from the other 5 crew members. <br/><br/>Really? I'm supposed to accept this as a reasonable decision?<br/><br/>Worse, this isn't even how the alien escapes. This mind numbing stupidity from a supposedly reasonable character is just the setup for even more ridiculous antics. <br/><br/>The decision to enter the room with a dangerous alien was merely the excuse to get the station's engineer into the lab, where he would proceed to use a flamethrower (really?) in a failed attempt to kill the alien. The flamethrower then sets off some space sprinklers (which wouldn't work due to the lack of gravity), allowing the alien to escape into the space station's fire suppression plumbing (which the actual ISS does not have, since, you know, it would't work).<br/><br/>In scene after scene, the movie continues to obliterate any remnants of it's plausibility, from the ISS's fuel being expended in 3 short burns (The Zarya and Zvezda modules carry over 6000kg of fuel combined, which the movie expends in about 30s), or the stations thrusters being inexplicably connected to the station interior to allow the alien inside (despite the fuel for the thrusters being extremely toxic to humans on top of being explosively reactive - i.e., why it's used as rocket fuel), to the crew not being informed of a final fail-safe measure, resulting in a crew member accidentally interrupting it (We're going to push you into deep space if containment fails is hardly some kind of shocking revelation when just getting to the ISS risks fiery death).<br/><br/>The constant and brazen violations of realism (which, let's be honest, could have been caught with 5 minutes on Google, or about 10 seconds of applying some common sense), in a movie that tries so hard to be serious in it's tone and presentation completely destroys any semblance of being either horror or science fiction.<br/><br/>I can not, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone who is not inebriated to the point of passing out."

"lnvicta","5","113","211","31 March 2017"," A predictable homage to ""Alien,"" lacking the key ingredients that made ""Alien"" so terrifying.
","""Life"" being an ""Alien"" ripoff should not come as a surprise to anybody; it's been marketed that way since day one. Compared to the majority of what the genre has been spewing out lately, though, a derivative sci-fi thriller can be seen as a breath of fresh air. And in many ways, ""Life"" succeeds as one. It's fluidly directed, well-acted, sporadically suspenseful, and thoroughly entertaining. The space setting lends itself to impressive visuals and claustrophobic scenarios, of which ""Life"" has no shortage. The problems with the film lie underneath the surface.<br/><br/>Part of what made ""Alien"" such a terrifying experience was its bleak atmosphere. The exploration of a cold, desolate, seemingly uninhabitable planet; traversing through the long, white corridors of the ship; the lingering sense of unease, not knowing where the alien was at any given moment. ""Life"" is more streamlined, its action taking place entirely on board an indistinctive space shuttle. Some scenes serve as clear homages to ""Alien,"" such as David (Jake Gyllenhaal) floating through uncertain corridors mirroring Dallas' maneuvering of the airlocks, and one of the crew members being in isolated danger, forcing the others to decide whether or not to assist them and risk endangering the rest of the crew. These scenes work well enough to generate a modicum of suspense, but their impact is severely reduced because of the fact that we've seen it before. It's difficult to be truly scared when you know exactly what's going to happen to who and when.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest issue with ""Life"" is its characters. None of them have distinct personalities; we're hardly given a chance to get to know them. Some of the most effective scenes in ""Alien"" were simply watching the crew sitting around and chatting - we saw how they interacted with each other under normal circumstances, we noticed their quirks firsthand, we understood what their priorities were early on; so when crap started hitting the fan, those subtle characterizations made the tension all the more visceral and relatable. In ""Life,"" we're introduced to caricatures who spout bland dialogue and do consistently stupid things. All we really know about them is their jobs, so you don't feel an impact when any particular character bites it.<br/><br/>Still, ""Life"" is too well-made to be completely dismissed. Sci-fi horror fans will likely find enjoyment from a one-time watch, if only for the constant callbacks to ""Alien."" It fails to break any new ground, but it's a perfectly serviceable and moderately thrilling addition to the genre."

","On behalf of all movie goers with semblance of common sense I would like to caution everyone who passed 10 Grade Science against seeing this movie. You'd spend 2 hours screaming at the screen and if you have a background in a field of science your head will explode. Don't say I didn't warn you...<br/><br/>A carbon based life form on Mars survived in hibernation the billions of years since the planet lost its atmosphere. OK, why not, I can bend that far. So far I am with you. <br/><br/>The crew of the International Space Station gets incredibly lucky in an intergalactic game of catch with the pod carrying soil samples. This is starting to be problematic but stranger things have happened.<br/><br/>But the next scene broke the suspension bridge to my disbelief. The paraplegic biologist with severely misplaced paternal instincts, wearing no protective suit what so ever opens the samples in a box separated from the lab by a pair of kitchen gloves. There is no protocol in place for decontamination or isolation. There is no quarantine, open the door of the lab and you are in the company of the crew waiting to be slaughtered. As things start to go wrong we find out that air is supplied to the lab through vents that can only be shut down one at the time, they lead directly into the life support system of the station and the pressure inside of it is produced by magic. To top it all off a member of the crew who is from the CDC so presumably studied pathogens in Earth-bound labs had no problem with this set up what so ever. <br/><br/>They figure out that this single cell organism needs 20 degrees Celsius and a very specific oxygen and CO2 mix to come back to a live state. Good news to the audience is that when the temp is accidentally lowered the creature goes back to napping. Although we are moving along the story line of Alien which means there will only be one survivor we are made to think that maybe the amateurs who built the lab will not have caused the demise of the crew and the creature is at least in for a good fight. But no such luck. The creature eats a rat and Ryan Reynolds which in turn makes it able to survive the minus 270 degrees Celsius temperature and zero pressure of open space. If it's all that it takes we should consider this before we start colonizing space.<br/><br/>I gave it a total of 3 stars, one for the scenes of zero gravity conditions and one for the acting then deducted one for the ending on behalf of NASA. I don't care how adaptable the Mars alien is it can't go from a single cell to piloting for a successful re-entry in Earth's atmosphere in 24 hours."

","Life tells the story of a crew of astronauts as they discover a new life form on Mars. As the crew begins to examine the new life form, it begins to take each crew member out, one by one. As the life form makes its way through the group, the space team begins to turn on themselves in hopes of survival. The film, directed by Daniel Espinosa, is a heart pounding sci-fi film much in the vein of Ridley Scott's Alien. While many sci-fi films since Alien have been rightly compared to it, Life is a sci-fi film that knows its inspirations and directly alters the perception of its viewers. When you think the film will take a right, it takes a hard, very surprising and very swift left. This keeps you on your toes and never lets you relax at all which is the best compliment I could give this film. <br/><br/>Starring an all star cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, and Rebecca Ferguson, the film's cast adds to the surprising nature of the story. The moments that end up being the biggest in the film come from the surprising lengths these characters will go in order to survive. This makes for a very layered and very interesting take on something that could have easily been a CGI spectacle with no heart and very little brain. The decisions that these characters make are real decisions. The weight of someone's choice echoes and reverberates throughout the entire film. Espinosa has done a very good job at keeping his characters grounded in reality, much like the film. While this may turn some viewers off, especially those who are expecting something like Gravity or Interstellar, it really made the film something else for me. It was a sci-fi film that was completely unafraid of being real and ho-hum at times.<br/><br/>Overall, Life is an excellent example of going against the typical sci-fi genre tropes and features some truly brilliant performances from the main cast. While many may be expecting something like the sci-fi films that Hollywood has been churning out over the past couple years, this film is far from the normative sci-fi film. This film feels more in line with films like Ridley Scott's Alien and Tarkovsky's Solaris which makes this rise above the rest of the films it will be compared to. Along with being Espinosa's best work, it also features a very human performance from Ryan Reynolds that was just as surprising as the film itself."

The organism(Calvin) is immensely adaptable and severely aggressive. Calvin is growing and finding new ways of dispatching it's victims. The first half of this film is tangled with a web of mystery that unravels in it's second half. I don't know if you'll enjoy this as much as I did, I am a big fan of science fiction and with this cast, it would have been a crime not to see this. <br/><br/>Director Espinosa delivers a thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Wondering who will be next and will they survive. Sounds cliché if you think about it. I mean, a survival story in space, a concept that has been done over and over again. However, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, have a tendency to to add life(pardon the pun) to classic stories. Deadpool is a prime example of that. I'm sure critics will find pilot holes or mistakes in the film as I have, But I don't want to give too much away. So, I'll just say that the crew on the space station made mistakes professionals shouldn't. But that's to be expected. This is Science Fiction after all.

"rgkarim","8","90","171","25 March 2017"," Life, So Delicate, So Fragile, So Detailed In Terms of Death
","What is life? That is a question that so many researchers have tried to answer over the centuries. And what better way to try and answer that question than with a Hollywood movie production starring Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. My last review this weekend is on the movie called Life, a science fiction/horror film hoping to provide the scares of the March season. But will contact with this film give you the chills, or send you running to the illswith disappointment. Robbie K here with another review. Let's get started!<br/><br/>LIKES:  True Science Fiction  Evolution of the creature  Creepy and horrifying  Good characters<br/><br/>Summary: We know most science fiction movies fall short of the genre, focusing more on the fantasy element and special effects (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.) Life though hits the genre right on the mark, dropping us amidst an international space station where research about Mars is underway. As the chaos unfolds, the crew has to use their training, knowledge, and science (and not gigantic guns) to try to outwit the beast before it gets them. And speaking of the creature, ""Calvin"" as it is called has an interesting design at the start looking like a fungus. Yet the spores quickly evolve into a deflated looking star fish, and from there began to evolved into a truly destructive creature. Calvin's metamorphosis is perhaps the creepiest aspect of this film, as his search for the crucial ingredients (food, water, and oxygen) drives it to savagery (it will make you look at star fish in a whole new way).<br/><br/>Outside of that though, some other factors that brought the thrills and chills start with the realistic setting. There rendition of the international space station looks pretty close to our own world's, minimizing the fantasy component to keep one ground in the horror the team tries to present, establishing a feeling that this could happen. To go alongside this, the other factor is how alone one feels on the station. Much like the first Alien movie (to which this pays homage to), you feel the isolation of the station as if you are the prey Calvin seeks. This added edge truly brings the horror aspect full circle Finally, the characters also help amplify the horror component of this film. It is nice to see the human cast not be a bunch of idiotic, shallow teens for once, but instead educated scientists fighting for survival (while also not being the single-minded buffoons that often take these roles). The cast was dynamic, each specialized but capable of covering their team members should something happen. Such development led to characters you actually rooted for, instead of against them as we often see in horror films. And the actors all played their roles fantastically, from Ryan Reynolds sarcasm, to Jake Gyllenhaal's scary accuracy in someone with social anxiety. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Unneeded dramatic opening  More evolution of the creature  Predictable ending (though nice twist)  Savagery of kills<br/><br/>Summary: A minor dislike I know, but Life's dramatic capturing of the capsule in the first twelve minutes was really unnecessary. All I gleamed from this opening was technical displays and a little excitement to get the mood going. There are probably a few other scenes that could have been left out as well, but these were minor compared to the big stink they made with this opening sequence. <br/><br/>Unnecessary scenes aside, the other thing I would have liked was more development into the creature. Don't get me wrong, the final form was creepy, but after all the changes happening in the beginning (which were a stretch mind you), the team suddenly brought it to a halt. Yes, they tried to explain it via ""science"", but this abrupt halt just broke pace/balance the movie was establishing, which felt a little off for me, right down to the end. <br/><br/>Speaking of ending, Life's trailers hint at what the conclusion is, and based on my observations I had a good idea where it would go. I wanted things to be different, but sadly the ending can be predicted within 30 minutes of the show time (assuming again you haven't watched the trailers). Albeit there was a nice twist to try and throw you off, Life's directors didn't go the full distance to prove my observations wrong. <br/><br/>Yet the biggest beef I have with this movie is the dark, disturbing, savageness the directors instilled. If you're a fan of watching gore filled deaths, suffering, and depressing looks this movie will send ""out of orbit"". For me though, these moments only take away from a movie if done too much or in the wrong manner. My biggest strike comes from the graphic death of a lab mouse (which broke my heart as most animal cruelty does). That's only the start of Life's grotesque hunt as Calvin finds disturbing ways to attack the band of researchers in immense detail. Why the directors felt the need to focus on such disturbancesI don't know, but in this case less would have been more, as the first Alien flick did long ago. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Overall, Life is one of the better science fiction, horror films I've seen in years. It drops the grandiose serial killers and idiotic victims, and upgrades to an adapting monster hunting intelligent people. This realism crafts a more suspenseful tale that kept me engaged, while crafting that horrifying atmosphere I love. While most of my dislikes are small, the mutilation involved, alongside some scientific imbalances, really didn't impress me in this movie and the predictable ending didn't necessary wow me as well. Is this worth a trip to theater? If you are looking for a good horror film, then by all means hit the theater for it. As for weak constitutions, skip this one and save some time. <br/><br/>My scores: Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
"mpcoe2003","5","91","175","24 March 2017"," Life gets sucked out of Life by bad direction.
","Life is a simple story that has been told many times before, most notably by Ridley Scott in the 1979 film Alien. A group of diverse astronauts discover an alien life form, which eventually becomes a threat to their lives.<br/><br/>Life starts out as an intriguing enough plot, a crew is assigned to intercept a damaged satellite that contains soil samples from Mars. Once these samples are retrieved, the on board scientist begins to discover what becomes the films protagonist, an intelligent life form with a brutal determination to survive.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Life fails to make use of a great cast and a fairly fresh take on the classic alien versus man concept. To make a long story short, the Direction is poor. You never really connect with any of the characters, therefore the order in which they are inevitably dispatched not only makes little sense, but doesn't affect the viewer on any emotional level. The suspense is forced, the twists although not particularly predictable are underwhelming and the ending lacks closure.<br/><br/>Wait till On Demand to view this one :)"
"bob-the-movie-man","7","59","110","30 March 2017"," Life after Gravity
","Mankind is on the verge of a major milestone. The ""Pilgrim"" probe is returning from Mars containing soil samples that might spell the discovery of the first palpable evidence of life beyond earth. Proving that earth scientists are not completely incompetent, the probe is being returned not to earth but to a lab on the International Space Station where strict quarantine can be maintained. This key mission requirement is the responsibility of Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson, ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation""). Supporting her is an international crew including fellow doctor David Harris (Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Source Code""), professional astronaut Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds, ""Deadpool"") and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), the lead scientist studying the samples. Needless to say, the soil samples yield more promise than Derry could have ever hoped for (or North could have feared). A crisis of growth and death ensues in a manner that fans of ""Alien"" will be suitably familiar with. Can the crew survive against all the odds?<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors with a raft of quality films in his CV such as ""Nightcrawler"" and last year's hugely underrated (and almost Oscar-ignored) ""Nocturnal Animals"". Rebecca Ferguson is also a class act and one of my favourite actresses of the moment. Here they are starring together for the first time and they don't disappoint. Whilst neither gets enough quality screen time to really hammer their roles home, both connect to the audience in different ways: Harris is heading for an ISS endurance record, and starting to mentally disconnect from earthly connections as his body also starts to atrophy. North, with a clear attraction to him, tries to hold both him and everything together with steely determination, while carrying more knowledge of the mission directives than anyone else has.<br/><br/>The supporting ensemble cast also work well, portraying a real mixture of nationalities from the cock-sure American played by Reynolds to the sultry Russian commander Golovkina, played by the lovely Olga Dihovichnaya. A special note should also be added in the margin for one of the most surprising portrayals of a disabled character in a recent film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the material the actors get to deliver, by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (co-writers of ""Deadpool"" and ""Zombieland"") doesn't match their ability. The first 30 minutes or so of the film I found to be totally gripping, but even here some of the dialogue is sufficiently clunky to distract you from the ongoing narrative. Some of the rest of the dialogue becomes head-in-the-hands awful in places: a scene during a de-pressurization episode being particularly painful. <br/><br/>Some dodgy dialogue might be forgivable in an action movie if supported by a strong story. Unfortunately, while the premise of the film is sound (if not original), the story leaps from inconsistency to inconsistency from beginning to end. The writers never seem to settle on whether the 'being' needs oxygen, likes oxygen, likes hot, likes cold, etc. and this lack of credibility distracts from the whole film. While the screenplay delivers some seriously suspenseful moments, and some decent jump scares, this is not satisfactory enough to serve up a cohesive movie meal. <br/><br/>This is not helped by 'bad science'. As I have commented upon before, I'm a physicist by training and unscientific scenes annoy me to distraction. I've had to learn to live with the basics of explosions and other 'noise' in space (something ""Star Wars"" started 40 years ago, damn those TIE fighters). But there is a scene in ""Life"" involving an airlock breach that just completely beggars belief, acted out as it is like a stiff breeze on the front at Skegness! (It's almost – (almost) – as bonkers as the 'reactor venting' scene with Chris Pratt in ""Passengers"". <br/><br/>However, the film has its strong points too. Like ""Gravity"", this is another special effects triumph with the scenes outside the ISS being gorgeously rendered. ""Gravity"" was a clear 10/10; this is probably at least a 7, and a reason for seeing the film on the big screen. A key question though is why there wasn't a 3D version of the film released? Heaven knows I'm no fan of 3D, but ""Gravity"" was one of the few films that was genuinely enhanced by the format: in fact it is currently the only 3D Blu-ray that I own!<br/><br/>In general, the whole film seems a little half-cocked and lacking in its own conviction. You wonder whether the production company (Skydance) got rather cold-feet about the film in releasing it when it did. Yes, ""Deadpool"" did very well with its February release, but this is a much more suitable film for a summer audience than a release in this post-Oscars doldrums.<br/><br/>In summary, its a moderately entertaining watch, but at heart just another retelling of the old 'something nasty in the woodshed' yarn that we've seen played out countless times before. Here though the swanky setting and special effects are diminished by a lack of credibility and consistency in the storytelling. Redemption was on hand though, for while it was heading for a middling 6* rating, it managed to salvage another star in the final 60 seconds: a memorable movie ending that might prove hard to beat during 2017. <br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

","The movie started off visually stunning, every object moved smoothly as if in zero-gravity, it had great compositions, relaxing atmosphere, camera moved slow enough to not cause dizziness, and around enough to give us the feel of being in space. Our characters were introduced to us with great pace, showing little details of their background. Then it went downhill.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie insults the intelligence of all astronauts, all of us viewers, and all space programs. It was breach after breach of protocol, blunders, and plot-holes. Basically, stupidity moved the plot forward.<br/><br/>-- spoiler alert --<br/><br/>After the alien life-form showed aggression, broke a guy's hand, which resulted in him losing consciousness, what do you expect our team of highly intelligent, strictly disciplined, best of the best of humanity, would do? <br/><br/>breaking protocol #1, instead of incinerating the box and containing the aggressive alien, they did nothing. They watched as the aggressive creature took its time to escape the box.<br/><br/>breaking protocol #2, instead of incinerating the lab module, they opened the door, got another person stuck inside, and watched him die too, still not incinerating the lab. Why? for the sake of convenient plot device.<br/><br/>blunder #3 air vents suddenly opened! And it could not be closed! oh no! with a dead guy in the lab, what do 4 of our most intelligent people did? send one person to close the air vent one by one. why are they still not incinerating the lab? help me. <br/><br/>IS all the talk about firewall 1 (incinerate box) and firewall 2 (incinerate lab) just talk? sure, spend 10 minutes discussing firewall 1 and firewall 2 then conveniently forget to do either when needed to move the plot along.<br/><br/>plot-hole #4 dangerous murderous alien who went to hibernation after a minor turbulence at the ISS , is suddenly able to freely waltz outside the ISS in vacuum.<br/><br/>breaking protocol #5 In the event of murderous creature on the loose outside of ISS, our group of intelligent astronauts decided to send one person to die by walking around outside ISS.<br/><br/>Killer alien then attaches to said astronaut walking outside. BIG surprise, like seriously, what did you expect would happen?<br/><br/>breaking protocol #6 At that point, our intelligent astronaut was still trying to save herself, trying to get back into ISS, thinking perhaps the rest of the crew can get it off of her. Only in the last dramatic minute when she is supposed to open the door did she decide, oh, actually, it is better that I keep this dangerous alien outside of ISS, because most likely it will just kill everyone inside if it re- enters. Now we have a cheap thrilling/emotional moment where she sacrificed herself.<br/><br/>plot-hole #7 after killing the astronaut, alien decided to discard the life source it just got: the cooler liquid in the spacesuit and the glucose inside the astronaut's body. Instead of latching on to food, it decided to get back in the ISS. This could still be explained by saying it has developed enough intelligence to know deep space is dangerous, but I doubt after 6 consecutive, stupid plot devices, that the scriptwriter put more thought to it than just ""it would be thrilling if it tried to get back into the spaceship now.""<br/><br/>plot-hole #8 alien knows exactly how to get back into ISS. Viewers were just explained that there are 6 thrusters where it can get back in.<br/><br/>blunder #9 stupidly burn what little of remaining fuel to temporarily stop alien coming in, and at the same time, get ISS into entry orbit. Just what we should expect from our intelligent astronauts, throw away what little resources they have to temporarily keep a dangerous creature out while moving orbit into earth (sarcasm).<br/><br/>#10 after this much danger and breach of protocol, our remaining female lead astronaut decide it is still not time to announce that they should contain the alien in ISS, and prepare to sacrifice themselves. This leaves our Japanese astronaut to expect rescue.<br/><br/>This expectation to be rescued allowed our Japanese astronaut to accidentally set alien free, kill himself, and kill one random new astronaut.<br/><br/>#11 alien never split itself up to kill multiple targets even though it is a cellular organism.<br/><br/>#12 escape pod conveniently malfunctioned and propelled the other astronaut into deep space. Then conveniently work as intended in pod with alien inside.<br/><br/>#13 alien did not kill astronaut for the whole 15 minutes of him in escape pod. A gruesome body would have deterred the fisherman from opening the pod.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Such lazy script! What a waste of great shots! I left feeling drained, dumb, and stressed.

"FabledGentleman","3","86","171","31 May 2017"," In Space, no one can see the stupid things you do, over and over, and over, and over
","It seems like Hollywood wants us to believe that every single person being sent into space, being astronauts, scientists, engineers, doctors, specialists, theorists and experts are morons. People who's actions are subnormal at best, over and over and over, which of course leads to easy script writing, because when you have morons in space, anything can happen, at any given time.<br/><br/>We have recently seen this in movies like Prometheus and Alien Covenant as well, and there is no other reason to portray these characters like idiots, unless you want to write a movie faster, there is no other reason. Therefor it is lazy and without passion.<br/><br/>Why do Hollywood think that i will feel anything for characters that basically signed Darwin's Law before they went to space?. People making stupid decisions that put themselves and everyone else at risk at any given time? I say screw them, let them die.<br/><br/>Which then kinda ruins the purpose of this film, which tries to bring some heart to the story before manure hits the fan (That other word that starts with S is prohibited here on IMDb.......). But the character development in this film is absolutely horrible, and the characters are bland and uninteresting. I have difficulty understanding why Reynolds and Gyllenhaal signed up for this, as this movie can only damage their careers.<br/><br/>This movie has basically nothing going for it story and character wise. What this movie does well, is the CGI, which for the most part is pretty nice. But i could not help noticing this movie tried to replicate Gravity (2013). And throw in the essence of Alien (1979) just to try and make it interesting. But the story has no logic to it, the plot is carried by foolish decisions, the entire movie insults my intelligence to a point i hardly could find it in me to give it 3 stars.<br/><br/>I am so glad this movie was a flop. Some times horrible films earns hundreds of millions, even billions, this is not one of them. It has earned far less than it cost to produce.<br/><br/>I hope Gyllenhaal and Reynolds is more careful choosing roles from now on, they are really good actors and can carry a film on their own. Just look at how good Gyllenhaal was in Donnie Darko and Nightcrawler for example, And Reynolds in Buried and Deadpool. They should not have signed up for this train wreck.<br/><br/>I'm not sure who to blame for everything here. The direction isn't really bad, but the director took on this job, he is responsible for the outcome, even though i suspect studio executives overruled him on so many occasions. It's sad that the industry has come to this, where only a few directors are allowed to present their true vision, but that's not saying this director ever had one.<br/><br/>But none the less, the script is the biggest problem in this film. It is just ridiculously poorly written, I'm simply amazed this movie got green-lit to a budget of 60 million dollars.<br/><br/>Avoid this one.<br/><br/>If you want a space horror movie that works, you watch Alien and Aliens. Or if you just want to watch space movies in general, see The Martian or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Or Gravity. Just not this one, and also, stay away from Passengers, which is also a horrible recent space movie.<br/><br/>3/10 - Bad"

","I was gripped throughout. The characters were fantastic and the story line was great. You feel that you've seen something like this before, but I haven't. I've always been a supporter of NASA and space exploration. With the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe being one of the biggest questions as a human being, after watching this, I'm not so sure. From the moment that 'thing' came to life, I knew we were stepping into the realms of the unknown. Caution should be of utmost importance. From the moment it was confirmed as a threat, I just wanted them to get rid of it. Naming it Calvin did not make it lovable. No spoilers here but that ending is amazing. It just shows how possible this could be, even with us being very near to sending manned missions to Mars. I really hope we don't. Let's just send robots and probes for now. Another line of thought here is, maybe this is why Aliens do not communicate with us. They've probably got the intelligence to er on the side of caution. All in all, this movie was a heart pounding 10/10."
"twotrybe","1","62","122","1 April 2017"," Typical tropes to a suck feast of a film
","If you like your logic inept and stupid, this is the film for you. On the other hand, if the logic don't make any sense, steer clear away from this movie. Life and Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal in this over wrought tale of space exploration. I'm surprised Ryan Reynolds is in this considering that he mocked the typical superheroes trope in his film Deadpool. Here, the clichés are derivative and hackneyed. Here is one, the captain of the crew is outside the space station with the creature attached to her and she knows she's going to die. So instead of pushing herself off and away from the space station where it can't do anymore harm, she lingers close to it where the creature slowly kills her and then her body floats away and the creature comfortably launches off her body and back to the space station.<br/><br/>And here is the atypical trope that's been worked to death in movies kike this, you have the scientist fiddling around with an alien organism where he names it and plays with it like it's a cute doll. But like all things small, it grows and it grows big. So why do we keep seeing the same thing over and over again? Is this the sci-fi rule where a scientist rule to treat alien spawns like Muppet babies that will one day grow up and eat your face off? Watching this was so frustrating. You can understand why people talk back to the screen because idiots make movies.<br/><br/>And here is another typical trope, the crew gets killed off one by one. We've seen this before in films like Aliens. And then there is the lone survivor. They make it so that it ends a certain way in order for you to want a sequel. I don't want a sequel, I want it to end. Don't do this again. That little mind play at the end with both capsules floating around in space only to discover that the one without the creature is hurtling off into space and the one with the creature is entering earth's atmosphere, not that surprising. <br/><br/>And why does the communication fails in these scenarios? You'd think that the communication devices were made by three year old's. And with all of the so-called experience this crew had, hadn't any of them seen a sci-fi movie where things like this happens with regularity? And why would the capsule land in a part of the ocean where the fishermen could see that there was something on the guy and yet they still open the capsule and he was screaming at the top of his lungs, NO!? No and huh are universal languages. And yet they figured out how to open a space capsule without any problems.<br/><br/>This is a stupid movie, this is an inept movie, this movie insults astronauts, this movie insults scientist, this movie insults movie goers, this movie insults the integrity of film making, this movie insults the genre it falls under. I ave it one star because that's the lowest I could go. I wish a could have gone lower, like a -100,000."

His father biologist sees him but say nothing until every one is sealed in one small room and sees Calvin's eating his father's leg????

Every one escapes and that Japanese guy dies.. Finally, only two people left. They start to take and cry.. wait... there are two escape pod...??? Interesting. And one guy tries to sacrifice himself and bring Calvin to deep space and let the lady go back to earth. Of course, of course, even though you figure out light attracts Calvin, you still want to bring him with you but not leave him here and use there two escape pods to go home. Even at this point, I'm still fine with this scripts. Until the director tries to make people think the lady got on earth and the guy brings Calvin into deep space and dies. In the end, somehow their escape pods go oppositely as they wish, and Calvin surprisingly knows how to drive escape pod??? He leaves his food alive and control the astronomer's hands then safely lands on earth??????

It owes a debt to those other, groundbreaking films, and that being the case, it should be acknowledged that it's not as good as them.

","I saw this at SXSW in Austin, Texas when it first premiered and I was blown away by it. I just saw it on DVD and I must say that I'm still blown away by it! Life is a science-fiction horror film with a massive cast and an even more massive scope. What I enjoy more than anything else in this film is the cinematography and the direction. There are several minute-long long shots all over the film, including the first shot which lasts four minutes long. It could've been very easy to just lamely film a scene and cut back and forth between the dialog, but the director and his team did an amazing job with these creative cinematography tricks. There's also this big feeling of actually being on the spaceship with these characters, which doesn't happen often I tell you what! I could feel the cold metal walls and the freezing air in space. The script is okay at best, just a generic alien- on-the-loose Alien knock-off, but so what? Alien rules, and I wasn't born yet to see it on the big screen. Even then, the directing jazzes up the story as much as possible, and the most disturbing scene in the film is when the characters read Goodnight Moon on the verge of death. Scenes like that really boost up the film, not to mention the extremely shocking ending that I still think about to this day. The CGI on the alien is also very well done and I think is still this year's top contender for the Oscar for Best Special Effects. It probably wont even get a nomination because of the Oscars always going to Marvel superhero films (which is completely fine), but I swear the texture and movements on the alien were very realistic and most of the time I couldn't even tell it was CGI. So to summarize this: The story is standard but the writers, directors, and crew do so much to make a mediocre Alien rip-off into a first-rate, state of the art horror film in space. I want more of these in modern cinema instead of lame remakes and teenager slashers!"

","Let's start with the ending: what a big f-you to the audience. It doesn't even work as a twist ending, because the only twist is that they are telling you that what you saw is not what you saw. And that alone makes me angry, not to mention the fact that the ending shatters what little investment we had in these characters, letting us know that although we might have cared about them, the filmmakers did not. The ending is not there for our benefit, but for the benefit of the filmmakers who are clearly out of touch with film as an art form, and even as entertainment.<br/><br/>But let's go back to the beginning: a capsule is flying through space, returning from Mars, and there is a lot of fuss on the space station, since the capsule is off course and needs to be captured through a difficult maneuver. The whole scene has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the film, and is there simply to give the audience an exciting opening. Already then I felt cheated and my expectations for the rest of the film sank.<br/><br/>Then we find out that there was life in the samples from Mars, and life that they reanimate in minutes. Of course, there are no safety precautions, and the governments of the countries involved seem happy to let them play with alien life without any clear agenda or security concerns. The only thing they care about is naming the thing.<br/><br/>Then, through some incredibly lazy writing, they lose contact with earth, and never regain it. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Then, the thing (it's called 'Calvin') grows into a squid that can fly through air without actually propelling itself. You remember the film 'Alien'? One of the potential directors for that film said he'd just buy a liver at the supermarket and that would be the alien. He didn't get the job, but a similar fool got this job. I mean, it's a stupid squid. It's not scary or original.<br/><br/>From then on, in a series of incredibly confusing scenes where the audience spends most of the time trying to figure out what the hell is going on, the characters are killed off one by one. The characters remain cardboard cutouts, nothing but fresh meat for the alien. One of them barely manages to escape, but is then killed off five minutes later, making his escape totally pointless. There is absolutely nothing in terms of payoff in this film. Nothing is set up, and no investment in a character is ever rewarded.<br/><br/>Finally, for some reason, the station falls apart and we get the stupid, confusing ending, which also ends up being a confusing TWIST ending. Genius.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the film has some entertainment value, but not enough to redeem it. It's a failure in terms of screen writing, directing, and editing. And the monster is as stupid as its name."

","This is a Sci-fi suspense horror film, staring an A-list cast. The crew are isolated in a space-station, which feels incredibly claustrophobic. The mission is to analyse some soil samples from Mars and in the process the crew discover a dangerous 'octopusy' like alien life-form.<br/><br/>The Alien (they name 'Calvin') grows very quickly and slowly picks off the crew in it's attempts to survive. The alien is fairly scary but I don't think will measure up to some other film monsters, and I'm not sure if I'm ever going to enjoy calamari again.<br/><br/>The plot is heavily inspired by the original Ridley Scott 'Alien' film, while the very heavy CGI opening scenes are heavily inspired by 'Gravity'. The zero gravity 'floaty' scenes are well filmed and very effective. The sound-track is very atmospheric but is 'bigger' than the film.<br/><br/>In summary, the film is watch-able but there is a very predictable twist at the end and the film is ultimately forgettable in favour of better examples."

","'Life' has state-of-the-art production values, but its sophomoric science and scientists would be sneered at by kindergartners. The story begins as a robot probe carrying a cargo of soil samples from Mars arrives at the International Space Station in unnecessarily melodramatic fashion. The follies continue inside the station's 'fail-safe' isolation lab, after a biologist revives a Martian organism which has been in suspended animation for the last 3 billion years. The tiny creature seems cute at first and is named Calvin, but he soon escapes from his cell in the orbiting Supermax prison - and like all toddlers, he starts to misbehave.<br/><br/>What follows is an 'Alien' copycat plot, except with even more generic characters, duller dialog and a total absence of original ideas. In a matter of hours, Calvin bulks up into a starfish-squid hybrid with the strength of a gorilla, the intelligence of a chess grand-master and the empathetic capacity of a cobra. Calvin's cuteness wears off fast, and the crew decide to neutralize him, but he demonstrates some impressive natural defenses and the ability to scamper about the station's exterior in a vacuum. After that, the hapless astronauts know they need to think out of the box if they want to avoid becoming Calvin's luncheon buffet."
"Danielpotato","1","46","92","25 March 2017"," Nothing more than a Alien Rip off, with an absurd ending
","Last night I've seen 3 movies in theaters, Life (2017) was one of them. To my surprise, this film was made by Daniel Espinosa. And I was even more surprised that Mr. Espinosa did not try to make this movie a sci-fi drama as has been usual in Hollywood for the past few years. <br/><br/>So what to expect from this movie? Firstly, the technical and aesthetic aspects are very good, as it comes this habit in this type of film with this type of budget. The cinematography is very good and the camera movements are agile and very beautiful. Daniel Espinosa's direction is interesting (at least in most of the film).<br/><br/>In other words in the technical department the film is very good. You can have a beautiful movie visually, but a movie needs a good story and good characters if it want to be a good movie ten years (or more) from now. The problem is that the script is fragile (one example, the Earth sends a spacecraft to push the station into space fearing that the contamination hits the Earth if the station falls on the planet, after a few minutes after this scene, this information is completely forgettable by the script) and full of holes, the story is way too simple and some acting is very bad. To start with, I've never liked Ryan Reynolds, he's a bad actor and his character is annoying, I think the director got this idea and because of this, Ryan Reynolds's character is the first to die (thank God). What a annoying and uninteresting character we got here. To tell the truth the actress Olga Dihovichnaya could have done a better work with her character (Ekaterina Golovkina). Her acting was very bad. The other actors are fine, however they needed more time to work on their characters (most of the blame is because of the stupid script). Especially the character of Jake Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>Some lines of dialogue said by the actors are also very stupid (example the character of Jake Gyllenhaal agrees to commit suicide to prevent ""Calvin"" of contaminating the planet, because according to him, it is not worth living with these 8 billion stupid humans and he wants to stay in space is better for his life - ridiculous, I know).<br/><br/>But the biggest problem of the film is that the film is just a poorly made copy of Alien (1979). Yes, Hollywood copies another classic movie, this time - the Ridley Scott classic sci-fi and horror movie. But the this film can not maintain the intensity, nor the pace nor the amazing construction until the very end that the film of Ridley Scott has. What's more, the movie is full of stupid moments. One of the most stupid moments was the camera moves to the first person (too see through the eyes of the creature) when ""Calvin"" flies inside the station. What is the purpose of this? The only thing that comes to my mind, is the director wants to do these scenes to appeal to video game fans who play Call of Duty and other FPS? Ridiculous. Yes this movie is the Alien for the new generation that likes games and consoles and the same generation that likes to see blood and violence gratuitously to satisfy the ego.<br/><br/>What a lousy movie we have here, the icing on the cake and the absurd and unnecessary ending. In Alien (1979), the ending was a perfect construction from start to finish of the movie, here the director Daniel Espinosa puts only this ridiculous ending to give the air of the film wants to be different from the other sci-fi movies that currently exist in the market. That is, a different ending just for the sake of being different and not according to the purpose or construction of the narrative. In other words, an absurd, unnecessary and irrelevant ending.<br/><br/>Do not waste your money and your time watching this absurd movie."

Absolutely no character development by either the stars of the film or from the actual life form, 40 minutes takes place in a sealed off science chamber with a new life form and a mouse. Then we get to see a jelly belly starfish take out the characters one by one. Kind of like what Jason Vorhees does in the Friday the 13th franchise. <br/><br/>This film has two major stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds, their acting was sub par, they are two actors that can't do a space film, it just doesn't seem like their type of role for some reason. <br/><br/>The whole film from start to finish feels off to me. It could be the fact that we have seen this type of story so many times before. I could just imagine all the people that actually paid to see this garbage, probably checking the time on their smartphones after the first 20 minutes. <br/><br/>Final Verdict.<br/><br/>Save your money for something else, this film is just a tired story line with two major stars in it, that's the only thing that sold tickets. It was just a paycheck to these two main stars, and that's about it. On a side note, I see a score of 7.0, the studios must have their fake accounts up and running for this film.

","If the Alien franchise never existed, 'Life' may be considered a groundbreaking movie in the sci-fi genre, but obviously that's not the case. The good thing is, 'Life' doesn't hide the fact that it's clearly inspired by the original Alien film. Because it's extremely well- acted, paced, shot, and structured, the similarities don't really matter. 'Life' is just a heck of a thrilling time at the movies.<br/><br/>I can appreciate original science fiction as much as the next guy, but when you have a film that is as entertaining from start to finish as 'Life', I don't need every scene to be something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. 'Life' stars Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Hiroyuki Sanada, Olga Dihovichnaya, and Ariyon Bakare; written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (same guys who did Deadpool); and directed by Daniel Espinosa. There's nothing overtly new or refreshing with any aspect of 'Life', but at the same time, the film fires on all cylinders. <br/><br/>At a brisk run-time of 103 minutes, 'Life' never slows down. It reminded me a lot of 2013's Gravity in that way. The only time these films stopped to breathe was to add subtle but vital character depth to the story. Scene after scene is filled with terror, intrigue, and impressively shot action. It doesn't have the polished cinematography that the aforementioned Gravity or Interstellar does, but what films do? Life succeeds in nicely timed long takes, shocking deaths, and a terrifying creature named Calvin, but it doesn't always nail the emotionally gripping sequences. <br/><br/>However, what struck me most was the film's intelligence. All of the characters acted exactly how I would imagine these particular people would act in real life. Although some choices could be perceived as illogical, you have to put yourself in their shoes. Having an extremely dangerous life form trapped on your spacecraft isn't the most ideal situation, after all.<br/><br/>With stellar performances from the entire lead cast and it's single celled antagonist, 'Life' is one of the best films of the year thus far. Shocking, gruesome, and relentless, 'Life' manages to avoid falling into the forgettable sci-fi territory. It's better than I could have hoped this Alien knockoff would have been. If everything goes accordingly, we will have two great Alien films this year. <br/><br/>+Great cast<br/><br/>+The best Alien film since 1986<br/><br/>+Relentless tension<br/><br/>-Doesn't pack enough emotional punch<br/><br/>9.2/10"
"cruise01","9","35","69","23 March 2017"," Life is a lot of fun and intense. With a great cast ensemble and thrills. It can't be missed,
","Life is an awesome fun science fiction horror film that covers familiar ground with the story all while keeping the thrills and adrenaline rushing. Lets cross the first thing that may be running in everyone's minds and comparing Life to the Alien movie. Yes, it has that familiar plot of astronauts in a space station. They discover some lifeform that evolves into a killing monster. Everyone is killed off one by one. Life is more grounded compared to Alien. Sticking to a modern time and being more believable with the concept as the space crew reconnect with their satellite probe that was sent to Mars to get some samples. Some of those samples have some hibernating organism that develops and grows rapidly and gains intelligence. Next thing you know, this alien species they call ""Calvin,"" is an unstoppable killing machine. The creature design on Calvin was also grounded and its incredible strength. <br/><br/>Besides having a familiar story, the direction and script was fast paced and intense. The script tries to build some characterization briefly with the space crew. From an introspective Dr. Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), a medical analysis Dr. North (Rebecca Ferguson), Hugh (Ariyon Bakare), Katerina (Olga Dihovichnaya), Roy (Ryan Reynolds), and Sho (Hiroyuki Sanada). We learn briefly about these characters, but you also care for them when they meet a deadly bloody fate. Even, if there are some stupid choices made, being made for a logical reason. You actually feel sad when somebody dies in the film. Kind of rare for most horror films now and days, when the script has nothing but stock characters. The first character death scene was disturbing and bloody when their fate is sealed in a horrible way. Just like how Alien had that dinner table scene that really set the tone. <br/><br/>The film does have plenty of thrills, as characters are trying to figure a way to eliminate Calvin and avoiding the alien from reaching Earth even if it requires they sacrifice their lives. What makes the thrills is the space station being small and tight corridors with the alien freely roaming and killing characters off. The intensity never slows down. The direction was pretty exciting, seeing characters being in a zero gravity setting and the visual effects was stunning and the creature design was grounded and creepy. It does have a fun great cast ensemble with some recognizable actors like Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Rebecca Ferguson. And a few others. <br/><br/>Without giving away spoilers, the film does have a twist in the end that left myself with a frustrated and surprised reaction in a good way. I thought the ending was intense and a bit nerve wrecking. But left the movie being satisfied. <br/><br/>Overall, Life is a really good sci-fi horror movie that worked great on its own; it was a lot of fun, intense, and thrilling. Better than expected. I definitely recommend it if you care for the genre. I rate Life 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","From the opening scenes of triumph that were impossible to connect with followed by the early gruesome demise of the the biggest name in the film, the movie proceeded to be completely predictable with each character being picked off one by one. The acting was the only saving grace, unfortunately this was countered by the lack of character development, clichés and a too smart alien who is instantly familiar with earths technologies. The 'twist' ending gave me the same feeling the rest of the movie did, indifference."
"ewf1000","5","28","54","24 March 2017"," A Very Big Missed Opportunity
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>From the previews I saw, I was expecting an intense, suspenseful sci/fi horror movie along the lines of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens."" Sadly, this movie comes nowhere near the brilliance of those two flicks.<br/><br/>Its biggest failing is that it doesn't give you any three-dimensional characters. There's no one to root for here, so it really didn't mean much to me when the alien picked off crew members one by one. It also doesn't help that the characters do completely illogical things when facing an increasingly hostile alien organism. In one glaring instance, one of the astronauts is outside the space station with the alien attached to her body and methodically killing her. This woman could save the rest of her crew and keep the thing from reaching earth by simply pushing herself away from the station and drifting off into space. But no, she hangs on to the hatch, twisting away at some gear to keep the people inside from opening the door, when again, all she has to do is push away and take the alien with her.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I figured out the ending halfway through the movie, and I hated it. There are some decently suspenseful moments in ""Life"" but not enough of them, and definitely not enough logic. This isn't anything I have to see again. Instead, I'll just watch ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" when I'm in the mood for some really good sci/fi horror."
"john_seater","1","32","63","24 April 2017"," Insultingly stupid variation of Alien
","A good sci-fi movie generally must violate some law of nature but, having done that, presents an internally consistent plot. This catastrophe violates virtually every law of nature that pertains to it and then imposes a ridiculous plot.<br/><br/>I had a list of some of the things that most bothered me. However, previous reviewers already have covered most of them, so I won't repeat them here. I only insist on dwelling on the utter implausibility of the alien itself. It starts as a single cell that can perform all the functions of a multi-cellular organism: nervous, muscular, endocrine, mobility, intelligence, learning, you name it, this single cell can do it all. Totally ridiculous. The cell multiplies, and the mass of cells aggregate into a larger being. (That actually is believable and happens here on Earth with organisms such as cellular slime molds). Despite having been asleep for millions and perhaps billions of years, the alien quickly figures out how to use a human tool (it has not met humans or their tools before) to free itself from the observation box it is in (it has not met observation boxes before), and then it figures out how to get out of the lab (it has not met human labs or habitats before), which the crew was too stupid to seal until it was too late. What a remarkable beast! Later when it is outside the space station on one of the crew members and the crew member pushes herself away from the space station hoping to take the alien with her into deep space, the alien outsmarts her by jumping back onto the space station. Go figure: the alien eats living creatures, the crew member is alive and the alien knows it, the crew member is warm, the outside of the space station is extremely cold (temperature in outer space is about 2.5K, or about -455F), yet the alien knows it should abandon a piece of food and jump onto an inorganic extremely cold metal object. Right. Still later, the alien gets inside an escape pod and fights with the crew member who is trying to override the pre-programmed autopilot sequence to take the pod safely back to Earth. The crew member wants to take the pod into deep space. Somehow, the alien (who has not met an escape pod before) knows it should battle the crew member so that the autopilot (the alien has not met a human computer or an autopilot before) can land the pod safely on Earth. Really believable, right? In fact, how does the alien even know that Earth is there? It arrived on the space station in a frozen soil sample from Mars.<br/><br/>The foregoing are only a few of the utter idiocies of this film. Other reviewers have done a good job listing and explaining most of the others.<br/><br/>This movie is an unimaginative, unintelligent variation on Alien that offers nothing new except for its depth of stupidity."

","Oh goodness, where do I begin? The first clue that something was very wrong with this movie, was the scene where an astronaut is supposed to catch a large space module incoming at high speed towards the space station, the module the size of a van, with a robotic arm. The astronaut suspended in space, controlling the extended arm, hanging a mere few feet underneath the trajectory of the incoming space module. Really? Is that how we conduct docking in space with a 200B$ space station? Cowboy style, smashing up the equipment, risking lives?<br/><br/>The quarantine is simply ludicrous, a below average cheer leader would know that it's not how you arrange a barrier between high risk labs, especially when the subject is an unknown life form from another planet. Poking it with an electric rod when it sleeps? Seems like a great scientific method! Why not use a forging hammer too, to wake it up real good? Probably end up with the same result! <br/><br/>The alien then grabs the guy's arm, and the whole crew panics, and starts screaming like a troop of little girls at the sight of a tarantula, while spinning around each other. Really? That's who NASA chose to fly to the space station? A bunch of screaming, hysterical preteens who have no clue what to do during an emergency? I'm half wit, and I'd know what to do! I think Melania Trump would handle emergency that better than those ""clownstronauts"".<br/><br/>The straw that broke the camel's back for my part was however, that heroic Ryan Reynolds type (memo to myself: never watch a movie with that guy again, EVER) barging in through the only barrier between the crew and the contaminated area green lantern/deadpool style, to save his fellow electric rod poking scientist-astronaut friend, thus condemning the rest of the crew.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to go into the cheesy Russian accent (it's a miracle they didn't name the Russian female ""astronaut"" ""Boris"" or ""Vladimir"" to perfect the cliché), and the half witted lines written for the general public, who can't tell a difference between a rocket booster and a dill pickle.<br/><br/>The remaining part of the movie I spent hoping the alien would wreck havoc, ingest the whole crew shown in spectacular effects, and eventually remove the entire humanity from the face of the Earth, as obviously, the evolution had at this point gone down a dead end road and would never recover.<br/><br/>This is by far the worst sci-fi production of any time, there is NOTHING to compare with the outstanding Alien movies, anyone who claim so, didn't understand the spirit of those movies.

","Life (2017): When a movie stars both Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds,one would expect a mind blowing one for sure.But Life is nothing like that.It is our typical sci-fi horror which will remind us Ridley Scott's masterpiece Alien.During the period of epic space films like Gravity.Interstellar and The Martian,a film like Life should have some distinct qualities to standout from those but unfortunately Life doesn't have those except from an amazing climax.<br/><br/>Plot: Set on-board the International Space Station, Life kicks off with its crew performing the successful capture of a probe that's returning from Mars with a sample inside. This crew is made up of Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), Sho Kendo (Hiroyuki Sanada), Ariyon Bakare (Hugh Derry), and Katerina Golovkin (Olga Dihovichnaya), and they're ecstatic to learn that the sample includes the first proof of extraterrestrial life. But the organism soon starts to grow and evolve at an alarming rate, and after a test backfires, it becomes hostile, threatening the lives of everyone on board, as well as those on Earth below.<br/><br/>My Review: The problem with Life is that it's almost too aware of the films that have come before, and it always feels like it's striving to be held in the same regard.Life just plods along a bit too predictably. After concocting a gripping enough concept, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are happy to follow the well-worn path of the film's predecessors, as six becomes five, which becomes four, and so on..<br/><br/>Life is termed as horror but it is nowhere a horror.It doesn't even try to be one.It mostly depends on thrills of how the organism attacks its next victim.But what really surprises is its nail-biting,shocking climax which is the life of the movie.That particular scene at the end is spine chilling when we guess the consequences.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as usual as it is a cakewalk for him.Ryan Reynolds is wasted in a small role.Others are decent.Director Espinosa,who earlier directed Child 44 (which is bad) did a decent job by unofficially rebooting Alien with a shocking climax twist.<br/><br/>Cinematography is good and BGM is soul of the film.Especially at the climax,BGM makes sure that we suffocate with tension.<br/><br/>So,Life is like an unofficial reboot of Alien with a shocking climax twist.A decent watch for its thrills.<br/><br/>My rating 6.75/10"

"hdavis-29","3","36","73","5 April 2017"," Unoriginal and Unimaginably Stupid
","If this film were a high school essay it would receive a failing grade for two major reasons. One is its sheer stupidity (more on that in a moment). The other is its lack of originality or – as it's known in school – plagiarism. Is there a rule that says we've got to remake Alien for every new generation? If you love the old ""confined in a small space with a bloodthirsty alien"" routine, go see Alien. Indeed, go see any of its sequels before you waste your time on this not-very-bright remake. If you're a real film historian, then go see It – The Terror From Beyond Space. Despite its silly title, this low-budget 1958 original shows you where the whole Alien franchise got its shtick from.<br/><br/>But by far, the bigger sin here is stupidity. Even the most original film concept couldn't survive a script like this. Suspension of disbelief is one thing. But this goes way beyond that. Consider: these guys are doing the Star Trek thing. They're looking for new life and new civilizations. They're geared to finding new life forms, and we find them eagerly going through what look like soil samples from Mars. So you'd think they'd have some protocols in place just in case they get lucky. Even more, you'd think the people on the mission would show a little sophistication about dealing with possible alien forms of life. And you'd think their vehicle would be designed with the dangers of such possibilities in mind.<br/><br/>So what do we get? The highest priority seems to be naming the alien. Then some clown on the crew actually poking his finger at this not-so-benign looking life form! Ask yourself - if a 10 year old kid finds an orphaned raccoon in the woods and brings it home, what does he do? He names it and tries to pet it. So why can't we expect a little more from this highly trained space crew than that 10-year old kid? And when this alien goes quiet for a while, guess what that space explorer does. He sticks an electric prod into the alien to try to rouse it! It's hard to tell for the rest of the movie whether the creature's behavior towards the crew reflects inherent evil (which the writers conveniently assume) or because it's just plain p*ssed off. Lord knows, I am, and all I did was buy a ticket.<br/><br/>The three stars in my review are for (1) hearing Norman Greenbaum under the closing credits - what an unexpected payday for him! and (2) the CG effects. At least, I'm assuming they're CGIs. If not, I'm even more impressed with the acting job done by somebody's pet octopus. Next to the lab rat, who didn't have much to do before being absorbed, the creature deserves star billing. And FWIW, neither of us could figure out what happened at the end. It was plain the producers were going to pull a Night of the Living Dead ""nothing turns out OK"" ending. But I couldn't even guess the ""logic"" behind how this one went so horribly wrong. Maybe the whole movie is simply meant to be a political satire revealing that ultimately our species is doomed by its own stupidity."

","First of all, this was a great movie, maybe partially because i am a huge fan of this sci-fi/Thriller/Horror genre, movies like Alien, Event Horizon and Sunshine are awesome.<br/><br/>It did however have 3 major flaws<br/><br/>1.The crew seem to have no training in how to handle a security breach, they seem to just be normal people in space, acting on emotions rather than rational thought, this continues throughout the movie.<br/><br/>2. No matter how tough an alien life form could be from evolving on Mars, where our best Theory on Mars history is that Mars used to be allot more habitable, but slowly or maybe even rapidly declined into it current state, there is no way it would so easily be able to manage space, it is -171c and depressurised, if exposed to space for that long, it would at least just freeze solid. <br/><br/>3. The whole ending is made to make room for a sequel, but to what use ? the life form is not only massively overpowered and much more tough and smart than the aliens in Alien form 1979, it is an organism consisting of a complex system between trillions of independent cells, meaning every single cell can become a new big alien. Hence once they crash on earth, given how fast we saw it grow and just absorb other lifeforms and manage to survive extreme conditions, it merely needs to drop itself into the ocean, fall apart and within a day, you would have trillions of them running around after they have all grown up. A Sequel would just need to last 5 min, and its game over."

Yet, in my opinion, Life (2017) has a lot of things going for it that makes quite special in the modern horror genre.<br/><br/>What I mean by that is that he movie never falls in many of the easy old tricks we are so used to in horror films : There are no so-called suspense scene that drags for long minutes, where you're supposed to be scared but in fact you're bored to death because nothing happens. There are no jumps scares. It is not overly gory (just enough). And last but not least, it's a monster movie where the monster doesn't hide off camera or in the dark for 90% of the film.<br/><br/>Instead, everything happens in plain sight of the viewer.<br/><br/>The fact that, without using any tricks, Life (2017) managed to be so scary is, in my opinion, an achievement that very few horror movies have reached.<br/><br/>This is mostly due to the creepy nature of its creature.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, just know that it is a strong, smart-ass piece of filth that will make you reconsider your positive opinion about extraterrestrial life and squids.<br/><br/>The movie is also served by a good cast, excellent cinematography, a creepy yet discrete score and top notch special effect. It is clear that everyone involved put a lot of care and effort into it<br/><br/>Of all the horror movies I've seen in my life (a lot), I can count the finger of my right hand the ones that I can consider really scary.

","Smartest creature ever. Super adaptable, evolutionary. This is by far the bad assiest being ever imagined. The science in the movie was up to my extremely lofty standards. For the first time, ever in a horror movie, this thing could theoretically actually exist makes the movie extremely interesting. The main reason I gave it a 9, is due to the fact, they should have sacrificed the first guy, immediately. I had one other issue, but that would tip spoilers. Other than that, this is a great, thrilling, mind bender of a horror sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>And for those who ridiculously state this was ""like Alien"". This movie had a super intelligent, highly evolved bacteria. This was never done before. Actual physics and biology was implemented. It wasn't just some creature out of the mind of a teenager. The crew were attempting to contain and survive. Never before have I saw a movie, that was about containing an entity while above the planet. This used an actual space station, that is real and does exist. This was not a fairy tale of a movie, as was Alien. No one was hunting this thing down with guns and such. This movie is about what can actually happen as we go frolicking around our solar system. This is something that we should actually be worried about. That is completely ground breaking in every way possible. The Europa Report was closer related to this film, but even that was not as real of a threat as this movie, since it was on a Saturn moon, using theoretical science and fictional equipment. Life used all actual equipment, actual science, and actual crew reactions, although, I would have sacrificed the first guy, immediately and launched the immature state of Calvin at the first sign of an issue. And one last thing, Calvin didn't even kill anyone, except the first guy, who was attempting to incinerate it. I bet in part two, we will find out he is actually peaceful.<br/><br/>This movie was nothing like Alien. Besides the fact that the setting was in space and there was a creature hunting them down (or was he?). The Alien was killing, Calvin was surviving."

","Abroad the International Space Stations a team of six astronauts is preparing for the approach of a probe carrying a most valuable treasure: a cell of alien life. When the scientists try to give life to the cell things seem to go smoothly until the alien life form starts to become conscious and scary events start to unfold.<br/><br/>Not even the fact that I am a huge Sci-Fi and Horror fan, nor my love for the actors involved could manage to save this generic, bland piece of directing that left me utterly uninterested and bored. This feature is an endeavor in terrible character development and embarrassing storytelling that manages to arouse fascination only in small components of an otherwise messy picture.<br/><br/>As much as I am against at turning hate towards filmmakers of films, which should always be appreciated as a work of craftsmanship and effort, I am sadly over Daniel Espinosa. Once OK, twice try again, three times I'm out. He has directed some of the worst and most soulless films of the last years and he has consistently demonstrated to me an inability to control plot or develop character.<br/><br/>This isn't meant to be a hate letter towards anybody or anything, rather than just an analysis of what bad filmmaking is. Lets starts with the camera, possibly the worst part of the picture. Espinosa's camera does not tell a story, it describes a situation. I mean you have possibly the best cinematographer in the world (for me at least), Seamus McGarvey, and you manage to screw that up. There is no philosophy behind the camera. It is just placed around stuff and looks at the situation from the most generic points of views possible. There is no style, no over arching theme given to it. Maybe a couple of repeated patterns, but even then, they are used in different situations and at that point I did not know what to think anymore. The aimlessness of the camera is just enough to take away any grit or interest to this film, it looks like it could have been directed by a computer, there is no rhythm to the shots, no artistic beauty to be taken from a pantheon of images that are almost always in the wrong place.<br/><br/>This has many effects on the movie. Character and plot are a fantasy. Even with only six characters Espinosa struggles to give any of them any relevance. Jake Gyllenhal manages to be the only one to emerge with something but even then, characters are always and only talking and explaining the plot to one another. There isn't half of a decent and genuine conversation, very single scene is exposition time, it almost becomes mind numbing. And this is to be considered even worse once you realize that they are explaining the plot, but you are not understanding it. I was lost by the feature in at least four points. I went to see this with a friend and we had to feed each other almost constantly on what was going on because we didn't understand it. There is no order or hierarchy in how plot points are presented to you (all due to the camera, again!). They introduce one plot point early on then they take it back one hour later, or they do the exact opposite or even worse there is a button that solves the problem. Story and plot are literally put all over the place.<br/><br/>One could also go on in explaining how many things do not make any kind of sense: the plot holes are everywhere, the logic in this people is ridiculous and worst of all the mythology established behind the alien life-from is broken at every further step in its evolution. Then the score, god the score of this film is insanely bad. It is loud and overdone, it does let moments breathe, it's just big drums and heavy music in the moments of tension and high strings in the moments of emotion, my ears were bleeding by the end.<br/><br/>As much as this is a disaster from any kind of emotional or visual point of view, I can give it little moments of premise magic meaning that there are some scenes, mostly early on because then it goes on a train-wreck, that engaged me in the questions they were presenting, the alien life form works really well at the start and the scenes of the sessions with were definitely the best the movie had to offer. Moreover, none of the blame can be shifted to the actors, they are all top tier talents and show it here, none of them give a bad performance they are just surrounded by generic shots that give no context to their performance.<br/><br/>""Life"" is a really bad film and I rarely find myself saying that. I wish all the success in the world to Daniel Espinosa but after this I am out of seeing any film of his from now on, unfortunately his particular vision is one that sits really badly with me and always leaves my mind numbed by the blandness of the visuals and consequently of the feature itself."

On the space station ISS the scientists analyze the creature. It is rapidly growing and starts to get violent really quick to point it out without spoiling anything. What really worked for me was the creature, it was terrifying and mysterious just like the alien and the predator. The acting too is very good, Ryan Reynolds has a lot of charisma and so does Rebecca Ferguson. They really did make me care for them, unfortunately that is the only real detail given to any character. I only cared about Reynolds and Ferguson as they had charisma, Gyllenhaal on the other hand really did let me down. He gives a good performance but his character simply isn't interesting. Unlike 'Alien' which has characters that are like actual real people. 'Life' makes it too easy by just giving the audience two dimensional characters. Some of them have charisma but most of them I fear were plain and dull. The story too is incredibly predictable, you know how everything will play out fairly quickly. This would've been okay if the characters were interesting and likable. Overall this still is a fun sci-fi horror flick with some really scary scenes and charismatic performances.

","This movie isn't even Alien-light. If you're looking for a movie on par with Alien (1979), you should look elsewhere. SPOILERS AHEAD...<br/><br/>The character development is horrible. Personally, I didn't care who lived and who died. There was a particular character that you were expected to sympathize with (I suppose), because his wife just gave birth. However, after seeing the events that led to this character's death, I wasn't remorseful at all.<br/><br/>For a crew full of astronauts/scientists/Ph.D-level personnel, they were pretty stupid. They let emotions get the better of them, even though they surely were trained to follow specific procedures - no matter what. They should have known that any deviation from procedures and protocols could lead to injury or death of themselves or someone else on-board. Well, sure enough...<br/><br/>Yes, the crew did try to anticipate the creature's next move, but while the crew was playing checkers - the creature was playing multi-level chess. This brings me to my next gripe with the movie: The creature was far too smart and calculating. I'm not saying that other life-forms can't be intelligent. However, I'm saying that the creature in this movie became too intelligent...far too quickly. <br/><br/>The creature was also (seemingly) indestructible. Every time a crew member tried to kill the creature, it effortlessly out maneuvered the ""smart"" humans and survived despite impossible odds.<br/><br/>Other annoyances:<br/><br/>I rolled my eyes when the creature attached itself to the disabled crew member's leg. Granted, the man seemed to be paralyzed from the waist down, so he couldn't feel the creature....but couldn't he at least see his pants squirming around?<br/><br/>I rolled my eyes when the Japanese crew member fled to his sleeping pod and he had a straight on view of the creature's face. The animators for the scene even added inward slanted ""eyebrows"" to the creature, to give it an angry human quality. BTW, the overall physical attributes of the create was cringe worthy....(unlike the menacing creature in the Alien movie).<br/><br/>Towards the end, when the remaining two people are developing their ""final plan"", I knew exactly how the movie was going to end. I'm not patting myself on the back, because I often have a ""I didn't see that coming"" moment when watching movies, but the male character gave the audience huge clues as to the outcome of the plan.<br/><br/>Overall, I blame the silly script for the demise of this flick. If you sat through the previews of this movie, you do not need to see any more. Save your time and money on something better."

","In general, horror films tend to follow the same formula: introduce main characters and their friendship, introduce monster, monster kills them off one by one, and there's some kind of twist at the end.<br/><br/>Life follows this formula as well, and there are absolutely no surprises.<br/><br/>The story centers around a group of scientists aboard the International Space Station, who analyze soil samples brought back from Mars and discover a form of life from Mars. They work on it in space so as not to risk Earth, which proves to be a wise precaution as the Mars life form (which is named Calvin by schoolchildren planet- side) grows rapidly and decides it doesn't want to be a lab specimen anymore.<br/><br/>There are many obvious parallels to Alien/Aliens as it is set in space, revolves around a small crew aboard a space vessel getting picked off one by one by a creature, and they can't risk it getting to Earth.<br/><br/>However, at least with Alien we know it's predominantly a horror film with a sci-fi setting. Life, on the other hand, can't seem to decide if it's a sci-fi film that happens to have horror elements, or a horror film that is trying to be a sci-fi film. In the end, it's trying to be both and kinda failing at both.<br/><br/>To be fair, there are some good character moments. Ryan Reynolds is a bright spot in a cast of otherwise one-dimensional characters, and even though Reynolds' space mechanic character is also one- dimensional, at least he's enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast gets fairly cursory character set-up, and by the end you just don't really feel a sense of loss when someone inevitably dies. <br/><br/>Finally, the creature itself, while intriguing when starting out small, turns into a pretty generic space monster by the end, which is fine but breaks no new ground and leaves you feeling kinda blah about the whole thing.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is not terrible, it does not make for painful viewing, nor does it make for edge of the seat thrills. It's a very average film with some big star power attached to draw you in, and if you go into this film knowing this, then you'll be fine."

","""Life"" is a movie directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick about a team of scientists aboard the International Space Station that discover a rapidly evolving life form, that caused extinction on Mars, and now threatens the crew and all life on Earth. Looking at the plot, it seems very similar, if not equal, to Ridley Scott's Alien. It's very much inspired by it and Cuaròn's Gravity, so it's not really an original film. Is it good? Yes. Let me explain, step by step: 1) Directing: the movie starts with an amazing sequence shot in the Space Station, it's impressive and features every character and the ISS, there are a lot of upside-down shots which are beautiful to watch. The overall directing is very well done, it's one of the best things of this movie. 2) Cinematography: the Oscar-nominated Seamus McGarvey directed the photography of the movie and it was well done, with some impressive shots. 3) Acting: while not featuring any Oscar-worthy acting, it's pretty good, especially Jake Gyllenhaal. 4) Atmosphere: since it's very much inspired from Ridley Scott's Alien, people could expect the same kind of atmosphere, but, sadly, this movie doesn't capture the perfect anxious and claustrophobic atmosphere of Alien and you don't really feel tension in all the parts of the movie like in Scott's masterpiece. 5) Horror & Gore: it's not the scariest movie ever, it wasn't particularly scary, actually, it wasn't scary at all for ME (I've heard people being scared by it so this is subjective). It doesn't feature a lot of gore scenes, but there are a couple of violent scenes. Still not the extreme violence of Alien movies. 6) CGI: I found the CGI pretty believable. 7) Alien Form: while it's not an iconic alien creature like Giger's Xenomorph of Scott's Alien, it's interesting. While it's not an original movie, Espinosa's Life is enjoyable by sci-fi/horror fans. Don't expect a masterpiece and you will probably like it."

What do I mean by unrealistic? Well, you expect certain things to happen in a movie or story. You expect characters to behave as their role implies and that's logically consistent - it's just too much and too tedious to get into because this movie is strife with them. I'll give a few examples though *spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>Example 1: After the life-form escapes the lab, the characters do not seem worried and they even joke around even though one of them says 'it could be anywhere.' However, moments ago, while they were watching the brutality of the life-form attack and kill their colleague, they were shocked, scared, and frightened. This is an example inconstant and unrealistic behaviour.<br/><br/>Example 2: The numerous, and extremely lucky escapes of the life-form diminished any suspense that's left over. However, it's not just luck but also how badly designed the ship is, which adds to how unrealistic the whole story is. For instance, when the life-form is trying to escape the lab, they need to shut down the sprinklers one by one.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but you get the picture.

","It's rare for me to watch commercial movies; I decided to take a break from the ordinary. While in reality this film is technically a work of fiction, it is quite possible that similar events could happen in the future. You don't stand to learn extensively from it, but at the same time it touches on some very real and important concepts. I'm taking the time to review it because I thought at minimum it was well worth my time to buy the ticket.<br/><br/>This is essentially a tale of man's desire to explore, and a journey into outer space that turns violent due to the unpredictable nature of life beyond earth.<br/><br/>I think that visually they did an excellent job of simulating spacecraft technology, as well as conditions beyond the earth's gravitational pull. The scenario present certainly reinforces the climate of isolation in space, and challenges involved for humans to exist there.<br/><br/>Several astronauts and scientists recover specimens from Mars and attempt to study them. A particularity specimen initially appears to be in suspended animation, but awakens after being provided conditions that may support life. The specimen slows grows and takes own a life of its own, proving to be both highly adaptable, as well as willing to kill to accomplish whatever agenda it may have, if possibly nothing more than survival, though this is left as speculation to the viewer.<br/><br/>Conditions inside the International Space Station become lethal very quickly, and the astronauts are forced to fight for their lives. Yet at the same time they must balance the need to fulfill their mission as well as their duty to protect the rest of mankind on earth from hostile alien life. This is a very interesting prospect; the idea of a cause great than yourself. Anyone with a conscience would realize that sacrificing a single person is for the greater good when you would otherwise be putting billions of people at risk. And in reality some people, such as those who venture into the frontiers, are occasionally confronted with this decision.<br/><br/>I personally think the ending was more predictable than it should have been. Other than that I would say this is an intriguing and suspenseful piece of entertainment at the very least."

Space station is out of fuel so you're not driving to deep space anyways. Guess what? The ONLY chance remaining... is hoping that re-entry kills it. THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION.

Decaying orbit will bring it down whether it kills the rest of the crew, stays in the space station or is trapped outside of the space station.

","In all fairness, ""Life"" was a good in theory, bad in practice. <br/><br/>How I felt about the movie going in was much different from the experience, and then leaving the theater. I went from, this is kinda cool, spooky, emotional, scary, even more emotional, to a plot twist at the very end that simply was wrong for the movie. That left me with a very poor taste in my mouth about ""Life"", so my review of this movie is focusing on its negative aspects. <br/><br/>First I will start by saying DID have potential, had the writers, producers, and director had not taken the angle that they did. Originally, because of the ending, I had given the movie 2-Stars, but due to the theater's wonderful recliner seating, I was able to muster- up another star.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning, the story was moving way too fast...is this action, drama, horror, comedy, science fiction? I was left aimless trying to figure out which genre to choose from. The character development did become a little more developed as the movie progressed, but it did so at odd and unpredictable times. This left me asking ""What?"" too many times during the film.<br/><br/>Catching a probe carrying Mars soil samples with an 'arm' at that velocity would have torn the arm off the movie-version of the International Space Station. This is where ""believable-fiction"" went straight to ""science-fiction"". <br/><br/>Next, they find a single celled organism in the soil samples, alien in nature, and let's wake it up! I think Ryan Reynolds said it best: ""This is some real Re-Animator s***"". The children of the Earth name it ""Calvin"". In what seems to be an extremely short period of time, ""Calvin"" becomes a multi-cellular organism and starts interacting with its environment. Why? Writer's Scapegoat - it's alien, it has and endless possibility of script-killers!<br/><br/>""Calvin"" goes into survival-psycho-killer mode because the foolish scientist let the gas valves leak into the chamber, injuring our newly found friend, and effectively putting it in a 'coma'. But, like a little kid, let's bathe the creature in even more food and while we are at it, let's take a zapper and start poking at it. No wonder it crushed your hand and tried to kill the whole crew. I'd be pretty pi**ed off too! Really begins to make you wonder what mail-order- university these crew members studied at...<br/><br/>NASA has a backup plan (of course!) of sending a Soyuz capsule as a booster rocket to dispense of the crew (whomever may be left), the creature, and the station to prevent the Earth from being contaminated by ""Calvin"".<br/><br/>This is where it completely defined the movie: The Plot Twist. Plan - get Calvin and Jake Gyllenhaal into an escape pod where he nobly sacrifices his life for mankind, shooting himself and ""Calvin"" into deep space, and have the other female crew member use the second escape pod and get back to Earth safely to live to tell the tale...<br/><br/>Had the movie ended on this note, I may have given it 6, maybe 7 stars (and that is pushing it). Nobility self-sacrifice for the greater good are traits that are hard to come by these days. <br/><br/>BUT NO! Through the cutting between the capsules launching and what was happening inside the capsules, you really BELIEVED this is what was happening. Come to find it was the female crew member's capsule that was flying off into deep space, and Jake Gyllenhaal's capsule splashing down on Earth with him and ""Calvin"" - Apocalypse!<br/><br/>The worst horror-plot twist in existence, and they had to go and put it in ""Life"". <br/><br/>Don't spend the money in the theaters - rent it, get it from Red Box, Netflix, Hulu, or wherever it ends up."

Here's what I wrote:<br/><br/><ul><li>'Life' is a stupid, stupid film.

I feel a pressing need to shame Hollywood for vomiting up such a waste of work hours, all of whose mistakes were completely avoidable, and made purely out of disrespect and, it seems, active contempt for the audience. This film didn't just not need to be made, it needed to not be made.

"jtindahouse","8","17","37","23 March 2017"," A modern day 'Alien' made with a lot of class
","I was not surprised to read that 'Life' was inspired by 'Alien'. WIthout calling it a remake or a reboot, it is basically a modern day re-imagining. By the time I was old enough to watch 'Alien' it had aged a little too much for me to truly appreciate it, and so I felt I kind of missed the boat. There is something very unique about space films. Because it is something that very few of us will ever get to experience in our lives, and yet remains a very realistic film subject, it can be quite a wonderful thing to watch a movie about. Even without the prospect of aliens it is quite an unsettling environment. Throw aliens (and dangerous ones at that) into the mix and you should have a hell of a film.<br/><br/>Having said that there is no guarantee of high quality simply based on that premise. You still need a talented set of filmmakers to make it work. 'Life' obviously had those though, because it is a very fine film. Firstly, it's quick to get about its business. One thing I do remember about the original 'Alien' is that it took a long time to get going. That is not an issue here. Secondly, the film's creature is created in such a way that it feels particularly realistic. It is very menacing, yet also very grounded and believable in a way that is hard to explain exactly. Only by watching the film will you truly understand what I mean.<br/><br/>It is a well paced film too. At no stage does the story stall. An impressive cast also does a good job of keeping the audience tuned in. One character played by Olga Dihovichnaya was quite hard to understand at times with a very heavy accent, however that would be the only acting fault I noticed. Then to top off an already fine film, there is a very fun and interesting ending that will be heavily discussed I suspect. 'Life' is a very well made, tense, interesting and thoughtful film that I see the majority of audience members thoroughly enjoying."

","We need to talk about Calvin, the first evidence of extraterrestrial life, a single cell collected from Mars (named by one of earth children through space to earth live beaming), is retrieved by a six- member crew in the International Space Station in director Daniel Espinosa's ALIEN + GRAVITY hybridization, LIFE, a by-the-number claustrophobic space-capsule horror, hits every blasé note in its story development, so much so that, the only twist crops up in its anti-climatic ending, but by that point, audience's interest is virtually evaporated.<br/><br/>As a moderately budgeted Sci-Fi thriller (around $ 58 million), the film's open gambit is its expansive space shots patterning after GRAVITY, but less awe-inspiring by default. The crew's initially effusive atmosphere is soon dissipated when they find out that Calvin, a fast growing creature embodies a (unsurprising) tentacular form, evolving into an indestructible predator with high intelligence, where the high-minded crew members are being singled out one by one as its sustenance. When eventually it is down to our two protagonists Dr. David Jordan (Gyllenhaal), the American senior medical officer and Dr. Miranda North (Ferguson), the British Quarantine Officer (not that Japanese father, who has never met his newborn daughter; or the Russian captain, or the black biologist), to preclude Calvin from reaching our homeland, a bold plan is propounded with true grit and self-sacrifice, but when all bets are off, can lesser mortals truly outmaneuver Calvin, a shorthand of the universe's oceanic profoundness, inscrutability and threat? <br/><br/>As mediocre as the final product is - the script is painfully by rote (although it is a fair surprise to kill off a name star as the first casualty, I guess the paycheck is not fat enough); all six characters are bland, stand-up guys who are more than willing to die for others when the crunch arrives, no personal complex is unearthed to compound their danger, thus, we have no one to blame but Calvin, a conglomeration of intelligence and primitivity (it can outguess its human rivals in every step but cannot stay put for a minute to fight against its predatory instinct); the score is plain pedestrian while its slithering cinematography being predominantly curbed by the set's limited space. - time and again, LIFE does forewarn us in the face of unknown mystery, we shouldn't get too psyched, as broken-easily as we are, we might just as well prepare ourselves fully for the worst scenario."

","In 1979, Ridley Scott's Alien made such a quintessential impact on both the genres of horror and sci-fi, remaining to this day as the perfect example of how to blend the two so effectively. There have been many films that have taken inspiration from Scott's classic, the latest being Daniel Espinosa's Life, a sci-fi horror set a little closer to home.<br/><br/>Aboard the International Space Station, a six-member crew perform the successful capture of a probe returning from Mars with a soil sample. Amongst the sample, the crew find the first proof of extraterrestrial life, which they begin to study. When the organism, named Calvin by people back on Earth, shows how far it'll go to survive, the crew realise they, as well as all life on Earth, are in serious danger.<br/><br/>I have to say that I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Life overall, much more than I thought I would as a matter of fact. Yes, the film hardly reinvents the wheel when it comes to sci-fi horror, and it certainly borrows elements from other films of the same ilk however, Life deserves a chance for managing to keep me on the edge of my seat right up until the film cuts to the end credits.<br/><br/>The film lacks originality in its story, a crew fighting for survival against an alien life form having been done so many times before, but the film is smart with the majority of its dialogue as well as knowing that it has to deliver characters that we are going to care about. Life definitely does so, taking the time to introduce us to the crew before the main event occurs.<br/><br/>The film's visuals aid Espinosa in creating a tense and claustrophobic environment aboard the International Space Station, Seamus McGarvey's cinematography swiftly taking us from compartment to compartment, akin to Calvin's movement throughout the film. Speaking of Calvin, I thought the design and effects both played a major part in making me enjoy the film more, Calvin blending in with the surroundings rather than sticking out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Life doesn't feature anything outstanding by any means. What it does feature is a cast you know you're going to get good performances out of, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson. I was worried about Sony wanting to have Reynolds do his Deadpool gimmick, just in space, but thankfully they avoided that. <br/><br/>Like I've said, Life hardly reinvents the wheel in any shape or form but I had plenty of fun watching this film unfold, a film that went up in my estimations with the ending they decided to go with. If you're looking for tense evening at the cinema and like a bit of gore in your horror, Life is definitely a film you might find some fulfilment from."

I had high hopes, but they were sorely crushed 20 minutes into the film.<br/><br/>For people who have been in space, one of them for 400+ days straight, they seem to have lost logical thinking. Considering they've created several firewalls to prevent this thing from reaching Earth, it boggles my mind why they make it so easy for the alien life form to whip their butts.<br/><br/>Not to mention the fact that leaving a fellow astronaut without communication and no idea of where the alien is, would be prone to be a big issue. Case in point when Sho somehow knows the Soyuz is coming ""to the rescue"" and have no idea about the third firewall? Shouldn't that be information available to all crew? This is not Weyland-Yutani - and they've all agreed the life form must not reach Earth... Ugh. Annoys the heck out of me.<br/><br/>The ending, while I do enjoy the occasional disaster ending. This would have been a lot more satisfying, had they done everything right on the ISS and that the life form was just outsmarting them at every turn.

","""Life"" takes place on the international space station orbiting Earth, where an international crew of astronauts and PhDs are investigating soil samples that just arrived from Mars (in a manner than defies all the known laws of physics and chemistry). They discover an alien life-form and help it grow into a monster that eats them all.<br/><br/>The film sucks on multiple levels and watching it felt like having voluntarily exposed myself to 2 hours of psychological torture. There are no characters to root for because they are all both incredibly stupid and equally helpless. The creature is both smarter than all of them combined and physically indestructible. At no point in the film do you feel that the characters stand a chance of survival. <br/><br/>The creature develops out of a single cell and within a few days it knows how to operate complex technology and how to psychologically manipulate humans, with the single purpose of eating them all alive. It's as if Albert Einstein, Hannibal Lector and The Hulk were fused inside the body of an indestructible, headless octopus, that just happens to be helped at every turn by an incredible set of coincidences. And while you waste time asking yourself ""How?"" and ""Why?"" people keep getting eaten. The film ends with the alien finding a way to steer itself to earth in a capsule. At that point you can only imagine that it proceeded to devour and brutally dismember every living thing on earth. <br/><br/>Now I find myself asking why does this film even exist? It appears to have been made for the sole purpose of allowing audiences the ""pleasure"" of seeing around 10 people being brutally and very graphically devoured by an alien organism. Nevertheless, there are two possible ""points"" that the director was trying to make, none of which I like or agree with. <br/><br/>1) Humans are weak because they suffer from things such as morality, empathy and curiosity - whereas the alien just wants to kill everything it comes into contact with. The humans seem to get into endless trouble during the film every single time they try to help one another. The message is clear: looking after yourself is good and caring for others only makes things worse. <br/><br/>2) A number of times in the film Jake Gyllenhaal talks about his time as a medic in Syria during the civil war. He got so disappointed in humans on earth that he now feels more comfortable in space, away from all the mess. But what he finds in space is a lot worse and it ultimately destroys him and all life on earth. The message: there's horror on earth, but trying to escape it only makes things worse and brings even more horror.<br/><br/>Politically speaking, this makes the film an ode to libertarian conservatism, to staying put, to not asking uncomfortable questions, to minding your own business, to self-interest, and to passively accepting that this is what ensures the best of all possible worlds. To this I say: go watch something else."

","Everything in this movie is predictable, except one aspect. It's the same old plot and characters. Even the alien is unoriginal. As always in Hollywood, the black man is the first casualty. However, and this is the new twist this film brings to the genre, the black man isn't killed outright early on, he's maimed. Then he dies. BUT HEY! He is brought back to life, only to be maimed again! BUT, that's not all! He's dies again! This time he's dead for good though. Thankfully, the torture is over. On another point, the commander, a woman who you would think would be a great Hollywood heroine, only becomes a feeble run of the mill delicate woman. When the S#^% hits the fan, a woman needs a strong brave man (Of course!) to take control of the terrible situation. Now, I'm not a social critic movie watcher. It's just that this movie was so predictable that it was these two elements that struck me as most notable. Any rating above a 6 is being very generous. Rent Alien again instead."

","""A team of scientists aboard the International Space Station whose mission of discovery turns to one of primal fear when they find a rapidly evolving life form that caused extinction on Mars, and now threatens the crew and all life on Earth."" So many people will watch the trailer of ""Life"" and immediately compare it to Ridley Scott's Alien. There definitely maybe some similarities, but ""Life"" is a brilliant SCI-FI Thriller that has you on the edge of your seat. People will also compare it to gravity, but it's not like Gravity either.<br/><br/>The acting from from the cast was really good. Everyone did their part perfect. Despite the fact that Ryan Reynolds is only in it for the first 20 mins of the film he is definitely the most memorable, and is no Dead Pool! Reynolds also gives you a scene you will never forget. The CGI was excellent, the cinematography was good, the direction was done, the pacing was also excellent...there was never a dull moment. Each scene left you wandering what would happen next and when Calvin (the life organism) was going to attack and how much he was growing bigger and smarter! It's definitely the best space survival flick we have seen in a long time, and the ending was so unexpected! A very enjoyable thrill ride and maybe not for the faint of heart, but definitely worth seeing. 4/5 stars. Jay And Nick -The Autistic Reviewers. Check us out on facebook and Instagram!"

","--Spoilers Ahead--<br/><br/>This is a movie about a really smart Octopus from Mars. His name is Calvin. He starts out as a single cell organism that has been frozen in the Martian dirt for Billions of years. The really smart scientists in the ISS orbiting the Earth catch him in a baseball glove as he's flying through the air in a baseball that has been thrown from Mars. They then raise the temp of the dirt from the seams of the baseball and Calvin comes to life. Then they decide he's really great cause they have been dreaming of aliens from Mars since they were all kids and saw Mars Attacks at the movies. They all love Calvin, he's the best! But oh, oh, Calvin gets really angry after putting on a little more weight and size and gets tired of the really smart scientists screwing with him, so he crushes his favorite really smart scientist's hand into jello. Oh, my! Actually I think he's just mad 'cause nobody fed him since he's been on the ISS. Anyway he starts being really mean and decides since there's no octopus food in the ISS, he's just gonna eat the food that's available. That would be the really smart scientists.<br/><br/>Soon we discover that the really smart scientists aren't really too smart, neither was the writer of the movie, or the... well, anybody involved in bringing this mess to the screen. Because we have to suspend our beliefs and logic as we watch Calvin outsmart the really smart scientists over and over again. One RSS(really smart scientist) tries to burn Calvin alive with a blow torch but Calvin is a Super Octopus and he's invulnerable to anything that kills other carbon based life. So while he's surviving the blow torch, the Halon fire suppression system activates and Calvin escapes into the Halon pipe before it closes. The problem here is that he went into a system full of a gas that completely removes Oxygen from the air, this is a closed system with no way for Super Calvin to escape, the outer valve is closed and there is nothing but Halon tanks at the other end. Hmmm. <br/><br/>At one point they finally get Calvin out of the space station but Super Calvin doesn't succumb to the mega freezing temps or the vacuum of space. He was frozen on Mars (which is much warmer than the vacuum of space) but not here. I still haven't figured out how he got back in the space station, Maybe i fell asleep during that segment.<br/><br/>Anyway Calvin killed all the RSS's and flew the rocket ship back to the Earth and landed in the Pacific and lived happily ever after with the rest of the Octopi. The End <br/><br/>Oh BTW, the review part: This movie is ridiculous."

Sure.<br/><br/>The spacecraft has returned from Mars carrying soil samples that may contain alien life forms. The good news is that the space station has a special isolation lab and a full-time Quarantine Officer.

The cute little alien, which school children back on earth have named ""Calvin"" and over which everyone on the space station oohs and ahhs, quickly becomes a juvenile delinquent and starts attacking the astronauts. Rather than keep it isolated, the astronauts insist on opening and closing the containment door and then try to kill it with a giant blowtorch. (Open flames on a space station? No problem.) During all of this, no one seems interested in letting the folks on earth know what is going on. When they finally decide to, the radios stop working.<br/><br/>And, the astronauts problems are made worse because the space station is low on fuel, which no one seems to have noticed or cared about until it becomes critical. When the Quarantine Office realizes their decaying orbit may force the space station back to earth, she thinks about it for a moment and with a look of surprise, says, ""We won't survive re-entry."" In a space station? Really? REALLY?<br/><br/>All of this continues for 90 minutes, with the astronauts making one bad decision after another.

","Firstly, let me say that I am a stickler for reality. I went into this movie with somewhat ""higher"" expectations. I say ""higher"", because as this movie was taking place on the International Space Station, I had at least SOME expectations that the people NASA puts in these places, would be the smartest and best of what humanity has to offer. Sadly, this is not the case. Just like our college grads these days, they take dumb to a whole new level, where emotions rule the day instead of brains. It's a ""risk everyone's life to try and ""save"" a person who has just been contaminated with a foreign microbe/life form"" scenario. The combined IQ on that station couldn't have topped 100. It started out with so much promise, and kept me glued to the screen for about the first 40 or so minutes. Then after that, I was kicking myself for wasting the $20 for the flick and popcorn. I suppose if I were drunk or high on some drugs I would give this a higher rating and not cared about the bad writing and asinine situations. Thank god Hollywood writers will never find themselves in a situation requiring the grey matter to keep humanity safe. With a little over 20 minutes left in the movie, I was just wishing that some big asteroid would come along and just wipe the station out of existence, so I could spend the remainder just watching station parts float by. It would have been more kind, and eased the misery a little."

","I made an account specifically to rate this movie and write a review.<br/><br/>This is the most nonsensical, most illogical sci-fi, or just any movie, I have ever seen. It tries to be scientific but it fails catastrophically at that. Like, it's apparent that humans somehow know the probe is going to bring back life from Mars and so Miranda NORTH has made some contingency plans in case things go SOUTH. Only, those plans are so useless that I can come up with a better plan in under 1 minute. Make a modular lab that in case of a containment breach can simply be detached from the space station and sent towards deep space or the sun. Done. No need for firewalls 2, 3, 4, 5, 100.<br/><br/>Characters, who by the way are as interesting as a sack of potatoes, do the stupidest things imaginable, state ""facts"" just to break them 1 minute later, contradict themselves at every turn, constantly break protocol and just avoid using common sense as much as possible. Damn, one of them even hides the alien, let's it feed on his leg and smuggles it in a room with all the rest of his living colleagues even after it broke his arm, brutally killed his best friend and, hell, even his captain sacrificed her life to prevent it from coming back to the station. And you know why he did that? Because.<br/><br/>The alien apparently needs oxygen but it doesn't need oxygen. Yes, you read that right. First, it's shown that it can store oxygen for prolonged periods of time. But then, it's shown that it can't survive without oxygen for prolonged periods of time, thus they bait it with oxygen sticks. I mean, it could just ""suck"" one of them and go about it's business killing people or whatever.<br/><br/>And the logical fallacies just keep piling on and on.<br/><br/>You probably think I'm one of those scientist-wannabes who get angry at even the slightest mistakes and constantly nitpick movies. But I'm not. I could have overlooked a couple of mistakes but they are just so much and so glaring, it's incredibly annoying. You know, if this movie didn't try so hard to be scientific, I suppose I could rate it with like a 3 or 4. It would still suck but not as much. But as it stands, it's a movie you should avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>TL;DR - the only reason to watch this movie is if you are getting paid for it."

When will Hollywood realise that not everyone is a complete moron and the days of 90s and naughties style Hollywood science are long gone?<br/><br/>There are too many logical holes in this movie, it was ruined for me the second the returning probe was ""caught"" but I carried on. Here are some of the worst pieces of ridiculous, laughably unrealistic nonsense seen regarding just a single aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>1. Communications.<br/><br/>They're on the ISS in orbit around the earth however for some reason ""the transmitter"" breaks. They have a single comms system up there? Yeah, not buying it. They will likely have multiple main and backup comms systems up there using a bunch of technologies and probably some systems that could be used (escape pods) assuming the absolute worst happened. They have high speed Internet up there! They could literally Skype NASA, or bounce a signal off a satellite. Or a sat phone? I'll bet they have dozens of steerable dishes and transmitters/ receivers to pick up and blast out signals across a massive spectrum. Comms will be so utterly critical I'm sure the ISS could be blown to pieces and on fire and they could still find a way to phone home.<br/><br/>Astronauts have their days scheduled out, I wouldn't be surprised if they literally had to wait for a p*** break inbetween carrying out set tasks. Therefore to not hear ANYTHING from NASA or anyone else is utterly ridiculous on a normal day. During one of the greatest moments of mankind you probably wouldn't be able to shut them up and the astronauts themselves would be on a VERY short leash, giving feedback and waiting for instructions from rooms full of expects. The casual ""hmm, we seem to have accidentally killed the alien life form... Electrocute it?"" ""I guess, go for it"". Is just hopelessly ridiculous.<br/><br/>Why does it seem logical that these scientists (and one in particular) just get left to it? It would have been more realistic if this had been set on Mars where transmission delay could have been used for some plot based fun or multiple critical comms failures would have been a little more plausible and the distance and journey time could explain why they're acting like idiots the whole time.<br/><br/>The ""coolant"" leaks from the transmitter rendering it useless (thanks alien). I work in broadcast so I can tell you on earth the only coolant needed to push a signal up to a sat is a couple of (redundant) ac units to keep the (redundant) amps at a reasonable temperature. We've been sending date via satellites for a while now, we've got it down its not that big a deal. Seen how small sat phones are now? We certainly don't need to cool amps down which are in orbit. Coolant needed to cool stuff below absolute zero? You sure about that? It's cold outside, how about some heatsinks? (assuming the Hollywood science was even vaguely legit). In fact the kit in satellites need to be kept above absolute zero as it is bad for components to get that cold. It would have been more plausible if they'd said ""ah no! The heaters in the transmitter have gone down! We're so boned!"" Not that that's too realistic either...<br/><br/>Just don't watch this piece of garbage."

Just watch the first half of a scene then you write down the most obvious outcome and you'll be right 99% of the time, that other 1% its because there was an even more obvious outcome that you were too smart to even consider and that was the one they chose in the movie.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil it because anyone with half a brain could predict it during the movie, but there is one point where you're like ""oh man, if he figures out the solution with this stupid thing they're showing then I'm walking out of the theater."" Then 5 minutes later after you've been like ""well it was terrible but at least they didn't use that stupid plot device"" thats when they spring it on you! Then at the end something happens which is so obvious that I bet a million dollars on it occurring (unfortunately nobody took the bet, they probably thought it was a figure of speech) and I was right. Wish I would have predicted how stupid the movie was, wouldn't have that million dollars but I'd have saved the $7 for the ticket."

","--- Read this if you're looking for a non-traditional rant only ---<br/><br/>I had seen on trivia that this movie is inspired by the original Alien (1979). Immediately I thought Life has to have strong atmospheric element to it; characters which form a real team; scenes which require a bit of maturity and patience from viewer as to allow plot to develop more fully, etc.<br/><br/>There's nothing of that sort here. I feel uncomfortable writing Alien and Life in the same sentence (there it goes). Life is not even a horror. I'm usually easily scared but haven't find even one second of this movie scary; or entertaining. I would not even call it science-fiction since only reasonable science in here is scientific terms protagonists use repetitively in order to sound sophisticated when in reality all six of them are a shame to every astronaut who has ever lived.<br/><br/>All of you who have already seen at least one great sci-fi movie have nothing to look for here. Those who haven't... well, you have nothing to look forward here as well. But what is Life's ultimate purpose? Thousands of philosophers tried to answer this one... Seriously, this movie's only goal is to make you feel awestruck about how amazing modern science is. And I believe most of us are already sick with it.<br/><br/>OK, so Life fails when it comes to making you scared or interested but instead fills you with scientific gibberish it presents. Can Life then make you feel sad at least? Unfortunately, yes.

"galahad58-1","6","12","28","26 March 2017"," Cliché after Cliché
","Life is a movie filled with clichés and obvious scenes taken straight from Alien.<br/><br/>We have the usual science fiction cliché where scientists are going to bring an alien life form (that probably will kill all of mankind) into play no matter the cost. Of course, one of them will say that studying this alien may lead to the discovery of life and maybe even the cure for disease.<br/><br/>We have the usual cliché were one of the scientists will do anything to protect the alien even though it is killing his friends and may destroy all life - with the typical ""if is just trying to survive"" line.<br/><br/>In Alien: Dallas and Lambert are bringing back Kane after he is attacked by an alien. Ash lets them on the ship even though Ripley warns about contamination. In this movie, Hugh is attacked by the alien and Rory ignores all the warnings and enters the lab creating the chain of events to allow the alien to attack. Now, doesn't anyone wonder how the person in charge of security just allows this breach of protocol? Another science fiction cliché.<br/><br/>In Alien: Ash protects the creature by letting it live inside of Kane and does not tell anyone. In Life, Hugh lets the alien feed off of his body so that it can survive and does not tell anyone. Again with the idiotic scientist who wants to keep the alien alive to study it.<br/><br/>In Alien: somehow (the most ridiculous scene in a great movie) the alien knows Ripley is going to go onto the escape craft and is inside. In this one the alien is lured into the escape craft, but same premise.<br/><br/>In Alien: somehow the idiotic company makes an escape craft that will only fit three people - that was another dumb aspect of a great movie. In Life: there are two escape crafts, but only one person per craft. No space program is going to have an escape plan where only 2/6 can survive and the rest are left for dead. Another cliché.<br/><br/>In The Thing: an alien is frozen and in hibernation. The scientists go to study it and it thaws out and kills everyone. In life: the cell is frozen and in hibernation. The scientists thaw it out to study it and it kills people. Another cliché.<br/><br/>In Life: somehow the alien knows to knock out communications. Now I do not care how smart something is - it was a single celled organism at the beginning of the movie and no matter how intelligent it is - it does not have a grasp of technology in any way, shape or form. That this creature figures out how to get to the communication array from the lab is a joke - that it knows to knock out communications is a joke - that it knows to destroy the coolant in the commander's space suit to create a situation to get back onto the ship - that it takes over the escape pod and flies it to Earth - these are the things that are insulting at times to viewers. Another cliché about super smart aliens who know everything.<br/><br/>So the question you have at the end is: why did this creature just go on a killing spree? Hugh says that it has to kill to survive - but why? It was not eating them to survive - it was just killing for the sake of destruction and chaos. Even in Alien - it had a reason - it was taking people to reproduce. In the Thing - it was on a mission to take over the planet. There is no reason in this film.<br/><br/>On a positive - the film looked good and it was good for a late night rental if you enjoy the genre. It is nothing original and the script (and acting) will not redefine anything about science fiction. It is not a classic type movie that you will look back on in time and it will not be influential for future movies."

It is, except in this case, the movie utterly fails in the end with a terribly predictable ending. The characters are cookie cutters and just watching you'll know whose going to die. The Japanese Astronaut's wife just had a baby, the American is a cold woman who came up with the firewall protocol, Ryan Reynolds is his usual one dimensional wise cracking self. The Alien itself is quite lovely to begin with and an original design. But everything here is an unoriginal, paint by the numbers movie. There are a few goofs as well such as only intermittently seeing the characters breath when the station goes cold. This could have been a great movie, instead it's a if I never see it or think of it ever again, I'll be fine.

","If you have been around the science fiction film block a reasonable number of times, you will almost certainly see that the premise of ""Life"" is heavily derived from the movie ""Alien"". But originality in Hollywood these days is a rare thing, and I was open to seeing the same story again as long as it was done with style and a few original touches. Unfortunately, the end results pretty much lack those ingredients. The first third or so of the movie is surprisingly dull - the movie can't find awe and wonder about the premise of finding alien life from another planet, believe it or not. Then when the alien lifeform subsequently becomes a threat, you would think there would be plenty of scares and tense moments. But surprisingly, that's not the case. The so-called terror feels... well... flat. I think a big reason for that is that the human characters are not well developed. They are so bland that it's hard to care about them and feel the so-called terror that they are experiencing. The only saving grace the movie has are a few good special effects, though there are also some special effect moments that comes across as surprisingly crude and clunky (bad CGI rears its ugly head in a Hollywood movie once more!)

"ashishagupta","2","10","23","18 June 2017"," Creature Feature Genre Breacher
","Science fiction movies of late have adopted a trend of pandering to the masses. Instead of creating a piece of art that has viewers pondering, debating and struggling to understand for several years to follow, the movies of this new genre are designed to have the shelf life of the popcorn eaten during its viewing. This cross-cutting and encompassing novel genre is Mediocre Crass.<br/><br/>The foundation of science fiction is making the plausible into possible and writing a What-If story based on this transmutation. The operative word here is plausibility. It stems from certain pattern of rules that govern the universe in which is story is set. The Fantasy genre relinquishes the limitations of our current universe and creates an alternate universe to facilitate a different pattern of rules, which in turn allows for different set of plausibilities. Highly regarded Fantasy works go to incredible lengths to meticulously create consistent and sensible alternate rules for their universe. The point being that even the Fantasy genre does not permit nonsensical random chaotic events.<br/><br/>Life (2017) is a science fiction story, set in our time on the International Space Station (ISS). The principal backdrop of this story is the ongoing Mars exploration, particularly search for life on Mars, which confers this movie its title.<br/><br/>Here is how science fiction works, the part about playing with plausibility. An average teenager, with no similarity to kids who actually end up being astronauts and scientists, can end up on the ISS. Very unlikely given any set of circumstances, but okay, I can buy into that, if the story provides even a tenuous plot. This teen can suddenly develop the knowledge and skills to operate the ISS. Pushing it, but sure, why not, brain implant or something, it is Sci-Fi after all. The story is pushing the limits of our suspension of disbelief but it is still in the realms of the plausible becoming possible.<br/><br/>Now consider the converse. Current ISS astronauts and specialists, who all have advanced degrees and advanced training and advanced intellect and advanced experience and advanced selection procedures, etc etc etc. suddenly become average teenagers. Not just regular average teenagers, but the Hollywood dumb teenager in a gore horror flick type. Now this is not plausible. This kind of nonsense would not be acceptable in even a Fantasy genre.<br/><br/>The way that most successful Sci-Fi movies have allowed for dumb teenagers to frolic with aliens in a gore fest in space is by placing the story well into the future and way far away from Earth. In this space and time, the crew of space vessels is not the creme de la creme of scientists but just your regular average folks. So a drunk abusive psychotic freight ship captain on Earth's seas is now a drunk abusive captain of a space freight ship. Now, the retarded behavior of people in the gore fest has become plausible. Highly annoying and unlikely, but plausible.<br/><br/>I can't help feeling that movies such as Life (2017) is like a revenge of the retards on the nerds. In the past, Sci-Fi provided much needed catharsis for nerds to have a laugh at the monumental stupidity of 'jocks' when placed in a new challenging environment. The gore fest was oddly satisfying, where the dumb jocks of this world finally got their just deserve for tormenting the nerds in real life. Movies like Life (2017), are made by the dumb jocks and for the dumb jocks to watch nerds being tormented on the big screen, as well.<br/><br/>You will either like this movie or feel deeply insulted by it. It depends on which group you identify with, jocks or nerds."

","If you did not like the Alien movies, then this is the movie you so richly deserve. <br/><br/>The movie starts very promisingly, and quickly devolves into melodrama and mayhem. A key character takes an ""executive decision"", and pretty much leaves the audience bereft. This also has the effect of leaving the rest of the space team unhinged, which explains the terrible decisions they take throughout the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Honestly, a bunch of Boy Scouts would have handled the crisis better - said crisis consisting of an alien life-form, nicknamed Calvin, that turns out to be far less cute than the name suggests. Calvin is a bad boy who wants nothing more than to...I'm not sure, since Calvin's motivations are not spelled out here, other than to perhaps create chaos. When the strongest emotional point in a movie is the death of a white rat, you know the movie has unsolvable issues. <br/><br/>Calvin suffers from a bad case of CGI-itis, glaringly obvious in many scenes. The movie cast suffers from a lousy script, bad writing, and a clear aversion to actual acting. The movie in general has a strong disinclination to be nothing more than a poor rip-off of Alien and Gravity."
"handle1973","4","7","15","28 March 2017"," Plot hole central
","ONLY SLIGHT SPOILER INCLUDED<br/><br/>So I finally got around to seeing ""LIFE"" tonight. It starts off pretty much straight into the story with little unnecessary build up and character introduction which worked well and gets you kinda hooked from the start, the pace then slows a little whilst the Mars discovery builds in both size and intelligence and then the trouble starts for both the crew of the international space station and unfortunately the audience too! Visually it all looks good but the plot becomes increasingly irrelevant. My first problem is with Rebecca Ferguson's position as an on board CDC Doctor apparently in charge of quarantine and failing miserably (in particular regards to what Ryan Reynolds character decides to do). My next big problem with it (without giving too much away) is at one point the creature voluntarily decides to go on a bit of a space walk without seeming to struggle in the freezing vacuum of space at all! Not long after that the crew of scientists, doctors and let's face it actual rocket scientists came up with their brilliant plan to rid themselves of the creature! Which in turn left me wondering if they'd all suffered from a severe lack of oxygen making them all stupid, because I know they had just witnessed and even commented on what I had just seen. After lots of running around sealing doors over and over only to discover it didn't quite work as planned we come to the end scene. This was the worst part of the film, not only did they very poorly and blatantly try and fail to mislead the viewer, but did so by insulting the audience presuming everyone watching is stupid."

"cliff_bd","4","7","15","23 March 2017"," Remake of Quatermass?
","*******Contains spoilers****<br/><br/>I found this movie extremely frustrating and predictable. I am amazed that Ryan Reynolds agreed to be in the movie. However, Reynolds part in the movie was relatively small as he was the first to be killed off, I can only assume he requested this.<br/><br/>The movie is about discovering a life form on another planet (in this case Mars) and bringing it back to Earth orbit in a space station .. it is similar to the Quatermass story in this regard<br/><br/>The frustrating part of the movie is, astronauts cannot are really this stupid, if they are, then mankind has no future in space.... let me explain.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film repeatedly talks about the ""firewalls"" and the importance of quarantine. But shortly after the life form has been discovered and starts growing at an extremely alarming rate (alarm bells!!), the life form expert (Ariyon Bakare) makes a silly mistake, does not follow protocol and puts the whole crew at risk. Ryan Reynolds than charges into the quarantine area to fix the issue.<br/><br/>Secondly, they have discovered a life form, which is the first ever positive confirmation that life exists outside of Earth. So what do they do? They electrocute the life form and then wonder why it starts attacking the crew (or defending itself?)<br/><br/>Thirdly, after they electrocute the life form and it starts showing a aggressive reaction (surprise!) the life form expert (Ariyon Bakare) is attacked and falls unconscious. Reynolds character (again) charges into the quarantine area and pushes the unconscious Ariyon Bakare out. This results in Reynolds being told by Rebecca Ferguson character, ""you can't come out!!"" Why was allowed to enter the quarantine area in the first place?? – this takes me neatly back to my first sentence of this review......Exit Reynolds :)<br/><br/>Fourthly, this worst part of the movie is when the third ""firewall"" kicks in, which is a ship sent from Earth to push the space station into deep space to stop the life from reaching Earth. The scenes during this part of the movie are ridiculously confusing. Basically Hiroyuki Sanada character tries to get into the ship to escape, and this results in the ship breaking up and pushes to space station back into Earth Orbit. .. Great job of protecting humanity guys!!<br/><br/>The rest of the movie continues on this downward spiral of silly mistakes an amateur astronaut would avoid doing and in the end the life form gets back to Earth (Surprise!! (again)) after a totally ridiculous scene where the last 2 survivors jump into escape pods (and again) completely mess up, sending the alien back to Earth while the escape pods that was supposed to go Earth is pushed out into deep space with Rebecca Ferguson's character in it!<br/><br/>I came out of the movie theatre feeling cheated this is 104 minutes of my life I will never get back<br/><br/>Avoid this movie at all costs"

Spoiler Alert Having been around aviation for decades and personally knowing an ISS Astronaut I can guarantee you that the agencies involved with the ISS would not send such a bunch of under-qualified, over-emotional, dumb asses like this crew anywhere near the ISS. Real life Astronauts are the brightest of the bright whereas the ""crew"" in this movie are anything but! So many holes and gaps in the plot I do not have enough room here to list them all. Suffice it to say this is a poorly put together movie. The Ryan Reynolds character Rory Adams would not have made it passed the first psych eval and obviously is not smart enough to follow protocols. Deserved to die! The character Hugh Derry played by Bakara was just not a clever man given he was supposed to be a crack biologist! Not professional in any way. Deserved to die! David Jordan/Jake Gyllenhaal is another emotional cripple and would have been weeded out of the Astronaut program in real life very early on. Neither of the women are strong characters which the exact opposite of real life women in the space program.

"jds_grl_7","8","9","21","12 April 2017"," Sci-Fi-Themed Thriller
","Continuing my foray into sci-fi films, I recently went to see the movie Life, starring Hiroyuki Sanada, Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson, Jake Gyllenhaal, Olga Dihovichnaya, and Ariyon Bakare. Before I went to see it, I identified the movie as ""that space movie with Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal."" While that description is accurate, the film actually stars all six main actors equally. Truthfully, I am disappointed that there isn't more of Ryan Reynolds; he plays one of the most, let's say, ""infrequent"" characters. I was impressed with how pretty much equal airtime is given to every one of the characters, and the audience is not forced to focus on only one character's timeline throughout. I guess in a storyline based entirely on the International Space Station there isn't much room for extremely varied plot lines.<br/><br/>I have to imagine that, while the cost to make this film was probably beyond my greatest guess, they must have saved some money by basically only having to pay six actors. IMDb lists only 17 cast members, 11 of which simply being extras, and the stars are a mix of unknown and popular actors. Even though there are only six main characters, any actual character development and exposition is lacking, although there are some slight attempts.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, they get right into it really quickly. In the opening scenes I had the feeling that the events that transpired before this movie could have been their own movie altogether, and we were just coming in in the middle. The ending is equally as notable, and an audience is left with the potential for a sequel. The ending in particular came as quite a surprise to me. In hindsight, I could maybe have seen it coming, but the film does an excellent job of leading its audience to believe one outcome and then concludes with another. I don't want to say too much about the end, I fear I've said too much already, but rest assured it is a good one.<br/><br/>One thing I also really like about this story is its complete lack of romantic interests. In a world that seems to revolve entirely around love, it is very refreshing to watch a movie that can carry itself along without having to use a crutch of romantic tropes. The closest thing to a love story is when we see Sanada's character in a video call with his wife, watching the birth of his baby. I'm sure you'd agree that this doesn't even come close to making the movie a love story, so we can just ditch that label altogether.<br/><br/>At the expense of the romance genre, the movie was much more of a thriller than I anticipated. There was much more gore than I was expecting and little actual science: a horror film disguised as a sci-fi.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I left the theatre feeling a bit mentally exhausted. I don't watch a lot of movies at home, but I can foresee myself making an exception for this one! This movie does not pass the Bechdel Test.<br/><br/>Read more of my reviews at mindovermoment.wordpress.com."

","Well. I've been working on trying to put together my thoughts on Life (2017) without giving away any spoilers; so here is what I've come up with.<br/><br/>Life (2017) is a good movie, it is well put together. The graphics and the concept of the life form itself are completely off the charts and beautifully done. In the first half hour or so of the movie, details are on point; I mean everything is perfect!. My advice to understand what I'm saying is when you're watching Life (2017), pay attention to the most minimal details. Now after the first half hour or so the movie tends to spend less time focusing on important details. The scenery and the story seem to start losing pace; it's as if all the money was used up in the first bit of the movie; though the movie is still really good.<br/><br/>Things that caught me right away about Life (2017) is this movie wouldn't have reached such an audience or interest without Ryan Reynolds and you can tell it in the film that this was the biggest kickoff to hold their ground with this movie; well played. I have a huge interest in sci-fi films and of course, I would've seen this film either way, at least in time; I'm very happy to have gotten to see it and I look forward to having this movie in my personal collection when it comes to DVD.<br/><br/>In short, they done a very great job with this movie, the film was well thought out and the cast certainly did their job. Loved the movie."

It definitely doesn't look like they put actors in front of a green screen. Everything is really believable. Named after Calvin Coolidge, the alien first elicits ""awww's"" from the audience and then ""EEK!"" You get to see plenty of the alien. My son's name is also Calvin, named after his grandfather and great-grandfather, who were also aliens. Just kiddingabout the alien part. There is an extremely impressive shot that is very long without cuts, showing the space station and the people working inside. The book Goodnight Moon book takes on new meaning when read while circling around the moon. Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese also wrote Deadpool and were happy to work with Ryan Reynolds again, who has all of the snappy one-liners in the flick. He was going to play the lead character, but his schedule conflicted with his role in the upcoming movie ""The Hit-man's Bodyguard"", so he had to take a supporting role instead. This is also the second time Ryan Reynolds has worked with Director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House). By the way, have you seen the special, short clip of Deadpool before the movie Logan plays on screen in theaters? Hilarious. I'm always fascinated with how they make space movies and show actors almost swimming through the space station. I love it when items float in the air, especially tears. In the film you often see drops of blood float, symbolism the very essence of life.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: There are some really disgusting moments and super gory deaths that made the audience I sat with groan and moan. I really like Jake Gyllenhaal and find him almost mesmerizing to watch in all of his movies, but his character in this film seemed underdeveloped and one dimensional. Rumors have been swirling that this is a prequel for a future marvel ""Venom"" movie. Nope. Not true, although it would be a good back story.<br/><br/>Interesting lines: ""We're looking at the first proof of life before earth."" – Hugh Derry ""What I feel is not rational. It's not scientific. I feel hate."" – Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) ""No life support, no life."" – Hugh ""Life's existence requires destruction."" – Hugh ""Calvin doesn't hate us, but he has to kill us in order to survive."" – Hugh ""I can't stand what we do to each other down there."" – David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) ""It's hard to watch people dielike fireworks."" - David<br/><br/>Funny lines: ""Woo! Cue Instagram!"" – Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds) ""This is some re-animator shxx!"" – Rory ""That's some kind of obscure reference!"" – Miranda ""Not if you're a nerd."" – Rory ""Control, if you're listening and I know you are because you're creepy that way"" – Rory ""Seriously, that kid had blue eyes."" – Rory ""It was all going so well."" – Hugh<br/><br/>Tips for parents:<br/><br/>Profanity, including F-bombs Bloody, violent, gruesome deaths. The alien itself isn't that scary looking. It kind of looks like an octopus in the end."

","Went in today into the first showing. I like 'Alien' and similar movies, whereupon 'Alien' is the origin and reference of the genre. Only if you watch 'Alien' nowadays, it has a very long and slow introduction, but it's unbeaten in building up an eerie atmosphere. 'Life': There are some flaws, but all in all it was also successful and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe here the introduction was a bit too brief. The fate of Ekaterina (the commander) was very realistic, I saw a documentation and the astronaut there had exactly the same problem - exempt the alien organism, of course. Even though the premise strongly reminds one of 'Alien', the differences - and there are significant ones -, lie in the details respectively in the extraterrestrial form of life. The ending was satisfying to me, however it was also illogical (no explanation was given for that 'change'). So, if you liked 'Alien', this one is recommended to you. I hope that the forthcoming 'Alien: Covenant' will also meet my high expectations."

I thought the alien's design was pretty good but it felt a bit too smart off the bat. It went from a blob of cells that could kinda wiggle to killing and moving with efficiency too quickly.

","TLDR: the world's dumbest (and unluckiest) space crew meets a(n initially) single cell serial killer. Ugh.<br/><br/>If you like DUMB, movies go for it. This might be the top 10 material for you. This movie will likely offend you for its stupidity. And for being unoriginal.<br/><br/>There are so many problems in this movie we could write a PhD with it. Suspension of disbelief start to die in 5 minutes. First almost every scene has a BIG scientific or common sense problem. This is usually not a problem in general, as most movies have such problem (and even the critically praised ""Interstellar"" has ""Quantum Gravity Love"" in it, which is dumb and cliche in many levels - but the movie needed an artificial out, so it was a bearable flaw -, but at least is decent in other parts to make for an OK movie). For this movie, tho, this is unbearable for happening too frequently. If you ever talked online with an astronaut, you know they are anything but dumb people - they are usually FAIRLY technically knowledgeable.<br/><br/>All characters are stupid, make dumb decisions and you do not have time to relate to most of them (their acting is ok - even if they do not convince me they work in STEM fields or with piloting ships - given the trash they are given to work with; they are not the best characters of the world, by the way, as they lack depth). The scientists do not act like scientists would. The plot is the most predictable ever (there is a 50% chance you'll guess the ending when you get past half of the movie, and there is 100% chance you'll guess what will happen in the immediate next scene) and was made in a way to allow for a possible sequel...<br/><br/>The CGI is passable. Not great, not bad. No jump scares, just boredom and collective sudden idiocy. The cast is actually great, but... It won't help. The scenery is ok.<br/><br/>Dumb stuff that I'd tolerate in other movies:
They play a game of catch to get the soil sample (physically very unrealistic, and useless for the plot - it'll just make you think the astronauts here are dumb, which is going to turn out being true).<br/><br/>The organism drinks toxic liquid coolant for food - sure.<br/><br/>Stations thrusters connected to the station interior. <br/><br/>Explosively reactive fuel that doesn't intoxicate or reacts with the organism.<br/><br/>Unbearably dumb stuff:
Astronauts with bad work ethics. The crew preferred to cry instead of dealing a series of serious problems at many points in the movie.<br/><br/>The billion year old sample has a cell alive that only needs glucose and - spore like cell, maybe, covered in adamantium and invulnerable to everything, including fire (not even the alien in ALIEN has that) and frostbite, but can get cold arbitrarily by the end of the movie - a specific gas composition (for now, but this changes radically and arbitrarily later, the organism being able to survive in space for long times later... BUT IT LOVES OXYGEN???) to relive, which is promptly done, with the SCIENTISTS not asking themselves if this is a dumb idea - I'm not a biologist and even I know this would be a bad idea. ""Invulnerable Starfish"" should be the name of the movie.<br/><br/>All of the creature's biology seems, by sheer coincidence, to be basically equal and compatible to ours (which would be quite unlikely), yet most of its cells are magically undiferentiated and can be muscle, brain and eyes at the same time (which is so dumb).<br/><br/>An organism apparently without bones or hard structures that can break hands at will, and can easily use tools after being a single cell for a billion years.<br/><br/>CDC approved lab designed by a kid with legos that would not be safe to investigate a virus that can't harm humans, with kitchen gloves that can be easily pierced.<br/><br/>The communication system is broken, but who cares for redundancy? A space station costing billions that doesn't have backups for essential systems that even airplanes would have, right?<br/><br/>Station's outta fuel just before the alien died... Very conveniently.<br/><br/>The creature seems to learn how to sabotage radio communications AND to fly the escape pod back for a re-entry."

","I'll keep this short. Really this film has on paper a lot to give it credit for. Good writers, actors and director, it should have easily have been a good enough film, and yet all we seem to have is a homage to the original Alien movie.<br/><br/>It does start well, and it will remind you of the first time you watched the original Alien movie. The tension, the story, the unknown and the scares, something that many have tried to ape and yet all miserably failed until this one.<br/><br/>However, despite that good point it just doesn't grab you. You know it's just Alien under another name, and so you could hardly keep any interest as Alien itself (let alone the clones) has been flogged to death in now 7-8 movies (and should be put to bed). This film tries hard, and despite the best efforts of all, sadly fails.<br/><br/>You do have some great space scenes and feels authentic to what being on a real spacestation would be like. Yet I didn't watch it for that. The actors shine in this, but little for them to develop. The ending was predictable enough which didn't help (but I won't spoil it).<br/><br/>I think there will be many who many find something in it to value to watch again, I wouldn't spend my time to do that. One to just file away, and leave be (just like with the Alien franchise I guess)."

","An average cliche ridden movie that lacked originality. Stealing obvious scenes from Alien, Life is a boring look at science fiction cliches - one after another. Like Alien, you have the breach of protocol that allows the alien to attack the rest of the crew. That usual cliche where someone ignores the warnings and opens the door to let everything happen. In reality - the lab would have been sterilized, but then that is the end of the movie. Like Alien, the mad scientist (android in Alien, Hugh in Life) protects the alien even though it is killing everyone else. The usual dumb cliche. Life Alien, there is/are escape craft, but no everyone can fit. Life a space program would have something that only 2/6 of the crew could survive. Another cliche. The alien who has never seen technology, never seen humans, never been exposed to computers, etc - somehow knows the entire ship, knows how to shut down communications, knows everything. Something that started as a single cell organism - no matter how many neurons it has - can never just wake up and know how to manipulate and run a space station."

It was not a block-buster. It was not even good. It was watchable, but don't expect to be wow-ed by it. The movie was slow in the beginning. By slow, I mean boring. The pace was far too slow to maintain interest. It's like they had a notion of an idea, but no idea how to write a story around that notion. The last half of the movie was fast-paced, but full of over-used tropes, really bad decisions, and nonsensical science. Again, I am not sure what I was expecting, but this was a cookie-cutter style horror movie. No originality. The movie was predictable, even the ending.

","As someone who has seen thousands of movies, I get quite incensed when someone makes a movie that's already been made before. What's worse is when they try and recreate an iconic movie. Some might not have seen the iconic movie made back in the late 1970's but it's popularity is so huge, there are few regardless of age who have not seen the movie ""Alien"". Okay? Enough said. The similarities are so stark, I'm furious and want my time back I wasted watching this. <br/><br/>I try to write reviews as movies are big part of my life, but more often than not, I get distracted and forget to write. But this movie really struck a nerve and it's only been a few minutes since I watched this horrible film and had to write about it now to try and alleviate my immense disappointment. <br/><br/>I got sucked into watching the film because it was just released today on DVD and Rotten Tomatoes gave it 67%... I should have paid attention to the audience score which was 58%. <br/><br/>In this movie, they discover life on a cellular level that grows at a totally unbelievable pace. The story revolves around a space station that for the size has seemingly a very small crew and coincidentally, the same crew size as the movie Alien. I really needn't go on, because if you know the movie Alien, you know what's coming next as the alien species grows. The ending is somewhat different and I'll leave it there but I can't say it's worth watching to see the ending. I probably should have read the reviews as I see so many others who came away with the same feelings regarding the Alien comparison. ""Alien"" is one of the greatest horror/sci-fi movies ever made and you just can't try and make the movie over again into something only slightly different."
"michaelhitchcock","3","5","10","4 June 2017"," Okay reviews, but a less than okay movie
","I was really disappointed. With Ryan Reynolds in the cast I expected there to be some light comedic banter at the very least, but this movie didn't make me laugh. It didn't make me do or feel anything at all. I was so bored that I stopped paying attention. <br/><br/>To the people rating this a 6 and above... why? The only thing going for this movie was that the CGI looked really good. Other than that, it's lame. Nothing about any of the characters stood out to me in the slightest. I don't even remember their names, except David, and of course, Calvin (the alien). The attempts to foster some kind of human connection between the characters through short conversations were pitiful. <br/><br/>And then there's the science. Oh boy. Did you know that carbon-based life forms (like us) can <br/><br/>1. Survive direct contact with the business end of flamethrowers <br/><br/>2. Not die when chilling out in space for ten minutes <br/><br/>3. Grow from a single-celled organism into a four foot long octopus thing in 24 hours <br/><br/>4. Pilot an escape pod through the atmosphere and land safely<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the ties to reality grew weaker and weaker. It started off bad and got much, much worse. <br/><br/>Speaking of realistic things, where was the basic common sense? I didn't see any from the characters. The biologist, because apparently it's a trope now, fell in love with the dangerous alien and let it kill everyone on the ship. Ugh. Every other attempt by the remaining (and dwindling) crew to kill the alien was met with some impossible counter-move. Bad, bad writing. As a writer myself I am very frustrated with this movie. It had a lot of potential. It could've been more than an alien-ripoff, which it's just a poor excuse for now. Rather than seizing that chance, the writers were lazy, and decided instead that they should build the entire plot around the alien reaching Earth so that there was potential for a sequel. <br/><br/>That's the number one thing that irritates me about Hollywood. Because money runs the world, setting up for a sequel becomes more important than telling a good story with the first movie. It makes me want to scream. Word of advice, only see this movie if you enjoy cheap jump scares and lots of blood. With the zero-gravity effect, there was a lot of that floating about. The plot itself can be ignored for the sake of watching the alien kill everyone, but given that this movie presented itself as somewhat serious, it's not enjoyable however you look at it. It serves as an example of how the movie-making industry has shifted its focus from producing quality to collecting money. <br/><br/>Funny enough, this movie didn't even accomplish that bit. There's a price to pay when you sell garbage as riveting film."
"sanjin_9632","4","5","10","2 June 2017"," So many mistakes. On and off camera.
","This movie is so flawed, I don't even know where to begin. I mean, the six astronauts are the most stupid bunch of people I've seen on screen in a long while. Apart from the fact that this copies a lot from movies like Gravity (the effects, colors) The Thing, Alien (theme) etc., this film still manages to lower the bar even further down into oblivion. <br/><br/>There's this one scene which kinda tells you how terrible this is. In the course of the first 15-20 minutes, the paraplegic biologist revives the organism by jolting it with electricity, only for it to almost devour his hand within an instant. After awhile when the crew tries to revive him they realize that the creature has latched onto him, feeding off of him. In that moment the crew captain (played by Rebecca Ferguson) decides to do the most incredible thing. Just shock it a little bit more with even more voltage and let it absorb more energy. Now how stupid is that.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds' character dies relatively early, which is fine since the character wasn't needed in the first place. The script sucked terribly. I think this could've been made without a script. No character development at all. Considering the not so small budget and the people involved in making this, I gotta say it's a horribly underwhelming effort. <br/><br/>The only thing I liked about it was the ending. Bad endings are good, since there aren't many to begin with. Since this wasn't a box office success, there's not much hope for a sequel. <br/><br/>3.9/10 for the creature and the ending."

There are definitely a few ""gross-out"" scenes that could make you a bit squeamish. Also, its a bit of a one note show.

Space movies in general always look great on the big screen and this one does not disappoint. <br/><br/>Also, the acting is generally quite good. Ryan Reynolds provides a bit of comedy and both Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson turn in nice performances.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Life"" doesn't break new ground but as entertainment that sticks to the tried and true Hollywood framework it does a pretty good job of keeping you in it's grips."

"classicalsteve","4","6","13","7 May 2018"," Sort of Alien meets Gravity meets Predator: Death at the Hands of Calvin the Terrible
","I guess if there's a message to this film, it's life is typically hostile, so you should be on your guard. Not exactly an uplifting message. A team of scientists in an orbiting space station extract a bit of Martian soil and in it is a one-cell creature. The first few minutes of the film are relatively interesting. The one-cell creature seems to respond rather benignly to Dr. Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) to his gloved hands which he has put into the chamber where resides ""Calvin"". Then Calvin appears to go into extensive hibernation which makes Dr. Derry bored and frustrated. Of course, he decided to ""wake up"" Calvin with electric stimuli. Turns out this was a very bad idea.<br/><br/>The creature not only responds but turns into a kind of flying organism with the shape of a star fish and the lethalness of 1000 jelly fish. From here on out, the story goes from bad to horridly unbearable. Calvin makes Alien (from the 1979 film) seem like a wimpy creature. Ripley and company had it much easier dealing with the Alien. Calvin is super-fast, seems to withstand anything, including large doses of the equivalent of rocket launch propulsion stuff. All the while, the thing consumes people, a rat in captivity (which is never explained) and grows bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>I think the main problem I had with this film was the notion that the creature was absolutely invulnerable. They do everything except nuke it and nothing slows it down. I think I would have liked the crew to figure out better about what made it tick. Even a dragon for all its grandeur has a vulnerable spot. Calvin is like a sting-ray on steroids which seems to be immortal. It's like the screenwriters just opted for a copout by having the alien creature indestructible, invulnerable, and faster than a speeding Superman. <br/><br/>Also, The characters were a bit flat, except for the scientist, who wants to explore the thing like he's a daredevil willing to try anything to find out more about the creature, Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), the pilot who likes floating around in space more than dealing all the horrible people on Earth, and Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) who seems to have more emotion than anyone of the crew put together save maybe the scientist. Jordan starts to show more emotion as the film progresses. The other crew members were quite unmemorable, unlike the crew of the Nostromo from Alien where each character was quirky and not necessarily likeable.<br/><br/>A rather disappointing film. It's really just Alien again, except it's a slimy semi-transparent creature with about as much humanity as Attila the Hun. I think the creature needed something a bit more redeeming rather than just a slimy brute who relentlessly goes after its human victims. He should have been called ""Calvin the Terrible""."

","There was a time in the movie when I started laughing, and not like giggling or smiling, started laughing so damn loud that someone could have thought I was watching a comedy. <br/><br/>This movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who likes sci-fi. I don't understand why Jake and Ryan even signed this film. Take those two out of the movie and you do not get a single reason to watch it. The story is just too cliche but that's not even the main problem with the movie because the same stories can be retold in different manners. And in sci-fi genre it's quite a common phenomena to use common features from past works. But Life, no, no, no. This is an old story, told in an even more old way with just some new beautiful CGI.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with most poorly written Sci-fi is that the writers, usually to avoid hard work, proper research, patience and use of imagination, make their characters ridiculously stupid. It makes their work easy. How do I keep the creature contained but then let him enter the ship? Well, let's have one of the brainiest people of earth break the security protocol. Why? Because security is not his department. And you know, astronauts don't give a damn about protocols other than of their own area. How about containing the creature again and then making him reenter the ship. Hey! Why can't another genius from earth do the exact same thing once again? And the biggest of it - let's break down the communications first so everything else in the movie can be easily turned into a complicated situation. And how do we that? Well, the alien who came back to life just a while back and broke free out of his cell an hour back is not only smart enough to understand the whole structure of a giant space ship and the technology behind it, but is also intelligent enough to break it. Check Mate. We are fighting god!! And guess what, an intelligent creature like it doesn't even have its own language, well, because it doesn't need to communicate, it only needs to kill. <br/><br/>For me, the movie died many times. And after a while, finally, instead of caring for any of the stupid scientists or fearing the most intelligent creature of this universe, I just started laughing. This is possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long time. And if not for Jake Gyllenhaal, I would have stopped watching it at least half an hour before its end. And the end! What an end!! The moment they started discussing it, I realised what was going to happen and no, I am not one of those people who can see twists coming from miles ahead.

","I cannot begin to describe the banality and predictability of this flick. I give it a two only because it has some production value, and is set in space. That the ISS has finally come to the attention of the younger movie goers is also a plus, although the station is in it's 20th year (construction beginning in 1997). Apart from this, this flick has very little to offer in credibility, originality or even suspense. There are a bunch of actors who probably took most of the budget, leaving very little for the script writers and the rest of the production. There are plenty of both older and more recent films set in space to watch. Do this...watch them instead of this ridiculous sleeping pill."

","Nice visuals and CGI effects, but the scenario is simplistic and completely idiotic! All astronauts, though presented as experts everyone in his field during the film, appear to react with almost total lack of logic and dominated by emotion, which is absolutely absurd for astronauts trained for such a specialized mission! No way a space laboratory like that would have so poor safety procedure! Completely naive and the end of the film so predicted."
"nmanderson-15423","3","6","13","3 June 2017"," It Adapts to Space
","If I were to use logic which this film lacks severely. When the Alien enters earth's gravity at the end it won't survive due to the fact that it hasn't even experienced gravity since it adapted to living in space. I would imagine that it would simply be a blob on earth and it wouldn't survive due to its specific needs of a certain combination of oxygen and CO2. The fact that this alien is far more intelligent than ISS astronauts that have spent years training and practicing how to fly a shuttle and this alien learns how to fly it perfectly into earth's atmosphere and survive re-entry manually flying an escape shuttle is unbelievable. <br/><br/>This movie has a great story and execution by the actors but there is no emotional attachment to them as 2 of them we don't even get a chance to know because of the speedy introduction before the alien becomes an unstoppable killing machine that is carbon based and can somehow survive in space longer than a human. Moral of the story is that this movie has an unrealistic, idiotic, and simplistic plot to it and leaves a not so much cliffhanger to a sequel which I imagine will be fairly terrible also."

","This is another alien replica, it looks and feels like an alien movie and the alien itself even looks like the one from the Alien franchise. The acting is decent, but Rebecca Ferguson does a fine job. The script is at times dumb and political correct. but what to expect when the director is Swedish.<br/><br/>For example when they talk about the syria crisis or when the astronauts acts like uneducated teenagers. Like they hadn't prepared at all before going into space. That enfuriates me or when they feel the need to explain that humanity hadn't found life in space before. Like the viewer is dumb enough to not understand that before going into the movie. I really dislike when the creators of the movie think that the audience of the same movie are retards. But the movie ain't a big long propaganda fest of political correctness, despite a few outlandish dumb decisions from the astronauts the movie picks up some pace and the good ending saves to movie from a total disaster. It's also so many similarities with the original two Alien movies,, so we've seen this before but done much better. There has been a lot of space movies lately and this one is somewhere in the middle if you ask me. Arrival still is my favourite from the last couple of space and alien movies.<br/><br/>The movie steps up towards the end and when it is all over it becomes a pretty decent sci-fi movie after a real shaky start."

","After watching the trailers I thought this film had great potential. I love sci-fi movies and was looking forward to this one. It started quite well, I noticed some details such as tablets computers being put down on a table or a chess set and chess pieces resting there as if it was not zero gravity (ok lets say it's all magnetised, maybe...), and actors looking more like they're dangling on wires rather than floating in space. But that alone would have been fine. Unfortunately it became stupidly ridiculous.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>Kevin is a creature that was dormant on Mars because it could not cope with the environment there, a creature that needs an early earth atmosphere to function, yet it's ""running"" around in space for ages, overpowering a human in a space suit, searching for a way back in to the ISS, surviving being blasted by several thrusters (that is after surviving being torched early on). And yet, knowing it survived this, the solution the crew came with to make it dormant again, is lure it into a section of the ISS and starve it of oxygen. Errr... it survived the vacuum of space!<br/><br/>The other thing that ""puzzled"" me is that apparently it's possible to go from outer space into the ISS by just entering through a thruster. There's nothing stopping Kevin from travelling in as it pleases and get back to the crew. I'm not sure how they managed to keep the ISS pressurised with this going on.<br/><br/>I won't even comment on the lack of professionalism from the crew themselves.<br/><br/>It could have been very good but it fell flat for me."

Therefore, they sacrifice themselves for nothing.<br/><br/>I believe some other reviews already talk about the shallow plot with all details in this movie. In here I just put one more example that annoyed me a lot: The moment that I realized this movie is completely a joke is when I saw the world's reactions with their alien-life discovery. Imagine that, a living cell from Mars! What an astonishing discovery which can attract everyone's attention in the world. Reporters will crush to NASA for the latest updates. Scientists, religious scholars, experts in Biology, geology and all kinds will be ignited with heated discussions. Everybody will have so many questions about this alien life and hopes to find more clues by watching the live connection with these astronauts in the space station. Guess what they are going to see? They will see some little journalists from primary schools, asking questions which can find answers from Google search by one click. The audience will disappointedly watch the astronauts showing their living style by space jogging, dry beans and toilet in a kid-talking face and voice!

When space is one of the settings of a movie I kind of hope to be it as deep and mysterious like space is it self. ""LIFE"" isn't it. The movie is very fast paced, much too graphic without any mystique and we don't really get a chance to really care about any of the characters. The movie has very bad taste in it's visual and dramatic effects. LIFE has also a very difficult time to set a mood. Is this a comical movie? Or do I need to take this scene seriously? I was laughing through out the more 'dramatic' scenes of the movie, but it actually had to be a serious moment. It's just very underwhelming. Although ""LIFE"" has it's strong moments, you have to wait a long time to get there. The opening scene was strong and kind of great. You really hope this beauty would continue through out the movie, but it doesn't. What follows is very underwhelming for a movie that has such a beautiful setting. Space is mysterious and you would hope to see a more meaningful movie about it. What we see is yet another Hollywood cliché which cares more on making it big at the box office than creating a meaningful experience.

Incompetent astronauts were fighting the huge threat and made an endless series of crucial mistakes. At first it is interesting that the new life form is extremely difficult to kill but soon it is just boring, in particular due to over emotional and illogical astronauts. The ending was aiming to be fresh but did not convince me. In a horror film, the capsules would have been other way round, so I guess the director decided that this was an intellectual science fiction film, despite the incompetent astronauts, after all, but it was a bit late for that."

It was interesting though to see the dramatic changes of this alien and how it became smarter and smarter throughout the movie. But this movie was way to long. The alien just did the same thing over and over again. It would find a host and then feed on it and then the person dies. After one death, you basically are seeing what the rest of the movie is.

"stevenmall","6","7","16","23 March 2017"," Inspired by Alien, succeeds on all but the most important one!
","First let's get one thing straight, I love these kind of movies. Alien has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it.<br/><br/>Life clearly got it's inspiration from it. You can't deny it. And seeing as Alien was it's inspiration, you'll wan't to compare it to it.<br/><br/>But if you do that, like I did, you will not have a good time and will think it's not a great movie.<br/><br/>The story of Life is simple in its design. A probe comes back to the ISS with soil samples from Mars. In it the team finds a single celled life-form which they are able to revive from it's dormant state. They start testing and things go wrong and the whole movie goes on a decent into a roller-coaster of tension.<br/><br/>In the tension department this movie truly excels, it has a few good jump scares, a few brutally gore filled sequences. But that's all there is.<br/><br/>Comparing it to Alien, which is similar, it does almost just as well. Don't get me wrong, the design for the life-form is great. Unique to be exact.<br/><br/>But why is this not going to be a classic or overall great horror- SF like Alien? It has all the same base elements as it's older brother. And the answer to this is fairly easy. The tension in Life compared to Alien is stale. Alien started out a lot slower, giving you a false sense of security. When the action starts, you just can't seem to think of any means of escape or survival. And Alien tops it off with a different kind of tension than Life.<br/><br/>Where Life has a tension built on the idea of the life-form itself, the tension in Alien is not because of the alien, but because of the surroundings. Giving you a claustrophobic feeling preying on the primal instinct of fight or flight. Life doesn't even consider this. The setting of ISS should have given you the feeling that there is no escape. But you never get that idea. Because of this small, but key, difference, it makes itself inferior to its own inspiration.<br/><br/>One other difference between the two is not it's cast, but it's crew. The crew in Life seem to always make the wrong decision. Although I love it when a good plan fails over and over again, that was not the case in this movie. Most of the decisions seemed like they would not have been made by professional scientist and astronauts. These people should have been trained to deal with any situation, even a breach in quarantine. But apparently they never trained for any of these situations. In Alien the crew were just work-class civilians who just happened to stumble upon something extra-terrestrial. They were people like you and me. This made all their decisions the same as we would make them, improving on the dread and hopelessness of the situation.<br/><br/>All in all, it's still a fun movie to watch. It has a great cast, a great creature design and a magnificent plot twist at the end, but don't go in thinking this could be the next Alien because you will leave disappointed."

Meanwhile, against ANY logical quarantine procedure, the ""scientist"" lets the life-form crawl on his hand!! WTH?! In real-life, they sterilize spacecraft sent to Mars just to avoid the rare chance a microbe might survive on it coming from Earth.
Everything they did was wrong. They should have jettisoned Reynolds into space the moment the thing killed him. The Russian should have cut herself off during the spacewalk the moment the creature had her. Sacrificing themselves would be written into the rules of the mission in real-life in a situation like that.
Apart from the lousy plotting, the actions of the crew and dialog were trite. Blubbering like children over the death of a crew member when it was so telegraphed by the plot only an idiot would have been surprised.

"complicated-25837","4","4","8","24 July 2018"," Somehow less than the sum of its parts.
","Each individual element of this movie is decent to great so I'm trying to figure out if there's one department/position to blame for this movie The writers also wrote for Deadpool. The producers also produced moderate-very successful films. The actors clearly did the best job they could for what they were given. The only conclusion I can come to is that the director couldn't bring it all together which is why it's such a disappointing film. I may be wrong but later on I'll be referring to that.<br/><br/>I binged watched all the movies in the Alien series the day before watching this, so I'm sure I'm used to a standard that isn't fair to judge other movies by. I tried to step back and be objective so that's why I went with 4 Stars. The visuals are stunning, the alien in this film looks pretty and scary at the same time. It moves in a way that seems realistic and the actors reactions to it are spot on. The cinematography, especially at the beginning, was great. The dialogue was a bit weak, and so was the plot but I get the feeling someone near the top or in a board room wanted this to be the modern day alien so they had to do things a certain way. <br/><br/>Anyway! On to the film's story! <br/><br/>I am good at suspending my disbelief, so usually I can roll with films taking artistic liberty with science. I'm also a nerd though so in the back of my mind I'm always thinking about what would have actually happened. So it really concerned me that right off the bat the movie decided to tell me that this was not going to be Sci-fi/horror, but more thriller/horror set in a typical watered down Hollywood version of space. This happened before the Title displayed when Ryan Reynolds caught the probe at the beginning. They used fuel to try to match the out of control probe, which is an issue they face later so props for continuity from the writers, but it's still coming in at an incredibly fast speed. I can overlook the fact there's no way that arm could have snagged it with no damage or it breaking off. I can't overlook the fact though they are in orbit and a force like that transferred to the station would have pushed it out of Reynolds orbit who was seemingly untethered. Even if he was the recoil probably should have killed him or made the line snap. That could have been a good way to justify the unnecessary plot of an out of control probe and have some actual consequence early on. Instead it just makes Reynolds seem awesome and makes you immediately like his character better than all the others.<br/><br/>So I changed my perspective and tried to look at it from a different angle. The film contradicted itself though by pushing scientific jargon, especially during the scenes where they're describing the organism and trying to reanimate it, so I was never able to reconcile that new perspective. I'm not sure why they stopped looking at samples after they found the first cell, or why after documenting it - the first ""test"" they did was attempting to bring it back to life to prove that life existed somewhere besides earth. They found the cell, it wasn't terrestrial, that was all the proof they needed. Anyway I attempted to suspended my disbelief yet again, and then these super qualified people are all ok with how exponentially this being grows. The cells are multiplying at an insane rate to grow the way it does when it dances and the biologist becomes friends with it. No one bats an eye... <br/><br/> Instead of robotic hands (on a station with what I assume are hologram capable screens/tablets) to handle the alien they're using community college grade lab equipment with rubber gloves. There is only one door into the ""firewall"" area which means no way to decontaminate anyone going in or out or keep out potential hazards which would easily be accomplished with a second door.. There is no way the cdc signed off on any of that. There is no action or true wonder going on because from the trailers and description this is not a feel good movie. It's not interesting to see a grown man pretend to be friends with a tiny cgi dancing alien. So those glaring mistakes are what I thought about during these pointless scenes.<br/><br/>The only character innately likeable and with any common sense is Reynolds' character, and in near 4th wall breaking logic (since everything up to this point has suggested the characters aren't too keen on using logic) he tells the scientists he's a glorified plumber and not qualified to be around the alien in a quarantine lab after one of the scientists misses a safety check. I thought certainly at this point more of this would follow and it might be somewhat comical. However, no other characters have this common sense except the Russian girl and jake Gyllenhaal when the plot calls for it. The only character I sort of liked was the first to die so now I don't have a horse in this race. I don't want to pull for the alien because he killed the little interest I had in the movie at that point, so now I'm just watching to see what happens with 0 emotional attachment to any of the other characters. <br/><br/>On another note, when things take a turn for the worse it is insane to think somehow it could know to break the mini cattle prod to puncture a hole in the gloves... that's using tools which isn't something an organism that's a small collection of cells should be capable of alien or not... but that's what we're expected to believe...<br/><br/>One by one the crew are all killed by the alien. I will admit the Russian girl drowning in a space suit while out in space was pretty interesting and not something I had ever seen before. Props to them for that! The deaths become less and less interesting after that though. There were so many establishing scenes of why we should care about these characters, a guy unable to walk given freedom of movement in space, a new father, a war doctor who hates earth because of all the horrible stuff he saw... and yet the only connection I felt with one of them was when Reynolds' character was frightened and said he missed his dog... It was the only one that felt like it wasn't being forced down our throats and wasn't made up for us to pity him for the sake of the plot.<br/><br/>The middle part of the film was, for lack of a better word, mind numbing. I felt like I was on auto pilot seeing what malfunction or mistake would happen that would let the alien have another chance to kill them. I get that's the movie but I think if all they wanted to do was have an alien kill it's victims the same way over and over they could of just had them all walk in the quarantine zone 1 by 1 toward the beginning and saved us an hour.<br/><br/>The ending was predictable but came about in a weird way. Like the way they came up with the idea to give the aliens in Independence Day a computer virus from the dad saying ""catch a cold"", Gyllenhaal reads goodnight moon, says goodnight air, then comes up with a plan to have the alien follow torches for heat into an escape pod that he plans to fly out into deep space while the girl escapes to earth. It works perfectly except you are shown one subtle hint that is quickly dismissed by the film as a small scare like the girl might die on rentry. Only to find out, no, actually the monster manually reentered the atmosphere by piloting the escape pod in such a way at the perfect angle that it didn't disentegrate, and the girl was the one somehow flying into deep space on automatic after bumping into a solar panel. <br/><br/>The monster gets loose on earth and sets up Life 2. Honestly, I don't know how there was a life 1 because if an alien species is smart enough to know how to sabotage communications on a ship alien to them and how to use tools and how to FLY alien ships then surely the species would have been smart enough to create civilization and have technology and be able to build a ship and not get stuck on mars in the first place...<br/><br/>
So as I said in the header, individually the parts range from decent to fantastic, but the director somehow failed to bring them together to make them even equal their sum. Finishing this movie I felt like my intelligence had been insulted especially after all the bull**** I was expected to suspend my disbelief for. I can't even say this is one of those movies so bad it's good because it's such a phoned in typical Hollywood film they knew people would go see it. There's no heart from (I'm assuming) the director in this movie and it's pretty sad. <br/><br/>The visual effects were amazing, the sound/music wasn't too memorable or even that scary but it wasn't bad by any means. I'm sure they had the budget for it, but you can tell a lot of people behind the scenes worked really hard on this. I feel bad for them."

","'Life' suffers from one of the common problems that most films in the recent decade have suffered from: boring film-making. This movie could have made a great contribution to the genre that 'Alien' birthed decades ago but it lacks any variation in the ways the film-makers use the camera. What I've noticed is that recently film'makers are lazy with the camera. I believe this because these films all look the same: they tend to fill the frame with the characters and don't bother pulling back from the close- up/medium shot to capture the setting to create ATMOSPHERE - and to me, the atmosphere creates a feeling of a film, the feeling creates a personal connection and if that connection resonates within my mind (and enjoy that feeling), I've watched an (at least) good film. These film just cut between obscure shots and close-ups of the actors and don't give the viewer to capture the atmosphere of the space within the film and lose that essential connection a good film always has.<br/><br/>The story very linear and predictable - until the end and I liked the twist at the end because it was a great way to cause misconception with the camera. Jake Gyllenhaal, as usual, provides a good performance but is limited by the script. Ryan Reynolds is good as Ryan Reynolds. I especially like Ariyon Bakare as the father of the alien, his character was good.<br/><br/>Good things exist within this movie but because of the lack of atmosphere and style, I was checking my watch throughout the entirety of it.

","Life was disappointing, even with my low expectations since I'd not seen this movie advertised in theatres at all. The only good thing about Life is that they knew it was not even a grade B film, so they edited it down to a short 1 hr 40 mins. <br/><br/>The story is simple. Space station gets samples from Mars that turn out to be something dangerous. It's just like a horror film waiting for who gets killed next. This alien is another take on Alien's well-worn monster except they keep saying how smart it is. One by one, bad stuff happens.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the actors sleepwalk their way thru this mess. Jake Gyllenhaal must've know he was miscast as a scientist because he had zero believability, even in this one scene where he cried, it was terrible acting. All the crying scenes left me crying from how fake they were. Rebecca Ferguson from Mission Impossible was horrible too. Besides her fake crying, with horrible music, even her horror at the monster was just bad acting. <br/><br/>The music was bad. Ominous black cloud music that didn't synch well with the scenes. Even the end had me laughing when the final song was Spirit in the sky, and I thought, what? Is this a 1970's Vietnam war movie? Bad stuff.<br/><br/>The only breath of hope was Ryan Reynolds who was given his comfortable role of group comedian, just like he was as Deadpool. Unfortunately, his role ended up being minor. He might have helped save the day.<br/><br/>Bad script, bad acting, bad music. Just bad. What this movie needed was a hero. Someone who was a military presence who was going to take it to the bad guy. but alas, there was no such character, which in a space station just amazed me. <br/><br/>You can skip this disaster.

"gregnbonnie","4","4","8","30 June 2017"," Unfair to the viewer - actually made me mad
","I'll try to be vague, but I there is only so much you can complain about without revealing why it bothered you.<br/><br/>My wife thought it was so funny how much this movie irritated me. I just felt like the director wanted to provoke more than entertain. Maybe I'm just naive about what sci-fi horror should be. I've seen all the Alien movies, and I understand plot twists and endings that hint at a not-so-resolute resolution. There are clichÃ©s everywhere used in horror, and techniques to keep the tension alive. Characters always seem to make bad decisions...<br/><br/>I will admit I haven't read the novel. It's difficult to translate what works in a book to something on the screen that is time-limited. Many plot techniques are done because we don't have time to hear the narrator explain a-la Stephen King how someone comes to a conclusion or acts a certain way. There are triumphs and tragedies, comedy and horror, and many other dualities within theater. I myself like (need?) a happy ending, especially when you connect with the characters and other aspects of their lives, revealed to you during the story.<br/><br/>Be prepared for the 'rules' to be broken. Go into this with the expectation that you will see things that either don't make sense or you can't expect to be reasonable. It has great special effects, and while many will point out scientific impossibilities I've long since expected the science in science fiction to be perfectly and physically acceptable.<br/><br/>I suspect the director or author wanted to make a thematic statement, rather than give the viewers something they were expecting. There were a few points in the film that haunted me, like in the scene in Saving Private Ryan where a soldier was stabbed to death in a struggle. The visceral, painful inevitability tasted bitter to me, when I was expecting heroics. There were two characters at the end I connected with, and I wanted a much different ending.<br/><br/>I respect anyone else who feels otherwise. I think a person's reaction here says more about themselves than the movie itself. I will continue to look forward to more sci-fi..."

","Not the Eddie Murphy comedy of the same name, a more appropriate title might be ""Death"" as this film focuses on a spaceship crew gradually eliminated by an ever-evolving Martian lifeform. The film has earned unfavourable comparisons to 'Alien', however, the plot differs in unexpected ways. Most notably, the crew in 'Life' initially befriend the lifeform and raise it in an artificial atmosphere with some great early moments and excellent CGI as the minute creature curls back and forth and forms retractable limbs. The alien's motives are also very different here as it only kills in defense, with the crew bringing the horror upon themselves by their unorthodox administering of electrical shocks and then trying to kill it when it understandably defends itself. This agenda would, however, work better with more credible characters. For highly trained scientists, the team often let emotions get in the way and recklessly break safety protocols. The film also lacks characters as interesting as Ellen Ripley, but Jake Gyllenhaal has some good parts as an astronaut who -- after spending over a year in space -- would prefer to stay there for the rest of his life. With lots of mindless carnage and less interesting creature effects as it increases in size, the film sometimes feels like wasted potential. It is, however, capped off with a really powerful ending and Jon Ekstrand's brooding score is great throughout."

It's just this movie really unexpectedly horror and scary. Never did i imagine that this movie will be as scary as it actually is.<br/><br/>At first i thought this will be just the usual monster movie that will end up like the other typical monster movie. And because it's been a long time since the last time i've got a run for my adrenaline, i decided to give Life a try.<br/><br/>Enough with the horror, scary, bloody, intense, surprising scene, this movie also contained an unexpected ending that made me really disappointed and so regret to watched this movie. It's not only i really hate this movie from the middle beginning, i hate the ending too. What kind of crazy cliffhanger ending is that? The alien monster named Calvin alive? And after all of their crazy, bloody battle with the monster in the end the monster still win and successfully landed on earth?! I feel lose and terribly unsatisfied. In the end i can only said that i regretted watch this movie very much"

","When will america stop trowing into space the most stupid and incompetent crew ever? 
Every sci-fy movie in space is the same: they found a strange organism and decide to be incredibly no-scientists about it by ""playing"" with it. They always have to touch it! Not even a kid would have done such a thing. <br/><br/>This movie is a bunch of stupidity after stupidity committed supposedly by intelligent people that work they way up to be one of the few chosen to live in space! Yet every action they take compromises their lives in a very serious way. They do mistakes of judgment a seven years old would have know not to do. I cannot wash a movie full of this stupidity.<br/><br/>They grab a LIVE extra terrestrial organism, isolate it then start to touch it and play with it. They think it is cute! And pet it. Who does this? I mean this people are supposed to be scientists, smart and not even a kid, I repeat, would act this way.<br/><br/>And who goes on to be the first to play with it? The only guy on board that is irreplaceable. When the organism finally attacks, the crew refuses to go into rescue wile they still have time. When the foreign organism releases the man's hand is LIVE body keeps on floating around but NONE of the crew goes inside to rescue him - and they were debating on doing it so just two seconds before. When they still have time, they refuse to take action. When is too late is when all the ""bravery"" (stupidity) comes to surface and they all start to give orders to each other, panicking. Another demonstration of immaturity and lack of hierarchy - they always panic and start to speak and shut at the same time wile the foreign organism is doing its thing. They don't take action before or after. So this foreign organism kept inside a container releases this guy hand and he is floating around. What does the crew do? It keeps on looking trough a glass window. Instead of taking the opportunity to recollect their colleague they actually stay around waiting for the foreign organism next move. Witch is to release itself from the container. Yupi! It is free! That's when the crew decides to open the door and take their coligue. They ad plenty of time between the release of the guy's hand and the break trough. But no... only when is extremely dangerous is when they put themselves in a life and death situation. So this guy goes inside the lab were this thing runs free, takes the colleague out but they shut the door on him because the ""thing"" garbed is foot. Then he is instructed to ""burn"" it. It is obvious the thing reacts to eat but will not be harm by it. Still this guy keeps on using the fire to try to kill it, instead of using it to establish a safe distance and get the hell out of there. All this time their colleagues that are still safe outside (or so they think because they have the injured colleague with them) do NOTHING. Is when this foreign organism gets inside the man's mouth that all the orders and panicky mode resurface and they all start to shut again: lets go grab him!<br/><br/>First they close the door on him and are unable to instruct him to use the fuel-limited torch to safely get into the door. But when the guy gets invaded and starts to spit blood is when they think something can be done to help him.<br/><br/>Oh please stop making stupid movies!
They have technology but plot wise USA keeps on doing the most ridiculous and insulting movies ever.

"asastewart","2","5","11","13 December 2017"," Quite a bad movie that makes wastes a good cast
","From the opening scene where a spaceship makes a loud whoosh noise as it passes the camera I knew this wasn't going to be the most scientifically rigorous movie. That's OK though and doesn't necessarily detract from the quality of a movie.<br/><br/>What I hadn't anticipated however was one of the worst scripts I've ever heard in a relatively big budget movie. It was as if two college kids had watched Alien and thought hey we can write something like that.<br/><br/>The central premise of finding a life-form on Mars, and then through bad choices or plain ignorance antagonising the creature is quite a good one.
The problem is the 'scientists' on the spacecraft are only really there to get chewed up so nothing in the script would actually indicate these are intelligent people on an important mission.
A central aphorism of movie making is show don't tell. The characters in this movie are constantly describing what's happening on screen, or what motivation they have, the insinuation by the film-makers is that the audience are dumb.
As a viewer we are supposed to feel something for the crew as the horror falls upon them, but there are no characters in the movie. All the crew speak with the same voice, the voice of the scriptwriters. There are certain twee moments like a crew member video chatting with family members, but this is no 1 in the cliché list of humanising a scientist or astronaut. The crew's characters are all largely interchangeable and it would have virtually no difference.<br/><br/>Some things I liked were the creature design, at least at the start of the movie. The spaceship interiors and zero-g effects were well done and quite atmospheric.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending, but I thought it was one of the most hilarious endings I've seen for a long time."
"drew1116","2","5","11","31 October 2017"," Incredibly bad
","This movie is horrible for all of the reasons mentioned by other reviewers and they are spot on. I'll just add a few thoughts.<br/><br/>Personally, I will give a movie wide latitude on believability as long as said movie is enjoyable to watch. I remember watching The Revenant a few months back and nitpicking here and there, but you know what? We don't have a movie if the director/writer isn't allowed to venture out a bit. Unfortunately, Life just tosses all reason out the window and then the complaining starts...during the movie.<br/><br/>I've seen one other film by this director and it was terrible as well. Child 44 from the book which I thoroughly enjoyed. He managed to turn that one into a snooze fest and inexplicably deviated from the book plot line which I thought was very original. How this guy keeps getting directing gigs, I don't know.<br/><br/>I say this over and over in my reviews, but good movies are just a giant collection of great scenes...memorable scenes. This one literally has not one. Just complete lameness throughout. Prometheus was a weak movie, but it was pretty grotesque and horrifying. Not here. I think my favorite scene is the Soyuz smashing into the ISS. Go figure.<br/><br/>Life is rated R. To me, that means you can dispense with the schmaltzy story lines meant to captivate all viewer groups like we see in most PG films. I couldn't care less about the pregnant wife, daddy lines, etc. <br/><br/>The creature has to be one of the lamest aliens ever in a sci-fi movie. Yes, later on it's a direct ripoff of Prometheus. Everyone is afraid of tentacles, so I can let that go. But watching a white banana peel chasing the crew members around looks just stupid. This is unforgivable in my opinion, because the makers of Life could have gone in any direction and they chose the wimpiest looking alien I've ever seen. Of course, if you make the alien indestructible, incredibly strong, intelligent... you get the idea. <br/><br/>I can go on and on, but just wanted to say a few different things about Life other than how unbelievable it was, which is very true. Seriously though, give me two A-list actors and a $60 million budget and I could beat this miserable garbage into the dirt."

"Robert_duder","2","5","11","9 September 2017"," Calling it a knockoff of Alien is being way too generous. Life is blah.
","I was hesitant to watch Life for a few reasons. I remember when it came out, I hardly saw any trailers and it has a strong cast and yet did very poorly. I knew there had to be a reason for that. I'm not sure how a film like this goes so poorly. All parts of it are things we've seen before. Space exploration, vivid personality crew, experts at what they do, find something weird, weird attacks them and picks them off, a few or two or one remaining finds a way to survive. But Life is so completely forgettable. Despite the charisma of the stars in the cast and some very weak attempts at making them seem human, I couldn't care less about any of them. Most of the time I was so bored I didn't care who was in it. Even the music seemed like it was the same little snippet over and over and over again trying to set tone. The special effects are okay although sometimes I thought their faces looked like you could practically see a green screen behind them. It gets marginally better once the practically faceless cast gets picked off but probably only because Jake Gyllenhaal has a lot of chemistry on screen. There is one good solid scene that was still only good because it was reminiscent of Alien. This film checks a ton of boxes for smart sci-fi horror and then doesn't deliver on any of them.<br/><br/>So check out this cast. As mentioned you have Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Hiroyuki Sanada and Rebecca Ferguson in your main cast. Between them you might have one okay scene each. Gyllenhaal gets the most but only because he lasts longer than everyone else. It's honestly like watching a cheap slasher flick where people are picked off one by one but not even in a fun gory way. I don't even know what they're goal was behind the film. It's so brutally predictable and obvious with nothing new added to the genre. It feels like a stale remake of a hundred different Alien films and especially THEE Alien film itself.<br/><br/>Director Daniel Espinosa is young and fairly new to Hollywood but he did alright with Safe House though I remember thinking then too that a more experienced director could have done more. He just doesn't seem to know what to do with a strong cast. Life is less than average and I was bored by the half way point. You could compare it to other films but it doesn't try nearly as hard as it should. It was a colossal disappointment with a few and I mean... minimal moments that caused me to look up and keep going instead of turning it off. 2/10"

I don't know exactly how biohazard security works, but I'm sure that this kind of first contact situation requires more than what we have for highest level of terrestrial biohazard. For the sample manipulation box, which by my scientific and engineering standard, it requires complete seal, wireless robotic arm on the in side to manipulate the sample. This would ensure nothing gets in ,and that if things go south, nothing gets out at all. This then brings to firewall 2: if things go south in the box, the second level is another sealed container that has the capability to incinerate everything inside, that is the firewall 1 and whatever sample is in there. Another key point here is that, the operator need to be outside of firewall 2 all the time, so that they cannot screw things up inside the firewalls, leading to emotional situation such as need of rescue. Lastly, for firewall 3, instead of the expelling the whole station, how about make the section detachable and has its own propulsion system that is remotely controlled by the station? this way, even if firewall 2 is breached or ineffective, you always have the option to launch the section to deep space right at the moment, in a very safe manner.<br/><br/>However, i guess none of this works when the plot requires every safety system to fail."

All 5 or 6 astronauts seem to be really stupid and help the creature at every turn, instead of isolating it. There is a lot of useless lengthy talk and meaningless drama, and you just cant feel sorry for the astronauts because of their stupidity. The science behind the movie is very ""thin"" to say the least. The acting is not bad, but doesn't really shine either, some scenes are there just to feel the space, etc. I almost didn't watched it to the end - actually I did watch it only because I was able to use a higher playback rate, so I would advise against losing your time with this movie."

In Life you also have an alien life form, certainly not as creepy as in Alien but still it's entertaining to watch.

Know i was really engaged with the movie. I cant think of one moment when my eyes weren't off the screen. The alien is amazing and very smart. And how it kills people is very horrifying and also morbidly creative. And it actually gives the thing some humanity to it. Like in the 1979 film Alien, the movie made it out to be this monster that just kills and only because that is all it thinks. But in this movie, they make it out to be this thing that only does what it does to survive. The movie acknowledges that its an animal that does what animals do, survive. Although it isn't perfect and i'll talk about that now. Some of the people in this movie are almost completely disposable. Like Ryan Reynolds is cool in the scenes he is in, but he is seriously in the movie for almost 12 minutes before he is killed by the alien. The 2nd half of this movie is also not as intense as the 1st half. The ending also felt a little rushed to me. So in the end, Life is a very enjoyable science fiction horror movie that really doesn't add any thing new to the trapped in space horror genre, but it also earns its spot in that category as well.

","This is a fantastic movie. Not only it's entertaining but you are tensed the whole time the movie is on the screen. Something that many of us haven't felt watching this kind of sci-fi horror movies since we watch the masterpiece that is Alien.<br/><br/>If you watch the trailer you probably will think it's the new Alien movie, which by the way comes out next month, but that is far from the truth. While it might seem like a copy from Alien, this movie takes another path. A path that feels more real to us because this could happen right now, up there, at the ISS and we wouldn't be aware of it. Not at all. Yes, it is clearly inspired by Alien, but that's it. Not even the creature looks alike, nor the way the story keeps forward. It has its own charm, its own style, and that is something to be grateful for because it makes the audience enjoy the movie, and that is why we go to the cinema in the first place.<br/><br/>As any science-fiction movie, visual effects are the main characters of the show and in this movie they are but they don't fully get all our attention because the movie has a terrific cast in it that makes us forget that everything we see is CGI, which is also an added value of it. All the actors are just brilliant. Each of them playing wonderfully their roles and you just can't hate them in some cases, but just feel really sorry for them, of what you know is going to happen to them. but you keep watching to see it happening.<br/><br/>This movie is a magnet to the eye and it's not only science- fiction,. because what it depicts, it could really happen anytime.

So the first ten minutes of the film are boring because of all the set-up, the next 30 minutes of it are fantastic because they are interacting with this simple lifeform and asking big questions.

"vice0077","5","5","11","22 April 2017"," For mercy's sake.. Help!!
","OK I'm late to the game here, but please pardon this, I'm just so confused after watching this movie. First, to get the basics out of the way;<br/><br/>1. Beautiful cinematography, excellent production and surprisingly decent music score for a horror movie. You can tell money was spent here, and the movie did have some jump scares and true horror moments that were true to the genre. Good job there.<br/><br/>2. That said, I wish they would have spent more time questioning the plot and storyline. Everyone has already stated the basics on the completely illogical creature, but fine let's throw that out the window for a moment and let's say somehow such a creature was possible for the sake of discussion. (I will say it does suck when a movie forces you to do that, when it wraps the movie in realism but forces you to abandon consistent logic even in the movies' own universe in order to make the plot work, but fine). <br/><br/>A movie should not in my humble opinion fold back on itself in its own logic. With this creature running around needing oxygen to the point of sucking on cans of it and withering away in a vacuum, it can't do that yet hang around in open space jumping about like a rat on a ship. Furthermore, please explain how this creature just 'knows' things that it has know reference point to know- one moment it's figuring out how to use tools, next its navigating the inner and out workings of a space station- including how to access the station through the thrusters? Only one man on the station knew that and this thing just knew it right off the bat- not to mention it knew to keep trying after several burns of those same thrusters to keep it out- it would stand to reason that without knowing the fuel level, with advanced intelligence it should infer to keep away from the thrusters. Maybe try again after a distraction, not just doggedly ramming the gate so to speak. And how is it possible a space station would have what is in effect a non air-tight seal on the thrusters? I'm no astronaut but wouldn't that affect pressure bleeding air into space all the time? And furthermore, if this thing is so smart it can anticipate needing to keep the scientist alive for some bizarre reason to flying the ship for reentry, why even bother with all the savage attacks on everyone even at the risk of being sucked out into space? If it's so brilliant why not just jump in the escape pod and jump down to earth? It's not weaponized, there is very little they could have done and it would have meant far less risk to it- which with its own strong drive to survive, would stand to reason it would make decisions leading to the most safe result for itself and certainly not the animalistic stalking and killing of each scientist one by one. I could go on for days here.<br/><br/>So many questions, so little answers. But hey, it's a movie. If you just leave it at that and enjoy it in a high budget b movie horror kind of way, you can have fun watching it. But you can't take this movie as serious as it wants to take itself. I also can't stand that it is being compared to Alien, and came out so close to Covenant. It's not even close in so many ways, and for that reason I dinged it an extra point. To be completely fair, 6/10 for this movie."

","Life (2017)
Just shy of 40 years since Alien, i think it was ok to use some of it's devices. Set in the very near future on the International Space Station gives it a brilliant reality and helps make this a properly scary movie. What helps more, is the design of ""the alien"" which is at its scariest early on when the fear of the unknown looms larger than after its first reveal. The characters not being ""tooled up"" brings it slightly further away from Alien, with the characters being arguably more vulnerable.
The ""Space"" is done well and in comparison with other is perhaps limited by reality. Futuristic space movies don't have to be compromised by awareness of its setting. The sound is good and the tension, though never turning you foetal quite like the first scene in the lab, does maintain well.
Gyllenhaal is decent, as is the ever excellent Rebecca Ferguson, though i felt Ryan Reynolds was a bit too Deadpool and not enough ISS type. His character felt out of place, or at least should have been toned down a little.
While I was happy enough with the direction the ending took, I felt it could have been far better implemented and was the only real error for me. In conclusion it is the best space horror i've seen since the aforementioned genre topping Alien(s), so not bad at all. SEVEN"

","I just watched this movie on Netflix and it somehow surprised me positive and negative. Thats why i signed up to review what i experienced while watching this sci-fi, horror trip on the ISS. I only want to spoiler the first 20 Minutes.<br/><br/>Beginning:
The movie takes place on the ISS. The crew awaits an probe with some examples from Mars containing an example with a possible lifeform. They want to research it and find out if it is really an lifeform from Mars and so the first Alien lifeform.<br/><br/>The Probe is out of controll and the crew on the ISS want to catch it with an large robotic arm. There are chats between the crew members and what do you await on the ISS? Specialists. Professionals. You start with Ryan Renolds, who is an great actor but doesn't fit into this movie, chatting all along like , ""Yeah, yeah"", ""Faster, faster, FASTER!"", ""Spoiler Alarm!"" ... he just does not fit here on THAT place.<br/><br/>So he wents out and has to manually catch the probe with a robotic arm.
The Probe is a waaaay too fast. It's not like 20 km/h too fast more like 200 or even more. This is absolutly beyond physics and really impossible. But hey they did it! Somehow. ""Whoohoo *cought cought* Yes!"" Everyone is happy except me.<br/><br/>That moment i turned off all logical thinking and thought: ""Well my brother watched it and he liked it, so i want at least watch it and have something to talk with him."" and i wanted to know what this lifeform is. Maybe it turns out good. So trash this first10 minutes.<br/><br/>Real start of the movie:
This is where the real beginning of the movie starts. They exermine the probe under microscope in the isolated lab of the ISS. They try to get it alive and succeed. It's intresting to watch and on earth they give this lifeform the name ""Charlie"". After a few hours it evolves and starts to grow and learn.<br/><br/>In the first 20 min until now, the movie failed a lot at realism. Not in realism like ""It's an Alien, this is impossible"" or ""No lifeform can evolve like this!"". More like the basic physics. The cast. The setting overall and the crew. This is the worst for SCIENCE-fiction. Imagine this in other genres.<br/><br/>This sadly continues and only works when you don't know anything about basic physics, chemnistry, biology, space and phew ... a lot other basic stuff or you can just put it aside and ignore it. Beside of this you get a typical ""Alien-is-hungry!-Needs-food-to-evolve!-Kill-all-humans-as-gory-as-possible.""-movie. But in this category, it is pretty good. The lifeform is effective, deadly and resistant. Humans get chased. Humans die. Humans want to survive. And so wants the alien.<br/><br/>Grab your popcorn and give it a go. You may be thrilled or amused. Depends on your expections on the scifi-horror genre."

","Another piece of evidence for the crisis of filmmaking in Hollywood. Well crafted and by all means masterly produced and acted. But, why?

Overall a well-made movie. I liked the characters because they seemed calm and professional. They did make some bad decisions but is there are movie where bad decisions aren't made? And I bet self-reservation plays a big part in all of us.
The scenery was flaweless and I really got the sense of them being in space. As a person, who has a mild phobia of huge objects and places like deep sea and space, I was horrified by some scenes, especially the death scenes.

","Small film of farniente, do nothing and have a siesta, on the international space station. Chinese excluded of course. Nasa dominated. When you have nothing to do and you have a marvelous extraordinary laboratory and means, you try everything you can without even checking what you are doing. So a new matter, substance or whatever is collected up there from out-space is a troth of pleasure. At once you cultivate it in more or less safe conditions; You play with it when it starts pushing some small tentacles and you even provoke it a little bit electricity. That is a like a puppet show.<br/><br/>The being is a crossed version of an octopus, a star fish and some kind of alien. It is nice and beautiful as long as it is small. But it grows fast and becomes aggressive. It eats all it can catch that is alive or emit some energy in the form of fire or light or whatever. In no time, it manages to invade the one who was playing with it and it evades from its little airtight cage and it invades the whole station, inside at first and outside then because it does not breathe and it can survive both in the station or in outer space.<br/><br/>The thriller is simple and is no thriller since there is no suspense. They will all end up dead and eaten and one of them will carry it, one it-individual, to the earth where some naïve Asian fishermen will liberate it out of curiosity. <br/><br/>I am telling you I am still shivering, of cold more than fear, because I had forgotten to turn the heating on this afternoon.

","Life is about a team of astronauts on the international space station on a mission to investigate what they believe could be new form of life discovered on Mars. Through fiddling and adjusting the climatic conditions they are able to bring life back into the organism. It is subsequently affectionately known as Kelvin. But the floppy leaf like creature grows and becomes more squid like, escapes and starts attacking and feeding on the crew.<br/><br/>There have been a few space movies out in recent years, Gravity and The Martian both exceptional films. But I wouldn't hold Life in the same esteem or even in the same generic bracket. Gravity and The Martian do a fantastic job of establishing the sense of isolation, futility and vulnerability of space, so far from civilisation, as they say no one can here you scream. If things go wrong, you really are on your own. You don't get that sense with Life, it easy to forget sometimes that it is actually set in space. Not helped that on a fair few occasions the crew don't seem to floating about at all (like you would be in the space station) but just standing about. There is no talk of a new fangled artificial gravity machine that you get in some space films to get over this hurdle, just seems like they hoped we wouldn't notice.<br/><br/>The films has more of a connection with The Poseidion Adventure, running around the ship to escape the water, or even Deep Blue Sea. As it is fresh in mind I saw a lot of comparison with The Grey that I saw earlier in the week. Instead of escaping the wolves, slowly cutting down the numbers here its alien lifeform. So it's like The Grey, but I prefer The Grey."

","Had I not seen ""Life"" the same weekend that I also watched ""Alien: Covenant,"" I might have dismissed it as a cheap ""Alien"" rip-off. But because ""Alien: Covenant"" was such a dirty piece of cinematic toilet paper, I ironically ended up liking ""Life"" more than I might otherwise have for coming much closer to giving me the experience of watching an ""Alien"" movie than an actual ""Alien"" movie did.<br/><br/>""Life"" has modest ambitions and meets them admirably, thanks to competent direction, a pretty decent set of actors, and a system of internal logic that follows its own rules. I have no idea how realistically scientific the movie is and don't much care, but the things that happen make sense within the context of the movie, and that's what matters to me. There are some truly disturbing moments -- like one where the alien life form kills off a major character early on by eating him from the inside, or another in which a crew member drowns in her own space helmet -- and the film is paced well. Its twist ending is handled a bit awkwardly and doesn't have as much impact as the filmmaker I think wanted it to have, but overall this is a solidly entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

Clearly these individuals are *not* well-trained, well-educated, mentally stable people you'd spend billions of dollars on sending into space.<br/><br/>From the trailers you already know this is a show about fail-safes failing to contain a creature. What it doesn't show is how many times these people screw up, and in such unbelievable ways... assuming they are actual astronauts who are also scientists, engineers etc and undergone rigorous training. I also don't buy the ""people want to relate to characters, so they should be like the average person"" argument here, as this setting is not the time and place for that nonsense.<br/><br/>SPOILERS (but I honestly feel you're better off reading these and save yourself a couple hours)<br/><br/><ul><li>The thing is growing pretty freaking fast... so let's just keep feeding it more and more!</li><li>You're dealing with an unknown creature growing rapidly with unknown capabilities, so the only containment between you and it is a rubber glove. Great.</li><li>The housing for said creature has zero fail safes to destroy it (ex. incinerate) if things get out of hand... OR there was one but the characters just sat there watching it the whole time without doing anything at all.</li><li>Quarantine procedures? Hah, i'm emotional and want to open the door anyway.</li><li>Guy from above point goes in (with zero protection), picks up a mini-flamethrower, and starts going at it like he's trying to light up a forest.</li><li>What kind of bio/chem lab built for testing unknown space viruses and organisms is not completely isolated and air-tight? This one apparently. With pipes openly leading into the the rest of the space station, and just a single door to get in (no second door or airlock mechanism for quarantine/de-contamination). Oh and of course the housing for the creature didn't have this mechanism either for putting things in and taking them out.</li><li>When the creature breaks out of the lab the characters have no idea where it is and instead of being on the alert and securing themselves they go about repairing other things on the space station as if the creature weren't even loose. I guess this is a great way to slowly kill off characters if that was the goal.</li><li>When trying to isolate themselves from the creature they started duct-taping spaces between wall panels. Um... this creature can crush a human and almost break apart metal. Have these guys been paying attention at all? Also they don't seem to have any systematic means of slowly closing off airlocks to isolate the creature away from them... the film just shows them seemingly randomly closing doors. Oh obviously this is why the creature ends up showing up in the one room they were trying to isolate themselves in.</li><li>What seems like less than an hour after they call for help, a Soyuz capsulte shows up (super unrealistic... but whatever, given everything else, I was ok with this) and attempts to push the space station away from Earth to contain the threat. Of course, another guy has to become irrational and with zero idea where the creature is, open the Soyuz capsule door and let the creature into it killing the people in it.</li><li>Creature makes it to Earth in an escape pod that was meant to go into deep space. People come by and clearly see the creature inside. What is their first instinct? Try to open the door ASAP to let it out of course! The end.</li></ul><br/><br/>Ok that's enough, you get the idea.

In ""Aliens, The Thing and Pitch Black"" the creatures crawled, ran, jumped, implanted eggs in your throat, and grew at an enormous rate.

","I only took interest to watch this because Jake Gyllenhaal was in it. Then I found all the characters not fleshed out enough to be interesting or to be cared about. Dull or two-dimensional characters help sink any movie. And the more I read the reviews here after watching, the more I discovered how utterly stupid most of the story's events and details are. But while watching the film, it had a lot of suspense and building tension and dread to keep me awake and riveted, sort of the way you can't look away from a car crash out of morbid curiosity. In the end, I felt depressed and morose after watching it. I particularly hated the scenes with the lone, poor little rat tethered in place with some sick kind of lab experiment harness, just knowing something horrible was going to happen to it. It's even worse when that kind of thing really upsets me in real life, animal experimentation, and I am vehemently opposed to it. So the filmmakers exploited that kind of knowledge, knowing that nobody wants to see anything bad happen to a sweet little rat with cute whiskers, and they kept showing closeups of him or her, just to keep everyone who would care utterly uncomfortable and squeamish. It worked, but just fed in me a growing feeling of unease and dread that of course wasn't appeased or dissipated by the increasingly bleak events of the film. Would I watch this again? I don't know, maybe, but only because I did like Calvin, even if he did look somewhat like a space squid. The fact that he becomes a relentless predator, one almost with a seemingly conscious agenda to kill those first who harmed it and in terrible ways....gotta admit, he never could be as good as the aliens in Aliens, but, not bad for a space baddie creature either.

","A silly movie with bland, boring characters. Being a big fan of the ISS, and what it represents as an achievement of humanity, the visuals of this movie were nice to watch. Effects wise, everything was perfect. However, the plot was just somewhat formulaic of the same old genre, i.e. space alien is busy eating everyone in a remote location, one by one. Think of ""The thing"" or ""the blob"" or ""alien"" but on the international space station instead. However, what made those movies memorable was that eventually, the protagonists, being human beings who want to survive and not be eaten by a space alien, managed to outsmart said alien creature and eventually contain or subdue it somehow. Ripley managed to kill the alien, they managed to freeze the blob and drop it in the arctic, and the Thing I think never did complete its return spacecraft before it was dispatched.<br/><br/>In this movie though, the alien creature is already contained. They know its there, they give it food, nourishment and play with it like its their favourite pokemon, not for one moment questioning why it might be that everything else on Mars is dead, and this thing is all that is left. Obviously, one by one, it eats them and they run around the ISS (an environment which all these experts are no doubt super familiar with), like a bunch of headless chickens, concocting one half baked plan after another. Turns out though, that this creature has some of the thickest plot armour in cinematic history. There's no blasting it out an airlock for this one. It's just going to get all the way to Earth with the assistance of the most incompetent space crew in the history of cinema. This life form is based on carbon and oxygen, and needs water, just like humans, but unlike humans, it can survive the freezing and oxygenless vacuum of space, can survive fire, electrocution, and can hop about with surprising agility. Despite this creatures amazing survivability, and the fact that it gets more intelligent as it gets bigger, it somehow managed to leave no trace of its existence on Mars, save for a few convenient small cells in some dirt.<br/><br/>Every technological cliche and mishap happens, one after another. Crew members repeatedly try to rescue fellow crew members, despite knowing they are obviously already dead.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was daft. I didn't find the space alien scary, because the crew were total idiots. They all deserved to die, and the ending left me saying a great big MEH, DON'T CARE."

","Life is a bit of an Alien clone, but it's probably one of the better produced.<br/><br/>The effects are good, the actors are good, and it's well paced. The first half of the film is certainly better than the last - it's all more of the same. One of Alien's key aspects was that you didn't see the creature all the time; that added a lot of suspense. Life's monster seems rarely off-camera, so the novelty wears thin towards the end.<br/><br/>There are many, many moments where you will scream ""why, why would you do that?"", but you can say the same of most films.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of sci-fi and horror then it's certainly worth a watch, but probably not a second."

","This review might contain spoilers so you have been warned.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies I really like on a cold rainy night. It was for the most part fun but geez it's full of stupid people who are supposed to be the brightest and best minds. Really I kid you not. <br/><br/>So here we go they recover a soil sample from Mars that is on its way to Earth in a capsule, they manage to recover that and analyze the sample to find a single cell life form of some kind but it's in a dormant state and needs reawakening.<br/><br/>Now I can't really complain about that because well that seems like a thing most scientists might consider doing under controlled conditions. Try to revive the organism they found. So I gave them a pass on this.<br/><br/>But later on as it is seen moving and then growing they do dumb things like play with it and pet it. <br/><br/>It's an alien of undetermined origin and possibly very dangerous. Did this thought not occur to these supposed smart people? They could have left it in the box and not played with it and maybe things would have been better, but then we'd have a very boring movie on our hands.<br/><br/>However having said that I wonder how the movie might have played out had they done this and followed Calvin's adventure on Earth and what mayhem he'd cause on the planets surface. That would have perhaps been a tiny bit more interesting then what we got which was great production wise but slightly predictable. <br/><br/>Anyway I had fun with this but your mileage may very. You might like it too or not."

Monday morning quarterbacking. However this movie was mostly smart, beautifully shot, and a lot of fun to watch overall. A good eye on technical details, and EXCELLENT creature, and unlike it's doppelganger Alien, it was very bright and well lit. The actors were fine by me, and the space scenes and ISS interior were totally believable and well thought out. <br/><br/>My only beef with the movie was the somewhat predictable ending; I think most viewers saw that coming. But it was a very good, if not great, sci-fi piece that I recommend to those that enjoy suspenseful and scary space epics. This movie is certainly deserving of grades over 5, no matter what slight issues with technical details of 'that couldn't happen' or 'he would never say that', etc. It's a movie for pure entertainment people! <br/><br/>So there you have it."

From the setting to the amazing soundtrack, it literally kept me on the edge of my seat and also I found the ending quite suitable, very nice plot twist although some scenes did make it a bit predictable. <br/><br/>All in all I found it much more satisfying than Prometheus for example and although some of the characters were a bit flat I did enjoy the way they interacted with each other. Indeed, some plot holes could be noticed when it came to the ISS's communications system but I guess they needed that to further drive the narrative. For me this was a good movie and I really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>I recommend watching this on a rainy day with the curtains drawn and speakers on high volume. It's worth the experience.

Space station - alien life. Like many others that are mentioning this, I too must point out that it is easy to see the resemblance with ""Alien"" but still ""Life"" offers something fresh and new. It is never boring and you are at the edge of your seat throughout the most of the movies' light hour and 43 minutes run-time. Jake Gyllenhaal gives yet another fantastic performance but the supporting cast does an above average job (especially Rebecca Ferguson). Visually it was done very good (with scenes that were resembling ""Gravity"") and I think that the design of an alien form was done superb. There were some creative ideas concerning death scenes as well which is always a welcome surprise. Still, there have been some moments where I was afraid that scenario is going to become a little bit cheesy but luckily that never completely happened (which can't be said for aforementioned ""Gravity"").<br/><br/>With that being said, it probably won't be anyone's best movie of the year but that shouldn't keep you from seeing it.

Its a fundamentally simple premise that, in a basic way, is akin to the likes of Alien, just not as exciting.<br/><br/>The acting is reasonable but this is not a film run by narrative, for the most part. Its an exposition driven affair, that is action focused. To be fair too, there's a good amount of action but the nature of the film is restricted by the narrow confines of the space station, in which it takes place.<br/><br/>I'd say not a bad film as such but not doing anything terribly innovative .

"drsecure","7","6","15","23 March 2017"," Intense for sure with a justified ""R"" rating.
","I was fortunate enough to go see this movie as part of an advanced screening on Wednesday 03/22/2017. Overall this move is a solid ""B"". To start off, the set-up is critical. It does border on almost too long, but just as I began to realize that, the movie did ramp up. There definitely is suspense, and the plot did require a bit of disbelief in the lack of protocols I believe actual scientists would take in ""growing"" the life-form, who quickly by the way becomes the actual star of the movie. This is a pure monster movie though, and after a bit more time, the creature solidly shows who is boss. What really kept this story higher than a ""C"" rating is that the alien really does cause murder and mayhem in ways that are completely unique to other Sci-Fi or horror movies like Alien(s), SE7EN, Final Destination, etc. This movie is not for children, 14 years old minimum, and even that is a stretch. Language aside, LIFE definitely earned it's ""R"" rating from the sheer shock value of the deaths in the movie. Very few movies can do that. Think about how the original Poltergeist, Predator, or Jaws did this. In fact several, (about a dozen) people actually left the movie. Not because I think it was ""bad"", but because of the scare and squeamish factor. The movie however, lacks - something overall. Maybe it's just the cheap (possible) sequel set-up the director included. It has a Mark Wahlberg Planet of the Apes feel to it.Or, the fact that it just seems that once again humans are portrayed as completely stupid when it comes to strange, extraterrestrial organisms. Don't get me wrong, I liked it overall, and a 3-D version would be awesome. LIFE is a fun, (gory but fun) trip to take."

"Vivekmaru45","7","5","12","15 April 2017"," A sci-fi-horror film set in deep space. I also recommend you see Europa Report (2013) and Harbinger Down (2015).
","This film is a hybrid of Alien 1979 and The Thing 1982. In short, this is a ""creature"" film.<br/><br/>This film casts two well known male actors Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. I think this is the first time these actors have acted together in the same film. The female actresses in the film are Rebecca Ferguson and Olga Yuryevna Dihovichnay. The rest of the cast are experienced actors Ariyon Bakare and Hiroyuki Sanada.<br/><br/>Plot: six-member International Space Station (ISS) crew capture a probe returning from Mars with a soil sample that might contain evidence of extraterrestrial life. Exobiologist Hugh Derry(Ariyon Bakare) revives a dormant cell from the sample, and it quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name ""Calvin"". After an atmospheric accident in the lab, Calvin becomes dormant.<br/><br/>If you have seen The Thing 1982 and The Alien Trilogy of films, this film will appeal to you in the sense of sci-fi horror coupled with intense action scenes. The background music effects are also superb as is the cinematography. Swedish director Jorge Daniel Espinosa directs his first full length U.S. feature film and he does so professionally. Also those of you who like surprise endings will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review, may you lead a full and happy life and proper.<br/><br/>More creature films: Lifeforce(1985), Star Crystal(1986), Moontrap(1989 stars Walter Koenig of Star Trek fame), The Dark Side of the Moon(1990), Critters 4(1992), Pitch Black(2000).<br/><br/>I have seen tons of films in my life most of them sci-fi horror, sad to say I can't remember all of them. These above films are a good guide into the genre. I also recommend you see Nightflyers(1987) based on the novella by George R.R. Martin."
"The_Dead_See","7","5","12","10 April 2017"," Flawed, but still entertaining and horrifying
","I went in to LIFE with zero expectations and ended up quite enjoying myself.<br/><br/>No, scratch that. ""Enjoying"" isn't really a term that can be applied to this movie (unless bleak and horrifying downer scenarios are your fetish), so let's say I was ""entertained"" instead.<br/><br/>It's your standard 'Alien'/'The Thing' scenario - small group of people stuck in an isolated location with an unpleasant lifeform - That's pretty much it. However, 'Life' doesn't come close to creating the atmosphere or tension of either Alien or The Thing. The reason for this is, I think, in the characters who weren't near as empathic or sympathetic as those in the aforementioned masterpieces. The big flaws here lie in some illogical character decisions and some phoned in acting.<br/><br/>Where Life does succeed, though, is in three areas: 1) It gives us a believable and horrific creature, that thanks to its early introduction scene makes you uneasy every time it appears on the screen. The sense of danger was very palpable and well handle. 'Calvin' had me squirming for sure.<br/><br/>2) Wonderful sfx, most notably an impressive single tracking shot that opens the movie.<br/><br/>3) And this is the big one for me - it dared to do something that even Alien and The Thing didn't do - to not have a happy or even ambiguously hopeful ending. For this I give it major props. If you're wondering if Life should be categorized as a sci fi or as a horror, by the time the credits roll, it's firmly, unequivocally horror.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to all sci fi horror fans - If you liked Event Horizon, Pandorum, The Blob, Europa Report, Infini, Leviathan, deep Star Six, Deep Rising, Titan Find, Splinter, Sunshine etc. then you're probably going to enjoy this. It's not Alien or The Thing, but fortunately it's not Harbinger Down or Supernova either."

","Upon the throne of mediocrity and in the context of sheer wasted talent due to an uninspired, banal and lackadaisical script, this is the worst movie I've ever seen (second only to Interstellar). Many will disagree, saying they were riveted from beginning to end, because the screen writing is engaging, the acting of course is top notch, and the directing, cinematography and lighting are even exceptional at times (thanks, money).<br/><br/>Perhaps Alien was just too good, so good that everything after could only pale in comparison. Maybe Alien was one of those miraculous time stamps like the Beatles that for whatever reason was the most possibly realized constellation of talent, courage, luck and will. Walter Hill knew and deeply researched his Freudian psychology, the alien-penis with it's vicious thrusting inner mouth, the near anatomical vagina of the pods, and creating a virtual reality ship named ""mother."" Perhaps there is nothing more after this when it comes to alien quarantine and/or contagion movies. Perhaps only Carpenter's ""The Thing"" even comes close. <br/><br/>And I sit is with great sorrow I tell you, even despite the musical score, which was excellent, in this overall context, this movie redefines disappointment. After all this is Deadpool and Donnie Darko in space.<br/><br/>And to leave us with the ending credits with ""Spirit of the Sky"" is unforgivable. <br/><br/>Here's a simple twist that would have elevated this movie to greatness: the martian spore contains the genetic history of the fallen Martian race to massive atom wars of long ago; the astronauts, being the evolutionary manifestations of the long ago spores of the Martian ruling class, sent to Earth right before the apocalypse, trigger the Martian amoeba to ""Terra-form"" (for space travel instigates this evolutionary possibility), creating a new version of war of the worlds which illustrates and is a vehicle for current struggle of class, power, race and aristocracy we are all currently experiencing. <br/><br/>Again, sad to see Gyllenhaal, Reynolds and the others entombed in the banality of it all; maybe that is the greatest sin.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>E-Cubed."

The incredibly STUPID crew that somehow became astronauts without having the basic common sense that even Paris Hilton had in every movie she starred in. The idiocracy of the crew members shows that this was probably written by a parent who was dictated by their 2 year old. <br/><br/>If you want something to die in space then send it into the vacuum, it's not that complicated. The ISS has airlocks in every compartment to ensure that penetration or leaks are impossible, but don't tell the writer that, because then the film will no longer have premise. <br/><br/>I think I'm mostly disgusted with how ignorant and idiotic they think the viewer is, I truly feel offended to think that someone thought anyone with a brain would believe anything in this film would be possible"

","This film is often compared to Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", what to some may be a spoiler, but to all others, it's just like saying that it's a space creature story, what is exactly what people that go watch this kind of show are seeking, anyway. The title is actually spoiler enough, pointing that there is ""Life"" out there.<br/><br/>The plot has many problems, starting from the creature concept: it begins as a single cell that can multiply and form a multicellular being, in which each cell keeps its individuality, to the point each cell can see, think and act independently, mostly like John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", except that it/they doesn't/don't, i.e., the creature never splits (it could have left a single cell behind to consume each person it killed, for example, so there would be half a dozen creatures at the end, instead of just one, increasing its/their chance of survival). That feature of the creature is never used, not even once (although, to be fair, the idea haunts the film, making us think that everybody and/or everything the creature touched could host a new creature).<br/><br/>The characters are amazingly dumb, poking the alien with an electric probe, opening doors when the whole section should be shut, using fire (in the space station!) to try to kill the alien, getting alone when a deadly alien is loose and hunting and so on.<br/><br/>There are also problems regarding the Science behind the Fiction, like why is the creature intolerant to oxygen at first, then without explanation becomes an oxygen ""vampire""? The creature's driving goal also changes randomly, some times it's after ""food"" (anything carbon based, even coolant), other times it's after air, on other times, droplets of blood...<br/><br/>There are also Engineering problems, like how did the creature return into the station, to attack the scientist's leg, without breaching air out (and engaging all kinds of alarms)? Also, why did the gauges move when the creature supposedly tried to invade the propulsion exhausts (to eat the fuel), while they were shut? Finally, the ending became too obvious when the two last survivors started plotting two different paths of action for them. I think it would have gone better if the pilot had kept his plan secret until the very last moment, so the twist wouldn't be spoiled so long before the ending.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the cast is good, so the acting is convincing (yeah, they manage to convince that they are all very dumb, but they do that really convincingly!), and the music score is nice, adding a lot to what's happening on screen, giving a really menacing ""feel"" to the mostly faceless creature.<br/><br/>Everything considered, this is more ""space opera"" than properly Science Fiction, but then again, that's the case with most films classified as such, including ""Alien"" and ""The Thing"", what doesn't make them less entertaining. As a thriller, this film delivers a few good moments, just don't think too much about hows and whys (if you do, you will probably hate it)."
"tristan99","6","4","9","14 April 2017"," Decent Space Thriller, but nothing too original
","The first time I saw a trailer for this movie, I immediately thought of the movie Alien (which is amazing) and I wasn't really excited to see something that looked nearly the same. The result was what I expected with a few notable exceptions. The alien creature in this film was very interesting and I loved the way it looked and moved around. I like the concept of the Alien getting larger and larger within just a few moments. I squirmed in my seat when the thing crawled inside of Ryan Reynolds character and killed him, that just made me feel uncomfortable but it was quite a thrill. I also love the ending to the film, left me hanging for more and ready for a sequel. Other than the two things I mentioned above, there really isn't anything else original about the film, the astronauts go to another planet, an alien creature tags along with the team, then there is always a scientist trying to stop the team from killing the specimen so he can ""research"", who then inevitably gets killed and gets loose in the spaceship to wreak havoc.

Here we go again.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna say I want my money back, but I AM incensed enough to write an opinion about it.<br/><br/>It's a waste of time to write about how implausible the actions of the alien were, like some of the other reviewers have done. It's an ALIEN - who knows what in the hell those little bastards could ever get up to? I'm old enough and seen enough movies to know how to SUSPEND BELIEF. My issue is that this movie didn't bring anything new to the table and was actually pretty predictable.<br/><br/>I'm OK with movies that are ""inspired"" by others. There's rarely such a thing as an original idea anyway, right? And Alien is one of the greatest movies ever to be inspired by. But to sell this movie as ""Alien inspired"" while having no other correlation than an alien on board your spaceship is quite the let down.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about Alien was that it's hero was a female. For that time period, outside of a few Grindhouse selections, a female heroine was pretty avant-garde in a main-stream action movie. No one, at the beginning of Alien, guessed Ripley would have been the lone survivor at the end. Life doesn't really explore new ground, other than the whole, ""Be careful what you wish for, scientists!"" Although this is timely, considering our burgeoning hostile take-over of Mars, is it really a new idea? Seems like the last time I saw this explored was in a similar mediocre sci-fi called Splice.<br/><br/>As I write this, I'm questioning why I am even bothering to post a review when rating a movie 5/10. But then I remember why I felt so upset when leaving the film - that ending...I would say there was more inspiration from Tim Burton's The Planet of the Apes than with Alien. And that's REALLY the biggest let down."
"MaximumMadness","7","4","9","30 March 2017"," ""Life""- An 'Alien' knock-off for sure... but a decent 'Alien' knock-off. It's appropriately gooey, gory and thrilling and never mistakes itself for being more than it is.
","You can't keep a good classic down. Nor evidently, can you keep others from trying to replicate the success of a classic for years- even decades- after. This is especially true about the 2017 Sci- Fi/Thriller release ""Life"" from director Daniel Espinosa. Yes, for all intents and purposes, the film is very much aping off of one of the great classics of the genre... that of course being Ridley Scott's phenomenal 1979 release ""Alien."" From tone to character to basic structure, Espinosa and the wicked screen writing duo of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick craft a film that is either lovingly paying homage to the iconic Scott picture... or drastically ripping it off. Either way, it isn't the first 'Alien' knock-off... nor will it be the last. The best we can hope for it is that it ended up being one of the better 'Alien' knock- offs...<br/><br/>Thankfully enough... I'd say it is.<br/><br/>Yes, despite a few major problems with the pacing and a few questionable choices with the structure, I found ""Life"" to be completely entertaining and a lot of fun for what it was. Sure, it won't win any Oscars... but there's nothing wrong with a good, old-fashioned thrill-fest. It's got all the goo and gore you'd expect from a deep-space creature-feature, and boasts a massive budget and top-notch talent on-screen to boot. It honestly reminded me of an old nostalgic favorite in that respect- the Kevin Bacon thriller ""Hollow Man"", which similarly boasted a big budget and big talent for what amounted to a cheesy slasher movie. A lot of people complained (just as a lot of people are complaining about ""Life""), but they seemed to miss the point... these movies are meant to be pure, visceral fun. Not mind-bending or even all that complex. And in that respect, I think ""Life"" works quite well.<br/><br/>In the near future, a six-person crew aboard the International Space Station intercepts a probe returning from the planet Mars with soil samples for study. Soon enough, it is discovered that a microscopic organism exists within the soil- the first real sign of alien life beyond Earth. After managing to revive the organism (nicknamed ""Calvin""), it begins to grow and display signs of intelligence and thought. However, things take a turn for the worse when Calvin escapes his ""habitat"" and begins to act in an aggressive and defensive fashion... eventually beginning to kill off members of the team in order to feed. And so, the remaining crew must work together to try and kill this martian beast before it is able to reach Earth...<br/><br/>I really gotta hand it to the cast- they all knock it out of the park, despite the film zooming through their establishment a little too quickly. Our leads Rebecca Ferguson and Jake Gyllenhaal are a lot of fun, and both are given just enough motivation to help you care about their characters. Supporting roles by the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Hiroyuki Sanada, Ariyon Bakare and Olga Dihovichnaya are all very well-played and are given just enough quirks and defining features that you actually do kinda feel bad when the creature starts to attack them one-by-one. It's a case of good casting overcoming a few missteps in the narrative.<br/><br/>The script by Reese and Wernick is quite entertaining, and they show that they have a knack for suspense and thrills. I've been seeing a lot of reviews nit-picking the minute details or trying to poke holes in the logic... but you gotta remember: these are the same guys who wrote ""Deadpool."" If you think they're trying to deliver a hard-hitting and cerebral drama set to the backdrop of a Gothic horror picture, you're clearly not in the right mindset. They know exactly what they're trying to do... pay homage to Sci-Fi classics like the aforementioned ""Alien"" while delivering as many jumps and disgusting displays of bodily- fluids as possible. It's not tongue- in-cheek per se, but it's also not 100% trying to be overtly realistic. They're crafting a fun movie... not a complex one.<br/><br/>The tones and style that Espinosa injects into the film are incredibly invaluable. It's a very competently made movie, and there's a lot of really fun visual nuances and nifty camera-work on display that lends much to the proceedings. From an opening sequence told almost entirely in a single complex (and breathtaking) shot, to more subtle moments like allowing the camera to linger on the various crewmembers as they cry at their terrible situation in one genuinely touching scene... there's a lot of really smart moves being made in the storytelling thanks to top-notch visual guidance. I'm not overly familiar with Espinosa's filmography... but if he's able to do so much creative and original work with what is essentially an homage-picture, I'd keep my eye on him in the future.<br/><br/>All that being said, however... there's some issues I cannot deny. And they do bring the whole thing down a few points. Despite allowing the story to truck along quickly, the pacing does rob some much-needed moments with the characters and I would have liked to have seen some more development in the supporting roles. A few of the ""scares"" are telegraphed from a mile away, which annoyed me a bit. And I do think that despite aiming to pay homage to the classics... the film could have subverted expectations a bit more than it ended up doing. It would have helped it stand alone a bit more.<br/><br/>But in the end, for what amounts to a fun-albeit-generic creature- feature in space, ""Life"" is very much an enjoyable time. It's not going to break new ground and I certainly wouldn't call it a great film. But it's more than adequate and I know I had a lot of fun seeing it on the big-screen. I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10."
"felix-wyderka","6","4","9","30 March 2017"," A mediocre sci-fi thriller that is carried by it's stars
","""Life"" is a mix of ""Alien"" and ""Gravity"" and while that might sound good it is not. The movie was hyped and highly anticipated but it was not worth the wait. This movie proves once again that a great cast isn't everything. The movie starts with an amazing opening sequence using a tracking shot similar to those in ""Birdman"" and right away gives us a inside into the characters. However, after this 10 minute sequence the remaining hour and a half is rather disappointing. The acting is good but nothing special and there is really nothing sophisticated about it and the movie is carried by the three stars. The cinematography, except for the stunning opening sequence, is also nothing special and really doesn't convey the danger and fear as well as it could have. That is a real shame. There is so much potential and especially with this story the tension could've been build up so well with better camera work. The story definitely has great potential but as previously mentioned it would have been expressed so much better with some good camera work but is at least for the most part compensated by solid direction. The best aspect of the story is the ending. The score is also rather disappointing for it could also have helped to underline the emotions that were expected. The direction here is a strong point. There are many good elements that were considered in the set and building of surprise in some scenes. In conclusion we can say that ""Life"" is a solid sci-fi thriller that builds some suspense and is quite entertaining. The story and emotions could have been underlined better by the camera work and score but otherwise it is a solid thriller."

"Troy_Campbell","6","4","9","23 March 2017"," Tense and good looking, but lacks originality
","The trapped-in-space subgenre is one of the most common within the cinematic sci-fi realm. In order to stand out something special is required, a spark of inventiveness that shines a new light on a well-worn plot. This mainstream thriller from Safe House director Daniel Espinosa doesn't have that spark; in fact, by all outwards appearances, it's not even attempting to breathe fresh air into its decades-old formula. It's just trying to entertain. Essentially a C-grade outing decorated with A-grade trimmings, Espinosa stretches every dollar of his relatively modest $58 million budget in order to employ cutting edge CGI and a ridiculously talented cast, which goes a long way in disguising the entirely unoriginal story. The set pieces are executed with flair, often mounting tension and unease before culminating in unexpected violence; an early death establishing the uncompromising tone that permeates all the way to the very end. The lack of narrative innovation aside, the other major blunder is the visualisation of the otherworldly threat. All muscle and all brain (as we're told numerous times), the design of the creature is rather dull and unmemorable. As for the humans on screen, they all bring their best despite tackling some wooden dialogue and clichÃ©d character traits, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson having the biggest impact. Life doesn't add anything new or ground breaking to the sci-fi genre, but it does serve up a suspenseful, good looking and solidly acted outer-space thriller."

This has all been done before. I want to say if this was made in the 70s, it might be groundbreaking, but there are simply too many movies that have been made almost identically to this to see it as anything special.<br/><br/>It is a decent movie to watch. It's well-made, and it did hold my attention for the most part. At the same time, it felt very thin in key areas like character development and plot. It is shot well- the cinematography is good and the music is effective to raise the intensity. It flirts with parts and material that could make it an 8/10, but unfortunately as a whole it just doesn't quite sit well enough to be that good, and at best I can see a 7/10.<br/><br/>However, all in all, there's just something about it that I didn't like, despite it not being a bad movie.

Well, by now the creature had killed or maimed 3 people in a brutal and horrific way, yet they were still calling it Calvin! So if the name chosen by the school kids had been 'Fluffy', or 'Darling', they'd still be calling it that?

","Although it's far from a masterpiece, the movie is not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. However with a relatively original premise (not really comparable to Alien any more than Event Horizon is) and a great cast, it still kind of falls short.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and the dialogue is believable, however this is where the good writing stops. Although these astronauts should be the pinnacle of humanity, they act completely illogicaly and are seemingly driven only by emotion for each other, which ultimately leads them to their demise.
The actors aren't given too much to work with, and I sense a problem with an inadequate director (considering his previous Child 44 clunker) who doesn't pull out emotional performances from the actors. The direction is otherwise serviceable with some tense moments and jump scares, although there is major problems with pacing as this movie comes off as overlong.<br/><br/>The effects are truly great and are surely the highlight of the film, keeping you almost engaged until the final scene, with a conclusion that is predictable as soon as you see the editing in the final scene."

"commander_zero","4","3","6","11 March 2019"," Pointless and Cruel
","We all have our own ideas about which might be the most disastrous trends in current Hollywood filmmaking. I vote for the trend that allows directors to essentially remake the science fiction action films that influenced them when they were young. This is the trend that in recent years has given us such dispensable works as Predators (NimrÃ³d Antal), The Thing (Matthijs van Heijningen), and Terminator Genisys (Alan Taylor). While directors such as Denis Villeneuve and Alex Garland have been laboring over sci-fi films such as Arrival and Annihilation - original works with layers of meaning that are revealed in subsequent viewings - these guys have been devoting precious time, hiring a huge range of impressive talents, and spending massive amounts of money, essentially to restage the cool scenes and remake the groovy films that so impressed them thirty or forty years ago.
Now we can add to this sad lot Life, director Daniel Espinosa's remake of Alien. Life deserves to be grouped with the films above - not Annihilation and Arrival, I mean the other, rotten ones - although to give credit where it's due, the film is the best of a bad lot. Its recreation of everyday life in the zero-G conditions of a space station is masterful and often beautiful, performed by an expert cast, and produced with obsession attention to realistic detail.
But what's the plot? An alien life form gets on board and is at first a source of wonder: as Jeff Goldblum says in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, ""Oooh, ahhh, that's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming."" In a Jurassic Park movie, at least there are dinosaurs to look at, and the chance of escape. In Life, once the monster grows big enough, it first crushes a disabled astronaut's hand - his agony played out for us lovingly in real time - and then eviscerates a rescuer, and then proceeds one by one to kill everyone on board horribly until at the end - SPOILER ALERT - it makes its way to earth, where its arrival will certainly end life as we know it.
What the hell is going on here? The film was written by the same guys who write the Deadpool films, which make horrific violence funny by cloaking it in a kind of live-action Roadrunner-vs-Coyote ambience. Life reveals the weakness behind their sensibility: without the jokes, the fast cuts, and Ryan Reynolds (who departs too soon from Life), the violence is just pointless and cruel - not only for the film's characters, but for its viewers."

","Set aboard the International Space Station a team of scientists are preparing to analyse soil samples that a probe has brought back from Mars. A single cell is found in the sample; tiny but enough to prove that there is life of non-terrestrial origin. It gradually begins to grow and appears to react to stimuli. The news is greeted with excitement on Earth and the lifeform is quickly dubbed 'Calvin'. Inevitably it isn't long before things go wrong. After an accident in the lab it gets out of its quarantine container and attacks the crew. They struggle to keep it in the lab but it manages to get out and as it feeds it grows. They have to contemplate the fact that their mission is now to stop it getting to Earth rather than merely saving themselves.<br/><br/>Given that this features a deadly alien creature and is set aboard the ISS it is hardly surprising that it is described as 'Alien' meets 'Gravity'; that is a little unfair though. I didn't think it was as good as those films but it didn't feel like a rip-off to me. Even if the central idea wasn't the most original it was effective. Once Calvin is on the loose the tension rises quickly and there are some fairly disturbing moments. The location provides a great sense of claustrophobia and unlike most space based films there is no artificial gravity. There are some questionable moments but occasionally these are required to advance the plot... there wouldn't have been much of a story if they didn't make the mistakes that led to Calvin's escape. The cast, including some big names does a fine job; most notably Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Hiroyuki Sanada. The special effects are pretty impressive; both the realistic space shots and the creature design. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of sci-fi horror; it may not be the best in the genre but it is very far from the worst I've seen."

Interestingly, the 'life' that wreaks havoc on the science team started as a microbial life form from Mars. Not suggesting that is likely microbial life from Mars could mutate as a full blown creature; in in real world Martian microbial life would most likely kill by inhalation. Though the movie does try to depict space life more realistically than many other sci-fi films I have seen, Hollywood does pull out some dramatic licenses here; especially with the creature somehow flying about in the open vacuum of space without imploding.

The narrative of Life sets the viewer on an experience full of twists and horrors, the characters are portrayed with a level of deft realism, excepting Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds) as the generic funny guy. This character providing my main gripe with the film. Outside of this cliched character Life engages the viewer through insightful and thoughtful characters. Each flawed and human, yet driven and believable. The performances of Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson shining above the rest. This film engages the audience and provides an exciting and powerful opening, portraying the awe of such a discovery of new life.

Seriously, there's no room for that in this kind of film. Save it for Deadpool 2, buddy!<br/><br/>The rest of the ship's crew is formed by the average characters: there's a family guy, ONE black guy, the introspective guy that abandoned mankind (Jake Gyllenblorghpf - whatever his name is) and the others.<br/><br/>Sure, there's the one that sacrifices herself, locking herself out of the ship to save the others. Then there's the tough decision: to allow the creature to enter the ship again. They all die one by one, until there's just one female, that would be saved but gets doomed to float eternally through space, and Jake, who chose to be the one to be thrown into space with the creature (to save mankind), but the creature (very intelligent, even able to operate a small ship)makes them both return to Earth, where it will grow as a plague and kill us all.<br/><br/>The entire plot is bad: ""Oh, we found some living cells on another planet. They have been dormant for ages. Let's feed them and probe them with an electric stick to see what happens. Oh, it's growing, multiplying, getting smarter, eating us, killing us..."" <br/><br/>The end.<br/><br/>I mean, how repetitive is this?

Standard formula takes a grip of the viewer, who will be killed? who is next? will anyone survive? and etc. The makers - just to continue the unadventurous theme - throw in a Deep Blue Sea moment, while Hiroyuki Sanada has wandered in off of Sunshine's Icarrus II to feature aboard the International Space Station. The ending has and will infuriate many, but personally I liked it, very much from The Twilight Zone dimension, to which it lifts the piece just above averageville.<br/><br/>Not recommended with any conviction, especially to sci-fi fans stung by serious science defects and logic holes, while casual sci-fiers would be better off with the brilliance of Alien or something more fun packed and unpretentious like Leviathan (1989).

"tomsview","7","3","6","20 July 2017"," When a Martian wants to hug it out
","We know the scenario, but the filmmakers set themselves the challenge of doing it better than we've ever seen it done before - and they almost succeeded.<br/><br/>The movie is set on the International Space Station orbiting Earth. There are six astronauts including Dr David Jordan, Jake Gyllenhaal's character. They are awaiting an unmanned probe returning from the surface of Mars with soil samples. When it arrives, what at first looks like a piece of Martian snot, turns out to be the organism that wiped out life on the red planet. As it grows, it threatens to do the same to Earth if it can get down there.<br/><br/>You can probably guess what happens if you have seen ""Alien"" or ""Apollo 18"". However the effects in this movie rock; they would have to be the best ever for a movie like this. I remember back in the 1950's when you could see the fishing line holding up the spaceships - we can thank Stanley and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for the special effects leap to hyperspace; they just got better and better until now you can't believe your eyes - maybe it is proof aliens have visited Earth.<br/><br/>However special effects can't be the whole show; the heart of the story has to be the characters. There are six of them and we get to know them a little before the Martian organism, nicknamed Calvin, starts to pick them off. I must admit I liked these guys a lot more than the crew of the Nostromo in ""Alien""; they are a classier bunch altogether and less foulmouthed. <br/><br/>As the Martian entity grows, it hunts the crew down one by one in some truly terrifying scenes. Anyone who has battled an Australian huntsmen spider around their bedroom will identify with the plight of Jake and the guys.<br/><br/>But a film needs to end right for it to be truly memorable, and I don't love the ending of this one. It's a bit tricky and doesn't have the weight of the rest of the film; it would have been fine for an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"".<br/><br/>Even an ending like the one in another close encounter with Martians, 1950's""Rocketship X-M"", gave more satisfying closure. Despite primitive effects and laughable dialogue, it finished with a sense of sacrifice as the surviving crew stoically accepted the inevitable. But maybe that's just me."
"AnishMisra","8","3","6","13 July 2017"," Life Review
","Life is a film directed by Daniel Espinosa. Now when I saw the trailer for this film, I was quite excited for the film, as I like these kind of films. And at the end I was very satisfied with the kind of film that was finally made.<br/><br/>Plot: A team of 6 astronauts inspect a soil sample from Mars to dangerous consequences.<br/><br/>Story and Direction: Now what made me attract to this film is basically the writers: Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. The team gave us the phenomenal Deadpool that came out last year. The writing for this film is good. There are sequences that actually give some depth to these characters. I can feel with all these characters every second. Especially Sho's character. He was my favorite. We see the kind of difficulty that he is facing as a father not being there for his child when he is born. Then the crew giving him support. But where the writing falls short is the familiar kind of story. This story was shown before in the very famous Alien that is some 40 years old. And some scenes actually seemed so technical that I couldn't get the film in some aspects. Also the unnecessary introductory sequence and the sequence where school kids communicate with the astronauts. But on a positive note,the VFX and production design were marvelous. That is quite rare for an R rated film. Also the design for Calvin as he grew in each stage was also excellent. It was something different than the aliens we have seen in films before.<br/><br/>Acting: Jake Gyllenhaal was excellent again. I like every role that he takes up. Rebecca Ferguson was also good. She is quite underrated but with this role she proved that she too has range. Ryan Reynolds was good too in his short role. Hiroyuki Sanada was excellent. His scenes made me get attracted to him. Ariyon Bakare was also great. And finally, Olga Dihovichnaya was also good.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where in Sho's kid was born. The way he guides his wife through the tablet and his crew simultaneously giving him support was phenomenal.<br/><br/>Verdict: The film is good, if not great. There are some faults with this film but that doesn't always mean it is a bad film.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."
"Reno-Rangan","7","3","6","4 July 2017"," Their historic discovery was not celebratable.
","As I mentioned many times before, now is the trend of the space exploration in films. So there were many films like this one, but not all of them are received well. It was a decent flick, if you consider from the real world aspect, but definitely a very nice entertainer. Very tense plot, especially in the second half till the final scene.<br/><br/>This is a minimal cast film and the entire story takes place in an Internation Space Station in the Earth orbit with a lab facility. They've come from Mars with a soil sample to study for any sign of life. Their historic discovery does not become a happy event as they encounter life threatening trouble on-board. The remaining is to focus their rest of the mission that how it'll end.<br/><br/>This is the second film with the same name I've seen in the recent time. The other one was a biographical-drama starring Robert Pattison, but this is an sci-fi-thriller. Lots of big names in it, but the film did not make that kind of a big buzz. It was considered a good fictional space film. Kind of inspired by other similar themed flicks.<br/><br/>Lots of thrills, fast paced narration, a simple story with the nice visuals. From the Swedish director of 'Easy Money' fame. There were lots of speculations about its connection with other films. But nothing was confirmed by the filmmakers. I hope there will be a sequel, but this time it won't be same as the story might take place in a different setting. Overall, I enjoyed it and surely would suggest it if anybody asks me.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Many reviewers here are pointing out the logic in every move of the film. You can only read them, and wonder what level of space experts they are. It only tells me they loved it by going over every detail, yet they are saying it's dumb. I bet they were scared too. I don't dig deep in accuracy details for a sci-fi fantasy film. It's not a biopic or historical. Of course, you want it to be plausible, and I think the movie accomplishes that overall. <br/><br/>Now on to the good stuff. This movie was very scary, and felt realistic in effect. The monster, although gaining too much intelligence for my plausibility liking, was intense. I felt frightened. I also felt like it was happening to me while watching. My rating for movie skyrockets when that happens. All the actors did serviceable jobs moving the film along, and the special effects were great. I felt the same nervousness when I saw Alien for the first time. People will argue no way, but for me it was darn close, if not better in some ways. <br/><br/>No character really stood out, and not much of any back stories. Jake was the star, and no inter-relationships really stood out. The film's main purpose was to chill you, so I'm okay with that. The end really made me feel dread."

","I LOVE these kinds of movies and after seeing it can say it has got to be one of the worst I've ever seen. Allow me to explain, normally I wouldn't have been so frustrated if it were a ""B"" Movie or small- time production, HOWEVER, this movie was mainstream with a relatively large budget and meant to be taken seriously rather than laughed at. Because of this I expected this movie to be agreeable- few major flaws, good plot, etc... During the movie I had many issues with the claims about this ""alien"" such as it being smart enough to know it was breaking the coolant in a suit specifically to drown a crew member when it had no way of even learning what a suit was. I hoped that this scene and a few others would be the only flaws in the movie, however, the ENTIRE movie consisted of flaws that were so obvious it became more entertaining to begin taking count than to watch the rest of the movie (Or at least less infuriating). I feel I ought to note that I have no problem with the alien winning, only that the ways in which it was created, learned, and survived throughout the movie was utterly ridiculous and impossible- even for a near invincible alien species. The only upside to this movie was the graphics and decent acting."

"maggimar","6","3","6","8 June 2017"," Not the best, not as bad as people claim
","OK first things first. This is a science FICTION movie. So those who bash this movie for being unscientific at times obviously should avoid movies that involve aliens. Never in the history of mankind have their been documented cases of other intelligent life forms, therefor the writers have the choice to make the alien, the plot and the script however they want it in consideration to the alien life form. Also, do people really expect going to the movies to see a film with aliens in it and expect it to be scientifically accurate? Really? I guess i'm just weird.. Anyway the science was not 100% accurate and I never expected it to be.<br/><br/>Let's move on to the script. For me I was not expecting a deep story with complex characters in a movie like this. In fact what i got was more then I had hoped for. The story centers on a crew on the international space station. They receive soil from mars and upon exploring it they find a single cell organism that is hibernating. They mess with the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and awaken this organism. The organism begins to grow and they later find out the ""alien"" is hostile. You don't have to wait long for the movie to start properly and the beginning is quite fast paced and only gives you a little information about each character. For that reason the connection towards each crew member is limited but I still felt they did a decent job with it, since the movie was more about the action on the space station. The crew trying to figure out a way to kill the alien, rescue each other and most of all making sure the alien never reaches earth.<br/><br/>Now the movie is far from being perfect, it has its flaws. The story could have been better but I never felt it was bad since the action made up for it in my opinion. The acting was good with the material they had.<br/><br/>The biggest reason I see that people have a problem with the movie is how scientifically incorrect the movie is. And i'd like to mention the issues I have read now.<br/><br/>1. Alien survived being burnt and the vacuum of space.<br/><br/>To those people who felt that was so horrible i'd like to introduce you to the magnificent microscopic TARDIGRADE! Tardigrades are microscopic animals that live here on earth. They can survive in any environment including inside volcano's and boiling water. They can also survive in temperatures near absolute zero. AND YES.. they can live in the vacuum of space for 10 days and even more. There are over 1000 species of Tardigrades in the world and more are discovered every year. So if we have a animal here on earth that can do all that... it's not so impossible that an alien in a science fiction movie can do it to right?<br/><br/>2. ""It needs oxygen, and then doesn't need oxygen, and then needs it again. Decide if the alien needs oxygen!""<br/><br/>I feel these people just didn't watch the movie. From the moment they found the alien they said. It lives on oxygen and water like us. OK fair. Upon learning more about it they said. He can STORE oxygen for some period of time and survive on that. All through the movie they mention this. When the alien is locked outside they say that he can't stay out there forever.. that's why the alien was trying to get back in to the space station. When the alien was holding the oxygen candle. It was because the oxygen was being depleted from the space station. Which means the aliens oxygen was being depleted. That's why it followed the oxygen candles. People just trying to find something to bitch about.<br/><br/>3. Crew members make stupid decisions all the time.<br/><br/>People need to understand that very likely there is no protocol for this scenario. They just picked up some soil from mars with a single cell organism that was in hibernation. I doubt they have had any training if this situation comes up that an alien with super intelligence starts killing everybody on the space station. An alien nobody has ever seen before. Also the human factor. It is very understandable that the captain can not risk saving one person if there is a possibility he is putting everybody else at risk. This we all know. It is also understandable that someone on the crew might not follow orders to try and save a friend from dying. Like when Rory tried saving Hugh by going into the quarantine room when he had been ordered to no go in. Now in many movies characters do stupid things all the time and I myself ask why on earth did he not do that instead, its so obvious. But I never thought that in this movie cause the situations they were in is not something we can put relate to in any way. Also the decisions were not that stupid to begin with I think.<br/><br/>I can't write more, there is a limit on the words. Basically if people are going to see a movie with aliens in it you can't expect it to be 100% accurate when it comes to science. If you expect that from a science fiction movie, then who is the idiot. The people making the movie.. or you?"

And then they see it in space having no problem surviving for quite a long time and get the idea they will kill it by letting all the oxygen out of the part of the station they trap it in.<br/><br/>The fact that any of these 'scientists' even broke quarantine was far too unbelievable.<br/><br/>Physics was also completely ignored at the end with the escape pods 'flying off into space' which cannot happen because they would have to increase their velocity by thousands of km/h.

The visuals are amazing, the set-up works well. Introduction is swift and the plot is simple enough, so it doesn't need a ton of exposition showed down your throat. Unfortunately things go awry very soon and I was left with too many What? Why? How-the-hell? and That doesn't work that way! in my head to take anything that happened next seriously. <br/><br/>If you like movies for production values, then go ahead.

"judah-usmc","4","3","6","30 March 2017"," Spoiler Free Review from an Alien/Aliens Fan
","When I heard that this movie was being compared to Alien I got pretty excited. I'm a huge fan of Alien and Aliens (I just pretend the other ""Aliens"" movies don't exist). Alien was a genre shattering film that set the bar in dark, brooding, cerebral scifi. So, to compare this to Alien, is high praise indeed.<br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way right now. This isn't Alien, it's not even close and it makes me think the people comparing it don't understand either films.<br/><br/>Alien is a Science Fiction Thriller. I use the term thriller here because it's a movie with tons of suspense, really intense scenes with very high stakes. The Alien was smart, resourceful, deadly, and equal in strength to the protagonists. Set in a realistic environment, it just ratcheted up the tension even more. The Alien itself was also well thought out, logical in it's behavior and biological processes. It was a strange and otherworldly creature, but it also made sense, which is one of the things that made it so terrifying.<br/><br/>Life on the other hand is a Science Fiction Horror. I really don't like horror movies. There are some horror movies that are done well and are quite interesting, but I don't feel this is one of them. This wasn't exactly gore porn like Event Horizon, but it was brutal and violent at times, even shocking. The atmosphere wasn't dark and brooding like Alien, rather it was bleak and hopeless. The hits keep coming, and as a horror film, the alien is more powerful that the people it beats on. This gives the film a feeling of inevitable doom. If horror is your thing, then you'll probably enjoy this overwhelmingly dark atmosphere. If you're more like me and liked Alien because it was suspenseful and cerebral you may want to skip this one. <br/><br/>I gave it a 4 because the first 20 minutes are great, perfectly paced, and the tension is high so it really delivers on that front. But so many things were broken in this film, not least of which was the unexpected genre mistyping that I just couldn't enjoy this film at all.<br/><br/>If you love foreboding, doom filled horror and sci fi this is your movie, otherwise, steer clear."

I did not expect anything from this movie other than some fun, and i certainly did not get it. This movie is very boring. There is a lot of exposition at the beginning basically telling the audience everything they need to know and there is 6 characters introduced in the movie, and you don't care about any of them since they are not fleshed out. And since you don't care about any of them, tension is now lost because of this.There is one scene when Jake Gyllenhall's character is talking about why he loves to be in space, but there is no reason behind it. There is absolutely no motivation throughout the movie. Characters make idiotic decisions and it is not real. The script is horrible and there is absolutely no direction. Throughout the movie things just happen and there is no room to breathe in and let the characters flourish. Believe it or not, there is some things I like about the movie. The design of the alien is unique and the CGI accompanying it was great. The cinematography is sometimes impressive as the first time we enter the station is done in one shot and the final act was really well shot (I'll talk about the ending in a bit). The performances were good but the chemistry not so much. This movie gives throwbacks to other films and they come off forced as sh*t. There are a lot of stupid decisions and stuff happening but if I talk about all of them in detail, this review will be very long. The ending was awful, predictable, forced and hilarious. I don't think this movie deserves the praise it has by critics and it will be forgotten very quick. 4.5/10"

And that is my problem with ""Life,"" I've seen this story in various permutations too, too many times. And ""Life"" despite the fact that it has a really neat creature and spectacularly good production values, wastes my time by telling a familiar story with familiar characters.

Early on, the science and the CGI depicting the creation of the creature gave me chills and great hope that something new and interesting was coming. But eventually the movie found its rut, somewhere between the afore mentioned ""Alien"" films and John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" And once it fell into that rut, the only thing the makers did was decorate. ""Life"" is a beautiful film, with some Earth-from-space shots that made me melancholy for the fact that I will never be able to go there and see that. But once I realized that I had seen the story before, the cinematography and special effects were ALL that held my interest.<br/><br/>Maybe for movie-goers who haven't seen the earlier versions of ""Life,"" this will be ""their version"" of ""Alien."" ""Life"" is well-made, well directed and well-acted and may be worthy of becoming the ""Alien"" franchise of this generation. <br/><br/>One final note, and I don't think this is a spoiler: At the beginning of ""Life"" the narrator delivers the information that Pilgrim was hit by space debris and knocked off course. I think that could foreshadow the resolution to a situation left unresolved at the conclusion of ""Life."""

","An homage to 'Alien', where a crew in space find themselves threatened by a creature from another world. The effects are dazzling, as the crew is in zero gravity the entire time floating and shooting themselves around the space station. There are some good points about scientific hubris and some scary moments as 'Calvin' evolves from a single cell to a jelly/starfish to a full on floating, slithering killer.<br/><br/>However, there are numerous plot holes including how their entire triple-quarantine system fails. When Calvin escapes the lab by squeezing into a tiny fire control vent, he should be trapped in that closed system. BTW, the flamethrower was out of fuel so how did it trigger the sprinklers? When the Soyuz comes to push them into space, there should have been no way the crew member could have opened their hatch; they had to expect that maybe someone wouldn't want to go into oblivion. Calvin's indestructibility was another. (He's carbon based and needs oxygen, but can survive in space? He hibernated on Mars and in the lab.] Finally, the twist end - that you can see coming - was really more of a cheat. Both escapees were pretty calm if their respective missions weren't working. I was hoping for a double-twist, ""War of the Worlds"" ending where Calvin jumped into the sea and dissolved in the salt water."

The monster was scary as hell.<br/><br/>This film really only suffers from two things.<br/><br/>The first is that the story mentions, but doesn't clearly articulate that this was a privately funded mission, held on a private space station. A lot of the disbelief comes from our assumption that every character should be prepared for every eventuality. That's how NASA operates. But for the most part they act like people who are experts in their respective fields, but have no training to deal with things that are outside the scope of their expertise. It's the ""Doctor in a fender bender"" scenario dialed up to a 1000. And it's totally explainable with a more clear emphasis on this not being a military or government operation.<br/><br/>The other thing is an attempt at a gotchya moment at the end.

By a quarter of the way into the film I was literally sitting on the edge of seat until the end. The life form they are studying on board and watching how it progresses was captivating in itself. The movie had it's flaws, but the overall experience was very enjoyable. For what it was intended to be, it succeeded on every level. 'Life' has nice camera angles, long shots, an all around superb cast, good graphics and a nasty alien. Best of all, an ending that was worth the wait. There are many people, as usual, whining about realism. Life is set in modern day Earth orbit where some astronauts play with martian soil.

"hegedus_dani02","8","5","13","3 April 2017"," A freshening non-Ridley sci-fi horror
","First, I have to admit what you've probably heard. Life completely lacks originality, but not just in it's plot but also in it's characters (including the ""Martian"") and visual style. Then why would I gave it an 8 by 10 and say that this feature is freshening? <br/><br/>Well, believe it or not, the film's non-originality is not bothering at all (at least not me). The story is approximately the same as Alien's and Prometheus' till the half of the flick, but the filmmakers at least don't decline the similarity and influences of the plot. As for the camera-work, it's quite blatant that the creators tribute the cinematography to Stanley Kubrick, especially the opening 3 minutes long sequence which immediately reminded me to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The problem comes with the characters, because they not just lacks originality but also far from the so-called three-dimensional characters. <br/><br/>So let's start with the characters. Probably the only properly- developed character in this flick is Ariyon Bakere's Hugh Derry. He surprisingly stay alive after Kelvin nearly teared-off his leg and this survival gives a pretty emotional line to the story, which raises questions about survival, humanity and life itself. Fortunately, the screenwriters didn't want scramble up in these questions, so Life only raise them and don't want to answer them. <br/><br/>As for the technical aspects, we can state is pretty good. The direction is fascinating (especially in the closing scene but that's for later). I believe that Daniel Espinosa is a pretty director in the under-appreciated 'section' (of course not in the same level as for example Denis Villeneuve) and if he keeps getting better than he can easily become a classic filmmaker in the future. The visual effects are acceptable considering the limited budget of the picture. The cinematography and the editing are average possibly except the opening sequence.<br/><br/>And I cannot finish my review without highlighting the ending. Oh man I saw plenty classic and average movies with outstanding endings, but Life really among the top of them. I don't want spoil it at all, but I strongly believe that this movie's ending will become a classic in a few decades from now, just like 12 Monkey's did. <br/><br/>Life is definitely not a classic, but I think it's a bit under- appreciated and the ending definitely worth your time. Go and see it!"
"NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954","9","5","13","27 March 2017"," Life (2017) Movie Review – Is This Sci-fi Film Recycling Other Sci-fi Films?
","No. This movie isn't a remake or re-imagining of the 1999 Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence movie of the same name. So don't expect to see Murphy fighting over some cornbread in space or anything like that.<br/><br/>If this movie feels familiar, it just might be. Many people saw this trailer, and said to themselves, ""Why are you reenacting the script of 'Aliens'?"" While watching this movie, just from the trailer alone, you feel a vibe of other science fiction films you've seen before. <br/><br/>Did We See This Movie Before?<br/><br/>While watching this, I constantly kept saying to myself all of the movies that are like this. It reminded me of Alien, Splice, Gravity, Cloverfield, The Fly, Ex Machina, Apollo 18, Predator, and The Thing. <br/><br/>There are a lot of films that have this blueprint, a lot of films that follow this formula. In my opinion, even Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus) is starting to reenact his own movies. Even the movie Alien isn't the first movie of its kind. The whole finding new life or a new whatever and it turns out to be dangerous has roots that go way way back in movies. <br/><br/>This film has been advertising itself like it is a science fiction and a thriller movie. However, it is more than that. It is a creature feature, a thriller, science fiction, a B- Movie, and a horror. <br/><br/>I know most movies like this do not have the best character development. However, this movie could have used just a little bit more character development. We learn little details about our characters through little lines of dialogue. For instance, Jake Gyllenhaal's character seems like a loner. He says in the movie how he never belonged on Earth, and he likes the hum of space more than the noise of Earth. <br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds character is the one character I didn't feel a connection to. The only thing we really know about his character is he wants to kill Calvin, and he is an astronaut plumber. Meaning, when the astronauts use the bathroom, and all that feces, all that stool is floating around on the ship, Reynolds character fixes the toilet, and disposes the waste.<br/><br/>Speaking of Ryan Reynolds, this movie is from the same director as Safe House, which also starred Reynolds. I didn't like the movie Safe House. But I'm glad the director worked with Reynolds again, because I thought Reynolds was very good in Safe House.<br/><br/>""In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream.""<br/><br/>Accordingly, even though the alien Calvin is our biggest threat in the movie, there is another threat that is just as scary. The threat being the elements of space. This movie, much like Gravity, shows the audience how horrifying outer space can really be.<br/><br/>Gravity plays a horror role as well. Calvin grows up to be like a very large stingray that can easily glide through space. While the astronauts have difficulty moving around, getting where they need to go in a quick manner, and adapting to their surroundings. <br/><br/>Also, Calvin was made for this environment, unlike humans. Once our resources run out in space, we might as well consider ourselves dead. We have a lack of oxygen, limited oxygen, it's cold, and there is even a scene where someone drowns in their suit because their helmet floods with harmful liquid. <br/><br/>About 95 percent of the movie takes place inside the space station. This creates a claustrophobic environment as well. So overall, these characters have more than just Calvin to deal with.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is it could have been more original. It takes the best parts out of the movies I mentioned earlier like Splice, Gravity and The Thing, and they make that their movie.<br/><br/>I really want to give this movie a perfect rating. I had fun, it was entertaining, and I personally had a blast. On the other hand, in order for me to give it a perfect rating, it would have had to be just a little bit more original. All that being said, I believe the 2017 movie 'Life' earns<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10!<br/><br/>Well if no one in space can hear me scream, I'm ready to get back to Earth, and get back to some cornbread, because I'm getting pretty hungry. <br/><br/>Until next time, thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)<br/><br/>Life (2017) Movie Review Written By - Nile Fortner"

"Humphreywashere","5","5","13","25 March 2017"," The thrill is substantially outweighed by the cringe factor
","The premise is fascinating- the first extraterrestrial carbon-based life-form is discovered and its analysis takes place on a space station orbiting earth. When this organism poses a catastrophic threat to the lives of others, the story becomes terrifying. However, unlike Alien (a comparator), the characters behaviour from the start is completely unrealistic. What they do, what they say, has been solely contrived to set-up the terror that follows. The stakes are so high, yet the characters always respond inappropriately to events, they never collaborate, they never review their protocols, they have no plan, their affect (emotional response) is often subdued, flat, and inappropriate. The viewer feels manipulated, and incredulous and any transference and credibility is lost. This contrasts starkly with the engaged, switched on, yet terrified characters in the movie Alien. This is why 'Life' fails. It is not the horror and gore that is unpleasant, it is the human and technical repeated mistakes (no Swiss cheese hypothesis here), abuse of physics, and human incompetence. This can only be attributed to poor script writing and/or commercial interests. However, Alien was a huge commercial success, proving to movie makers that the investment in script and storyline will ensure longevity, whereas 'Life' will be forgotten in a fraction of time. PS. The musical score at the end is sensational, Very similar to Sicario, and even more foreboding."

","I love sci/fi space movies in fact I live and breathe space movies. From 2001: A Space Oddycey to Arrival, I love the idea of having a crew venture out into the cold darkness of space to either find a home or research a newly found species in the solar system. In Life, you have 3 great actors. One of them is the first space movie in his career, Ryan Reynolds. He still was a merc with a mouth but gave good humor in his part. However so naturally in a space film everyone is serious and don't run their mouth all the time. Ryan's character in a space film felt kinda out of place, like he was standing the most in comparison of the crew. This whole cilm is shot perfectly. Of course in a space film, the photography has to be precise. No shaky cam or anything like that. You really feel that you're on the station. You really feel that you're out in space the whole movie. The script is absolutely fantastic. You really do care about these characters and how they interact with each other. And you can feel the situation they're in is incredibly stressful and and every decision they make is key to their survival. Overall, Ryan Reynolds does kinda stand out from the crew, but his dialogue is enjoyable. This whole movie is stressful and intense. It succeeds in grabbing your attention the whole ride."
"CountJonnie","7","4","10","11 June 2017"," Stands firmly on its own
","One of the trivia says the movie is based on Alien (1979). That wouldn't be respectful to Life. Life indeed is in space, but in closer orbit to the earth, but also with a more realistic threat that feels close to home.<br/><br/>But the real surprise is that the actors carry the movie, and not the alien. The threat is real, looks real and feels real, but never turns this movie into a science fiction / horror movie. The movie is a thriller/drama that evolves with the choices that people have to make, their vulnerabilities, naivity and bravery. And as the characters evolve, so does the alien.<br/><br/>So as much as the alien is a threat to all of humanity, it also brings forth the humanity of all people on screen. And they do that with limited props, limited space and limited screen time. Therefor this movie succeeds in what other movies couldn't.<br/><br/>Life is claustrophobic, scary, intense, and all too human and all too real. You'll believe the characters and dangers, which will both keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The only minus is the ending. Personally I'd suggest to consider it a 'what if' ending, and don't ask for a sequel."

","This movie has a cool poster and some nice CGI and nothing else worth noticing. The beginning starts out fairly realistic. Slow as molasses, it barely starts to build up then it goes downhill super fast. A very underwhelming experience. I guess this is what happens when you got a serious screenplay, written by comedians. There are only two fully-developed characters so you already know who is going to survive. After a few people die, the rest of the crew keeps repeating ""all it wants, is to survive..."" to justify the Pokemon thing. Oh really? Yeah that's why it's so blood hungry all the time. Only about ten minutes after a kill and it's already lusting for another. Is it killing in defense? No. Is it killing because it's hungry? No. Huh? Then what- The movie claims it is a thriller and a horror movie. Thriller? Is it a thriller if you can predict every sentence and every scene? No. But I guess that makes it a horror movie though.

"AramIsaac","7","4","10","6 May 2017"," Should've focused at the research
","The only reason I wanted to see this film was Jake Gyllenhaal. If he is in a movie, it is certainly an OK movie. Still I didn't have much expectations, because the horror-films nowadays aren't as good as they were 10 years ago. I loved the beginning; it is very slow, and original. The research is nice to watch, and the events and acting is very good actually. But when the Martian started to become hostile, the film goes south. It's thrilling, I gotta admit. But if I want to see some cruel and disturbing scenes, I'm going to watch The Walking Dead or something. What really disturbed me was the fact none of the crew members, except for Miranda, knew about the protocol that if the Martian got out the lab, they would all be swang in deeper space. That should've been told to the astronauts before they went on the mission. The reactions of the characters nevertheless are kinda natural. They all panicked, and when they realize they aren't gonna make it, they sacrify themselves. That is how I would react in such situations, so that is good. Another thing that annoyed me, is the wasting of Ryan Reynolds. He is a good actor, but he is the first person to die. If he would've been the comic relief of the film, this movie would be much and much better. The ending is nigh, and that fits the movie. I did like the ending, however it suggests everyone on earth will die. However I didn't have high expectations, this picture disappointed me a bit. That's why I give it a 6,9/10. If you want to see a nasty horror-thriller, it is an good movie to watch. But don't expect too much."

","Calling Daniel Espinosa's Life an Alien retread is the easy thing to do. Both are tensely claustrophobic science fiction films with a violent extraterrestrial that's loose and in search of the crew. But it's also a very reductive comparison considering they are nothing alike beside genre conventions. The missions are different. The time period is different. And the creature's motivation is as dissimilar as can be. Life also can't help but stand apart on its own for one reason: it could actually happen tomorrow. We aren't readying deep space probes to find forgotten spacecraft. Mankind isn't tempting fate by forcing its control over the unknown (yet). What we are doing, however, is looking. We are visiting Mars and taking samples. We are experimenting with re-animating dormant microbial life.<br/><br/>Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick aren't therefore creating a horrific scenario out of thin air with H.R. Giger aesthetics and sky's-the- limit reach as far as imagination. They're instead writing about the pitfalls of the next logical step. If we find a single-celled organism trapped in crystal that's lived as recently as 450,000 years ago, we will attempt to bring it back. Call it science or hubris or both, it's imperative to continue our study of biology and perhaps a key to solving disease on Earth. So, like the CDC's Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), Reese and Wernick extrapolate the worst-case result of this and let it happen. North does this to ensure fail-safes aboard the International Space Station; the filmmakers do it to watch the aftermath of failure.<br/><br/>We therefore know these astronauts. They're like those who inhabit the ISS every year. There's North's microbiologist in charge of everyone's safety against the mysterious organism they hope to study. There's David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), the resident physician and ex-Marine who's been in space for over a year; Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), the mission specialist with the engineering know-how to fix mechanical issues and operate the station's robotic arm while spacewalking; Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), the navigator/pilot awaiting the birth of his first child back home; Commander Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya), the woman in charge of the mission; and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), the scientist tasked with coaxing their Martian awake. They're all qualified to be there and each possessed by a mixture of fascination and fear.<br/><br/>So what happens? The usual. But saying that doesn't mean it's boring. It's instead as authentic as a science fiction film can be since everyone stays in character and works towards finding a balance between curiosity and caution. While we get some fun with Reynolds playing the group's cocksure cowboy whose job it is to catch the shuttle holding their prospective specimen that's hurtling through space off-course, the camaraderie between all is actually quite entertaining itself because they enjoy each other's company. They're watching each other's backs and having a good time while operating in the awe-inspiring realm of space's vacuum. They go about their business and keep their well-oiled machine rolling. And they remain on the opposite side of glass from Derry and the alien. <br/><br/>Space is old hat. Aliens are not. The creature isn't built to be scary, but real. This is a living entity with undifferentiated cells—meaning its entire make-up is one hundred percent eyes, muscle, brain, and nerves. Its rate of growth is exponential as Derry feeds it, their relationship harmonious and civil as though it were a pet until an accident changes the dynamic. Like humans have done for centuries, we react as soon as something surprising occurs. We play with fire despite not knowing whether our experiment can be burned. We're cognisant to the reality that we've hurt it in a way to put its defences up, but we're too impatient to let its fear play out. So we poke, prod, and intimidate until it has but one choice: to fight back.<br/><br/>Our mistake is assuming we're at the apex of the food chain. This may be true on Earth (and only because of our capacity to invent and use weapons), but not necessarily elsewhere. It only takes one mistake, no matter how well meaning, to turn the tables and move from offence to defence. Whatever you think you can do to stop this thing will just as likely make it stronger. To place logic and earthly properties onto it is to become trapped within a box devoid of escape. There's no malicious intent or superiority on behalf of the alien (coined ""Calvin""). It simply needs food, air, and water. Unfortunately, it has the means to acquire those things in ways that render us impotent to stop it.<br/><br/>Its quest for freedom leads to a cat and mouse chase we've seen before. But familiar doesn't mean ineffective. Motivations are revealed early and each character stays true to them. Their actions are believable and the overall severity in response to their situation is pertinent to mankind's existence. It's a suspenseful journey from one death to the next as they constantly underestimate its instincts and overestimate their pragmatism. One could say Life is also a metaphor for our earthly actions. To continue assuming we know what's right by treating the ""other"" as enemy is to facilitate our own destruction. Searching to discover isn't the same as searching for power. And believing we're prepared for what that hubris delivers is nothing short of suicide. This film understands that cost."

"cschultz-2","6","3","7","29 March 2017"," We've Seen It All Before
","About three quarters of the way through ""Life,"" the new science fiction thriller from Skydance Media and Columbia Pictures, one of the characters muses to his colleagues, ""Life's existence requires destruction."" Even as simple pop psychology or a pun, it's a fairly prophetic statement: The character who speaks the line of dialogue has only a few more minutes before being dispatched by an alien in a particularly colorful way, and it occurs at a point in the picture when the audience has mostly given up hope of any sort of conventionally happy ending.<br/><br/>Set in more-or-less the present day—one character makes a reference to being a schoolboy at the time of the Challenger tragedy, and the math works out about right—in ""Life,"" the six members of the International Space Station crew are tasked with recovering an interstellar probe vessel returning from Mars with a sample of soil.<br/><br/>In analyzing the sample, the crew's biologist discovers a dormant single-cell organism, and is able to revive the specimen through the use of scientific stuff. Naturally the organism begins to grow.<br/><br/>At first the life form is fairly innocuous, resembling a cutely hungry little dandelion bud. And as news of the extraterrestrial discovery flashes across Earth below, the united schoolchildren of the world vote to name the alien life form ""Calvin."" But it becomes quickly apparent to the members of the space station crew that Calvin isn't as adorable as he seems—the organism continues to grow and grow, and eventually develops an attitude. And as usually occurs in this type of enterprise, the number one item on the alien hit list is people.<br/><br/>Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who previously teamed on ""Zombieland,"" ""Deadpool"" and one of the ""G.I. Joe"" pictures, acknowledge the influence of 1979's ""Alien"" on this picture, although ""Life"" actually is more reminiscent of the 1958 picture ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space,"" which heavily influenced the filmmakers responsible for ""Alien."" As in the 1958 picture, ""Life"" makes a persuasive case for the future inclusion of flamethrowers among the other tools routinely assigned to astronauts.<br/><br/>But Swedish filmmaker Daniel Espinosa, who previously directed ""Safe House"" in 2012, is also plainly influenced by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in portentousness if not cinematic quality. <br/><br/>The major problem with ""Life"" is that nobody involved seems to be able to decide whether the picture is science fiction or horror, so they try to cover all the bases.<br/><br/>The cast of the picture seems to be game enough to play along. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the space station's melancholy physician, Dr. David Jordan. Jordan has been on the space station continuously longer than any previous astronaut, at least long enough for his muscles to have begun to atrophy.<br/><br/>Jordan explains to a sympathetic colleague that he prefers space to life on Earth because of the relative peace. But as Calvin continues to grow in both size and hostility, Jordan must begin to rethink the notion, no matter what might be going on below.<br/><br/>Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson, recently of the latest entry of the ""Mission: Impossible"" film franchise and ""The Girl on the Train,"" appears as the space station's quarantine officer Miranda North. North is continually attempting to isolate Calvin to one part of the station, but is usually about one step behind and one or two seconds too slow. Quarantine becomes a major dilemma in ""Life,"" and finally explains to everybody's satisfaction the reason the original Apollo astronauts were sequestered for weeks following their return from the moon in 1969, a precaution many at the time thought preposterous.<br/><br/>And the genial, benign Ryan Reynolds, quickly emerging as a major Hollywood star, appears as the space station's selfless engineer and chief problem-solver, Roy Adams. Reynolds also seems to have been something of the catalyst behind the project: He's the solitary member of the cast to have previously worked with many of the picture's production team: ""Life"" screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Warnick also adapted Reynolds' breakthrough hit, last year's ""Deadpool,"" and the actor costarred with actor Denzel Washington in ""Safe House,"" director Espinoza's previous English language picture.<br/><br/>All hands onboard seem to be enjoying themselves as actors scooting themselves weightlessly through the various corridors of the space stationand frequently slamming hatches behind them in an effort to escape becoming a quick lunch for their Martian guest.<br/><br/>""Life"" ultimately works better as horror than as science fiction, and the picture is rated R for enough space carnage to almost be called ""Close Encounters of the Lurid Kind."" In fact, the picture has a little fun at the expense of Steven Spielberg's 1977 classic science fiction drama by satirizing that film's famed advertising slogan, ""We Are Not Alone,"" with their own posters, which read ""We Were Better Off Alone.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's no such humor in the picture itself, with the possible exception of keen-eyed viewers perhaps noticing that the alien as it grows begins to resemble H.G. Wells' description of the invading Martians in his 1897 novel ""The War of the Worlds."" <br/><br/>Otherwise, this is not a happy movie. ""Life"" takes a page from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" playbook by killing off one of its major stars in the second reel, and also leaves the door wide open for a sequel. And the picture's finale is genuinely nightmarish, although you'll probably figure out where the movie is heading a good five minutes before it arrives there.<br/><br/>But as these movies go, ""Life"" at 111 minutes has good production values, state of the art visual effects, and persuasive performances. It's not a bad picture, just an awfully messy one. And if the movie is not the classic of the horror or science fiction genres you were hoping for well, that's ""Life."""

","Hey ! Just saw this tonight too, I was greatly surprised by this film - I wasn't sure what to expect really;at first I thought it was just going to be about space astronauts sort 'hanging around' and surviving in a soon-derelict space station and finding cellular life - and that's it...but it turned out cooler - it became a sci-fi critter feature/Creature Feature... that life form they find, at first looks so cute/so pretty/so nice and unhostile...but then the film takes a drastic turn and shows the nastiness of Mother Nature..that Martian life form mutates into one a kind creature (like a transparent fleshy translucent-like flower or octopus or sea star...that little 'wraps' around everything and sucks their life-force - until it's clear this thing because a man-eating creature that needs food, oxygen, etc and becomes extremely powerful.... One the most horrible scene is the by Rory (one of the American Astronauts) who gets stuck with the Martian creature and it gets to enter his body by his getting in by his mouth,then it literally kills him from inside - munching him from inside and we see his body float in the dead-space (like when you see astronauts float by lack of gravity)...then we see blood spill from his mouth and it becomes literally a fountain of blood as he dies and 'floats' in this deadly silence while the creature his munching him inside... one of the most scary tense scene. The story is quite rapid and you guessed it surely : Astronauts - in space (whereelse) - who are in a space station (but of course) orbiting over the Earth - and do Astronauty things (right)...not Astro-Naughty things...although they might since some their actions (mostly errors) cost them dearly (but for the most part they never make any errors...it's just this life force as entered in the space station...just like Alien in Alien 1); so as said, they Begin doing experiment son a flagella cell they found on Mars - they reanimate it and Prove that Mars had life... but this little cell Grows Fast into a full huge organisms...until it's the size of a finger...then it starts to look like a translucent jello-ish flower octopus with flapping tentacles-like that extremely stretchy and 'clinging/choking', like tentacles wrapping themselves around anything...this thing wants to 'wrap itself' around the British scientist who handles it - until it does but its power becomes so strong that it can crack bones...so you can understand what happens it literally crushes his hand to bits...and gets to escape out of the containment room... then it becomes an alarm and hysteria as the crew members are terrified and Rory is killed by this same creature...which escapes and 'roams' around the station's ventilation or holes... hiding...like Alien (in Alien 1)...it is an homage to Alien obviously.. It's pretty freaky and the body count rises, that Martian creature is so powerful and unkillable and Extremely Intelligent - it literally can outwit the entire team... Great actors; Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gylenhall, and a few others...all convincing. Characterization is OK, not deepest though but sufficient and since it's a small crew, we get attached to most everyone.<br/><br/>And when someone does die, it is rather scary and 'like a loss for the entire cosmonaut team', you feel like their Doom is impending - they are stuck in space and are less than 10 people... everyone counts... for their survival. The film's ending Surprised me - in a great way - I won't spoil it but it finishes in a Way that is Different and Adds a Realistic Change, to the endings we always see. The film has also a touch of philosophy, ethically and moments of character drama with deep self-questioning.. thus it gets a little deeper.

","I liked this film. Now I know there are many who did not, and many more who think it is derivative of the Aliens series, but not I. For me this film was reminiscent of the horror films of my (long ago) childhood in which we know there is a creature, and we know it is close by, and so each time a door or cabinet is opened we expect it to jump out. And sometimes ... it does. And then there was this; we know what the creature looks like. For me this is a plus. Too often Sci-Fi-Fi creatures are shown moving too quickly or are somehow portrayed from so close that it is only their teeth that we see. Not so in 'Life'. We know how large the beast is from its birth till the film's end, and we know what it looks like; head to toe (though I can't swear that it had them; toes). As for the story, it is pretty much as one would expect, not better, not worse; but with the chills and surprises, the story is enough. Great acting, this film does not have any. Jake Gyllenhall seems to be sleepwalking through his role (so if its great performances you're after, this one you can miss.) Bottom line, the film held a grip on me right up to its final seconds.

And audience definitely do not necessarily know who the protogonist is until the very end. Ryan Reynolds is good. He acts as comic relief for the movie. Jake gyllenhall even though is good but his backstory is not that appealing. Rebecca anderson is great all the other actors did a wonderful job. The space station feels very good. The earth from space is awesome as in gravity. The entity in the movie really scares us,not the usual jump scares but real scares that gets under the skin of the viewer. The entity in the movie has a personality unlike other extraterestial beings in other movies. Now coming to the negetives,the graphics used for the entity was not up to the mark. It really lacks the advancement in CGI in recent years. Saying that the structure of the entity was good. The climax of the movie was awesome.

Biggest shocker: Jake Gyllenhaal manages to be boring. I never thought I'd say that about one of his performances. Rebecca Ferguson has virtually nothing to work with and the rest of the cast is all but muzzled in this cookie-cutter, throwaway screenplay. Visual splendor does make this nice to look at, but that's where the excellence stops.<br/><br/>Although this lethargic, mostly non-scary film does go on to finish strong, it is too little, too late and does not elevate this above standard fare.

'Life' stands up well to comparisons, being a well scripted and capably directed effort. I liked the way the members of the crew were fleshed out with backstory and some character development. There was a cost in terms of slackening tension but it was worth paying because you cared more about their fates. The creature was very well managed as was the spaceship interior.

"greenmemo","7","4","11","24 March 2017"," A good visual spectacle with a derivative story that it works in its own smaller terms
","I recently re watched this film and I must admit it holds up much better than other recent sci-fi pics like ""Alien: Covenant"". I cannot have enough of space movies: that is the perfect realm to have a bunch of characters faced with the unknown, to reflect on the fragility of the human condition within the grand scheme of the universe, and our limitations in understanding how we fit in it. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would be probably the most poignant ever, raising a myriad of mind boggling questions and yet movies like this insist on taking the most predictable road around it. The one that leads to just another survival endurance test with lots of cgi blood and an undistinguished monster in the middle of it all. Hollywood really has a knack for making the unknown look so familiar I have to say. However, if you can come to terms with the fact that not all movies need to have the ambition of ""2001: An Space Odyssey"", you might end up enjoying this flick quite a bit. The film starts by hitting some high notes courtesy of the production design and special effects departments, and with the introduction of some very interesting character bits. The story hints early at one of its possible themes, through Jake Gyllenhaal's character: the notion that maybe, to be able to function in space, one would need to be some sort of social outcast, incapable of being able to connect with people on Earth anymore. But this theme is dropped soon enough, and even as a source of suspense, it is downplayed later on in the movie to the gain of mere mayhem. ""Life"" should have stayed on the path of a science procedural in space, in the vein of ""The Andromeda Strain"", but probably the screenwriters haven't read enough grown up sci-fi literature to go that way, and it wouldn't have been a ""commercial"" enough of a choice to grant the big budget. From the entertainment standpoint, the film delivers a couple of good set pieces at the beginning and a surprising and thrilling first death, but then the story settles for the survival fight. I found the alien design and its behavior to be rather to be rather goofy (some of which seems to belong more to Disney's ""Flubber"" than to a space horror); however, its slushy nature and ability to squeeze in and out of the spaceship contributes to the suspense of many scenes. This is overall a good looking movie with a decent, admittedly tense first half, a rather muddled second act and a twist ending that is B movie gold."
"roshanin-81205","5","2","4","5 July 2019"," Have we seen this before?

It was called 'Alien' and a lot of people think that, when it was released, it was groundbreaking and genre defining.<br/><br/>Despite 40 years separating them, Life is very, very similar to Alien. There are a few design improvements but that's it.<br/><br/>In short, 'Life' is watchable, particularly if you haven't watched much sci-fi of the ""scary thing on a remote ship"" category.
If you want an intricate plot that has you hooked for the whole film, this isn't for you.
If you want a bit of plot setup then a scary monster chasing people, you've got it here.
Interesting characters... not massively but you could find yourself liking them.
Acting performances... nothing to write home about but passable given the material.<br/><br/>Seriously, Life is the same as Alien. In 1979 Alien was considered groundbreaking. Why did someone feel the need to make the same film in 2017?<br/><br/>There are a few differences. The crew is a bit more likeable and the fact that they study the life form in the vicinity of Earth in a structure a bit like the ISS makes you care a bit more about what happens. The artwork isn't H R Giger's, in fact I'm surprised to say I prefer the design of the creature in 'Life'.<br/><br/>And of course, the biggest difference is that there's no ship's cat.

The movie is about a soul sample collected from Mars which contains alien life.

They are handling alien life, which they have no idea about; in a glove box.<br/><br/>Long story short, it breeches containment and despite being seen as a simple creature that only wants to live by the ISSS astronauts, it outsmarts them at every turn. Right down to piloting an escape capsule to earth and perfectly controlling the landing sequence.<br/><br/>However this thing is a space squid. It has no bones. Even though it made it to earth it would be as weak as a jellyfish. Maybe not a threat to mankind, but to sea creatures and judging by how easily it is repeatedly isolated (and freed by bad luck) it would easily be caught on earth and killed.<br/><br/>

"jeremy-success","6","2","4","29 August 2017"," Good!
","If you have been around the science fiction film block a reasonable number of times, you will almost certainly see that the premise of ""Life"" is heavily derived from the movie ""Alien"". But originality in Hollywood these days is a rare thing, and I was open to seeing the same story again as long as it was done with style and a few original touches. Unfortunately, the end results pretty much lack those ingredients. The first third or so of the movie is surprisingly dull - the movie can't find awe and wonder about the premise of finding alien life from another planet, believe it or not. Then when the alien lifeform subsequently becomes a threat, you would think there would be plenty of scares and tense moments. But surprisingly, that's not the case. The so-called terror feels... well... flat. I think a big reason for that is that the human characters are not well developed. They are so bland that it's hard to care about them and feel the so-called terror that they are experiencing. The only saving grace the movie has are a few good special effects, though there are also some special effect moments that comes across as surprisingly crude and clunky (bad CGI rears its ugly head in a Hollywood movie once more!) You'd be better off rewatching ""Alien"" than this clone."

","Apart from its admittedly interesting and unexpected ending, there is little here you haven't seen before. A movie attempting to recapture the same thrills and chills that we have already been given in movies such as Alien, Predator and The Thing has a lot of work to do. It needs to hit as hard and have as much visceral and gut impact but sadly, this does not reach that bar. Gets into the nasty things jumping on people part too quickly, with great actors playing uninteresting characters, though Jake Gyllenhaal is mildly intriguing but not explored enough. The high production value and great score also makes it so much more disappointing that it doesn't strike the memorable chord. It's 2 thirds of a good movie, with the missing third being the pacing and genuine suspense. Thankfully isn't the queasy shaky cam of Daniel Espinosa's last movie Safe House, this goes the traditional route hold the camera in place and cut cut cut.

Yes, it was essentially an Alien clone, but I thought it was well done. The Alien was suitably dangerous to the point of being over the top, but that added to the suspense of the movie. I didn't see the end twist coming and it was a pleasant surprise. The actors were great, no they didn't spend huge amounts of time on them, but as the star was the Alien lifeform I don't see so many negatives coming from people. Special effects were great, and the movie never lagged or got boring for me.

","Firstly: I liked this film. I thought the special effects were good and much of the acting was up to standard. Of course, as I watched it, I got a great sense of deja vu.

In the same way that 'The Island' isn't a remake of 'Logan's Run' (and that sure as hell comes close). But it could be. Right down to the: 'let's blow it into space' idea and 'there's one survivor at the end'. Though I'll admit to liking the twist at the end.<br/><br/>Think Alien: think tracking the alien through the ship, trying to burn it with a fire device, the gradual picking off of various crewmembers Agatha Christie-style, the destruction of the ship, the escape shuttle.... yup it's all there in this film too - but actually it's all rather fun.<br/><br/>It also isn't an overly-long film, which keeps it moving along without too many 'dead' patches.<br/><br/>OK there are plot holes - and a couple of the characters needed a good bucket of cold water thrown over them - but then none of the plot would had happened and there wouldn't have been a film. Suffice it to say that, if you're a scientist dealing with unknown alien life in a sci fi film, then you're probably blinded by your role and lacking in common sense. They are here! <br/><br/>Anyway, if you liked Alien then treat this as an homage to the original and you'll have a good couple of hours (and it's actually better than Alien 3, Alien 4, Alien Covenent and Prometheus).<br/><br/>Enjoy :-)"

"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","4","2 August 2017"," A good movie, shame it had all been done before
","""Life"" is an American, (mostly) English-language film from 2017, so really new. It is perhaps the most known work by Swedish director Daniel Espinosa. The writers are Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and they are the ones who were in charge of the script for the recently very successful superhero film Deadpool, so it is no surprise Ryan Reynolds is also on board here again, especially as he already worked with Espinosa before too. Their new work here runs for roughly 100 minutes and takes us on board of the ISS when a new life form on planet Mars is discovered. The film is set a bit in the future as we hear there's 8 billion people living on Planet Earth at that point. Apart from Reynolds, Oscar nominee Jake Gyllenhall is the star here, but Rebecca Ferguson, Hiroyuki Sanada and Ariyon Bakare are known as well. You could really say they got a diverse cast here as the film got White Caucasians, African-Americans, Asians, Russians... Fits in nicely with recent criticism in Hollywood (or not because Asians and Russians weren't complaining). But that's another story. Back to the movie now.<br/><br/>My reference in the title refers to the 1979 Ridley Scott movie ""Alien"". This one we have here reminded me so much of that classic and I am positive this is not just because I watched Alien the other day. The title, the growing creature killing one space ship/station member after the next, the female/male proportion up there, the refusal to open airlocks, the way they recognize Earth is not necessarily a friend and they may not want them to return etc. There were at least a dozen other examples in there and you will recognize them when you see them. So yes this is a bit of a modern ""Alien"" for sure and with all the similarities I refuse to believe that this was coincidence. The two writers must have been clearly inspired by Alien because overall the parallels exist to such an extent that it just cannot be coincidence anymore. This means we do not have the most original movie here, but still a very good one, even if in my opinion it is all too technical early on and needs a while to get going really. But then it is quite impressive, actually closer to ****/***** than to **/*****.<br/><br/>This is obviously not an actors' movie, but it is all about the creature, the horror connected to it and the crew member's fight for survival. And that's absolutely good enough. I enjoyed the watch, especially in the second half of the film. In my opinion, it fits in nicely with the recent wave of space-themed films. It's not as good as ""Gravity"", but that's really only because of how good that one was, not because this one here was weak or anything. Haven't seen The Martian yet to compare these two. By the way, the ending reminded me a bit of Gravity with the idea of one character drifting into space to save another and the capsule in water scene. I assume that the ending and how it strongly differs from Alien also helps this movie in getting the parallel out of many people's minds. It was a really good plot twist at the end, so a bit of a shame they did not attempt to be original on other occasions really. I give ""Life"" a thumbs-up overall, definitely worth checking out if you like the genre and/or the cast. Go see it, a definite contender for best sci-fi movie of 2017."

","The amount of joy you get from this movie depends on your expectation. If you are expecting a science-fiction movie which includes detailed information about aliens and how we can deal with them, you'll probably not like the movie much. But the tension, the intensity is so suitable for those who look for these factors. A good ending too.<br/><br/>The main idea of the film is quite engrossing to be honest. <br/><br/>The curiosity about aliens has come along for hundreds of years and the information we have about them is pretty limited. So with that, we can't really expect anyone (mainly NASA) to share every research with the world. They might have contacted with aliens, or found critical information about them, but it might not be too good.<br/><br/>Think about it, NASA announces the first sample of an alien has been found. What would people think? Many would like it and welcome the news excitedly. But many would worry too. As long as we don't know that aliens can surely be trusted, humanity is not ready for them. I think this is the main reason behind NASA insisting to inform regularly.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty accurate to understand what I'm saying."

But it is not sooo bad as seen in countless other horror/monster movies.<br/><br/>The Achilles-heel of many horror movies is the poor communication between the protagonists... something that for a positive surprise - does not apply here.<br/><br/>However - the entire movie is ""decision-driven"" as it is primarily a story about action vs. reaction. And so - the quality of the decisions make or break the movie. As said before - the decisions are not entirely bad - but they are also not good - and when a casual movie viewer get the feeling that those supposed-to-be much smarter people make one poor choice after another - the immersion breaks.<br/><br/>So whats left is a good movie that could have been much better had the story allowed it to be."
"AaronDSimpson","6","2","4","3 July 2017"," Martian Pareidolia
","For many, Lucian's True History (2 C.E.) serves as the first notable narrative to mention extra-planetary travel, inter-planetary warfare, and alien life-forms. Some 2000 years on from this 'birth' of Science-Fiction, the concept of alien life is considered a real, though hypothetical, possibility. Understanding this potential, it seems that Science-Fiction directors have redoubled their efforts in rendering a 'realistic' and plausible aesthetic of alien life and have deployed cinema as a simulation for extra-terrestrial contact, most of which exploring violent outcomes.<br/><br/>However, despite the seemingly limitless capacity for imagination of extra-terrestrial life, in attempting to imagine the appearance and behavioural patterns of alien life, humanity demonstrates its own limiting egocentricity. For example, providing this with some explanation requires us to recall some of the most beloved instances of aliens in film history; E.T., the 'classic' alien from Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), or even the spoof representation of aliens in Mars Attacks! (1996). Each of these aliens share a common anthropomorphism; all humanoid, possessing shared features with humans; bipedalism, facial structure, and posable appendages. What each of these aliens demonstrates is that, whilst the potential for creative imagination is limitless, it might well be beyond human capacity to 'create' sentient life without the template of humanity; how, after all, does one imagine something outside of the known parameters of Earth? Or engage the effect of different atmospheric composition on forming organisms? Even in the instances where directors and creative producers have designed aliens that appear not to resemble humans outwardly, such as the aliens in the recent Arrival (2016) or Life (2017), they possess something recognisably human. Villeneuve's Abbott and Costello are communicative, aware of their human nomenclature, and develop attachments to the scientists that encounter them, sharing language and their relationships. The Martian 'Calvin' in Life (2017), despite its aesthetic inhumanity, possess a quasi-humanoid face structure, undermining the efforts in creating a realistic alien.<br/><br/>From the moment that the alien is discovered, it is clear that Espinosa is attempting to do something differently. Scientist Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) detects a micro-organism within a sample of Martian earth and experiments with varying temperatures and chemical compositions to recreate the conditions of the organism to re-animate it. This move is one that, initially, seems to understand the problems of Science-Fiction films prior; that life in other spheres would live differently, behave differently, and most likely not resemble humanity. However, it is when Hugh realises that the 'Martian' prefers an atmosphere closer to Protozoic Earth than contemporary Mars and we find ourselves engaging with a prehistoric alien, suspending our disbelief two-fold, that humanity's hubris surfaces. The Martian, or 'Calvin', develops rapidly from a single-cell organism into something of a hive-mind of all-eyes, all-muscle, all-brain, dispatching the crew of the station until only two remain (Gyllenhaal and Ferguson). Naturally, with each crew member that Calvin kills, it grows stronger through feeding on them until it grows into a formidable mass of ectoparasitoid that threatens the course of humanity by engineering an escape to Earth in a life-pod.<br/><br/>It is difficult to say what might be considered realistic and what is not when you're dealing with the current theoretical concept of extra-terrestrial life. However, all the scientific progress that Espinosa made with constructing Calvin as a scientific probability is reduced, firstly by its apparent invincibility - withstanding flamethrowers, the vacuum of space, and a decompressing docking tunnel - and secondly, by bestowing Calvin with a humanoid facial structure.<br/><br/>There is something indisputably alien about Calvin's face, yet, the exoskeletal structure representing a recognisable face, complete with brow and nasal bones, reveals the 'true face' of our fear about alien encounters - ourselves. Despite the varying degrees of fantasy involved with the Science-Fiction genre, whether we're faced with the 'dinosaur alien' in Life (2017), the quasi-crustacean face-hugger from Alien (1979) or the incongruously similar Paul, from the eponymous film (2011), there is something undeniably familiar in each of these ideas of 'little green men'. Even though Calvin appears to be a new breed of alien, when analysing Calvin's behaviour and attempting to ascertain what it is that can be considered 'alien', thoughts begin to turn to violence: Hugh's hand is pulverized, Rory is forced to swallow the alien and is destroyed from the inside out. Calvin appears also to be desperate for survival, grappling up David's legs during the docking breach, and feeding on the body of a dying man and embracing light sticks for warmth. However, there are none amongst these 'alien' characteristics which are not shared, however exaggerated, with the human race. When Calvin's 'human' facial structure opens up to reveal a biological monstrosity beneath, the ferocity of alien survival is united with the aesthetic of humanity to frame the human condition. The fear is that our scientific development will project us across the stars to galaxies where we will only discover an Other, brutal reflection of our own savagery in an episode of Martian pareidolia - seeing faces where they should not be.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at 'The Cineaste Review' - www.thecineastereview.wordpress.com"

","First of, this film is a solid 7/10 in my mind. Way better than Mummy/Wonder Woman. It is not a masterpiece but it is entertaining enough and well made, despite its some questionable (science related) logic. <br/><br/>Now lets talk a bit more of such questionable science, which I have found to be the major complaint point for many on IMDb (i.e. those who gave this film very low ratings and felt compelled to vent their anger in long negative reviews). My personal advise is: ignore these and do try this film. <br/><br/>I have to stress that I am one of those who, regardless of the overall IMDb rating, would more than likely to overlook a film as soon as I see a couple of very low rating reviews. I do believe that IMDb ratings are often hyped, especially for the big blockbusters (such as Wonder Woman which I found to be incredibly boring and childish). Before I took time to watch Life, there was hesitation due to the many low rates here; yet for some reason I gave it a try, and thus came to my personal verdict that this is a half decent and entertaining film. <br/><br/>This particular experience with Life and its reviews on IMDb thereby highlighted one thing for me: people these days can be so cynical and shallow in so many ways. In this instance, and to those who thought it was necessary to go on and on about the plot holes and ill logic of Life, my advice is to relax and stop being so serious for all the wrong reasons. I am fairly confident that the majority would feel the same (regarding the film itself and those low reviews) as soon as they finish watching with a light heart."

The problems start to occur if you view it as sci-fi and take on a more realistic approach as to what would be the protocol if an event like it really did happen. The sheer fact that they wanted to even initially create an environment that would allow it to grow does seem both implausible and reckless. Also why is it that Hollywood always has the approach that any living orgasm from space is always indestructible. That scenario has been so overdone.

They call it a scientific breakthrough and the final proof that there's indeed life on Mars. However, the euphoria is quickly reversed when this lovable organism, which name is ""Calvin"" by the way, threatens to kill the entire crew. And in hindsight, it's a danger to the entire universe. Including peaceful Earth. Before they know it, this single-celled alien friend turns into an overgrown shammy. The result is crew members being crushed and consumed.

And unlike ""Arrival"", the creature's intentions aren't friendly. The fact that many comparisons are made with the ""Alien"" saga is inevitable.

But even with this in mind, I can only say that the pacing of this movie was scorchingly fast. Before I knew it the movie was finished.

The space station has been worked out down to the last detail. And despite the fact that it's a huge ship, you still get the impression as if the compartments are rather limited in space and therefor creates a claustrophobic effect. But in particular the moving of crew members in zero-gravity looks fascinating. The tilting and rotating station ensures that you can no longer distinguish the bottom from the top at certain times. I'm sure the CGI department has had a lot of work to make it as realistic as possible. Even the bloody scenes suddenly become fascinating scenes, demonstrating how drops of blood behave in a weightless state.<br/><br/>Also the cast wasn't bad. Every single one excelled and contributed to this exciting space horror. The most famous names are of course Ryan ""Deadpool"" Reynolds, as space cowboy Rory Adams, picking satellites out of space and always the first one to break a rule. And Jake Gyllenhaal (still my favorite actor at the moment) as David Jordan, an ex-marine who's about to break the record of ""longest stay in space"" because he hates the attitude of people on earth. Hiroyuki Sanada, who played a major part in ""The Railway Man"", gets the most human role in ""Life"". He can see the birth of his first child because it's being broadcast live on the ISS. Rebecca ""Mission Impossible"" Ferguson, Olga Dihovichnaya and Ariyon Bakare complete the crew and join the others while trying to escape the fluttering alien.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious similarities with ""Alien"", Daniel ""Child 44"" Espinosa succeeded in making a creepy, dark and intense movie. It won't go down as a classic, but the film is successful on several levels. Still I hope when future Mars expeditions discover the slightest form of any kind of alien life, they are wise enough to leave it be and certainly don't bring it back home as a sort of trophy. For movie lovers who haven't seen ""Alien"" yet (that's impossible in my opinion, but still), this exciting SF will definitely be worthwhile to watch.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"
"krasilnikof","7","2","4","19 June 2017"," Definitely not as bad as the one - and two -star reviews make it out to be.
","The crew on the ISS examines an organism brought back from Mars. 'Crap enters life-support' and the eerie happenings occur in fast pace with little room for anything but characters acting on guts, rather than a medium-long term plan. However, most of what they do, makes sense in the moment - if they aren't quickly patching up some part of the stations machinery (If you don't do that on a vessel in the vacuum of space, you don't do anything anymore) they are awestruck watching the extremely powerful and versatile little being do its thing. A few, but not so many as to be mind-boggling, unfounded and unthinkable mistakes were made by characters - compared to others in the genre; the ratio of unthinkable mistakes in this movie pulls the average in the right direction. Also, discover them on your own - Many of the reviews here spoil several scenes, ick.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was way more, forgive the pun, air-tight than some of its' recent genre-siblings. The characters from Prometheus and Alien: Covenant still win the ""I should have been a space trucker""-awards, while these guys, (however boring.. maybe even because they were boring) seemed more like scientists than any in my recent sci-fi memory. <br/><br/>Fyi: I only have sci-fi memory."

","Now, I'm a huge fan of horror movies and have seen my fair share of sci-fi horror. ""Life"" is definitely not in the top, not even close, but that said it's not one of the worst, either. Many of the latest reviews are making ""Life"" seem like something you'd be better off without, but they clearly were expecting something more like ""Alien"" (even though they're screaming they did not) and got pi**ed off when the two couldn't compare.<br/><br/>Originality is far from ""Life"", as are the characters and the plot. When you've seen as many horror films as I have, you learn to expect certain things to happen and you can usually pick out the least possible survivors. About half way of the film I predicted two possible endings for this film with the twists, and got it right.<br/><br/>Acting is very mediocre, but the directing is something I found well done. The characters are very, very simple and roughly written, so don't expect to get too much out of them. A lot of the film was saved by the gorgeous CGI.<br/><br/>My recommendation for this film is to watch it like you'd watch a late 80's or early 90's horror movie with updated CGI and special effects. Shut down about 40% of your brains, have some popcorn ready, forget about ""Alien"" and you're good to go."
"angelkitteh-32778","6","2","4","14 June 2017"," Not so bad as some had pointed out.
","First off, I would like to say that if you are someone who writes a review based on your emotional experience throughout a film or uses another movie as an anchor point for comparison and ratings, then I do not find such ratings reliable. <br/><br/>I won't be comparing this to other sci-fi movies as they are each on their own. But lets get started.<br/><br/>This movie kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, partly because I was expecting such experiences for a horror/thriller genre. I certainly found this movie enjoyable overall, with the right amount of tension, suspense and a few memorable scenes. There were some jump scares but none so sudden to the extent that they would fling you off your seat. The setting was believable, along with the 'tools available' in such settings (no guns or lasers). <br/><br/>However, if there is one thing coming from other reviewers that I do agree with it would be the unprofessional-ism of the astronauts and the slightly unrealistic life form itself. Though it could be argued that being a more advanced life form comes with increased resilience to deprivation of life supports. <br/><br/>It would also be perfectly natural for trained professionals to act in an emotional and irrational way (perhaps not as easy as portrayed in the movie) when in a never before seen predicament. <br/><br/>All in all a 6/10, it is decent and worth a watch if you go in with an open mind instead of looking for realism or comparing it to Alien. Would have been a bit better if the characters and the life form were a bit more believable."

","I have read the many reviews this complains about the problems of logic and science. I really think the film should not be classified in sci-fi then horror but horror. In the comments I thought I heard the sketch of Bigard on the horror movies: ""they are not logical to make 2 groups of 2, at the supermarket yes but not when a psychopath is in the house."" In short the story is average but it's scary, jump, turn in disgust ...<br/><br/>I got screwed up because I thought I saw a good sf movie (as I like) and I come across a horror movie. I do not like all that kind of movie, but I always watch until the end a movie that I started, especially if I allow myself to put a note.

Also 'experts in their fields' characters repeatedly act incompetently allowing the story line to continue into chaos. The characters talked to much and several times explained how something might happen immediately followed by that exact thing happening.<br/><br/>This is worth seeing as a rental if you like almost B movie SciFi thrillers."

","Life (2017) from director Daniel Espinosa is not original movie at all, but has it's own unique moments.<br/><br/>Movie follows group of 6 astronauts, group itself works very well, you can see and believe they are real group of astronauts and friends, not just actors playing them, where the movie lacks is when u divide group and look at characters one by one, you don't have much, some characters are developed more than others, but that's normal, problem is some of them make very stupid choices for smart people, but that's due to writing, not acting.<br/><br/>Character I liked the most was Hugh (Ariyon Bakare), his motivation was best in movie, his character was very well developed and used, also there is one very horrific part of the movie, that could be done only with him, and it was done very well. Other characters were pretty much forgettable, some more than others.<br/><br/>Also I see this movie as having 2 parts, first part is where movie shines and where it has most of it's originality, there are some beautiful shots of space station, earth from space, inside of station etc. Cinematography big + from me.<br/><br/>Second part is where it falls apart for me, when alien creature starts growing, movie loses it's mysterious tone and becomes horror, that for me is done just for the sake of horror. And biggest problem of all is that movie loses all of it's little originality, although not original, it could have done something original, by that I mean how story progresses and finishes, because ending also was unoriginal and predictable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can't see this movie as being very well remembered, for me personally not bad movie, but nothing new and memorable. If it was whole on the level of the first part of movie, I think I would give it a bigger grade, like this it's 6/10 for me."

","Life has more achievements than mistakes, but it fails the most at the repetition of a well-known plot.
If you haven't seen a lot of sci-fi horror movies, it will surprise you and keep you with it, from beginning to end.
If you have seen enough (Alien is enough), it will be just entertained.<br/><br/>I think a repeated story can't be judged as a bad one, but Life falls into the same mistakes than other movies in that genre: A little predictable, quite repetitive.<br/><br/>Anyway, putting that aside, it has its achievements:
A direction that is interesting since the movie starts; a pretty good cinematography; an excelent use of sound that keeps you in the terrifying atmosphere, even closing your eyes; good actings, better than the characters themselves; great visual effects and a good use of montage, particularly in the conclusion.<br/><br/>Now, it certainly has its biggest mistake in the repeated story, but also in its flat characters, that you can't believe sometimes 'cause they don't really act like scientists, and on how predictable the argument can become.
It presents a strong plot point, so the rest of the movie you can expect more than you receive: Some jumpscares and the constant repetition of the same event.<br/><br/>While it is a story we've heard before, they know how to tell it you in an interesting way, so if you haven't listen it before, this is going to be a really good first time."

The rest you can probably guess for yourself, as it follows the standard formula of monster alien movies. The one bit of praise I can offer is that at least they didn't include any meathead macho soldier characters.

2. The CGI blood looks utterly horrendous.
3. There are a couple of plot-holes. For example, how did Calvin attach itself to Hugh Derry's (Ariyon Bakare) leg without him or anybody else noticing?
4. The characters are poorly fleshed out which makes it difficult to care about them.
5. The twist at the end of the movie is ruined by the film showing too much of the commotion between Calvin and David Jordan."

I found it definitely better than the above mentioned movies in horror and quality aspect (not characters though).<br/><br/>Problem this movie has is, you just can't care about any character except for the the Japanese astronaut who was the only person they gave some sort of character depth. Others are just, doctors and scientists. So to feel anything for any deaths or to root for any one except Sho is not gonna happen. Only thing you might feel is, no one should die like that and yes there's just tad bit of gore and good amount of brutal kills.<br/><br/>The film peaks when someone's dying on screen so yeah you end up cheering for the Alien probably. Acting is just about alright. The actors and actresses do the best at what they've been given.

Unfortunately the cell, now awakened, grows unbelievable quickly and turns decidely unfriendly. Growing more and more intelligent, it sets on a killing spree aboard the ISS.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that horror movie is not normally my kind of genre, and this movie is more of a horror than sci-fi. The sci-fi is just about the setting (ISS) and premise of the movie. The rest, like how the story evolves, is more or less pure horror. One thing I dislike with horror movies is that the characters are prone to do irrational (read stupid) things and that the plot have holes in it. Life got them too (and having read a few other reviews all the plot holes ruined the movie for them - so be warned if you are about to watch it) and they are plenty. For starters, how they recover the satellite containing the sample, using the ISS as a baseball catching glove, is ridiculous. On the other hand, there and then you get a feel how the movie and story is set up, so if you don't like it, turn it off. It will continue with the plot holes and bad (yeah, stupid) decisions from the crew.<br/><br/>However, if you view it as it actually is, a horror movie (and able to oversee most of the technical plot holes) the movie made me feel. It made me cringe, made me think ""oh, no"" and almost want to hide behind a pillow sometimes. And that is what horror movies is all about, isn't it? Emotions. So the story, albeit full of mistakes, is not that bad. If you like horror movies, this might br something.<br/><br/>The casting is impressive, with Ferguson, Gyllenhaal, Reynolds, Sanada, Dykhovichnaya and Bakare making up the crew. Since the story isn't character driven, the characters don't evovle much, and we don't get to know them very much. The acting are decent, but not stellar (not much material to act about). The effects are good enough.<br/><br/>So if you like horror movies, give it a try. If you are looking for a science fiction adventure, pick something else."

","The cast was great with what they were given. The first and second acts had me intrigued, but sometime after that first hour, things really began to derail for Life. The direction is certainly a problem for this film, which had all the essential components of a great flick, but ends up being a rental at best when you've exhausted all of your other options.<br/><br/>The movie tried to be Alien, but ends up being closer to Prometheus by falling into the same traps. It fails to capture what made the original Alien franchise so interesting. The dialogue is lacking in many ways. The characters, while well acted, lack anything that makes them interesting. It even falls prey to old tropes about scientists in film.<br/><br/>I think the greatest tragedy of this film is Calvin itself. This life form seemingly has no weaknesses at all. Even in Alien, there was this overlying sense of hope that the Xenomorph could be beaten. In Life, we are presented with the unbeatable. The unstoppable force, and while this can sometimes translate well in literature and comic books, it does not make for an entertaining watch.<br/><br/>Final score 6/10. It's watchable. it has a few moments. But you are likely to forget it exists within hours of watching it."

"jimrin","5","0","0","10 December 2017"," Not for you if...
","This movie is not for you if you're the type to yell at the TV (or movie screen) if you think someone on the TV is doing something stupid... Based on the written reviews, it seems there's lots of people out there like that. There are a lot of similarities in plot to Alien so it's natural comparisons will be drawn. I'll focus on the differences.<br/><br/>First, there's no comparison to the performance of Sigourney Weaver. However, as for the rest of the crew, many people complained about the character development in Life. While it's been a while since I've seen Alien, I can't say that I really recall a lot of character development in the rest of the crew in Alien. In fact, I thought there was decent character development in Life to build some connection with each of the characters. <br/><br/>Secondly, the story in Life is set in present day, not in some future where there's a crew making interplanetary space travel.Thus, it makes the story a bit more real. And since the story was set on the International Space Station, the filming of the crew moving around in zero gravity in the space station were excellent. <br/><br/>And finally, the alien itself. In Life, there is no artist like H.R. Giger to create what the alien looks like, so again, no comparison. Many were criticizing how the alien create looked like as if we have any way of knowing what an alien life form like that would really look like. Wouldn't all those reviewers be pretty embarrassed if we some day find out that the interpretation of what an alien life form would look like in Life is spot on.<br/><br/>So considering the above, the movie Life is mediocre compared to Alien, but that's what the IMDb rating shows anyway. Having said that, the ending was quite disappointing. First, cinematography-wise, the capsule landing in the ocean looked like it was filmed using cinematography techniques from the 1950s or 1960s. Then, the ending itself was quite a disappointment and rather predictable. An ending like that is quite a cop out. If they did a hundred variations to the ending, the actual ending is probably in the bottom 5. It's as if they had two days left to write the ending to the movie and film it."

","Underneath the common alien monster movie is the message of optimism may not necessarily be a good thing when reality comes crashing down. Also, that no matter how many safeguards are put in place, events sometimes conspire to render them ineffective.<br/><br/>I liked how at various times in the film, the protagonists succumbed to desire, selfishness, bravery and having it result in more misery and disaster. <br/><br/>We are treated to great acting, soundtrack and special effects while offering up a stern lesson about how good intentions often go awry.<br/><br/>Recommended."
"skyhawk77","8","4","12","5 April 2017"," If you hated The Martian you will enjoy Life
","Life is a an enjoyable movie given what we have been fed for example The Martian (2014). A crew of six is on the International Space station after exploring Mars 8 months earlier. Three of them fly the space ship the rest are specialists in their field of study like Hugh Derry a British Biologist who is experimenting with a butterfly like creature they found on Mars. At first the creature is sweet and lovey dovey before unleashing unimaginable terror. I say unimaginable because this creature is something you have never seen before. It is very different from outer space creatures we have been accustomed to maybe that is also why i give the film 7 not 10. Its only the creature that is original otherwise the story is not so original and no one is to blame. Even with that the film is enjoyable with an original ending you never see coming and a huge surprise before that."
"The-Sarkologist","9","4","12","25 March 2017"," Thrilling
","This film was quite unexpected. Okay, from the previews I had an fairly good idea what it was about, however the execution was nothing short of brilliant. In parts the film was a little slow, but then it is thriller so that is to be expected, and having parts of the film drag out does really add to the suspense. I wouldn't call it a continual, edge of your seat, suspense film, and I did eventually work out how it was going to end, but a part of that had to do with the way that they had executed the ending, but that is all that I will say about that.<br/><br/>So, Life is, as you probably guessed, about the discovery of life beyond the confines of the Earth. The film is predominantly set on the International Space Station and they have just collected a probe that has returned from Mars containing some soil samples. However, in the soil sample they discover a living organism. At first it seems to be quite harmless, but after an accident in the containment field, they believe that it has died so they start prodding it with electric shocks. Bad move, because it seems as if they have somewhat upset it and the creature goes from being curious to being rather mad.<br/><br/>This is one of the things that is left hanging throughout the film – is the creature naturally aggressive, or was it because we started poking and prodding it that it was under the impression that it was being attacked and as such decided to defend itself. If that is the case then it seems as if their first encounter with extra-terrestrial life has resulted in creating an enemy, and a pretty powerful one at that because it seems to be quite resistant to a lot of things such as fire and extreme cold. Also, a lack of oxygen results in it going into hibernation until it can breathe again.<br/><br/>Which raises another interesting question – life on Mars. It has been suggested in the past that the 'aliens on Mars' movies don't quite work anymore because we are quite convinced that there isn't any life on Mars, which is why John Carter of Mars was considered to be a rather bad movie. There was a time when all of the bad and nasty aliens came from Mars, but ever since we managed to find out a lot more about the planet this concept fell upon the wayside, that is until this film.<br/><br/>It has been suggested that this film is a tribute to the Aliens franchise, and I probably agree with that. However, the film also seems to pay tribute to the good old invaders from Mars films as well since this creature does come from the Red Planet. However, there is an underlying idea as to why Mars is now a lifeless hulk – this creature basically killed everything on it leaving it to become a desert wasteland. Since there is no longer anything to eat these creatures are now in hibernation waiting for an opportunity to come back to life.<br/><br/>This raises another interesting theory - the creature begins the film as a rather small creature, and only later, after it has fed, does it grow to its current size. It sort of flags the idea of what happened when we made contact with the natives of North America and other lands – it wasn't fun for the populations since huge numbers of them were wiped out by disease. This is the case with Mars because we really don't know what is on that planet, or any of the others in the solar system – with our desire to go out and explore, and conquer, a part of us doesn't seem to make the connection with the possibility that life may not only be hostile, but almost invisible. This is more so with the fact that symptoms of a disease don't come about until after the disease has reached its contagion stage.<br/><br/>Many films have us meet aliens and make friends with them, though we should also be aware that a lot of these films also have the aliens as being hostile, though we eventually defeat them. This may not, and probably won't, be the case if we were to encounter life beyond our planet, especially if they arrive here before we arrive there. In fact if the aliens were to arrive it would probably be more like Independence Day as opposed to ET or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or even a microscopic organism which will decimate the population before we have a chance to stop it."
"themadmovieman","7","4","12","24 March 2017"," A little too much like Alien, but surprisingly exciting and tense nonetheless
","This was a surprisingly exciting film. For a movie that looks to effectively borrow the premise of Gravity and Alien, Life is actually a very well-directed, well-acted and entertaining sci-fi horror. With a threatening villain that works well throughout, and a rapid pace, it's the sort of film that'll definitely make you tense, even if it's not quite the edge-of-your-seat thriller it could be.<br/><br/>But let's start off with the obvious. We've pretty much had this exact story before. A group of human space explorers come across life, and it turns out that life is hostile and threatens all of human civilisation. That's the premise of the sci-fi horror classic: Alien.<br/><br/>So, with the same plot, I expected Life to be an underwhelming remake of Alien. On the one hand, it doesn't quite have the unique haunted house feel of Ridley Scott's classic, but on the other, it takes the formula and makes it work very well from start to finish.<br/><br/>The plot does lose points for originality, but when it comes to making a sci-fi horror, Life is a surprising success. With an effortlessly simple story that involves a few astronauts under constant threat from a seemingly invincible alien, with the even bigger worry that it will reach and destroy Earth, there's a lot of fun to be had from this film as a tense and exciting thriller.<br/><br/>I can't say that any of the characters are so well-developed, however. You've got the same sort of backstories as the leads of Gravity, which aren't really that compelling. So, what is it there to make you care about the main characters of Life staying alive?<br/><br/>Simply put, it's the performances. Again, they're nothing on the level of Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, but the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Jake Gyllenhaal and others are so likable that you do want to see them stay alive. Their characters aren't the most intelligent, but the performances that the whole cast put in here are excellent, and that's why you can care about the fate of the few astronauts under threat, something that makes the whole film a lot more entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>When it comes to the film's villain, it's pretty much the same as Alien. A well-designed creature that's very threatening to see on screen throughout (although its evolution throughout the film is a little much), it's the reason that there's any real sense of horror in this movie. As director Daniel Espinosa doesn't hold back when it comes to gore and gruesome violence, the alien here has the same effect as the villain from Alien, a relentlessly evil creature that will stop at nothing to brutally destroy all those who it comes across.<br/><br/>Of everything, however, Espinosa's direction is the best part of Life. Apart from the fact that the visual effects make this look absolutely stunning throughout, Espinosa gives the film a very fast pace that keeps it exciting, as you're almost always watching the characters desperately trying to escape from the alien menace.<br/><br/>I do think that this film could have had a more claustrophobic atmosphere, bringing it a little closer to what made Alien work so well, but on the whole, it's fair to say that Espinosa does a great job at getting as much tension and excitement out of this story as possible by making a fast-moving and visually thrilling spectacle.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed Life. It's not a perfect film, and not on the terrifying, nail-biting level that it perhaps wants to be, but as a blockbuster horror movie, it's exciting and tense throughout, whilst its stunning visuals and very strong performances help to make it even more entertaining."

","Cinematography and special effects were beautiful, this movie was obviously trying to compete with ""Gravity"" in that department. But the writing and, ultimately, the directing was just incredibly terrible. <br/><br/>Time and time and time again I kept finding myself thinking that the characters' dialog and actions were completely stupid and unbelievable. It was one of those movies where the humans were so lame and idiotic, I found myself totally rooting for the success of the alien throughout the entire 2nd half of the movie.<br/><br/>One small example of the stupidity, trust me this is not a spoiler: No one even stops to think for a second that a human body THAT HAS HAD AN ALIEN INSIDE IT may still pose a biological threat. That is just terrible writing, and bad directing if the director lets that crap fly.<br/><br/>Several times the dialog and acting was so bad that I hooted out loud with laughter. It's a shame because I believe these actors are all extremely talented, and deserved a much better script.<br/><br/>The acting and dialog were exceeding overwrought, the makers of this movie obviously thought they were being very deep and emotional but really I felt embarrassed for them, it seemed like the script was written by a 13-year-old girl with pubescent angst. Compare to ""Europa Report"" -- now there was a great script and acting that really showed how humans might actually act out in space."
"maryolalov","6","3","8","19 June 2017"," Did I just watch an Alien reboot?
","Life(2017) doesn't show anything new and lacks originality. Watching this movie felt like I was watching an Alien reboot. <br/><br/>They bring the alien organism to the station, where it grows and kills everyone - I've already seen that in Alien. They try to kill the alien with a flamethrower - I remember that part from Alien too. So you'll ask is there anything different from the Alien movie and my answer is no. Even the alien looks like a xenomorph, I was very surprised that it didn't have acid instead of blood. The unusual ending is probably the only part, which is not copied from another movie but everything else is (as I already said) copied from Alien.<br/><br/>Another problem are the ""tense"" parts, where everyone just stay silent and look at each other, like in a movie made by Tarkovsky. There are like 2 or 3 ""tense"" parts in the movie but somehow these parts make the audience feel annoyed rather than tense.<br/><br/>Of course there are some good things in the movie but they're mostly CGI. The ending was one of the good things too, it was different and unusual and surprisingly not copied from Alien."

I'm not sure why suspense movies give so much away in order to lure moviegoers into buying a ticket. Spoiler: how many of our little Indians will survive? As usual, not many.<br/><br/>If you've seen any Alien movie at all, there's nothing new to you here. Elements of Gravity have been added, as we're on an orbiting space station in trouble. The plot is predictable. The character development is slap-dash to keep the movie short, and interaction between the characters is bland, astronaut cliché dialog. ""Being up here in outer space is so cool! Blah, blah, blah. I hope we kill the monster so we can go home. Blah, blah, blah. It sure is cold in here with the power off. Blah, blah, blah."" There is no uniquely memorable line to cite. No one dared to be creative or found any inspiration. <br/><br/>If you want to see a more original movie about dangerous life from Mars, a movie that worked hard to make you get to know and care about its characters, check out Red Planet. It didn't get great reviews, but I was riveted when I saw it for the first time, and I've gone back to re-watch it several times for its unique and original scenarios and special effects.<br/><br/>If you love outer space movies for the vicarious joy of feeling like an astronaut for 90 minutes or so, this is OK. If you need more entertainment than that to satisfy you, you'll probably be wasting your time on this one."

","Who doesn't love a good horror story in space? Brave and attractive people stuck in tight quarters with a hostile alien, without gravity, surrounded by the deadly vacuum where no one can hear you scream? Sign me up.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds easily steals the first few scenes as the cocky and humorous space cowboy, Rory. Jake Gyllenhaal joins him as David Jordan. Ariyon Bakare plays what is easily the most interesting character on the ship, Doctor Hugh Derry, the scientist in charge of studying the newly discovered life form.<br/><br/>Olga Dihovichnaya plays Kat, the leader of the mission on board the International Space Station orbiting Earth. Rebecca Ferguson as Miranda, Hiroyuki Sanada playing Sho, round out the crew. <br/><br/>The first act of the movie contains some epic cinematography, including one scene of Earth from space that almost brought tears to my eyes. Many of the shots are from strange angles, giving the viewer the impression that they are floating weightless with the crew. It can be disorienting so you may want to have some Dramamine on hand.<br/><br/>I won't spoil any key elements of the story but honestly? Anyone who has seen Alien will not be surprised by how it develops. Its plot may be unoriginal, but ""Life"" does manage to deliver a few great moments of genuine horror. The first time the alien shows the depth of its intelligence is startling, to say the least. <br/><br/>Creature design was superb although I wish they had taken it a few steps further. As the story unfolds, the plant-like alien grows and adapts to its environment, molding limbs and something like a face. Unfortunately, its evolution stagnates in the last third of the movie. What starts as a fresh take on body forms is reduced to ""space squid"" by the end.<br/><br/>One of my biggest problems with this film is characterization. With the notable exception of Doctor Hugh (the scientist working with the alien), it's unclear what each crew member's role actually is on the space station beside floating around waiting to be killed. Rebecca Ferguson's character Miranda talks continuously about how firewalls are her responsibility as quarantine officer, but she is the one providing physical therapy to one of the crew. Meanwhile, Gyllenhaal is supposedly the ship's doctor but later claims to be the pilot (who hasn't done anything remotely piloty up to that point, or doctor like for that matter). <br/><br/>I was equally confused by Gyllenhaal's portrayal of the character. At times he seems simple, at other times strangely intense, sort of like someone's creepy bipolar uncle. <br/><br/>The confusion doesn't end there. As the diminishing crew makes repeated attempts to rid themselves of their alien passenger various parts of the ship begin to fail (of course) and they run out of fuel (naturally) so they have to result to extreme (but not particularly creative) measures. In one scene I think what is happening is that an escape pod is coming loose. A crew member and the alien are struggling against the pull of the vacuum. Space wins and both are sucked out. It looks like the escape pod floats away.<br/><br/>At this point, I was thinking, 'Yay! The alien is gone! I wonder what marvelous twist they have in store for the rest of the movie? Maybe they can save the plot after all!' Nope.<br/><br/>The creature must have somehow managed to survive, hang on, and find another point of entry. The rest of the crew did not seem either upset or elated so I wasn't sure what exactly I was supposed to be feeling at this point. The pace vacillates between long drawn-out moments of reflection and warp speed, anxiety ridden races to defeat the big bad.<br/><br/>This leads me to the extremely predictable ending. I won't bore you with the boring details but trust me, you won't be surprised. <br/><br/>By the end of ""Life"" I was ready to go home. And maybe watch Alien on Netflix."
"dave-mcclain","9","5","17","25 March 2017"," ""Life"" is an engrossing and exciting science fiction horror thriller.
","Life on other planets. It's a possibility that has fascinated humankind since we first understood what other planets were. Movies have reflected many different thoughts on the subject. In the great 1997 sci-fi drama ""Contact"", three different characters opine that if humans are the only intelligent life in the universe, that it seems like ""an awful waste of space."" In that film, Jodie Foster's character is involved with the scientific movement known as SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Life). One real-life SETI supporter, the late astronomer Carl Sagan, said that the existence of intelligent life beyond earth was a virtual certainty, considering the number of planets and stars in the universe. On the other hand, the Rare Earth Hypothesis holds that the complex set of conditions that led to the evolution of humans on earth is unlikely to be found elsewhere in the universe. Then, of course, there's the issue of whether humans would ever be able to travel the distances necessary to reach such planets (as we see addressed in 2016's ""Passengers""). Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has been a supporter of SETI, but he has also warned us that finding life elsewhere in the universe could endanger mankind's existence on earth. That ""be careful what you wish for"" attitude has given birth to countless expressions in the popular culture, from H.G. Wells' 1898 novel ""War of the Worlds"" and Orson Wells' infamous 1938 radio adaptation of the same, to movies such as 1956's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", 1979's ""Alien"", 1996's ""Independence Day"" and, the subject of this review, 2017's sci-fi thriller ""Life"" (R, 1:43).<br/><br/>It's about 2027 and the International Space Station is teeming with life – six astronauts and one single-celled Martian. A dramatic rescue of an errant space capsule containing soil samples from Mars is executed by engineer Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds, who had been set to star, but ended up taking a supporting role due to a scheduling conflict) and biologist Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) is very keen to see if a dormant organism from that sample can be animated. The major responsibility of Crew Captain Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) is diminishing any potential danger from this unknown organism. Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is mainly concerned with the health of the crew, which also includes Japanese astronaut Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), whose attention is divided between the mission and his wife, who is about to give birth, and Russian astronaut Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya).<br/><br/>Hugh adjusts the temperature and atmospheric gasses in the cell's secure transparent box in order to mimic primordial earth and then, to everyone's excitement, the organism begins to move. These astronauts have just found, in Hugh's words ""the first incontrovertible proof of life beyond earth""! After a contest among elementary school students back on earth, this organism is named Calvin. The crew soon learns that Calvin's single cell functions as brain, muscle and eye. As Calvin grows, it replicates into many such cells. Soon it's big enough, smart enough and strong enough to reach up and gently touch Hugh's gloved finger, but as it continues to grow, so do its capabilities and its adaptability. Calvin's primary instinct is the same as that of every other organism in the universe – to survive. When it begins to perceive the presence of the people around it as a threat, what follows is a multi-species fight for survival – and a desperate struggle by the station's crew to keep Calvin from ever making it to earth.<br/><br/>""Life"" is an engrossing and exciting science fiction horror thriller. The film can be seen as a 21st century version of ""Alien"" (and Columbia Pictures moved up its release date to avoid competing with ""Alien: Covenant""), but this movie charts its own sci-fi course. The claustrophobic environment (with almost all of the action taking place in space and with essentially only six cast members) adds to the tension and makes the action feel very intimate and real. The writing team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (""Zombieland"", ""Deadpool"") give us interesting characters (brought to vivid life by six outstanding actors) and just the right balance of anticipation and action. Director Daniel Espinosa (""Safe House"", ""Child 44"") delivers great visuals and a taut and entertaining thriller – with one of the best endings that I've seen in a long time. This movie is definitely worth one and three quarters hours of your life – and it's so good that the time will seem to fly by – and leave you wanting more. ""A"""

"Rawal_Afzal","10","5","18","26 March 2017"," Exceeded my expectations by 20 times!!!!
","I get it, it doesn't belong to the original Alien series, yet forms most of its basal concepts on 'Alien' (1979), a lot of its scenes almost mimic the trapped-in-space troubles shown in that, but all of that goes out of the window once you start watching this film. It has its own feet and legs to stand on, its own horror to scare you and is special in its own ways. From one scene to the next, from one trouble to the next, it engages you so successfully that if you'd any predetermined thoughts of comparing it to the Alien series, you gradually forget all of that. The way it kills the rat and its first victim was a jaw-dropping start to the game, visuals that'll stay in my memory for some time, and from then on it just takes off.<br/><br/>I saw someone over here complain that the difference between the scientists of this film and 'Alien' (1979) was that these were shown to be highly incapable bunch of guys who're making one mistake after another. Whereas I don't dispute that observation, but I don't mind that. Thinking from a realistic point of view, irrespective of how capable you're, anyone would goof up things dealing with a creature like Calvin, a monster with abilities beyond their expectations and calculations. So that can happen, it's human.<br/><br/>And as it is anyway, a point that makes it different from the Alien series, this film shows the alien as having succeeded in the battle, as opposed to the others showing that there's always at least one human who kills it and survives to tell the tail - not something that I think is an any lesser concept than this. So the mistakes by the crew are justified by the note that it ends on.<br/><br/>The end-plan being goofed up totally is exactly what this film stands on, something that makes me give it 10 out 10 for its originality in that regard, and it ends on a tragic note. With the last 20 minutes approaching I'd that look on my face of having seen it all before, but then it surprises you with a brilliant ending. So, extremely sharp work by the film-makers. I was literally like ""wow"" when they showed the wrong capsule having landed in the water. I loved it!<br/><br/>I hope they make a sequel of this, because it's been always a fantasy of mine to see a film that shows the aliens on earth, as opposed to just in the space or on other planets. If they don't, well, I'll be bitterly disappointed. But I can still where this is coming from, because if I were myself a film-maker I'd be a specialty of mine too to end films on a tragic and unfinished note, because such an ending makes the film stay stronger in the viewers' memories.<br/><br/>All in all, an intensifying cinematic experience of my life that I 'll cherish for some time. Eagerly waiting for the next film from the other Alien series this May!"

It was in one of the most renowned sci-fi movies of all time. Y'know, that one movie in which Sigourney Weaver gets to show what she's made of. Of course, not even the best idea can get copyrighted, so there have been countless ripoffs, including Daniel Espinosa's ""Life"". There isn't even anything likable about the characters in this movie.

","No spoilers here, just what I think I've heard a few people say this is just a poor remould of Alien - but so what? If it works and it's good then who cares? Let's just enjoy it. Unfortunately it isn't that good. Although the ideas are sound, the script is not and there were just so many plot holes and clichés it quickly got ridiculous. I will say that there was enough going for it to keep me interested until the end but if you're looking for an intelligent sci-fi then this isn't it.

To each is own that is what i am saying, i enjoyed this movie for what it was, entertainment and that is all, its not going to win any Oscar its not going to be movie of the year either.<br/><br/>The first thing that is surprising is the cast, they manage to put a great cast together for a single sci fi horror Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds, i was fairly sure theses actors would not touch a project like this a mile away after the success they had with bigger production movies.<br/><br/>The alien: from what i read i was sure it could be compared to the blob type, with jelly form, but i was surprised it mutates and at the end looks pretty cool.<br/><br/>The death scenes are also good, and some people you would not expect die first in bad ways.<br/><br/>Far from what i read that the alien raps them up each time.......<br/><br/>There is a lot of hate for this movie, i guess that its all because it was compared to alien or a type of remake and it should really not be.<br/><br/>Like i said not the same context nothing.

"Hellmant","9","3","9","30 March 2017"," Reminiscent of classic space set sci-fi horror flicks, like 'ALIEN' and 'ALIENS'!
","'LIFE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new sci-fi horror movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Ryan Reynolds. It was directed by Daniel Espinoza (who also worked with Reynolds on the 2012 action flick 'SAFE HOUSE'), and it was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (who also co- wrote 'DEADPOOL', also starring Reynolds, and 'ZOMBIELAND'). It tells the story of a six member space crew, working on an International Space Station, that thinks it's discovered evidence of life on Mars, but they actually later learn that they've discovered something much more horrifying. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, but it's also underperformed at the Box Office (and gotten mostly mediocre reviews from audience members). I enjoyed it immensely.<br/><br/>The film begins with a space probe returning from Mars, that contains a soil sample from that planet. The crew of the International Space Station, containing six members, is able to catch the probe as it passes by them. A biologist among the crew, named Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), studies the sample, and he's able to revive a dormant organism inside it. The crew is excited to learn that they've discovered the first evidence of extraterrestrial life, and so is everyone else back home on Earth; where the organism is named Calvin by school children. After further studying Calvin, the space crew soon learns that they've awaken something very hostile and deadly.<br/><br/>The movie is reminiscent of classic space set sci-fi horror flicks, like 'ALIEN' and 'ALIENS', and it's almost as good as those. It's very dark, gruesome, suspenseful and surprisingly well paced (compared to a lot of movies these days). The story is also really interesting, and the performances are all topnotch (you could hardly ask for a better cast). My only problem with the film is that the characters aren't quite developed well enough, and the alien isn't quite frightening or memorable enough either. Those two things aren't huge flaws though, as they're still done well, they're just not done well enough for the movie to be another 'ALIENS' type classic.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/208412653"
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","5","3","9","28 March 2017"," ""I miss my f***ing dog.""
","The title does not appear on-screen until fifteen minutes in, and the film's trailer takes scenes mostly from the first thirty minutes, which made it seem like I had already seen the start, which made it seem like the plot took forever to really get started, and then when it did, it's not worth it. <br/><br/>Film spends its first act as a sappy, uplifting tale, optimistically​ showing mankind's reaction to a team of scientists orbiting the Earth, and their discovery of alien life (which, in early scenes, looks like a latex glove, inflated, and fluttering around) before dramatically changing gears, and genres, thirty minutes in, as the organism turns hostile, and they frantically try to kill it, before it reaches Earth.<br/><br/>The film's second act has some​ decent enough moments, in a 1990s B-movie sort of way, as the alien glob goes after each person, in the claustrophobic setting of this orbiting space station, but the third act degenerates into confusion and chaos, for the characters and the audience, as logic is flung out into deep space, and it appears they were just making up the plot as they went along. <br/><br/>As you may be able to tell from my description of it, the alien organism is lame, and​ poorly rendered, and the twist ending was predictable, and the addition of Norman Greenbaum's Spirit In The Sky during the closing credits turns the entire ordeal into a joke, an unfunny comedy.<br/><br/>A good cast, and​ a couple of decent enough moments in the second act, but that cannot redeem such a derivative, bland "" thriller "" such as this."

"LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt","5","3","9","26 March 2017"," A funtime movie
","LIFE is a bumpy little thrill ride, much like the actual thing itself. With a small but top notch cast and a deviously menacing creature to boot, the movie is able to sustain interest and a sense of emergency despite resorting to certain genre tropes in order to keep the story going. <br/><br/>While the movie does take of slowly(no pun intended), it is able to establish tangible distinctions between its characters and convey a sense of purpose for each. The groundwork thus laid pays off handsomely when the thrills come running, and additionally, character deaths have more of an impact. Point being that the movie respects its characters enough to sketch them out before slashing them to pieces. <br/><br/>The evolution of the creature and its design were all very interesting. The little thing has a commendable screen presence and was as well fleshed out as most characters, which I would say is a good thing for this movie. I only wish the mystery as to the full capabilities of the creature had persisted throughout the runtime, instead of the mystery of its powers sizzling out to the game of hide and seek that finally ensues. <br/><br/>As with most movies, the movie squanders its potential in the final act, and while it isn't in any way bad, it does not at all help with giving itself a unique tone, theme or feel from other movies of the same genre. Another unremarkable aspect was the score, which is a very important tool in helping the movie find a vibe and signature entirely its own. Instead of utilizing silence or minimalist sounds to heighten the suspense and isolation that the characters felt, generic blockbuster music is busted out repeatedly for entire set- pieces, which while initially being effective soon turns cumbersome.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is a fun movie with acting and effects that fit the bill, and a vitality that defies the movie's best attempts to sabotage itself, and shines through for an end result that will leave you smiling."
"trevor-82944","4","3","9","24 March 2017"," A Space Odyssey That Won't Live Long or Prosper
","Are we alone in the universe? Does life exist outside our world? Countless movies have provided answers, and yet we still don't know if intelligent beings inhabit other planets. So now following the generations-long trend, Daniel Espinosa plays his cards. While it may not be as rooted in scientific fact as District 9, Life still forces you to hold your breath out in the inky blackness of space as a single-cell organism grows into a faceless terror with only one instinct: kill.<br/><br/>A Mars Mission of eight astronauts picks up sediment from the red planet, leading to discovery of an unidentified single-celled object —an official confirmation of life in space. This little guy is named ""Calvin,"" after the elementary school of a select collection of children who sent in televised questions from Times Square. It isn't long though until Calvin grows appendages and breaks loose from his chamber. It probably wouldn't be too much to worry about, except his survival depends on the blood of each passenger on board. It's a long eight month return mission to Earth, so imagine what could happen if they don't eradicate Calvin before their time runs out!<br/><br/>As the journey sets off, it feels rather promising with a single uninterrupted shot composing the first five minutes, much like what Gravity did on a much larger scale, but everything afterward turns into standard this, standard that. Christopher Nolan took advantage of it in Interstellar, unlike Espinosa who put so little imagination within the empty vastness of space that no emotionally isolating feel comes out of the empty end product. He even feels the need to throw us into Calvin's point of view at random instances, which makes me question all the more who I'm supposed to be rooting for. Not even Independence Day was foolish enough to change perspectives, so why would it work here?<br/><br/>In fact, you could easily mistake Life for any other movie under the same genre. Many shots mimic set pieces and plot devices from something like Alien with no real originality. While you're not watching in fear of the gruesome Martian attacks, you're thinking, ""Hmm, where did I see that before? Oh, I remember! It's just like"" In fact, it becomes so obvious, one character even makes a reference to Reanimator. You know the movie has given up on being original when even the one- dimensional plot devices talk about how clichéd it is.<br/><br/>These talented actors cast as the astronauts certainly look the part, even if they barely have any direction to play from. Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Donnie Darko) gives the most believable performance of the entire cast, which honestly does not say very much. The entire crew consists of a Japanese man, a Black man, a Canadian man, and a bunch of White people with no established ethnic background. The depictions of everyone on board comes off more shallow than racially insensitive, although their accents are blaringly unconvincing. So the alien is not the one destroying our progress as a civilization, but the priority of White Americans over everyone else. Yes, I know: the title for their ship, ""International Space Station,"" is used quite loosely.<br/><br/>Then they express such stupidly pathetic means of interaction, with laughable on-the-nose exchanges about love, death, and living on Earth. The dialogue written by screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Deadpool, Zombieland) repeatedly mentions so much of what we can already see, it honestly made me hope Calvin wins in the end. After all, this faceless probe feels more human than any of those cardboard cutouts made of flesh.<br/><br/>Hey, at least it delivers the suspense it promised us. Especially the plot twist at the very end. It's not something as cleverly executed or shocking as Planet of the Apes, just a nice slice of dread to all the Gen-X men watching who want a satisfactory recreation of their childhood favorites.<br/><br/>If anything, Life has become less of a tribute to those better sci- fi thrillers, and more of a reminder of how much more fun they are to watch. In fact, you'd be better off watching any one of those classics, as they tell us so much more about the dangers of the universe and its hindrance of mankind."
"cssarde","10","6","24","25 March 2017"," Somewhat horrible emotional building but after that better than first Alien!
","In this film you actually fear for that alien thing. In the Alien you feel tense waiting for the alien, but you feel rather well after you see it. In Life however, you feel tension waiting for it to attack, you start to fear it as you see it and only way you get your nerves back a little bit, is when somebody dies. That is how scary it is. You kinda feel like that kid in the Simpsons ""Stop! Stop! He's already dead"".<br/><br/>Alien's problem is main character. In life you can't know who is lead and who is not. So you can't predict who might get hurt. It makes it super scary since everyone is really in danger. Of course there are some clues, but you can't trust them fully since they are all equal as characters.<br/><br/>Music is at times horrible. Beginning is not that convincing and camera work is pretty lame in the first 10 minutes. After that it gets better, but still remake with better start and cinematographer would mean best horror scifi in history."

The alien was suddenly on the foot of that Doctor and the doctor trying to hold for dear life with his crew knowing or not knowing that the alien was on his foot (either way still a dumb character writing) The alien suddenly understands it's path to earth?

","When movie makers have pretty much run out of ideas and every other movie is either a follow up, prequel, sequel, re imagining, 3D version, lego version or what not, movie goers still feel that they're being original by spotting a familiar theme in a movie that's been pointed a billion times already. <br/><br/>Personally I never got the fuss over the Alien franchise. I've always found it to be more of an ordinary horror/slasher flick rather than classic sci-fi with plot holes large enough to pilot the Nostromo through. <br/><br/>Life has similarities with Alien in certain aspects. While the premise is far more interesting and way more plausible than the Alien franchise, the execution is less so. The characters are weak and undeveloped to the extent that I really didn't care if they lived or died. The hard science was poorly thought out and careless which is inexcusable. And the constant need to have the characters make stupid decisions in order for the story to progress kept preventing me from immersing myself in the movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is still a movie that fans of hard 'sci-fi' will enjoy overall. For those of us who entertain the possibilities of an alien life form being out there, the thought of one being biologically alien to what we know is far more interesting than one that looks like a big lizard with acid for blood.<br/><br/>One thing that I definitely find encouraging is that movie makers are now more willing to ditch the 'Hollywood' ending."
"Paynebyname","8","2","5","25 February 2018"," An underrated gem of a film
","I have to say that this is such a good film and it's pretty unfair that it gets so quickly pied off for being an Alien clone. Okay, Alien was a good film but it doesn't mean that no one is allowed to put together their own interpretation does it. Should there only have ever been one Western?<br/><br/>What this film is, is a well acted, excellently scored, brilliantly executed example of how to generate real tension. The set up is realistic - our impulsive desire to find life despite the consequences - and the protagonist though horrifying has a genuine motive that propels it through the movie.<br/><br/>Having established what it can do, the inevitability of what is going to happen pours off the screen as things go from bad to worse despite the characters best efforts. The film conveys the suffocating claustrophobia of the space station and the idea of being trapped inside with something eminently dangerous and single minded in its desire to survive.<br/><br/>Life is an underrated gem of a film. The kind that you discover late one night as a wonderful little treat. It genuinely had me on the edge of my seat. Fabulous tension, amazing production, taut direction and great acting. One of the best tense thrillers that I've seen in a long time."
"lukem-13745","9","2","5","21 August 2017"," Enjoyed but it could have been better.
","The film has some scientists who are working on the ISS (International, Space, Station). With 3 supposedly main characters (Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson) I was extremely annoyed that one of my favorite actors (Ryan Reynolds) was the first one to be killed I expected him to survive very long seeing as he was on the front cover of the disc and is the first one to appear if you search up 'Life Cast' I think it was a bit of a waste of a good actor. The alien in the movie is very well made and feels quite original. The ideas felt original the ISS all that it made it feel very realistic, but it was set just now (2017) and in the film they have holograms so... yep that kinda takes out part of the nowadays feel to it but it's easily miss able. The characters I didn't find the most attachable to but I felt some were in parts of the film. The ending of the film is very good I find it can be predictable but not too predictable it ends with David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying to get an escape pod and having the alien go on it as we'll he attempts to fly the pod away from earth while Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) tried to take the escape pod back to earth it makes you think that the plan to kill the alien goes well in the end but it certainly doesn't...

"josephd-18087","6","2","5","7 August 2017"," A Surprisingly Good Film If You Don't Look Too Deep Into It
","Life is a perfectly adequate movie. I saw it not really not knowing anything about it past it being a thriller/horror film set on the International Space Station involving alien life. If you plan on watching this movie, I recommend you do too. I have heard a lot of different opinions on this movie and I would like to give a comeback to some. There are a good chunk of people giving this movie unrealistically low ratings like a 1 or a 2. I understand the points of view of people who dislike this film, however giving it such a low rating is insulting to the intelligence of anybody reading the reviews of this movie. Even if you hated this movie, you must still admit that there are plenty of things that would elevate this movie above the lowest possible ratings. I will talk about he good, the fine, and the bad about this movie, however the good alone is enough to keep this movie away from cinematic trash like Avatar The Last Airbender and the likes. Also this movie has definite flaws so a 10/10 or even a 9/10 isn't too warranted either, even if you were overjoyed by the movie. Basically I am saying don't listen to either extreme. <br/><br/>Before I get into my lists of positives and negatives, I would also like to address one specific complaint; the professionals act stupid. I personally am the exact kind of person who watches a movie ant thinks, ""oh don't go back to save the cat when the ship is about to explode you idiot"" or ""the chances of that happening are so low it is funny"". Hell, when I watched Arrival for the first time (and this isn't really a spoiler because it is literally the opening scene of the film) I thought ""oh yay this woman's daughter died of cancer so now they want us to be emotionally invested in the heroine without putting any effort in."" And now Arrival is one of my favorite movies of recent memory but I digress. In Life there are plenty of stupid or unrealistic decisions made by people who should know better, but more often than not you have to be actively seeking that kind of stuff to notice it. Unlike many other horror movies where the poor decisions are so blatantly obvious that it could make you laugh (think Prometheus' running in a straight line to avoid a crashing ship when you could run 50 feet to the left or right and be safe) most of the poor decisions made are less obvious. They are certainly there but if you go into this movie wanting to enjoy a movie most will fly right beneath you. Only if you go into this movie looking to actively dislike it will you find the reasons to do so in the first place. The surface stuff is really no more than your average fine to good horror movie.<br/><br/>Now I'll get into the good, the fine, and the bad.<br/><br/>Good: Plot- While the idea of finding alien life and realizing that it doesn't like humans sparking the events of a horror movie is nothing new, however it was done in a new enough manner so I didn't feel as if I was just watching the same movie I have already seen countless times before. Horror- The horror/suspense is actually pretty good. The movie refrains from easy jump scares (there are probably some in there that I have forgotten, however they were never used as a crutch or to the point of being annoying). Back to my point earlier, the suspense and horror mainly derives from the thought of what will happen to our characters. The actors do a fine job of making them likable and if you don't seek to dislike them, you will have an easy enough time attaching to them and worrying for them. Even if you manage to not like the characters, than there is the whole ""what happens if this gets to Earth"" thing. Effects- There were plenty of special effects in this movie, and at no point did I actively dislike them. Even the big scenes taking place out in space showing the station were good enough to not break my suspension of disbelief. The design of the alien is commendably unique and the effects are enough to do the design justice. The zero gravity was also done very well. Tone- The movie starts off relatively light heatedly enough, showing you the whole ""we just found proof of life outside of Earth"" elation you would expect. At some point relatively early in the film, there is a scene where it takes the expected turn towards horror/suspense. This particular scene was quite good and it makes that transition feel quite natural. Past that it was pretty consistent. <br/><br/>Fine: Music Pacing Acting Cinematography<br/><br/>Bad: Sound design- There were odd jumps between music and no music, volume got dialed in or back way too quick, and that sort of stuff. At times you couldn't hear what someone was saying and that was quite jarring. Decisions- Some of the more obvious poor decisions made were actually understandable, like under extreme stress, however there were points when characters just did the dumbest stuff without reason. <br/><br/>All in all I would give this movie a 6.5/10 (but IMDb makes me do whole numbers so I will give this movie the befit of the doubt and raise that to a 7).

","Life is the kind of sci-fi film that I really enjoy watching once, but will unlikely watch again.<br/><br/>I honestly hate horror films, but I appreciated the realistic approach and sequential consequences of each action.<br/><br/>This movie is perfect for people who dislike gory horror (Alien), pointless sci-fi (Gravity) and CGI bloated sci-fi films (Guardians of the Galaxy).<br/><br/>Most horror films overuse jump scares, subliminal images and nonlinear sound to stimulate generic responses.<br/><br/>Instead, Life uses the disturbing reality of isolation, the unknown, interpersonal conflict to deliver an intense and emotional ride.<br/><br/>I think the film is a realistic portrayal of what actual alien life will be like and the uncontrollable dangers therein.<br/><br/>A much more epic and scientifically accurate sci-fi horror film is Danny Boyle's (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire) Sunshine (2007) which coincidentally has the same actor Hiroyuki Sanada."

","Well after reading so many negative reviews I am really surprised that people come make up problems almost about everything. One example reviewer did not understand why US people would care about finding evidence for extraterrestrial life because they do not care about climate change. Unrealistic. Seriously? Mmmh wouldn't it be the greatest thing in human history to find proof that life is not created by God and life can exist out of Earth? First, I do not get the connection plus every nation would care especially an UFO maniac country. I feel like people just want to complain about something. <br/><br/>Yes, the movie is not perfect, there are situations where scientists could have been wiser, also the ending with Vietnamese fishermen opening the pod is not that great ( I would leave out that scene from the movie). Still I think there are tolerable amount of mistakes in the script. I hope those people who are so fussy about this movie gave even worse reviews to the new Alien franchise as they are well below the standards of this movie in terms of rational decision making and creating the image of real scientists.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie and I truly believed they are real astronauts-scientists who try to follow some rules, though not perfectly. At least they applied some protective measures and did not do huge f*cking stupid mistakes like the ones in Prometheus or Covenant. The quarantine measures could have been more strict by applying more caution eg. using robotics for initial experiments, more isolation for the lab. Still, I can live with these issues and they did not ruin the whole movie. Also Alien did not even come to my mind during watching the film as Life has a totally different atmosphere e.g characters, narrative, action scenes. Yeah if you analyze you can find similarities in the story, new fast growing life form trying to terminate humans in the space. That is all. In my opinion it is a bit similar to Europa Report. As a side note I am a huge Alien fan (original films, not the new ones), so if a film tries to copy I would complain here. You can go into details then you find similar scenes, but then all horror movies copy of another. <br/><br/>Overall, I had fun, got the thrills and LIfe is a science fiction, not a horror, dying is just part of the game if you experiment with an unknown life form."

","In 2017, there is a case to be made about movies that are fairly short, fun and easy to watch. In a world in which every action or sci-fi is 2 and a half hour long, a short 1h30 romp is refreshing. It's intense for most of its run, with a ""life"" that is a fairly good antagonist and a cast that is surprisingly 'quality' for a B level movie like this one. The main issue is that you've already seen this movie... It's Aliens in a Gravity setting. It's a gentle horror sci fi flick that never really surprises...to the end. But it's good fun, so why not?"

"fdbjr","5","2","5","24 March 2017"," The Old Switcheroo (SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!)
","I maybe speaking for myself, but I am getting very, VERY tired of downbeat 'surprise' endings. This movie isn't bad. It's an unapologetic homage to 'Alien', but slightly better scientific background. The actors are good, and credible, but the roles are not challenging. <br/><br/>I am writing this review, however, about the ending. As the picture closes, the characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson decide the new creature is too dangerous to be allowed even into the atmosphere. So Gyllenhaal, who does not want to return to Earth, decides to lure the being into a pod, and shoot into outer space, while Ferguson will try to find safety on Earth a' la Sandra Bullock in Gravity. All this is with reference to sophisticated guidance systems.<br/><br/>So all this takes place, and we see the capsules going in opposite directions. Then - at the end - the earth-bound one is opened - and - GASP!! - HORRIBLE SURPRISE - the wrong one went to Earth!!!! The creature is among us!!!<br/><br/>Come on. This is a surprise?? It was old by the time Twilight Zone ended its first run. And never mind that in terms of any engineering logic, plus the competence that members of a space crew would have to demonstrate even to be there, this end is absolutely incredible. <br/><br/>Plus it is SOOOOOO predictable. I wish some of these clever guys would take a leaf from Soderburgh's 'Contagion', which showed competent people doing their best, and an ending satisfyingly credible. The actual twist of 'Life' isn't a twist at all, and goes a long way towards damaging the picture fatally."

"paulwalsh-33212","8","3","10","27 May 2017"," Good quality Sci Fi horror.
","I didn't have any expectations from this film, neither did I read any reviews beforehand so I was unaware of the plot. I began by thinking it was going to be more of a Gravity styled space adventure, and to some degree this is true. However, and I do mean a big however, things started to seriously heat up at around 25 minutes in. <br/><br/>I love Sci Fi, and grew up watching Aliens and The Thing etc, consequently I am a big fan of both. I recently saw Alien Covenant which I really enjoyed, but I think this film is a lot more terrifying. Perhaps its just the down right persistence of the creature, and its lack of decipherable agenda other than to consume and kill. The location is set on a small space station, so the atmosphere is very claustrophobic. With each chapter the characters seem to get further boxed in, which constantly adds to the tension. The cast are excellent, however the biggest shortfall of the film is the script and characters. In my opinion there are no real standout or memorable characters. There are certainly no Ripleys, Hicks, Burkes or Bishops. In truth the excellent cast seem to have very little to play with, but they do there best with the limited material. If only they had of developed the script and characters further, this could have been a real contender. Previously, I also enjoyed Daniel Espinosas film Child 44 (Largely due to the brilliant performance from Tom Hardy), but that seemed to get a raw deal in the reviews as well. Its a shame as both movies are very enjoyable for the right audience.<br/><br/>As it is, Life is a fun ride for Sci Fi and Horror fans, it's genuinely scary and incredibly well made. OK, so it follows many of the usual tropes, but it brings new ideas to the table as well. It has an excellent cast and has an interesting score that helps to drive the mood. Again, If you don't like Sci Fi or Horror then obviously you wont enjoy this. Some of the reviews here seem biased, it would be pointless for me to write negative reviews about period costume dramas as they are not usually to my taste. I give this film a 7.5/10."

"CANpatbuck3664","8","3","10","30 March 2017"," Life Finds a Way to Deliver a Cool and Exciting Thriller Off a Familiar Premise
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* A probe carrying soil samples from Mars needs to be captured. The six man crew aboard the ISS (International Space Station) plans to do just that using the Canadarm. Pilot Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds) goes out on a spacewalk to control the arm and they are able to capture the probe. We are introduced to the rest of the crew gradually including: Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), Katerina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya) and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare). They're a tight bunch for the most part and they're excited about the possibilities the mission could lead to.<br/><br/>They individually test the samples that the probe has brought and they discover a single cell organism. It doesn't respond immediately but they are able to bring the organism back to life using a change in atmosphere in the tank and glucose. Over the next few days, ""Calvin"" (there was a contest to name it back on Earth) grows rapidly and has a different makeup than any other being we know of. He's simultaneously all brain matter, all muscle and all ocular nerve among other things. He's the size of a small flower after 7 days. After a breach in his containment unit he goes into a hibernation state. They try to wake him with electricity and it works but Calvin is no longer playful, he snaps the electric wand and crushes Hugh's hand causing a panic on the ship.<br/><br/>Life has a couple of characters that they focus on a little more but the movie operates as more of a ensemble film. I think this actually works in the movie's favour, you get to know the characters just enough that you don't want to see them become Calvin's victims. However, other than one of the more popular actors being the first to die, I was never really upset when one of them was in terrible danger. This was a careful line to walk, its hard to give everyone the proper screen time in this type of movie. Unlike other ensemble movies, I was never annoyed that someone didn't get their due. The character development was never too lopsided and I would say the same about the screen time that was issued.<br/><br/>The look of the movie and the science fiction concepts they decide to use also walk a fine line. The ISS seems so far ahead yet seems relatively grounded versus other sci-fi genre entries. The movie has a certain beauty (some of the opening shots are great considering they're all done in one shot) and it rarely falters. The design of Calvin isn't ground breaking (it looked like a translucent stingray combined with something that could walk) but it was unique enough to keep me interested.<br/><br/>Most of the unfavourable reviews Life has garnered have mentioned how its too similar to Alien and piggybacking off Alien's premise. I can't make that argument disappear completely. It is similar to Alien at it's core. A homicidal alien trapped in an enclosed environment bent on killing humans. But I do think that Life does a lot to distance itself. None of the characters really compare to Ripley, they operate more as a collective group. You can't get much more different from a Xenomorph to Calvin in their respective creature design. In most of the movies in the Alien franchise, there is some selfish motivation from either the Weyland Corporation or one of the crew members to endanger the others in the pursuit of doing something with the Xenomorphs (or the Engineers in Prometheus). In this movie, the crew are almost falling over each other to sacrifice themselves to get rid of Calvin and there isn't some sinister reason that they are trapped with Calvin, they are victims of circumstance and security protocols that dictate they must die rather than let Calvin get to Earth. So while there are some similarities, there are some key differences too.<br/><br/>The cast of Life features some well-known actors/actresses that I like but I wasn't familiar with all of them. Jake Gyllenhaal is technically the lead in this movie and he disappears into his character. It would be a bigger surprise if he wasn't excellent. I really liked Rebecca Ferguson in this. I was a little disappointed in the Girl on the Train but she worked a lot better in Life. She's a nice mix of collected yet compassionate. Ryan Reynolds was solid, I wish he'd been allowed to cut loose a little more but this is a pretty serious movie. Hiroyuki, Ariyon and Olga are all good. Life is a pretty calculated movie so other than acting horrified, the actors don't get very many opportunities to show a wide range of emotions.<br/><br/>I really like how Life went for a darker ending. They have the setup that's closer to a typical horror ending (it actually would have fit pretty well in the Alien series). Then they introduce a last-minute twist that really takes the movie in a more bleak direction. It might leave you a little confused at first but it fits if you consider everything that happens at the end.<br/><br/>People have been very critical of Life and I don't think the criticism has been entirely fair. Its okay to have more than one franchise in the genre and Life works as its own thing. They were talking about a sequel and I don't see how that would work, the ending seems pretty final. Life doesn't re-invent the genre but it's well put together in almost every way. It does work better as a thriller than a horror movie, it was pretty gory but I was never really frightened. If you're in the mood for a thriller with some science fiction, you could do worse than Life."

","Yes, this is just like the movie Aliens but it still stands for itself. The acting is good and so is the plot, not forgetting the CGI. All in all this is a great watch. <br/><br/>But if you want to watch this, watch it in the cinema so you get the entire feel."
"RLTerry1","8","3","10","24 March 2017"," In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream
","Chilling! In space, no one can hear you scream. Although that tagline is associated with Ridley Scott's groundbreaking space-horror Alien, director Daniel Espinosa's LIFE delivers an intensely dark thriller that will have you screaming and cringing from the moment life on Mars is discovered. In the same vein as Alien, LIFE is a science-fiction horror that may look like Gravity and might even have the strong orchestral sounds of Interstellar, but provides audiences with an entirely different experience. Borrowing from Alien and Gravity, Sony and Columbia Pictures craft a new space- horror narrative that can sufficiently serve as a standalone film--and be great in that--but also has potential for a sequel or two. Interestingly, there are parallels to Ridley Scott's Alien beyond the premise; LIFE also features the same number of crew members and other more subtle elements. That being said, LIFE is definitely not a knockoff Alien nor is it trying to be Ridley Scott's critically claimed film as it does not contain the social commentary on gender, sex, and family. However, imitation is the highest form of flattery, and LIFE pays both homage to the film that likely inspired it but delivers a comprehensive science-fiction horror experience that provides ample twists, turns, and even some emotional connection along the way.<br/><br/>Initial impressions of LIFE leave you with noticing just how much like Alien it feels. It's been nearly forty years since the Ridley Scott cinematic masterpiece, but in that time, no other science- fiction/horror film has come this close to delivering a similar (note: not as high on the cinematic totem pole as its predecessor) experience to that which first terrified audiences in 1979. One of the primary differences between Alien and LIFE is just how much closer to home this horrifying experience occurs. Whereas with the former, the alien encounter takes place hundreds of lightyears away, the latter's narrative takes place just outside of our atmosphere on the ISS. Not that LIFE feels more intimate than Alien--it doesn't--but the proximity of this story might add a little something more to the edge that you're already sitting on as the horrific events unfold on the space station. Pacing is similar to Alien in that LIFE has a slow burn during the first act. To balance this slow burn or to keep audiences from thinking that it's taking forever for the movie to really get started, the film begins with the ""big event"" right at the very beginning. The ""big event"" being the apprehension of the satellite carrying the Martian specimen. But for all it's similarities, this movie provides a different experience that can certainly stand on its own. LIFE may have been inspired by Alien, but it is certainly not a ripoff.<br/><br/>I've been quite critical of the CGI-effects of films in more recent years, but the brilliance of the alien life form in LIFE is the degree to which it feels organic. In the beginning, the life form is little more than a single-celled organism; however, as the plot thickens, the organism begins to take a more chilling form and shape. Eventually, the alien develops a frightening grin and a mysterious- like form. One of the scariest parts of Ridley Scott's Alien was the degree to which the Xenomorph feels so real that, even in your seat, you could feel the acidic slime and your body likely felt the excruciating pains of that iconic moment when the alien shoots out of the stomach. Part of that can be attributed to the use of pneumatics, animatronics, miniatures, and other practical effects standards. Yes, the alien life form in LIFE is computer-generated, but it also has a very real nature to it. Instead of focussing on how to make the alien as impressive as possible, it would appear that the special effects artists (whose work can be seen in the Transformers movies) focused more on the small details that ordinarily give a CGI character away. Just like with the brilliant visual effects work in Ex Machina, the visual effects of the alien are flawless.<br/><br/>There is an inherent level of unpredictability in LIFE even after the unavoidable similarities to Alien. LIFE plays around with the final girl trope and the killings have a strategy or method to their madness. Conspicuously missing from the characters of LIFE in a comparison to Alien is a Ripley- like character. Does the film portray strong female characters? Certainly. But LIFE keeps you guessing because the order of the deaths do not follow any predictable pattern. Do not allow yourself to fall into the trap of being predisposed to the order of the killings to be based up on star billing. Speaking of the characters, effectively managing an ensemble cast is always difficult. So often, some characters in the ensemble get lost or do not receive nearly as much development as the more obvious leaders. Not true with LIFE. True that there is not a large degree of character development all the way around, but each of the characters is treated with equal screen time and emphasis. That is, until death occurs. The excellent handling of this ensemble gives LIFE an extra dynamic that lacks in other ensemble cast films, thus helping this science-fiction horror to stand out from others that are similar in premise or plot. This movie has a ""life"" of its own."

Its music, tension and rhythm and casting could've been better, but the movie is still good enough to watch at a movie theater. The director tries to add some depth to the characters, but it somewhat fails, too, due to its not-so-long running time probably.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are into sci-fi movies, you should totally give it a chance.

It's one of my all-time favorites and Life did get some inspiration off of it (which is by no means a flaw!).<br/><br/>The premise is interesting enough and actually more ""realistic"" than other alien movies: they retrieve some evidence and study it, stimulating it in order for it to come to life (no pun intended). Then, as the creature evolves, it wants to defend itself, it wants to survive, so it's not as in Alien where there are spaceships with eggs and all of the beasts just want to kill everyone.<br/><br/>It's a beautifully-shot film. It's really a CGI masterpiece, every scene is shot with great quality, an excellent fluidity of cuts and a fast pacing, but without under-developing the characters (with the exception of one, I'll discuss that below). Besides a very solid cast with excellent performances, there are also well-developed characters: everyone has their own past and reasons to be up there and all of them are explained through extremely needed character- development scenes. This is a hour-and-a-half film, with a pretty fast pacing, so I was positively surprised that I was able to care for every character.<br/><br/>However, Jake Gyllenhaal's character (Dr. David Jordan) was under- developed, which I don't really understand since he's basically the star of this movie (Ryan Reynolds isn't in it as much as I thought he would be). It's not like his performance was below average (actually, he was really great, as always), it's just that his character was the only one that didn't get an emotional past or a good motivation to be in the ISI.<br/><br/>I love the creature, it's another CGI beauty, even if it isn't as scary as it should. Nevertheless, it does prove why Life is rated R ... Which I didn't know as I entered the theater, so I was pretty much satisfied with the gruesome and bloody scenes. Even so, this isn't the best movie ever doing this type of scenes, so it's not like something I've never seen before.<br/><br/>My main issue with this movie is the third act, which kind of messes with the creature's motivations. It goes from ""I just want to survive, don't threaten me"" to ""I'll kill you on sight"", which isn't properly a contradiction, but the way they did it at the end didn't connect the last act's tone that well with the previous two acts. Mentioning the end, by the way ... It is predictable, I'll not discuss that. However, by being predictable, doesn't mean it's bad, it can actually be pretty satisfying if done right and I think it was. I really enjoy the ending, it's well-shot enough for me to put aside its predictability.<br/><br/>Life is yet another ""alien on a spaceship"" movie, but it's able to have a more ""realistic"" premise. It's beautifully shot, the pacing is fast and the CGI is used masterfully. With a very solid cast and great performances come also well-developed characters, even if Jake Gyllenhaal's (who has another great performance to add to his amazing achievements) didn't get a past or motivations as good as the others. The suspense and horror prove right the ""rated R"", but it's not like we haven't seen this before (Alien ...). The creature is menacing at times and smart, despite the third act's tone messed its motivations.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"

","Just to get it out of the way, I thought this was a really good film.<br/><br/>I feel compelled to write this review to readjust the ratio of terrible ones. I cannot begin to imagine the mind set of someone who walks into the cinema and says to themselves, oh I hope this SCI FI / HORROR film about an alien sticks completely to the laws of physics and the characters portrayed within act in rational manner....just like every horror or sci to film out there ( rolls eyes ).<br/><br/>Personally I found this film to be exactly as expected, it wasn't a thrill ride of twists and turns with deep and meaningful characters. But it isn't supposed to either. It's supposed to be an easy watching Friday night film, requiring just the right level of concentration after a weeks work with a few obligatory jump scares and a suitably cliché ending. <br/><br/>In all seriousness though. If you like a bit of cheesy monster against puny humans trapped and fighting for survival. Watch this film. But if you're one of these people that think the slightest possibility that an alien (carbon based or otherwise) could hold its breath for 15 minutes or consume toxic coolant is absolutely beyond the realms of reasonable storytelling then give it a miss."

Now I put it nicely, because others might also say that it stole a lot. Whichever way you put it, it means one thing: there is a lot of predictability in this.<br/><br/>That either means, you will be bored and angry at characters or you will just enjoy the well executed ride (no pun intended). The effects are good and while the characters do stuff you might not always agree with, it's a movie and stuff has to happens. I've seen worse decisions people made.

","Life (2017)<br/><br/>A meld of ""Aliens"" and ""Gravity,"" with strengths of neither. The underlying point here was to make this idea—a Mars life form discovered and in quarantine on the Space Station—seem possible. And the big question: then what?<br/><br/>But they make it impossible. There are moments of reasonable acting and believable responses, but mostly it's exaggerated and sometimes just plain stupid. That is, the characters do really stupid things, given the situation. ""Gravity, for all its visual excess, was also weirdly down to earth and believable. ""Aliens"" made no pretense of truth, of course, but it had actors that had intensity and depth. ""Life"" it a parade of obvious clichés in the booming space movie business.<br/><br/>It's not impossible to watch. There are well orchestrated effects, and a feeling of weightlessness that's good. The acting is a mixed bag (and the leading name on the list, Hiroyuki Sanada, is just one of the crew, nothing notable). I think it gets passable ratings because it's kind of fun, and if you don't really care about the feasibility of this life form in this manner, and you don't care if the plot is absurdly unrealistic, then go for the ride.<br/><br/>And for the great, improbable twist at the end."

In doing so Calvin jumps onto the oxygen candles which harmed it earlier on in the movie. <br/><br/>It never shows how Calvin got onto Hugh's leg.

A scientist forms a creepy friendship with the octopus before accidentally putting it in a coma after when he forgets to lock up the lab equipment properly. Upset that he has crippled his new friend he then decides to shock it back to life using a miniature cattle prod. Not so surprisingly the Octopus doesn't really appreciate this and finds new purpose in life by following the usual horror film formula of killing off the characters one by one in standard Hollywood order.

","""Life"" is a horror film in space without great surprises, but very entertaining. The movie tells the story of the six-member crew of the International Space Station that is on the cutting edge of one of the most important discoveries in human history: the first evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars. Those who have seen Alien will have a pretty good idea what's coming, at least to a point. The film has good digital effects, real suspense mix with horror, an interesting twist and also A-list stars. The truth is that ""Life"" will not go down in history as the best film of the genre, but it's a B movie product with a good budget, which disguises itself well as a blockbuster."

","As everyone says is like the mythical ""Alien"", yes, but not. If it is true that the premise is the same (poor miserable ones are trapped in a spaceship with a very bad creature that wants to kill them), but there are several differences. This pretends to be as realistic as possible, it tries to show how it could be a first encounter with an alien entity that does not come with good intentions, with a more or less serious and scientific tone and in a more or less current moment. The director manages to entertain at all times and manages to transmit the angst of the characters without showing more than due and always with an elegant, successful and brave style. It is not a masterpiece, but it works."

","I liked this movie a lot. It seems to be vastly underrated. I am not easily terrified. Visually it was stunning. <br/><br/>I found this to be even more terrifying than Alien on a number of levels; the cramped quarters, the external views which constantly reminded me they were in space, and the visual realism which let me suspend {pun intended} my disbelief. No offense, but Alien looks so obviously like it's in a movie set. I don't recall another movie that spends so much time in zero gravity (not counting Gravity since George & Sandra were in spacesuits which makes the cgi too easy).<br/><br/>I especially like Ryan Reynold's floating blood drops turning into a gusher.<br/><br/>TG for Lara Flynn Boyle's Serleena. Without her I would have had nightmares for certain. I am surprised I haven't read anything else about that comparison.<br/><br/>I was so busy not allowing myself to be horrified {thanks Serleena} that I didn't second guess the ending until seconds before it happened. I am glad there was not even a glimmer of a happy ending."
"ReelLifeReviews","6","2","6","30 March 2017"," Solid creature feature
","Life (2017) - A claustrophobic thriller set in the wide expanse of space. It tries, but ultimately doesn't measure up to the success of Alien in this regard. The result, however, is a better than average creature feature.<br/><br/>It has intense moments of peril and anticipation that had me saying ""c'mon, c'mon, c'mon"" in my head. The score complimented these moments extremely well. The creature is altogether creepy and eerily smart. It had a unique look that set it apart from anything I'd seen in other films.<br/><br/>I did actually care about the characters though there is next to zero character development. But even with the minimal exposition, the sense of camaraderie and history within the crew comes through perfectly. The casting of Ryan Reynolds in an ensemble movie, however, struck me as strange. He's just too big of a presence for me to buy in a supporting role nowadays. It doesn't help that he basically just plays Ryan Reynolds in a space suit. Usually I like his shtick, but it pulled me out of the movie from time to time.<br/><br/>I know this next part is going to be vague, but there is one basically inexcusable choice that a character makes just past the halfway mark of the movie. It seemed wholly unnecessary to do this in order get them where the writer wanted them to be. They in fact had a built-in way that they could accomplish the same result without dumbfounding the audience with this backwards motivation. After you see it I'm sure you'll recognize what I'm referring to.<br/><br/>It has plenty of great moments, but didn't quite reach where I thought it could go. It deserved more than the measly $12 million opening it received, though with the marketing and seemingly generic storyline I can't say I'm too surprised. If I had to rank them, I'd go cereal, this movie, then the board game."

"SpencerPEvans","1","1","2","31 March 2020"," I Can't Believe I'm Saying This, But Life Sucks
","I'm going to come out and say it; this movie is not just overrated, it's insultingly awful! The acting doesn't come across well, the story is poorly written, the characters are stupid, the effects are very bad for a 2017 movie, and I don't understand why people even REMOTELY enjoyed this one, because this was unbearable to me!<br/><br/>-- THE EFFECTS --
I'm sorry, but the effects were really bad. The movie came out in 2017 and it hurts to look at the alien, especially when it's clinging onto the people. Plus, the alien... looks really stupid. It honestly looks more like a plant from the Upside Down. I would've enjoyed it a bit more, but there's still more to go through.<br/><br/>-- THE CHARACTERS --
I hate, hate, HATE, the fact that there is almost no true character. Just having your characters talk to each other and look like they're having fun doesn't tell me what they're like. Even if that wasn't my problem, here's the biggest one: they're trained astronauts! All the decisions that they make are BEYOND unrealistic and questionable for someone of their intelligence! And for a group of people who have a threat, but they still have a high intelligence, how long do you think people would argue? Maybe, 10-15 seconds, tops? The movie makes them argue for seven minutes continuously all throughout the film! There is no true character development for anyone on the ship or elsewhere!<br/><br/>-- THE ACTING --
I love Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson and Jake Gyllenhaal. as much as the next guy, really! But everyone's acting is not the right mood. Sure, when they're having fun and hanging out, it's acted (mostly) well, but once the alien arrives, there's only mild shock when it's discovered. The looks on their faces are mostly blank and dull unless they're (sigh) afraid of the alien. You might not agree with me yet, but please hold on with me for a little bit longer.<br/><br/>-- THE STORY --
This is, by far, the WORST part of the movie! Here's a quick rundown: A group of astronauts are out to collect a life sample found from a satellite, but later on it grows defensive and offensive, so it tries to kill the scientists in order for it to sustain its own life. In the end, every character is killed off, one by one, until the end where a twist so poorly written, shot, and directed that even M. Night Shyamalan is shaking his head in disappointment: they accidentally got the alien onto Earth and it will wipe out civilization as we know it.<br/><br/>You know that frustrating opening scene in Alien where the main characters know that the scientist was infected by the xenomorph, but they let him in anyways allowing the movie to continue (I still love that movie with an utmost passion, because it was mostly smart except for that one scene)? Imagine that for two hours then the aliens are so dumb as to wipe out humanity!<br/><br/>Here's the biggest problem with the story: all throughout the movie, it goes absolutely nowhere until the end where the characters made stupid decisions and kill all of humanity. ""Oh, no, the alien put him in shock!"" ""I'll go in and help him! Whoops, never mind, I'm dead."" or ""Oh, no, the alien is in the air vents!"" ""I'll go out and repair the systems! Whoops, never mind, I'm dead."" and this pattern repeats practically for forever! So the characters' deaths mean absolutely NOTHING except for ""I was stupid.""<br/><br/>Also, the title is the wrong name for the movie. This movie is mostly death; stupid, painful, pointless death. Given how they mentioned all the different lock-down methods (as they call ""firewalls"") this should be called ""Firewall III"", since Firewall I was the container holding the alien, Firewall II was the laboratory, and Firewall III is the space station. Is it just me or does that make a million times more sense for the title?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Normally, for most movies, I'd understand why people might love and/or hate the movie, but this one? This is an absolute slap in the face for anyone who has brain cells and is sober! I do not understand why you people like this, but don't make me watch it again! I'm sorry, but they forced me to say ""Life sucks."""

"kurakukasu","8","1","2","17 October 2019"," Flawed, but a treat for horror fans
","I read many of the comments on this film and have to agree with some of the criticism: its structure is basic and its characters are pretty shallow, there's even one of them I still don't know what he's doing aboard the ISS after several viewings.
That said, it didn't bother me as much as other viewers because as a horror fan, I tend to leave some of those defects aside, and Life is nothing more than big budget horror movie in a sci-fi setting.
And as in many horror movies, most notably slashers, the characters do dumb things and their situation keeps getting worse and worse.
It's part of the game, it lets us imagine how better we would have dealt with this situation and makes us want to shout at the screen: ""no, don't go there you idiot"", ""there's something behind you!"", etc. just like kids watching a clown show.
Now what I really like about this movie is that it states its rules in a rather subtle way towards the beginning: the creature doesn't kill blindly, it always does it for the same reason, which only becomes clear at the very end.
But when it wants to kill, it is relentless and doesn't show any mercy.
The deaths in this movie are brutal and often memorable, you really get to feel how scary dealing with such a clever monster could be, which alone makes the movie worth a watch in my opinion.
On top of that, it's beautifully shot and has top notch effects, especially those related to the absence of gravity, which are also very well used throughout the film. Finally, the ""monster"" doesn't pale in comparison to its otherworldly predecessors, it's main feature being its intelligence as I said (it's a lot smarter than a xenomorph for example) and we get to see a bit of its lifecycle.
And of course, there's the surprise ending that has been much discussed, for which I add a point to my rating."

It also seemed silly to cut of the creature's air supply when it had already spent a goodly time outside, in vacuum, without seemingly being harmed.

Movies are supposed to make you forget about your troubles, so they succeeded, even if it makes zero sense that they would ""catch"" a gigantic probe headed right for the space station, a feat that would likely have resulted in the deaths of everyone on board. I kind of wish they had named the alien Steve, so they could comment on Steve's progress throughout the ship in loud voices. At least make the alien consistent...if it's able to survive outside the ship in sub-zero temperatures, then why can't it survive later on when the temperature goes down? They have specific, dedicated displays for the position of the air vents in the exam room, why? Why would this even be a thing? Also, I'm at the point in my life where I've seen enough of Jake Gyllenhall's open-mouthed stare, which is about as convincing as Kristen Stewart's open-mouthed stare.

","After receiving samples from Mars, scientists aboard the International Space Station start to investigate if any traces of life are present. Their discovery will prove to one of humanity's greatest leaps but also one that leaves a lot of mysteries to be found, especially some very dangerous ones.<br/><br/>It's a movie which, to be honest, reminds me of the Alien franchise, at least its most recent instalments. The only major difference is that in this case, everything is treated with much more care, intelligence and knowledge. Although this one leads to a similar conclusion, you have the feeling that it doesn't insult your intelligence and that it also tries to tell its story in a rather acceptable way. Speaking of which, although very predictable most of the time, it manages to keep it all together, generating plenty of suspense along the way.<br/><br/>The characters are also ok, while not very well described, they tend to be likeable, thus their suffering doesn't leave the viewer without any emotion. The producers could have done a lot more in this compartment, but the result is quite ok, at least for the plot that it tries to deliver. The action is rather static, with a couple of rushes now and then, generating a dark but interesting atmosphere in which the characters can take their ""fight"". <br/><br/>As a result, I was left with some mixed feelings. Although predictable, even with the twist in the end, the movie somehow manages to keep the viewer interested. The suspense it creates is also a very big plus, while the actors do their job quite well in portraying their characters, which once again, could have been much better described. Its biggest let-down as far as I'm concerned is by far the plot. It could have done a lot more than being as linear, predictable and also generic as it is. Without a couple of different ideas it had, it would have been a pretty classic horror movie, without logic or even a clear finale."

I was greatly reminded of this year's ""Alien"" movie where people know they are in danger and yet proceed to act reckless as if there is no danger at all, like no human would. This made me lose any attachment I might have had to the characters (which started off low as Ryan Reynolds is like nails on a chalkboard at the best of times). In general the acting was wooden and unbelievable. You can tell the most of the events in the movie are plot devices by the screenwriters to advance the plot to the next cool ""incident"" they had thought of, forcing the actors to contort themselves to fit what was happening, so it's not entirely their fault.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen 2013's ""Gravity,"" do yourself a favour and watch that instead of this.

","I don't know what Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and even Hiroyuki Sanada (I love the guy, but he played in some really awful stuff) were doing in this film.

Some of the scenes were amazing. Unfortunately, the story is dumb and formulaic, going for the same cheap ""we are the good guys, so we must feel and shout and do stupid things to prove it"" and an implausible form of life that defied any possible scientific rule (or space station design feature). It probably is in the interest of film makers to not make horror movies too plausible, but I hated that.<br/><br/>Bottom line: you get to feel for the characters, mostly because of the sound performance, but the ""oh, come on!"" moments ruin the mood to the point of annoyance.

"svenlauke","5","1","2","3 September 2017"," Not bad, but nothing groundbreaking
","Is this movie groundbreaking? No. Is this movie Oscar worthy? No. is this movie something we haven't ever seen before? No. Then what is it. <br/><br/>Well its a well made hour and 40 minutes of space horror that is not a waste to watch. <br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>In the beginning I got a bit dizzy, because there is a lot of weightless camera stuff involved...nothing for people with vertigo. But it gets right to the point. Some very important samples from mars are reaching the ISS, and it makes the ""catching"" of these samples out to be very risky and easy to fail. sadly this is never touched upon again. Any effort to kill off the life within these samples is never met with any objection, whereas the ""you don't know what we had to go trough to get this""-character was missing, for better or worse you decide.<br/><br/>For the biologists among us (such as myself), a movie called life could have done a bit better at trying to explain how the creature does what it does. with nothing more than a microscope and some gloves, the on board biologist can tell things that I don't remember being possible in this way from uni. Non scientists might not notice this, but in todays day and age, I enjoy ""close"" proximity to reality even in Sci-Fi and fantasy. make us believe that what we are seeing can be real!<br/><br/>another problem for me? The alien spends a good....lot of minutes in the vacuum of space(which no adaptation I know of could save an organism that large and exposed, if you are thinking of the tardigrade, they go into a hibernation mode, which this thing (called Kelvin) is said to also do, but never does. What makes this so bad is, that this is a lot of what the movies plot solution rides on: deprive it of oxygen etc and have it go into stupor then send it to deep space. but we have seen it in naked space and nothing happened, so what will ""venting the compartments of the ISS"" do for you? well at least they stay true to that, because other than being lured to the oxygen sources later on, it doesn't hinder the creature one bit.<br/><br/>there are also three cheat moments in the movie: 1) Now I am no rocket scientists, but if there is a direct path from the thrusters into the crew quarters, you might have a leak in your ship. 2) the alien is in and we have the typical ""shadow moves in background, character is uncertain if he saw something"" moment. fine, every horror film has that. Then we get some weird ""him looking into space"" moment, and next his vitals are dropping (actually not next there must at least be like 15 min movie time in-between) and it turns out the monster infested his leg and is slowly eating him (which it could do at record speeds before). How did it get to his leg? its never shown because there is no way that could have happened without us or him seeing it. yes he is a paraplegic, but the monster makes a lot of noise moving around, and is about the size of a medium dog...so stealth is not its strong suit. 3) in the end, the major twist is somewhat predictable, but makes little sense when you sign up the sequences. one shuttle heads to earth, one to space, one gets hit (the earth bound one), and gets back on course, the other gets overwhelmed by the alien. all fine, but the problem is we see the inside of the cabins as all this is happening. and only after the big reveal, do we see that the ""into space"" shuttle was actually the one without the alien, all of a sudden housing a screaming female survivor. but when we last saw her, she should already have been well on her way into space, yet remained calm, despite her computer that would have informed her about her trajectory. so its a bit a of a cheat to make you think is a happy ending when it isn't. <br/><br/>OK earth is doomed, because despite everyone wanting to burn it, fire never made an impact on this thing. so I guess a sequel will be post apocalyptic.<br/><br/>the acting is solid enough, the effects are OK to more than OK, and you won't feel like a wasting your time if you are just looking for entertainment."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","26 March 2017"," Horror is only a by-product
","Following the trend of one-simple-word-title spaces sci-fi (Gravity, Passenger, Arrival), ""Life"" lives up to the character of its predecessors as a thought-provoking movie appealing to the intellect. In other words, comparison to the Alien series is misplaced. While I have no intention of undermining Alien, the fact remains that it appeals to the audience's senses and instincts, with an accent on horror. Not lacking in vomit-inducing scenes, ""Life"" nevertheless is not guilty of contrivances to that end. Everything shown on the screen happen for a natural reason.<br/><br/>The story is simple, as shown in the somewhat lengthy establishing scenes that appear before the title ""LIFE"" appears on the screen. The stage is an international space station that is an elaborated construction outside, and a variety of environments form narrow connecting tunnels to spacious control rooms. The crew of six is international, as evidences from how English is spoken: absolutely exotic Russian accent, normal American spoken with no noticeable difference between the American members and the sole Japanese member (undoubtedly educated in the US), and beautiful Queen's English. The mission is to collect samples from Mars, with lofty aspirations (from at least some member) that life forms, if found, may evolve into something that renders stem cells obsolete. When a single-cell organism was indeed found, the crew was ecstatic. <br/><br/>At this juncture, an introduction to the six crew members, and the actors who play them. The captain is a Russian woman, mild mannered and soft spoken as played by little-known (at least in Hollywood) Olga Dihovichnaya. Not a leader by forceful presence, she is later proved to be a leader by example. The only other woman, as well as possessor of the beautiful diction, is Miranda North, the authority on ""Disease Control and Prevention"". She has been instrumental to the governing protocol in all matters concerning this field and also doubles up as the crew doctor. Rebecca Ferguson is best known as the latest leading lady in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise (British secret agent Ilsa Faust acting opposite to Tom Cruise). As Miranda North, she displays both sides of the character: the caring nature of a medical doctor and the stern control of a protocol officer holding the line of defence against the catastrophe of something deadly from outer space reaching earth.<br/><br/>The two in the movie star category are both male. Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds play two professional astronauts with markedly different personas. The former, David Jordan, is introvert who finds himself completely at home in space, away from the hateful humanity. Rory Adams is outgoing, even bit reckless sometimes, never shying away from giving you a piece of his mind. The remaining two members are visible minorities. Black and British, Ariyon Bakare plays Hugh Derry, a dedicated scientist who believes that finding life form in Mars may mean salvation of Earth from all disease. Japanese participation in this project is represented by engineer Sho Murakami who was showing with pride on an I-pad to team members his new born baby, a heart-warming portrayal of a loving family man. Perfectly cast is Hiroyuki Sanada who was deeply touching in the portrayal of ""The Twilight Samurai"" (2002). <br/><br/>I am not going to spoil your fun by saying too much. As mentioned earlier, similarity with Alien is more superficial than real. ""Life"" is good science fiction first and foremost and we see horror only when it is a necessary part of the plot. We ""Calvin"" (named by the celebrating people on Earth) grow from a tiny life form clinging to one's fingertip to what looks like the beautiful hybrid between an orchid and a bauhinia, and finally to a human -size, sinister looks squid-form. There is nothing outrageously unpredictable in how Calvin grows and terrorises the six people in the space station. And it does not take much to see what is coming, the final choice between self-sacrifice and running the risk of Calvin coming to Earth. But then, it is nowhere near being paint-by-number, in simple things like the order of dying (which in almost all case would be related to salary of the actor, for one thing).<br/><br/>I have already said too much. This movie is not easy entertainment. For the appreciative audience, however, it is well worth seeing."

Our world is informed of the discovery and a little girl gives it the name of Calvin from her Calvin Coolidge school. (President Coolidge advocated noninterference in foreign affairs, maybe a noble idea, but contributing to the development of World War II.)<br/><br/>It quickly becomes apparent that Calvin is not benign and begins graphically killing the crew to consume their blood. The being grows larger and more powerful seemingly invulnerable to destruction. I have seen my share of horror movies but this one had me scared as it felt too realistic plus you were connected to the plight of the characters.<br/><br/>Of course, in reality, nothing is more terrifying than people conducting mayhem. In the earlier mentioned films, Jake suffered from homophobia, and Ryan suffered from consequences of the Holocaust. In LIFE, however, we are led to believe that governments have achieved relative peace in their search for extra terrestrial life. Perhaps peace is even harder to fathom than the existence of the life form.<br/><br/>I had read reviews mentioning a twist ending without disclosing any details. So I reflected on possible outcomes. Does Clavin kill all on board, does it invade earth? And what is the mechanism of these events?

","This movie is amazing. I really do not understand the bad reception of it. I guess many critics didn't like it because this is one of the few sci-fi movies that has a very depressing, catastrophic ending - which, in my opinion, is exactly what makes this movie so clever, credible and remarkable. <br/><br/>Here the viewer is confronted with ethical dilemmas regarding researches of extraterrestrial life - how far science can get? Are we allowed to play God?<br/><br/>In this movie, when astronauts find out that there is indeed extraterrestrial life, they start to explore the new alien cell inside their spaceship. That's when things go terribly wrong, and the new discovered creature displays an out-of-control behavior. After that, astronauts do not only fight for their lives, but have to deal with the catastrophic consequences of their own acts, the desperation of eminent death, and the conclusion that human lives are much weaker than we thought. <br/><br/>Cast is amazing and once again Jake Gyllenhaal's performance doesn't disappoint. I also congratulate Ryan Reynolds and Ariyon Bakare for their amazing work in this movie. There are bloody scenes that can make our stomachs churn, but in a good way - and the actors work very well to create the tragic atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>The ending could not be more nihilistic, cruel and catastrophic.

A clever, daring, unique sci-fi masterpiece that got me thinking and wondering about it for a few weeks after watching it."

","Lots of bad reviews for this film so I went in not expecting much. Now I have to say, it wasn't anything great for the first 95% of the film except some great tension between the cast and the 'Life', and the directing and cinematography/VFX and editing were on point, but if was very slow paced. I really didn't 'feel' many of the characters with the exception of Jake Gyllenhaal, and even he didn't shine until towards the end. Additionally, there were many plot holes that I felt could have been fixed in the editing dept. However, where this little gem did shine, was in that last 5% towards the end. The ending alone made my score jump by 2 points. I don't want to give anything away, but it's certainly visually appealing with an amazing end and should be seen. It's a 9/10 from me."
"mongeortiz","6","2","7","5 July 2017"," Terrifying... mediocrity
","It starts quite promising, with a pretty acceptable cast and decent lines. <br/><br/>However, you get to the point where you don't have to think or wonder, the characters tell you everything you need to know like they're telling a typical alien story with nothing surprising.<br/><br/>The script is vague and forced, with the details told in a too excessive poetic way. <br/><br/>Some characters don't fit in the whole idea. You get to hate Hugh even more than you hate Calvin itself. You hate how Hugh is illogically obsessed with a couple of cells like he had no common sense at all.<br/><br/>The ""emotional"" parts of the movie are pathetic. SPOILER: The death of Rory was sudden, stupid, and mourned by nobody in his crew. I'm pretty sure Jake even smiled a bit in this part.<br/><br/>After the first half of the movie, you've lost all expectation and you dedicate yourself to enjoy guess the predictable coming events of the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The monster/alien/bunch of cells growing up for no reason, is pretty dull. SPOILER: it grows up in an environment similar to Earth - according to the movie, is rich on Carbon Dioxide more than oxygen-, which has no sense after it escapes the firewall and begins to play around the entire spaceship which is fully charged of oxygen and almost no Carbon Dioxide.<br/><br/>Its a shame, though. The whole idea sounds better than it looks on the screen."

Those ppl (those who gave a negative review) should grow a brain because they cant understand it. I guess for those ppl a real scientist are more likely be the ones in the film Prometheus, where the lead scientist is depress because the found he existence of alien life, or where the first thing you do in an alien planet is take off your helmet and breath the air, or a multi billion dollars expedition where the scientist didn't even know each other until they arrive (WTF) shall I go on? In this film when the astronauts discovered life, the earth celebrated! you can see the astronauts know each other very well and each others capabilities, that mean they received good training. And the most important of all these astronauts follows protocols. There are step 1, 2 and 3 and you can see it through the entire film. The creature is well done, no more humanoid creatures, ask any scientist how alien life would look like and the last thing they will say is humanoid. When science is done right people will find it boring, not understandable. And that is the cause I think this film has received so many negative reviews. If you are a sci fi fan and really like science done ""right"" and considered Prometheus a ridiculous sci fi film go and see Life."

","Forget all the review about logic. if you really want logic in every movie, please watch documentary. Most popular movies has no logic at all. Remember that first.<br/><br/>So back to the review, spoiler alert<br/><br/>What I like about this movie, it makes me terrified to think that a single cell alien can be deadly (not like a virus or disease). And this idea of single cell alien is very original and also very logical. It is very possible if outside of earth has a living single cell, and maybe it is 'hybernating'. Not like other alien movie which show us about a big, scary, monstrous living creature. This single cell alien can multiply themselves and become bigger, stronger creature. And I think this alien is the strongest alien ever imagined. It all muscle, all brain, all eyes. Even in the end of this movie, there is no other way to kill this creature but the idea to push it away. <br/><br/>What I dislike, too many popular actors with poor script and act. Maybe too plain act for Ryan and Jake. And you know they are very good actors. Big potential but not optimized. But forget about the actors, Just think they are not big stars. Then you can make peace with this movie.<br/><br/>The special effects also good. And the ending is just surprising. I hope there is another sequel for this movie.

","""Life"" despite being a very well finished film and with a direction that does not leave to be desired, we notice that it is the opposite of original, it is a fragmented of at least another 10 films of the same genre that is inspired, that goes From ""2001, a space odyssey"" to ""alien,"" through ""apollo 18"" and ""interstellar."" I like the script of the movie, although I find it lazy in some ways, but it's smart to start with a slow pace until it shows what it really is, and we have a forced ending, but at the end it's a bit of a cliché. We have the story of a crew of six astronauts who collect and analyze a microscopic life analysis of Mars, until it begins to develop ... yes, we have seen before, and in a much better way. Technically the film does not dislike, as everything is a copy of a copy, we have an attempt to simulate something of ""2001 - an odyssey in space"" and to use angles of ""Gravity"", but in a way inferior, but that visually pleases , And we are very careful in the details, and the direction of art is effective, even if the whole style is reused, it is well reused, and the director has some whim, at least in that, we have a soundtrack that tries to be epic and pass a Feeling, but it fails completely. Making a broader philosophy about life, the film leaves a lot to be desired, because it creates a scope of who will debate the theme, and in the end becomes a blockbuster. We do not have any relevant acting, nor does Jake Gyllenhaal save here, despite fulfilling his role. What does not let the film be a waste of time is its direction, despite being copied from other films, it is a good copy -Technically-, it does not impress, it does not bother and it amuses a lot."

"danielharden","7","2","7","17 April 2017"," Alien Appetiser
","In the same year as Ridley Scott's official return to the Alien franchise since 1979 (Prometheus wasn't really an Alien movie more a teaser for one), we are given another Alien vs astronauts, Sci Fi horror film from the director of Safe House, the screenwriters of Zombieland and Deadpool, as well as starring Deadpool himself, Ryan Reynolds, and one of the best working actors today, Jake Gyllenhaal. Life is about a group of astronauts that discover alien life, but as it turns out they don't 'come in peace' and now it's a fight for survival. The film is a fun genre thrill ride but doesn't offer anything new to the genre pioneered by Ridley Scott's Alien (1979).<br/><br/>The most enjoyable aspect of this film by far is its genre thrills. The film takes the claustrophobic space horror genre and does it justice. The films sinister tone and nail biting tension are created effectively and there are some decent scares in this film. The film takes its genres formula and uses that formula effectively to create what is a very enjoyable sci fi horror genre film. The film also looks gorgeous, the visual effects are beautiful and the cinematography is OK albeit a little sea sickening with the upside down low gravity scenes. So on a consumer level, this film is good, it looks great and uses a winning formula effectively. The film is also well acted by its whole cast. No one really stands out, Rebecca Ferguson was good, Ryan Reynolds was Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal is good, but isn't on his A game here. But overall there is little to fault the actors on in this film.<br/><br/>Now, what frustrated me with this film was it's ending. I really enjoyed it and thought it was a really good twist, but unfortunately for me it was ruined by a particular fan theory circulating this film. The theory is that this film is the origin story for the upcoming Venom movie. I still love the films ending but having that theory in mind I found myself predicting the films final moments minutes before they happened. I believe the Venom theory to be false and that this is an original standalone film, and the fact a Venom film is coming out is pure coincidence, but either way we will have to wait and see to find out if that was Sony's plan all along.<br/><br/>Also, the film could have tried to be more risky and original to make the film stand out and simply be better. As I said the film uses its genre very well but does nothing new for the trapped-in-space-with-a-malevolent-alien genre. This film is literally a retelling of Ridley Scott's Alien which I like to think I've made clear by the name dropping in my introduction. Character development could also be improved on, as it is attempted to an extent and works with some characters, such as Sho, but the majority of the cast are given little to no background information, and so later plot points had little impact.<br/><br/>Overall, Life is a fun and enjoyable genre film. With fun thrills, a decent cast and beautiful visuals, Life is a winning formula of sci fi horror. Character development could be improved upon and the film could be more risky, but Life acts as a nice appetiser for Ridley Scott's return to Alien with Alien Covenant."
"tinovalkki","7","2","7","10 April 2017"," Tries too hard to be next Alien, but fails...
","Life tries really hard to be next Alien. Life is not bad, but you hardly can compare it to classic like Alien. The biggest problem in the movie is monster itself. Found from Mars life form, which starts to kill space stations crew one by one. Everything is like in Alien, so what is wrong with it? Actually everything. Monster is too pretty to be horrified. It is too sleek and smooth and looks too digitally made, not scary at all. Besides the terror for crew is not grotesque enough. You hardly see blood and monster looks a little like octopus, too cute to be scary. It might sound corny, but in these days when you find many TV shows more graphic and violent, monster here and it's ways to kill staff is too sleek. Besides the international space station feels too big and doesn't feel any claustrophobia at all, like space craft in Alien.<br/><br/>Still Life is not too bad at all. It's visuality is stunning camera run is breathtaking. It is too bad that this movie is not in 3D format. Space station looks quite realistic and spacewalk are very enjoyable to look. Even though Life is quite OK space monster movie, it hardy can compare classics like Alien. In some parts story starts to meander and fumble, but script is good enough to tighten the story back to basic. The end of the movie is more funny than scary. After all Life is quite descent space monster movie and it leaves great expectations for Alien Covenant movie. Hopefully at May we can enjoy great space horror flick, when Alien Covenant get it's release world wide."
"dromasca","7","2","7","6 April 2017"," 'If All Goes Wrong'
","The once very popular Murphy's Law was stating 'Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.' The practical application of the saying into the space horror genre seems to be director Daniel Espinosa's Life. What if the worst assumptions and the deepest fears related to the long expected contact with alien life become true? This seems to be the premises of the film, coupled with an execution which salutes famous predecessors like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Alien, but does it in a different dosage of the components adding a few of its own to be satisfying, interesting and thrilling.<br/><br/>The rules of fantastic fiction are well respected here as all starts in the familiar and thought-comfortable atmosphere of the space expedition returning from Mars and bringing back the first proof of alien life. Times Square fills with enthusiastic viewers of the life broadcast from the international space station where science mixes with trivia about food entering and exiting human body in no gravity conditions, and school kids give a household name ('Kevin') to the new form of life. It just happens that this very smart alien cell has the power to turn in a few minutes of screen time into a killing machine that will start devouring the crew whose mission of ensuring protection of Earth and life on the planet is in jeopardy, and gets suddenly much serious consequences.<br/><br/>For a serious science-fiction movie the script has huge holes and abounds in science gaffs, but this becomes secondary because of the good characters development. Quite unusual in the genre, we get to know the six astronauts, and when they start dying heroic but horrible deaths we already know and feel something for them. Good actors performance helps, with Jake Gyllenhaal excelling in his 'guy-we-care-about' routine. The sets also try something different, this space station has a lot of tubular corridors where the lack of gravity is induced to viewers by using camera position effects and the colors palette looks like the (dark) negative of the cool non-colors in Kubrick's film. I will not say more about the ending then stating that this was one of the most unexpected and unsettling movie ends that I have seen lately. One more good reason not to miss this film, especially if you like science-fiction and horror."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","7","4 April 2017"," Alien + Gravity - Everything That Made Them Great = Life
","There isn't much wrong with what Life aspires to be. It borrows an already existing template to tread a well-worn path, features a clichéd set of characters with base-level characterizations, makes fine use of tension & suspense, unfolds at a consistent pace throughout its runtime, and manages to be quite engaging despite its highly predictable storyline. But it's far from a great film.<br/><br/>The story of Life follows a six-member crew aboard the International Space Station who intercept a space probe returning from Mars with soil samples that could provide the first ever evidence of life beyond Earth. On studying the sample, they discover a dormant single-celled life form that quickly evolves into a multi-celled organism and proves to be far more intelligent than they anticipated.<br/><br/>Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Life brings nothing new to the screen and is derived from numerous existing & much superior examples. The movie's plot outline is lifted from Ridley Scott's Alien, its camera-work is inspired from Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, and the scripted people inhabiting its tale are a result of a lack of imagination. Espinosa's direction is good, for he manages to make its dull plot at least a bit interesting.<br/><br/>Its poorly written screenplay uses the hackneyed formula for the plot and doesn't even attempt to add something that would make its characters compelling on some level. They are supposed to be astronauts yet the stupid decisions they keep making throughout the movie is astonishing. It's just Rebecca Ferguson's character who showcases some sort of common sense while the remaining crew is too bland to be worthy of any emotional investment.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are well executed. Production design team recreates the International Space Station in splendid detail and the zero gravity ambiance is convincingly portrayed. Cinematography makes fab use of the camera, opening with a long, unbroken & single-take scene and encapsulates the whole picture with a claustrophobic aura. Editing provides a steady pace and keeps everything firmly stacked, and its intermittently rousing score has an overpowering feel to it.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Life features a star-studded cast in Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson, Hiroyuki Sanada, Ariyon Bakare & Olga Dihovichnaya amongst whom Ferguson manages to impress, that too in bits n pieces. Gyllenhaal could've done a lot more had there been more meat on his character's arc. Reynolds is there to play himself and does it without hassle. But the alien happens to exhibit more attributes than all the humans present at ISS combined.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Life is marred by numerous shortcomings and is severely lacking in originality but it still makes up for an adequate sci-fi horror that's quite enjoyable & moderately entertaining. The available resources are expertly utilized by Espinosa, the thrilling moments keep surfacing at regular intervals, and it is well aware of its limitations but there was still room for improvement, for the movie never really takes advantage of its R-rating, is filled with cringeworthy dialogues, and wraps itself up with an ending that it thinks is clever but is actually as trite as it is irrelevant."

","It's an aggravating watch.<br/><br/>Visually it looked clean, nothing spectacular, nothing unique about direction. It didn't give away the entire plot by means of the trailer. I thought the trailer made the film much better than it was.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film assumes moviegoers have never seen a film about humans who travel to space and discover extraterrestrial life. AKA ""the disaster in space movie with aliens"" with: established quarantines, protocols, space suits, evacuation procedures, ship designs, etc. It doesn't raise the bar form other films in the genre, it lowers it. It could have been a novel-ish story. Instead, the plot was driven by characters who were blissfully unprepared and glaringly incompetent. As in, ""There is no way in hell anyone could send you to space"" incompetent.<br/><br/>At least the captain wasn't incinerated by their life support pod in the first five minutes of the film. I mean that'd be tantamount to somebody engineering an airbag to deploy under your car seat in an accident. Kerrr-plunk! But, really that's what this movie was - being stuck in a car with a driver on the verge of a catastrophic accident.<br/><br/>""I don't NEED turn signals.""
""I don't HAVE to speed up to merge onto the highway. ""
""I only listen to AM radio.""
""I don't HAVE to get the money out for the toll yet, Hey what's up! How are you today? Hold on...""

"paul-allaer","7","2","7","31 March 2017"," Where ""Alien"" meets ""Gravity"": thoroughly entertaining
","""Life"" (2017 release; 103 min.) brings the story of a 6 person crew on the International Space Station. As the movie opens, we see the crew getting ready to intercept a capsule flying through space. The capsule contains samples retrieved from Mars. Having caught the capsule successfully (which is filmed in one long shot, just beautiful), we get to know the crew, with members from the US, the UK, Russia and Japan. The British biologist finds there is life in one of the samples, and he nourishes it, and even giving it a nickname (Calvin). But alas, things don't always look what they seem, and before we know it, trouble is brewing... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to reveal more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie is directed by up-and-coming Swedish director Daniel Espinoza. If you have seen the movie's trailer (which has been hard to escape in recent weeks), you know exactly what to expect. In essence this is a mash-up of where ""Alien"" meets ""Gravity"", the latter due to the spectacular in and around the ISS and space. The real question hence is: how does the movie measure up relative to the ""trapped in space"" genre? I am happy to tell you that the movie measures up very nicely, thank you. Almost from the get-go, tension is palpable and I found myself screaming out loud and even looking away from the screen a couple of times. When that happens, you know the movie is getting to you, in the best possible way. There are just enough plot twists to keep the action going quasi non-stop. Jake Gyllenhaal as the senior medical officer who is starting his record-breaking 473rd consecutive day in space (""I like it up here!"", he says) leads the cast. Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson is yin to Gyllenhaal's yang. Ryan Reynolds as the ISS pilot has a much smaller role. Last but certainly not least, Swedish composer Jon Ekstrand (who has scored several of Espinoza's earlier movies) delivers an excellent orchestral score that matches the film perfectly.<br/><br/>""Life"" opened wide a few weekends ago and has done okay at the box office, although for a movie of this caliber (and budget) with this cast, it certainly feels like it should've done much better. Cut-throat competition from higher profile movies like Beauty and the Beast, Kong: Skull Island, Power Rangers and now Ghost in the Shell certainly isn't helping. I can only say that I was more than pleased, and thoroughly enjoyed ""Life"" for what it was. I'd readily recommend you check this out, be it in the theater, VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
"jamesidf","5","2","7","30 March 2017"," No Life in this Movie
","Before I describe what treachery this movie was, I will explain the rating. After reading why, the rating will make sense.<br/><br/>3 points for the acting, the acting was pretty good, better than average. The problem was the director. The director did not give the certain feel for the movie. For example, everybody played their part excellent, but knowing Jake G. was one of the last survivors, the movie directing did not give him a chance for us, the watchers, to relate or even care for his side (or the other British lady whom I forgot her name).<br/><br/>1 point for the CGI. We all know CGI tends to ruin movies, and when it comes to alien movies, I don't mind the CGI, but it did feel like the alien came with perks that was not abiding common sense. For example, they claim to have caught this life form from Mars, which is the reason why Mars went extinct. If Mars was extinct, what was keeping the life form living on Mars if the cast in the movie claims that the life form needs oxygen, heat, water and food just like any other carbon based life form? 1 point for the plot, or transition with the story. The plot could of been changed or routed a lot better. For example, the ending was predictable in different situations. It starts to get predictable when Sho temporarily locks himself in the pod, and after that.<br/><br/>Total = 5 points.<br/><br/>What could of gave this movie another 5 points? The twist at the end was predictable of Jake showing how he cared about himself, or living for that matter. The British lady who got tricked into going to space got what she wanted, even though tricked, she still seemed to scream, cry and express her feelings. Even though it could be human instinct, it raises questions.<br/><br/>If you're trying to look for a movie with a good meaning behind it, or even a nice twist that would be hard to predict, stay away from this movie. Don't give ""life"" to this."

","There is some good suspense, but the plot could have been presented in a more credible and realistic way. The main characters are often acting annoyingly unprofessional, which feels very out of place considering they are supposed to be ISS crew. It is perhaps done like this to give more headroom for giving characters more personality traits, as i can see how a disciplined and professional acting crew could become a bit impersonal and sterile. Except perhaps for the characters ""Sho"", the characters are pretty dull anyway, so I would have preferred more realism, which would also have made it scarier (which is the whole purpose of a horror film). The protagonist could have been made a more realistic without jeopardising the plot as well, but I guess that logic and horror are not always easy to unite.<br/><br/>In short, ""Life"" is not terrible, but its by no means a classic and is instantly forgotten."

This atmosphere encapsulates the movie in its entirety, and it makes the experience all the more enjoyable. The performances across the board are also really good. I'll talk more about the characters themselves, but the performances by the actors are very good. Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Rebecca Ferguson, and Hiroyuki Sanada all delivered, though I was expecting them to be good. I was surprised with how good Olga Dihovichnaya and Ariyon Bakare were, simply because I haven't really seen them on screen before. They were really good in this movie, and I enjoyed them quite a bit. The wire work in this film cannot be praised enough!

"aharmas","8","2","7","26 March 2017"," Destroyer of Worlds
","""Alien"" is nearly 40 years old. It was such innovative and strong idea, both visually and as a concept that it has spawned a few sequels and prequels. Some came close to the originals; others were interesting ideas that weren't fully developed. ""Life"" arrives, clearly inspired by the ""Alien"" franchise. The best it can offer is an interesting and formidable new species, not as striking as the ""Alien"" monsters, yet it is quite a unstoppable force, and it doesn't give the crew much of a chance to fight back.<br/><br/>It becomes clear from the beginning that providing a source of nutrients and energy to the ""martian"" is probably not a good idea. It soon becomes apparent that these scientists were not prepared to deal with an experiment of the kind. Many theories are discussed, and one can see a few of the members of the crew dream of instant fame. It never occurs to anyone that the new passenger might have an agenda of its own.<br/><br/>""Calvin"" grows fast, adapts easily, and develops a taste for killing anything that might be a block to its survival. Although it never says a word or tries to communicate, the message is clear: You don't have a chance because I'm deadly and quite smart. The lesson to be learned is that you'd better leave what you don't understand alone.<br/><br/>The creature is not the most impressive when one finally gets to see it. It might be a little too beautiful to inspire terror. Its actions show otherwise, and suspense is effectively shown with the editing and lighting of the sets. It helps that Reynolds and the rest of the cast give believable performances, but something is missing. Yes, there's a threat, there is a nasty being, and the odds don't look too good for any of the humans aboard the ship. What's lacking is the sense of mystery and raw fear we had in the source of inspiration. No one knew what was going on. The goal was to survive, but dark passages and something that looks like it came straight from hell really sent shivers down everybody's spine. Through all its growth stages, one didn't want to think of anything else but survival. There were no technical or scientific explanations. One attacked, and the others ran for as long as they could.<br/><br/>In ""Life"", this life form is clearly misunderstood, even in its early stages. There are moments where logic disappeared. Other stories have shown that we fear even the smallest of beings, with viruses coming to mind. Why are the doctors so blind to taking the necessary precautions to deal with ""Calvin"" when it begins to show signs of maladjustment? Everyone seems to forget that poking any unknown creature might most likely result in some aggressive reaction.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, but it is dark, and one never feels completely engaged by anyone in the crew. Somehow we can't relate to people who haven't really defined or understood the basic rules of life's development. Did they ever read Darwin? It's best to turn off your mind and be ready for two hours of illogical but thrilling fun."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: C+ <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Life disappoints.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Life can be quite deadly as a group of astronauts discover in this typical sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>No one may hear a scream in outer space. But in Daniel Espinoso's well-crafted Life, the latest sci-fi horror film which follows that successful Alien formula, you do hear, with added certainty, an annoyingly loud music score that regularly blasts its notes to warn of impending doom. Six internationally diverse NASA professionals find life amid the soil samples from Mars. As this multi-celled organism begins to take form, so does the predictability of this film. It's par for the course, that the trained astronauts grow dumb and dumber while our little plant monster (affectionately named Calvin) grows stronger and bigger. There's no account that there will be room for human error on the screen. Dinner will be served soon enough!<br/><br/>However, the behind-the-scenes human talent have made a technically strong film. One can definitely observe that the filmmakers took a more intellectual and earnest approach to this genre with their willingness to spend more time with the characters and setting before the initial scares begin. Shamus McGarvey's fluid camera-work is above reproach as is Nigel Phelp's production design. Mr. Espinoso's direction builds some nice tension too. <br/><br/>But the script is a mere clone with its ""been there / done that"" formula. It's not that Life's screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is lifeless...it's just redundant and unexciting in its lack of imagination. It's not as if the writers don't try to create compelling characters by establishing background exposition on the six astronauts aboard. And there is some nice sleight-of-hand moments in the film's climax. But all that skill cannot disguise the simplistic plot mechanisms so intrinsic with the sci-fi nature of its origins.<br/><br/>Life begins as a serious film odyssey about space exploration before it take the rote route into the horror genre and settles into a standard monster flick to see who gets offed next and how gruesome the death can be. The monster itself isn't very scary. It's not hideous or creepy, with its octopoid tentacles and jellyfish form undulating quite gracefully before lunging at its helpless victims.<br/><br/>The actors (or human entrees) along for the ride are an impressive group of performers who have done much better in other outings but are saddled here with stock characters caught in a familiar plot, no matter have solidly Mr. Espinoso directs them. They are: Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, and lesser known actors as Olga Dihovichnaya, Hiroyuki Sabada, and Ariyon Bakare, all rounding out the sextet of space travelers.<br/><br/>To summarize: Calvin is actually Audrey III of Outer Space, a toothless, less terrifying creature that preys on other lifeforms. Its appetite may be insatiable but moviegoers should take heed of this simplistic horror film with its cheap thrills and gory kills. As the saying goes, Life can be full of disappointments."

","Another hit and miss big studio attempt to hardcore sci-fi (Gravity, Interstellar, Arrival), by my opinion the best of the three. What stands out are the mostly likable characters, almost believable as scientists. <br/><br/>The good side: The story takes place on ISS in close future, the sets are very good and the movement around the station looks very realistic. SPOILER: The story soon becomes an Alien clone, but so far the best I have seen. In comparison to, lets say, Prometheus, where there is also a group of scientists slashed by a monster, in this case you can at least care for some characters. BIG SPOILER: The ending is not happy by any means, which is at least interesting and bold (or maybe an attempt to milk the trend of dark movies?). <br/><br/>Bad side (I tried to avoid a list, but anyway here it goes):<br/><br/>1. The alien design is cool, but it looks and moves (unintentionally) funny in some shots - it somewhat resembles cartoon animation of that starfish friend of SpongeBob. The monster is most effective in scenes where it is only partially seen or not seen at all (breaking fingers, the pilot death in lab)<br/><br/>2. The editing seems sometimes confusing, the important plot elements are easy to miss (How many entities there was on the station? At least two I guess? The biologist tried to hide the alien on purpose, or he could not feel it because of his condition? What happened with the shuttles at the end, was the plan thwarted by the alien accidentally or on purpose etc.)<br/><br/>3. The last man and woman standing are the most underdeveloped characters. <br/><br/>The movie is worth seeing, it was a pleasant surprise. Just do not expect any milestones in storytelling."

","Not to confused with the great Sir David Attenborough documentary series, or the catchy song by Des'ree, from the one or two trailers I saw this looked like a new Alien style, a scary movie in space, I was looking to what it had it to offer, directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Child 44). Basically six multinational astronauts are aboard the International Space Station (ISS): American senior medical officer Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), British Quarantine Officer Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), American pilot and engineer Rory ""Roy"" Adams (Ryan Reynolds), Japanese system engineer Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), British biologist Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), and Russian mission commander Katerina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya). The crew have successfully captured a space probe returning from Mars with a soil sample, they are tasked with studying the sample, which could contain and prove the first evidence of extraterrestrial life. The crew determines that the sample contains a large, single-celled organism, the first example of life beyond Earth, Hugh is able to revive the dormant organism with atmospheric adjustments and glucose, it grows quickly, the organism is Calvin named by school children in America. An atmospheric accident in the lab causes Calvin to become dormant, Hugh attempts to revive Calvin with a mild electric shock, Calvin reanimates, but becomes hostile and escapes the containment cube into the room with Hugh. Calvin devours a lab rat and immediately evolves and grows in size, Rory enters and rescues Hugh, but Calvin latches onto him, David locks him inside to keep Calvin in containment, Rory attempts to attack the organism with fire, but it is resilient, Calvin forces its way into Rory's mouth, killing him from the inside. Calvin emerges once again evolved and even larger, then manages to escape from the room through an emergency fire suppression vent, Hugh believes the lack of breathable air on Mars is what must have kept Calvin dormant. With communication cut off from Earth, Katerina performs a space walk to fix the antenna, Calvin has consumed coolant as nutrition, it escapes through a valve on the antenna, then attacks Katerina, her suit coolant system is ruptured, she effectively drowns inside her suit. Calvin attempts to reenter the station through the thrusters, the attempts to stop Calvin result in the ISS entering a decaying orbit, Sho informs the crew they need to use the remaining fuel to go back into a standard orbit. But this would mean allowing Calvin back in, but they formulate a plan to seal themselves into one module, and to vent the atmosphere into the rest of the station to make the organism dormant. Hugh suddenly has a cardiac arrest, he is resuscitated, but Calvin had attached itself to his leg and was feeding off him, he is now paralysed, Calvin is now a much large tentacled creature, it attacks the remaining crew. Cho seals himself in a sleeping cabin pod, Calvin tries to break the glass to get to him, Miranda and David realise the creature has ingested a tracker from Hugh's suit, they track it, using Hugh's body as bait, they lure Calvin away from Sho and trap in an area to deprive it of oxygen. Earth Control received the SOS call from the ISS, they have sent a Soyuz capsule, to push the station into deep space to prevent any possible danger, Sho presumes it is a rescue attempt, he rushes to board the arriving ship, as soon as he opens the hatch, Calvin attacks him and the Soyuz crew. Sho's actions cause a docking breach, resulting in detachment of the capsule, this spirals back and crashes into the ISS, temperature and oxygen levels are dropping rapidly. The only survivors, David and Miranda, realise that the decaying orbit will mean re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, aware Calvin could possibly survive re-entry, they plan to use the two remaining escape pods programmed to auto-pilot towards Earth, David will sacrifice himself to lure Calvin into one pod to fly into outer space, while Miranda will return to Earth. David leads Calvin into his pod and launches it into space as Miranda launches hers, her pod is hit by debris and knocked off course, while David is attacked by Calvin and struggles to send his pod into outer space, the two pods then divert. The earthbound pod performs a controlled re-entry and lands in the ocean, near two Vietnamese fishermen from Hạ Long Bay, but as they approach, it is revealed it is David's pod, he is encased in a web- like substance, while Miranda's navigation system has failed and she screams in horror as she drifts into outer space, David is still alive and tries to warn the men not to attempt a rescue, they open the door and more fishing boats arrive, the screen fades to black. Also starring Alexander Nguyen as 1st Fisherman and Hiu Woong-Sin as 2nd Fisherman. The cast all do their parts well, it is indeed very similar to Alien, people trapped in space with an unwanted inhuman visitor that is indestructible and will kill them one by one, it is not that original, but there are plenty of easy to swallow thrills and tension to entertain, and the twist ending is disturbing, a worthwhile science-fiction thriller. Good!"

","The deadly extraterrestrial franchise has been capitalised heavily since the introduction of CGI. However this has a tendency to come with low risk plots that involve some sort of deux ex machina.<br/><br/>Life on the other hand shows a struggle for survival, the kind that you would find in the Alien franchise. The physiology of the creature in this movie is unique enough to satisfy the curiosity felt as we see the story develop, a welcome change. <br/><br/>I liked the movie as a whole but I feel it sins in a few places. *SPOILER*****SPOILER*****SPOILER*****SPOILER*****SPOILER*****SPOILER * At 34:30 we see the creature devour a rat in seconds, after this Deadpool, erm I mean Ryan Reynolds steps in to rescue his buddy. This was impulsive a trait astronauts are not known for. <br/><br/>The creature wraps itself around him at 34:57. Now seeing the attack on Ariyon Bakare who plays Hugh Derry and what he was doing to it at the time it would have been more reasonable for Rory to not try to hurt it. After all it attacked the rat which was a much harder target to get to than Hugh. (They did not try to contact mission control yet)<br/><br/>Rory could also have used the flame-thrower to defend him while he escaped the room.<br/><br/>The contingency plan put in place if there were a breach had a rocket propel the ISS into deep space. This ended up pushing the ISS into the atmosphere due to 'fucked up thrusting'. This doesn't make much sense. If they were going to push them into deep space why would they fire the rockets retrograde? If they couldn't use this docked rocket to turn the ISS then they could have waited an hour or two and the ISS would be pointed in a different relative direction.<br/><br/>I have a few others but they're really just me being nit picky. This film is in my top 20 Sci-fi films, I hope you enjoyed it too."

","I watched this movie on Amazon Prime and logged on here to read what others are saying and I guess people mostly have similar opinions. This was bad Alien wannabe with horrible plot and mediocre acting. Is it possible that humanity would send such stupid humans to ISS? This is insult to real astronauts up there. Everything every astronauts do here are questionable, off protocol decisions even kids wouldn't make. They wouldn't allow the guy in the beginning out of the lab because he had a contact with the alien but towards the end, they would try to save the Japanese guy with the alien on his leg??? Who's wrote this garbage? Story line was not only bad but also was very predictable. My wife questioned if I watched this movie before because I was predicting everything that would happen next, even the cheesy twist at the end. I didn't know anything could be worse than Gravity but this movie pulled it off."

"cammymadden","8","2","8","1 June 2017"," Exactly what you expect...but not in a bad way!
","Contains Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>So I hadn't really heard or seen anything about the film Life other than it was pretty good and was a sci-fi film. So I was pretty open minded going into it which is hard to do considering the rate at which they are pumping out sci-fi movies these days...just when you thought the superhero genre was being milked dry...<br/><br/>Anyway, as my summary states: Life is exactly what you expect it to be but not in a bad way. This isn't the first film and it won't be the last to adopt the idea of a space crew who find something that then tries to kill them. Even the ""twists"" in this film are about as predicable as the phases of the moon's cycle! <br/><br/>That being said, the acting in this film (with a couple of exceptions) is pretty spot on! The special effects are very good and while the storyline itself is wildly overplayed, the excitement and tension still manage to be raised to a pretty high standard. <br/><br/>I found one thing that this film did very well was make me feel uncomfortable. Whenever you watch a film with bugs and you get that feeling of something crawling on you. Imagine that but rather than a bug it's an alien species. The death scenes are brutal and add to the sense of discomfort I felt by watching this film (in comparison I can watch the Saw films while eating food and not remotely feel put off). <br/><br/>I'd say if you've come looking for the next Interstellar then you should keep looking...but if you enjoyed Alien (or the millions of sequels/prequels) or Sunshine or any of these sort of films then you should definitely give this one a go."

","I saw the posters and the name and I thought ""I must see this film"". Never have I been so wrong. First of all it's almost a copy of ""Alien"" but without the craftsmanship that made ""Alien"" a classic. But unlike ""Alien"" this movie has an obvious agenda. Science does not know what its doing and will destroy us all. And of course this will be true if scientists were idiots like the ones portrayed in this ""film"". Every second of the film is utter garbage so I can't go over it all. I would recommend seeing it though to get a perspective where cinema is going. So many genius books are waiting to be adapted to film. And instead a director filmed himself taking a s**t after having rotten sea food."

This proved to be a good choice.<br/><br/>The film was tremendous and takes alien life to a whole new level of terror. Try to watch the film without too much critical thought process and enjoy it for what it is, something a lot of the IMDb raters simply cannot do because they nitpick every little possible flaw rather than sit there and be entertained for 90minutes.<br/><br/>Fantastic story with a really great cast.<br/><br/>The search for alien life succeeds as close as Mars when a single cell is re-animated. Evolution of the organism happens quickly and at pace to get the film moving in the first 25minutes. The remainder of the film is an edge of the seat roller-coaster ride through space. Exceptional creativity into how the alien works and starts to think, ultimately trying to survive in it's new environment, which makes this an even more terrifying prospect than 'Alien' itself.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the naysayers, they would call the greatest film dull just to be controversial, this is a quite simply an outstanding film. Superb acting, great CGI and sensational all round cinema viewing.<br/><br/>Go watch it, you won't be disappointed."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","2","8","31 March 2017"," Alien meets Gravity
","A good film that pays tribute to quite a few classics of the Science Fiction genre. The topic itself is nothing new although a plot about ""not so nice"" life discovery on Mars is intriguing. The concept itself is really old but still effective as this film proved as it had me on the edge of my seat quite a few times. The cast was good enough although the performances were nothing special apart from Ariyon Bakare who is easily the standout. I wasn't a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal here. He rather sleepwalked through the film and seemed to be rather bored with his underdeveloped character. One of the few times he really felt out of place. Rebecca Furgeson was all right but also she can do much better. Ryan Reynolds tried too hard to be the comedic relief, it did not work the whole time. I did like Hiroyuki Sanada tho. The direction by Daniel Espinosa was good enough with some inspired shots. I loved the score which added a lot to the thrills of he film. Effects and action scenes were great. The atmosphere indeed reminded you on ""Alien"" the movie it primarily refers to. I really would not mind a sequel at all."
"ericrnolan","8","2","8","30 March 2017"," ""Life's"" a bitch.
","Or at least it is to the astronauts who make an abortive attempt to escort it back to Earth. (They realize that bringing a Martian organism home is a bad idea in this year's surprisingly satisfying science fiction-thriller.)<br/><br/>I actually had more fun with this than I expected; the movie is much faster paced and scarier than the trailer made it look. There are some real surprises and moments of genuine horror here, following a requisite plot setup that is relatively brief. It's a really nice monster movie that should please fans of the genre.<br/><br/>I actually didn't prefer its ending, which is something for which other reviewers are praising it a lot. I'm disinclined to say more, for fear of spoilers. The movie's marketing already spoiled enough. (The ads infuriatingly show the fate of a main character.)<br/><br/>I will say what the movie is not, however.<br/><br/>One, it's not a stealth prequel for Sony's planned 2018 ""Spider-Man"" spin off, ""Venom"" (though that's such a clever idea, I wish I'd thought of it).<br/><br/>Two, it's not a ripoff of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979). Yes, it's got the same MacGuffin, and some story parallels that I noticed early on. But I like to think of this as a more grounded contemporary thriller, where ""Alien"" was a futuristic fantasy creature feature. Besides, if we criticize every ""haunted-house-in- space"" movie as an ""Alien"" imitator, we won't get more of them.<br/><br/>I'd give this an 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend it."
"Solnichka","8","2","8","30 March 2017"," Just like ALIEN, but with a significant scientific dilemma
","The plot is really just an update of ""Alien"", although the film is presented nicely for a 21st-century audience. The special effects are nice, but the characters are somewhat undeveloped, due to the short running time of the film. What's first and foremost is an idea that the ""Alien"" series never touched upon until its fourth film. That drives the second part of this movie and makes it unique in terms of the ""Alien"" concept. Rebecca Ferguson is somewhat wasted in this role, and Ryan Reynolds is wasted, too. So, what about the dilemma? In our scientific rush to find life beyond Earth, do we take enough precaution? Can we even pretend to understand life itself, on Earth or out in space? Unanswered questions, for sure, and perhaps the film could have explored them more deeply. That being said, the whole film is slightly underdeveloped (characterization, especially), and that is its biggest flaw. All in all, though, quite entertaining for a space-horror film. The first three deaths are particularly grizzly. Be warned."

","Six members of the International Space Station, bring back with them what appears to be the first confirmation of living existence on Mars. They name it ""Calvin"" and attempt to call it that at every turn (I found this really annoying). ""Calvin"" after being awoken with electric shock therapy (not a good idea), turns on said members and is bent towards slaying them one by one. This leech-like creature can survive in any environment and its growth spurt is indeed rapid. As one biologist from the agog crew states, ""it doesn't hate any human but it needs to kill to survive."" How reassuring.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's the gist of 2017's Life, my latest review. Minus a happy ending (it's the antithesis to 2013's Gravity) and containing traumatizing ways in which space workers die, Life is a Twilight Zone nightmare and an effective one at that. It's the type of trepidation you tell your friends about after you leave the theater shaken like a Vesper Martini.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds co-stars in Life. I've never been a huge fan of his so I was happily surprised when Ryan's character was the first one to perish in outer space (spoiler alert). I can always do without his smarmy personality. On the other end of the spectrum, there's Jake Gyllenhaal. Although I haven't seen every Gyllenhaal movie, the ones I have seen him in are all recommendable. Truth be told, he's one of the best actors in the business. Jake also co-stars in Life. Yeah, it's one of this year's best films.<br/><br/>So hey, Life is good. No I'm not talking about life itself, I'm talking about the darn movie. Critics have been calling it a retread of Alien. Allow me to retort. Life is an unsettling, sci-fi horror film that stands on its own. It doesn't need to be compared to Ridley Scott's 1979 megahit. Now granted, Ridley is gearing up for a resurgence in the Alien franchise titled, Alien: Covenant. Life, with its nasty life form looking a starfish from hell and then growing into a badass serpent, will aptly bide time with science fiction enthusiasts. Originally slated to be released in May, it makes sense that Life got moved back to this month. I mean why should there be a need to compete with ""Covenant"" and a legend like Scott.<br/><br/>Tentacle alien species and slight movie plagiarism aside, Life is directed by Swedish filmmaker Daniel Espinosa. Remember his 2012 release Safe House? I do and this is a heck of a lot better. Espinosa does a bang-up job with Life, creating an outer atmosphere in which fervent fear and mission failure are inevitable. The script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, requires the crew members in Life to eventually lose all radio communication with planet Earth. I know it's a sci-fi thriller clichÃ© but that notion is still very unsettling.<br/><br/>Getting back to director Espinosa. He opens the film via a single continuous shot for the ages, letting his camera follow troupers with the impulse of zero gravity lingering. He then infuses lots of actor close-ups during Life's brisk, 103-minute running time. Not going too overboard with the required, space probe gimmickry, Mr. Espinosa moves the proceedings along, giving Life ratcheting tension right from the 30-minute mark. With a modest budget of $58 million, Life doesn't lack originality (as mentioned earlier). Instead, it reinvents it adding panache to the sci-fi genre cesspool. Bottom line: Life is a real winner. Again, I'm talking about the dang movie. Natch. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
"DreadfulA","8","2","8","27 March 2017"," A dark scifi thriller that relieves the angst of waiting Alien Covenant
","I went to see Life with little expectations, mostly because recent movies (scifi or not) had been huge disappointments. But I was gladly surprised how well Life hit me with its dark atmosphere, well executed scare tactics and brutal elements. Finally someone understood what the basic fundamentals of a good scifi-horror are. Good job.<br/><br/>Some complained about bland characters and their unprofessional behaviour, but none of it really disturb me too much. At least it didn't reach the level of stupidity seen in Prometheus where character flaws and their illogical choices affected the plot and nearly ruined the experience.<br/><br/>My complain mainly concerns the alien character. At first it was cute, slimy, singlecell creature developing into a large, multicell organism called ""Calvin"", that reminded too much of the tentacle/facehugger creature in Prometheus. In addition its every cell was supposed to be able to sense, move and perceive surroundings independently while still working perfectly together with each cell creating a sort of huge neural network with immense physical muscle power (as seen later in the movie). The crew's mistake was to underestimate its intelligence and strength and treat it like a simple singlecell organism. It was strong enough to survive harsh conditions unlike humans. In that regard, Calvin was truly a new, alien lifeform. Creature designers probably overstated its strength, though, as it was able to resist fire, cold, lack of oxygen and even vacuum while still being based on carbon. The organism was said to be hibernating on Mars when it was found. But why, when it could survive so well in the vacuum of space? Mars has atmosphere, gravity, water ice and sunlight (heat). Only thing lacking is oxygen. Maybe it needed oxygen and Earth-like temp to grow into more mature form. Who knows. And why did it need to have a face if it could sense indirect? Probably so that it could stare at the human characters menacingly. Unnecessary feature if you ask me and not scary.<br/><br/>Couple plot holes: This movie was probably not endorsed by Nasa, because the logo in the space suit was not accurate. Also, why was Nasa (or some other organisation behind the space program) willing to get rid of the space station so light-heartedly, as it was clearly pointed out to have cost 200 billion USD? Did Russia and China and everyone involved really agree? Considering, that on Earth they didn't know exactly what was going on because of communication failure.<br/><br/>The best part was probably the ending. Although it had a predictable plot twist I was satisfied with the choice. Next I'm waiting to see Alien Covenant. I expect it to surpass Life, or at least get rid of the stupidity that ailed Prometheus."

","I'm surprised at the number of harsh reviews for this tight little film. Perhaps in part because I suffered through the big budget total mess that is Independence Day Resurgence the night before, I really appreciated the tension and scripting and acting in LIFE. I liked it so much the first thing I did after the film was check IMDb for the director's info so I could be on the lookout for future films.<br/><br/>It's not without flaws. It's become a trope for scientists in films to breach what one thinks must be protocol and become emotionally involved at their own peril. My husband, for example, was appalled that the lab scientist electrically stimulated ""Calvin"" starting the entire downward spiral. Confronted with an epic scientific discovery - the first new life, I completely understand taking any action to keep it alive.<br/><br/>And folks have already expressed irritation with the lack of a good containment area. I agree there should have been more fail safes.<br/><br/>But ultimately, we're dealing with people in an extraordinary situation who have been aboard the space station long enough to develop strong emotional bonds. Might they make errors in judgment to save their friends? How difficult is it to sacrifice yourself immediately for the possibility of removing a life form from the ship? <br/><br/>I was on board and didn't find any of the scripting or actions unbelievable. <br/><br/>And again, it's very well acted and the special effects are beautiful.<br/><br/>Very hard to find a smart horror or science fiction film these days and I appreciated this one a lot. <br/><br/>Can't wait to see your next film, Daniel Espinosa!"

And while I'm sure people will immediately jump to the Alien comparisons due to the trailer, I thought of a lot of different sci-fi movies that I'm sure the writers behind Zombieland (a much better take-off, and funnier, than this film by a mile), so in its first moments it calls to mind 2001, and some of the camaraderie of the people on the ship and their functions as various scientists and engineers and, well, Ryan Reynolds, was like Event Horizon at its most entertaining, and I'm sure some Gravity worked its way into the script as well (the outside space scenes, and how the ship looks and moves, feels very much in tune with filmmakers who saw that movie and, naturally, it takes some time to translate that phenomenon to a 'take' on that).<br/><br/>Now, this is for those who have seen the film (though I'll keep it spoiler free): I didn't like the ending, or I should say the final minute and what may be a denouement (the climax itself is thrilling and for a moment I thought Sony might make up for the wasted potential of their last sci-fi release, Passengers). It's not the spirit of it in and of itself, it's the execution of certain details of where actors are at a particular moment. It felt like it was a Shyamalanian-ish ""ooh, twist, gotcha"", only it leaves things as... I dunno. Empty, actually, and that the studio asked for two endings and tested both, and this one somehow wound up not testing *as* bad, so they went with this. It just left me feeling 'ugh' - though having ""Spirit in the Sky"" over the end credits feels like an extra cheeky kick in the groin.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie's alright as a straight-forward, very science-filled piece of science/action fiction (until it isn't, which is... half an hour in) with a capable and spot-on cast. Actually, because of the cast alone (especially Gyllenhaal,n Bakare as Hugh the scientist that sets off nearly all of what's to come in the film, and Rebecca Ferguson who gets more emotionally intense in the last reel) and that the movie *is* well-paced, I'll bump up its rating a tad. But it could have been more than it was."

","First of all i have to say that i'm a younger person so i'm not very familiar with the other alien movies. I can't say how much of this movie is original but i can say that if you are looking for a good suspenseful thriller this movie won't let you down. As you can imagine the acting is very good , the pace of the movie is excellent. The atmosphere of the movie feels very real. I had very low expectations because of the average reviews but this movie surprised me quite a bit. So i guess don't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece and you will be fine. There are maybe two negatives things though. First is that the movie is sometimes predictable (i guess). The second thing is that i feel like some characters are underdeveloped but that's about it.<br/><br/>Very decent movie and i think it's unique enough. B.G."

","A small team of astronauts on-board the International Space Station bite off more than they can chew when they are given the opportunity to analyze Mars soil samples. The samples hold the first incontrovertible proof of extraterrestrial life; made flesh by a multi-cellular organism they have dubbed Calvin. Among the crew are a mission leader (Dihovichnaya), a couple of pilots (Reynolds and Sanada), a biologist (Bakare), a doctor (Gyllenhaal) and a quarantine officer (Ferguson) all of whom find themselves at the mercy of the dangerous new life form which learns and grows with each encounter.<br/><br/>If the plot sounds familiar its because Life takes the high-concept of Alien (1979) and boils it down to its absolute essence; that being a slasher film taking place in the void of deep space. In that regard the film aptly capitalizes on its nihilistic themes complete with a creature design that resembles something out of H.P. Lovecraft. Our cast dwindles, their hopes of survival constantly dashed by an escalating barrage of set-pieces as the suspense slowly shifts from whether they will survive to whether we will.<br/><br/>The small ensemble cast does a worthwhile job with the characters their provided with. No one really gets an edge over the others, with the story using every moment of exposition dialogue to color their motivations. While it would have been nice if the movie had the economy of thought to translate that exposition into actual action, the downtime provided by people's bullet-point backgrounds actually provided a bit of breathing room.<br/><br/>Yet given the fact that the film tries so hard to ground its story in reality instead of the far-flung future of the Alien franchise (1979-Present), its easy to assume or expect more to Life than a B-movie with a big budget. I mean the film is called Life, a title that positively pounces on the screen the moment Bakare's biologist character prods his protozoic organism out of hibernation. He later muses that Calvin ""may even provide life's meaning.,"" a grandiose statement that comes across as just plain goofy.<br/><br/>The structure of the film really begins to strain as the film enters its third act. By then Calvin and the remaining crew are basically at the same IQ level, which is to say smart enough to open doors yet stupid enough to think hiding in a glass cage is a good idea. A last plot point is dropped, the results of which will either come across as blatant half-a**ed pot stirring or give less picky audience members reason to give off a collective shrug.<br/><br/>That in conjunction with its chintzy, undeserved Twilight Zone (1959-1964)-esque twist sinks Life to the point of being a just another marginally entertaining sci-fi horror that's riding on the coattails of its much better predecessor. If it simply kept its head down and delivered on its pulpy premise, it could have gotten away with being a zero-gravity throwback. But since the film hints at something more then never delivers on the goods, Life might just go the way of Mission to Mars (2000) and Sphere (1998)."

"havocnitzan","8","1","3","4 June 2019"," Compelling and suspenseful, incredible ending. Don't miss out on this one.
","If you're a Netflix subscriber and Horror fan, you're probably aware of the challenge of finding a worthy Horror film to watch. While the selection of foreign films is indeed impressive, English films are scarce and many of them turn out to be mediocre at best and forcing a conscious choice to lower one's expectations and standards. Wanting to watch a nice Horror film and not feeling like a foreign one - I've decided to try Life and definitely wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>As I'm sure you've already seen in a trailer or read in a summary, Life tells the story of a space mission to retrieve Martian land samples believed to be containing organic life forms. As expected, said organic life form turns out to be a lot more dangerous than initially perceived by the shuttle's crew, who find themselves forced to fight for survival. However, if you're thinking of a Dead Space, Alien or Starship Troopers scenario - stop right there. The ""alien"" is far less fantastic and nefarious and therefore a lot more convincing and authentic. It isn't a terrifying hunter, simply and organism fighting for its own survival and which turns out to be a lot more evolved and superior.<br/><br/>The characters are relatable and very likeable despite some pretty unimpressive acting and direction (except for Jake Gyllenhaal, who was incredible, and Ryan Reynolds, who proved beyond a doubt he's much more than an action-comedy actor. Very impressive, way to go Deadpool!). The setting is utterly discomforting due to it being so different and remote from mankind's natural habitat (you know, outer space, no gravity, no air and nowhere to run). However, the plot itself is the main attraction, as it's suspenseful and keeps you at the edge of your seats all the way to the end.<br/><br/>And speaking of the end - I'll say it right now, it counts for about 2-3 points in my rating. It's so simple and ""easy"" that at first it felt out of place and illogical, but a few second of thinking about it made everything fall into place. It's surprising, despairing and in every way terrible, leaving the audience with a very distinctive knot in their chests. In the Horror genre, combining such a twist with such a feeling (which definitely stays with you for a bit) makes for an excellent ending, and I personally firmly believe anticlimactic endings is perhaps the greatest bane of Horror today.<br/><br/>All in all, while lowering your expectations and standards will indeed help you enjoy the film all the more, Life is far from being another average act of mediocracy. It's compelling, suspenseful and terrible and delivers a very highly entertaining Horror experience. While many might disagree with me (as this is all just my personal opinion), I would recommend to anyone and everyone (even those who aren't regular Horror enthusiasts) not to miss out on this one."

","This was a pretty good movie. I watched it for the biology aspect of it and the first half really delivered. It was interesting and realistic at first but then it got carried away to please a more basic audience, which was okay but I think if it didn't change direction and keep things within the realm of what is really possible then it would have been better. But again space is largely unexplored so maybe there is a creature who can survive just about anything, from fire to water to no oxygen to the vacuum of space where it came from. The end has a fun little twist, which I saw coming from a mile away but was still pleasantly surprised to find that I was right.<br/><br/>I'm going to steal this line from Jurassic park because it fits so perfectly; life always finds a way.

"evening1","6","1","3","17 April 2019"," Space-age Frankenstein story
","Man's curiosity -- his greatest attribute or his worst flaw?<br/><br/>This film tackles the dangers of pushing scientific exploration to its limit.
Scientists aboard the International Space Station accept a sample of soil from Mars and set about creating a medium in which a single-celled organism could spring to life. Back on Earth, humans' special brand of anthropomorphism prompts a school kids' contest in which the dormant creature is dubbed Calvin.<br/><br/>""C'mon, Calvin, wake up!"" an ISS scientist urges. He administers an electric shock of some sort, which the miniscule being interprets as an act of hostility.
And thus begins, yes, our home planet's very demise.<br/><br/>This exceedingly grim but interesting and at times exciting film features a monster that looks like an inexorably growing, transparent squid. But the creature definitely manages to scare.<br/><br/>The performances here are broadly sketched but manage to satisfy. And the space crew's slimy nemesis makes a certain amount of sense as we watch it exploit the humans' vulnerabilities -- from a scientist's palsied leg to the astronauts' selfless tendency to take risks to help one another.<br/><br/>The film ends particularly effectively, once an escape pod has landed back on Earth, presumably in some remote expanse of the Pacific. The film challenges us to ask why we do what we do. Maybe we can. But SHOULD we?<br/><br/>The movie ends aptly with the strains of Norman Greenbaum's ""Spirit in the Sky,"" which, I read on Wikipedia, has been cited as the second-most-requested song to be played at memorial services.<br/><br/>Will man's quest for knowledge become his funeral dirge?

","Great film, classic late night movie fare. Seen it three or four times now, once in the cinema, once on cable, and twice on rental DVD. It didn't get much love from the critics, and I seriously wonder why. Together with Prometheus, and alien covenant , this movie would make an excellent triple bill - alien mayhem in space. What I love about this film is that it starts out all grand and majestic, with the space vistas, the soaring strings and brass on the soundtrack, the title flashes out large to the crescendo , the moments of sheer wonder, it makes you think it's about finding life beyond the stars, then slowly, slowly, the scenes start taking on ominous undertones. then ... things start going downhill, the cute little alien starts getting really ravenous faster than you can say ""calvin!"". Before long, several crew members are mush. Subsequently, the tension mounts with every run-in between the remaining crew members and the alien, and by the three quarter way mark in the film, when Sho is trying to climb up the spaceship shaft with the alien stalking him from below, I was tearing a hole in my arm rests in the cinema! That's the mark of a good thriller - the carnage and mayhem just mounts till the (downbeat) climax. I actually watched this on a lazy sunday afternoon at the multiplex, and wasn't expecting much. Boy, was I wrong. This is one of my favourite space-creature feature in recent years.
And I have to put in a paragraph for Jake Gyllenhaal - he really, really sells every single scene he is in. I mean, there really is no reason for Gyllenhaal to act the hell out of this role - after all, this is not the kind of role or movie that wins anyone acting honours - but he truly and professionally knocks this right out of the park. I now am full of admiration for him, much more that in his other more ""actorly"" roles. If anyone out there hasn't seen this, go rent it immediately!"

"jormatuominen","8","1","3","26 March 2018"," When humans have the losing hand
","The morning after seeing Life I woke up thinking about the plausibility of the storyline. The more I thought the more plausible it seemed. Usually it´s the other way around with U.S. alien films, especially those of the Alien lineage. Admittedly plausibility limits creativity, but Life at least seeks a balance between the two. The film speculates how a life form discovered out there, in this case Mars, might be difficult to contain. It does this in a seriously scary way, as the scientists at the International Space Station slowly begin to understand that the organism can and will outsmart them. It felt like being in a poker game and having all your money on the table, just to realize that you can´t beat the other guy after all. Many complain that the film follows well worn paths familiar from the Alien series, which would really be hard to avoid since the whole genre was begun back in 1979 by the original Alien film. I didn´t see this as a problem, to me Life tried to put some new life into the genre, so to say. Few seem to know the 2013 sci-fi film Europa Report, about a mission to seek life in our own solar system, which takes place in a ship very similar to ISS used in Life. Science in that film was if not 100 per cent accurate at least taken seriously. It almost seems that makers of Life have seen Europa Report and thought, hey, we can make a better movie with these premises. And they did a good job."

","Life may not be one of the most original movies in existence, but I still found myself thoroughly engaged throughout the entire film, especially the middle part of the film, after Calvin breaks Hugh's hand and escapes from the containment room and before the two remaining astronauts make their final bid to escape from the brutal tentacles of ""Calvin"" a sentient life-form found from the soil and rocks of the planet Mars and ""re-animated"" thanks to the efforts of the crew of the International Space Station, Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), and Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya). 
Dr. Derry, the exobiologist of the crew, is naturally the one who has the most scientific interest in Calvin, being fascinated by how he develops and functions and even after being attacked by him shows some sympathy towards his plight, he tells the rest of the crew that Calvin is not inherently evil or malevolent but simply trying to survive, and it seems to be true as he only attacks people, or rats, in this particular case, who attack and threaten him first.

","There's nothing wrong, whatsoever, with 'Life.' It's a good film with some good characters, good sequences and, as the thriller genre demands, thrills. Indeed, in places 'Life' goes beyond what you might expect. Its characters are far better rounded and developed than some of its lesser cousins and cliches which could easily drag it down are avoided in clever ways. The performances, across the board, are good and the dialogue feels natural.<br/><br/>Despite this the film suffers from an obvious derivative nature. All films are derivative, nothing is original and almost all films pay tribute in one form or another, either obviously or subtly, to those films that inspired them. The problem with 'Life' is it feels too much like a modern day 'Alien' tribute piece than something fresh.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film and it certainly excels in some areas. It is thrilling, it is scary in parts and there is plenty of well placed tension.

","It's an interesting premise, but we have been here before. Honestly, the only reason I watched it was because of Ryan Reynolds. I started getting ticked off when they were just dismissing mistakes in the physical properties of space. From catching the probe, which would have destroyed the station, to trying to burn the alien (which should have worked if it was indeed Carbon based life), it just became more and more contrived. You can get away with that in a scenario set in the future to a degree, but since this takes place in a factual location, you have to honor the parameters involved.

","There was nothing wrong with this film technically. There was some great acting, and just about everyone will have told you about the plot twists (more than one). Apart from the usual aspect of 9 channels of noise in (actually silent) space, ""Life"" does a great job of putting us in a realistic, futuristic extraterrestrial environment. My one complaint --- enough to bump Life from a 4 to a 3-star rating --- is that it has once again decided to portray alien life as evil and scary. Fair enough, it may well turn out to be, and no less a scientist than Mr. Hawking has warned us of that. So my objection is really more than just that --- that for almost as long as there have been science fiction movies, they insist on being (1) dystopian, (2) apocalyptic, (3) quasi-military or (4) horror stories dressed up in science fiction garb. I'm sorry, but back in the golden age of science fiction, the stories were more inclined to be (1) space operas (more recently, The Expanse has got that right) which portray how great human dramas might play out in technologically transformed future worlds; or (2) stories of daily life against a transformed backdrop --- not horror, not utopia, just different (Heinlein excelled at this, though his wonderful stories of daily life and imaginable futuristic adventures never made it to the screen, rather, his least-interesting stories are the only ones ever produced). So, back to the current topic.... Life is, unfortunately, entirely caught up in the current dominant themes in contemporary scifi, and in the end is unable to break free to engage us in the way science fiction ultimately should --- to stir our imaginations by challenging due to visualize the non-obvious implications of technological evolution and change. On that count, despite its many technical and narrative strengths (it is, mostly, a gripping narrative), ""Life"" falls back to the tried and tested stereotypes, and has, unfortunately, nothing new to add."

","""Life"" is a very intelligent, well-crafted sci-fi thriller concerning the discovery of life on another planet. Six crew members on an international space station discover an organism from the planet Mars. The head scientist tinkers, zaps, and prods the organism until viola it comes to life. First appearing as a very innocuous life form, the scientists on the ship simply won't leave well enough alone and pretty soon everyone is fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie because of its realism. Unlike most science fiction movies, gravity does play a major role. The crew members are not ""ambulatory"" but move as if they are floating through the air. More story driven than creature driven, ""Life"" turned out to be a very taut, imaginative thriller. As in any movie, Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal deliver knockout performances.<br/><br/>Rated ""R"" for science fiction violence, disturbing images, and language I say give this one a try."

","No idea what people are on about.. its was a good scifi film. Nothing wrong with the plot, quite convincing to be honest, simple yes agreed. The creature was plausible as we haven't actually met many aliens I guess it was mostly made up or maybe it wasn't ?? This is another case of people expecting Oscar this and Oscar that, subtitles in french and one added obscure language and maybe a same sex relationship while one of them is going through a gender change because he or she was traumatized by her mother remarrying. The absence of a token wizzard was probably the last straw for most of the reviewers. Here's how it should of gone in the grown up world.. things got slightly out of control and earth instantly nuked the space station.. all 15 mins of a film, but perfectly logical. Anyway I'd recommend it, someone commented that the CGI was child like ?? Totally disagree it was excellent. I like Prometheus to BTW. All I can say is Fiction .. fiction fiction.. look it up absorb the definition, and maybe spend more time with real people outside in the real wide world.."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Life"" (2017) is a movie which will probably appear to those who like sci-fi movies in a first place - more for fans i think. The premise of this movie isn't original to say the least, but i like these ""kind"" of movies when they are done good. ""Life"" could be best described as a guilty pleasure - it doesn't offer you absolutely anything new or very exciting. Yet the craftsmanship of this movie and the A list cast makes it for a pretty not bad movie overall.<br/><br/>The weakest thing in this movie without a doubt was script. There many predictable moments, and some eye rolling lines like ""my place is in a space - i don't want return to 8 billions of the motherfxxxers"" - seriously - this line should have been movies dramatic punchline yet it sounded kinda bizarre. This movie also borrows heavily from great movies like ""Alien"" or ""Gravity"" - ""Life"" unfortunately is by all possible moons not as good as any of those movies. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Life"" is a not bad sci-fi flick for seeing it once at home. It doesn't provide anything new or very exciting, script is pretty weak, yet craftsmanship, music and great actors do deliver. And by the way to call it a creature in a movie with a name ""Celvin"" does not work. ""Bob"" should sounded more menacing."

","I remember when I walked out of the theater after watching Alien, my stomach hurt from 2 hours of gut wrenching tension and horror. When I walked out of the theater after watching Life, I was wondering if 5 viewers at $3.24 each, who didn't buy popcorn or drinks, would pay for the cost of showing the movie. It really frightens me that if this theater goes out of business I'll have to pay regular admission prices to watch first run movies. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, the movie: Life was a pretty decent looking movie, with realistic CGI and props. Most of the characters were actually fairly engaging and relate-able. But I recognized ""scary alien lifeform creature"" almost immediately--he's the starfish guy from Spongbob Squarepants in his first real life, big blockbuster, serious sci-fi movie roll. AND because he was inexperienced and only 100% brain and 100% muscle they had to help him out by using the time honored scary movie trick of having his victims do stupid, foolish and illogical things and by letting him defy the laws of physics. Bring your eyeballs and your sympathy, but leave your brains at home. 6 of 10 for spending a lot of money on special effects and cast."

","OK I am always looking for a good Alien movie with a twist in it , who the Alien is and how they think. Initially I felt, hmm good premise coming from a soil sample and this could explained what happened to life on Mars BUT after awhile my logic was being suppressed by the constant action of Calvin. <br/><br/>The script was lackluster and Ryan Reynolds became ""Deadpool"" in script and actions. Ryan has never been known in my book as a good actor except for Deadpool but I understand he was to be the main actor but had other obligations (didn't know he was in demand) so they let Jake G. take over as lead, for what I am not sure!! <br/><br/>The two characters are so non existent throughout the whole movie; pure caricatures. Also, Jake, during the whole movie appeared to not give his all. He seems bored or not interested. Maybe because his acting is far better than Ryan s and he didn't feel he should be originally billed as second banana. <br/><br/>Well for whatever reason Jake didn't give it his all. The movie suffered for more than just this reason.

","Welcome to the world of Science Fiction all you sci-fi lovers where we love to be entertained using mystery, imagination and adventure not limited to the known but the unknown realms as well. The movie Life takes us there. For about an hour and forty five minutes, we are first introduced to some space exploration that quickly turns into a major discovery and then a out of control situation. How it unravels is well done drawing us in little by little until you notice you are either biting your nails, wolfing down popcorn or a tasty snack or gripping the armchair of your seat. It happens more than once too making for a nice way to appreciate the story and of course see how it all unfolds. We humans have no idea of what another life form would consist of but here we are introduced to one of the many forms it can take. The awe of discovering Life elsewhere is quickly turned into a fast developing idea of who is discovering who first? Having all this take place in space aboard a space station makes for a good start and where it ends begs for a sequel not saying anymore but instead encouraging you to go see this movie and spend some quality, enjoyable entertainment time. The actors pull it off however I had trouble with some of the details and at times, understanding what was being said because it is being said over a radio transmission at times or quickly spoken with or without accents. Watching this with captions would capture all the dialogue. As far as the character details, there are too few. I also didn't quite care for what they ended up naming the Life form especially when we are half way into the movie but at that time, you don't care about its name as much as you care about what is it and where is it and why? It would have been nice to make this into a two hour movie and build up some background relevant data to add more mystery and of course explain clearly some of the scenes better. Never the less, worth the price of admission and I encourage you to take the leap and go see it on the big screen. I probably will see it again and be satisfied again. I hope they keep good sci-fi coming. Enjoy"

","I never read any reviews before watching this so went with an open mind and what a surprise. It was a little slow before the main action started but that did give you time to see the life on board the ISS and lull you into a false sense of security.<br/><br/>When the action started it was.... eh....hmm..... ""Shocking"" <br/><br/>I don't think I have been more grossed out since watching the first Alien. With one scene in particular (I won't spoil it) really making me feel sick to my stomach. I was brilliantly acted and directed and not in some dimly lit corridor with flashing lights all over. This was in a bright lit lab so kind of made it more horrible.<br/><br/>After that it was pretty intense action and the same kind of ""Where is the monster"" suspense as other great movies again like Alien. Speaking of the monster I think it was a stroke of genius who designed it as it was nothing like you might imagine with big teeth etc and this made it all the more terrifying and probably more believable of what is out there and would make a good friend for the Alien monster. Speaking of which I think the director had borrowed the 'bone crushing' strength of this monster from the small 'proto' type alien in Prometheus I really enjoyed this movie and would put it up there with the Alien movies and don't underestimate the shock this movie might gave you it did me.

Blame it on the screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who basically follow all the pulse points of the aforementioned genre classic despite director Daniel Espinosa's kinetic movements thru out and decent cast that is primarily wasted.

"sbb-46694","8","2","11","29 March 2017"," Unexpectedly great film
","Spoilerfree: The film stands out with a fine quality of camera work, acting, design, shock moments, characters and a solid plot, which also gives you a nice and honestly brutal ending. It is just a very well made film that captures an immersive, dense and hostile atmosphere. <br/><br/>Spoilerstart: One question I kept on wondering about are the electroshocks against ""Calvin"". I think this is a crucial element of the plot. - First possibility: Calvin was pretending to be ""asleep"" which makes a clever and predator-like (not evil) life-form out of him. - Second possibility: Calvin was ""honestly"" asleep, they attacked him (later on also with the fire) and he got into a defending mode that evolves into attack and killing. - Third possibility: Calvin was ""honestly"" asleep but always up for attacking everyone, woke up because of the shocks and followed his instincts.<br/><br/>Why is this important? Because it arises the question in which context ""life"" itself is hostile against itself. Perhaps the scientist are the enemies of ""Calvin"" - which the film remarks at some point as well. Considering humans the film makes hints concerning war on earth, the situation of mankind and our aggressive behaviour - things we are already doing without any alien influences. The biologist (who gets his hand broken) once makes the statement that he might also be able to answer the question about the ""sense of life"" just by raising this cells in the box. Well, by doing so the whole movie answers this question (war and conflict) in an cynical way (by which the ending is the perfect brutal topping). In a way it is possible to see the situation on board of the ship as an reflection of the human situation on earth. Just that there are humans against aliens and not humans alone fighting against each other. But when we change ""humans"" and ""aliens"" just to ""life"" and then look at the alien and the scientist as living species it is not a big difference anymore - and we see the life in conflict with itself."

In my opinion, the end kind of left a cliffhanger for me so I believe they should make a second movie in the series when ""Calvin"" tries to take over the world since the alien can survive with earth's oxygen life humans can.<br/><br/>Overall, the story felt kind of rushed, but it did keep the viewers guessing.

There's a small sci-fi touch to it which I like. The alien's appearance is original. You get scared but they don't spam jump scares. It's a cute little alien in a ship movie, who would have probably gotten a more attention and better reviews 30 years ago."
"kshell_fang","8","1","4","15 December 2017"," I wish Alien: Covenant was this good!
","For starters, I didn't realize how controversial this film was until I made my way to IMdb. 1 to 2 stars is by far a hyperbolic rating for this film imo, especially for something that is so visually stunning and inputs several completely unique twists on the tried and true formula that we've seen from movies like Alien and its sequels, the primary factor being the story and conflict not only threatening the film's crew members, but also the entire human species as we know it. <br/><br/>Although, as many other critics have pointed out, there are risky decisions made, these choices aren't outside of each character's moral identities. Specifically, it is just that: the moral weight of the film which shines throughout as the crew sacrifices themselves for each other and the entire blue planet which looms below. As someone who is familiar with how space crafts function, I was able to excuse the physical inconsistencies that were made because of the sheer thrill and pounding rhythm of the story as a whole. There is truly never a dull moment or a non-character-driven part in this film. It is not a film about survival like past iterations of such concepts. That idea pretty much went out the window early on, which was truly refreshing. It is a film which showcases an actual iteration of what an evolved species can more realistically be (as opposed to a wish list of monster traits like acid saliva xD). The alien is truly just more adapted to its environment as evolution entails: strong, intelligent, mobile, and resilient enough to live in space like the shark in Jaws to water. And it's more abut ending the creature's existence than protecting any one individual (aka the first mistake made which leads to the entire catastrophe, which I assume was an intentional trope). What happens when a flamethrower just won't easily eradicate the monster? <br/><br/>I was thoroughly entertained throughout, and the film had more to add to the genre than the past 4 Alien films combined. In a way, the movie reminds me far more of John Carpenter's The Thing with it's containment mind game and big stakes, but even taking it a step farther by putting it in zero g and making the monster's only weakness a robbing of its essential resources. <br/><br/>Finally, the ending, too, is extremely well orchestrated as the man who wished to be in space and despised human suffering was rendered powerless against the creature's will, ultimately, crash landing on Earth and bringing insurmountable suffering upon mankind. Very unlike the Alien movies' epic and conclusive final showdowns which leave nothing left to the imagination."

"kgprophet","5","1","4","18 July 2017"," Alien-Gravity Hybrid Knows how to Push Buttons
","It's one thing to go ahead and do a wannabe knockoff of a couple successful science fiction films. Some movie producer saw how the audience got their thrills from ""Gravity"" and figured there was some money to be made. Despite the recent ""Alien"" prequels being released, the scriptwriters deftly copied scenes from ""Prometheus"" and carried on with a non-stop thrill ride that knows it can't stop. A few plot holes help deliver these thrills within a short period of time. <br/><br/>It's another thing to make a watchable wannabe knockoff, and ""Life"" pulls it off with a cast of Hollywood regulars and decent budget. ""Life"" wastes no time getting to the nitty gritty. Samples from Mars contain a microbe that goes beyond the average animal (or alien) intelligence. Same goes for the metamorphosis of the microbe, as the film jumps forward in time to show that the alien lifeform has remarkable dexterity, strength, and intelligence. Cue the body count. Like other good horror films, it is a guessing game who gets struck by the sneaky alien octopus. He climbs around trying to escape his captivity with a mind of a human. <br/><br/>I really have to hand it to the guys who rendered the slimy alien in this film, it is top notch. This little fella is seen throughout the movie and is believable as he crawls around, as well as when he crawls into human bodies. Once this smart squirmy alien gets out of his cage, I got this giddy ""well, no guessing what's going to happen now"" as the story becomes relentless in how smart and capable the intruder is. You'll cringe during the bone-crunching and body-snatching scenes. This little varmint is pretty good at doing all the classic alien encounters. <br/><br/>As for the ""Gravity"" part of the script, it certainly helps to up the ante by adding the thrills of smashing up a space station. Again, nothing new here, but delivers the goods for those who are excited by the dangers of space. What's nice though as where ""Gravity"" zigged, ""Life"" zags. By taking things suggested by the other films to the next extreme, we are given a roller coaster ride that wants to outdo the others. <br/><br/>There is a group of recognisable faces. No single character really reveals any depth. But then again, there's not much time to as our alien gets down to business. <br/><br/>Although I didn't see this in the theatres, I would not have been disappointed. Nevertheless the plot gets a 1 out of 10 for originality. But once you a settled in and gotten over it, you've got a good looking thriller on your hands."
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","5","1","4","14 July 2017"," Kind of generic...
","It was.....OK. Visually it was cool, and I think it had some good performances. But the writing.....eh. Ultimately, I don't think they really knew what to do with the alien. Despite many times saying it needed oxygen to live, it seemed to survive several minutes out in space. It seemed to survive any temperature/atmosphere as well as being directly burned. It apparently feeds of humans and yet somehow can also survive by eating cooling fluid? I mean, what exactly are its properties? Instead of establishing something, it just seems that they would throw something else in there to drive the plot forward at that current moment. And the characters weren't very fleshed out. They had very generic personalities and nothing that made them stand out. Plus, you have to wonder why they didn't follow the protocols in place. Or at least use some common sense. I mean earlier in the film Ryan Reynold's character tells the scientist guy off for getting too close to the alien and treating it like a buddy by saying that for all we know it could be ""anthrax"" and yet later, goes into the room without any suit on to kill it. And there's just a lot dumb moments like that in there. I certainly don't think its the worst thing I ever seen in the world. And I wasn't ever really bored watching it. It did have a good concept, and there were some moments that were cool, but overall just didn't leave a good impression."

A microscopic bacteria grows into a complex, highly intelligent being within few days, really? And what for did they need the rat in the lab?

"Laakbaar","8","1","4","22 June 2017"," Visceral, claustrophobic and dark
","This film is like Gravity and Alien, but with more of a horror element.<br/><br/>It's a dark, visceral and claustrophobic film that shows you the collision of two worlds. No, not Mars and Earth, but science and the unknown. What happens when scientists come across an alien that is not studiable, not knowable, not interested in playing the game. <br/><br/>It's a first contact story, but one in which everything goes terribly wrong. The nightmare here is not one of misunderstanding or miscommunication (like Arrival) but the sheer inability to co-exist. It's about an unstoppable creature from Mars that kills in terrifying ways. From the start, the awful realization is that the entire human race is in danger. <br/><br/>I'm not going to lie to you: I am not sure I enjoyed this film. I'm a fan of sci-fi, not Cronenburg-style horror. As soon as I realized what kind of a creature this was, I foresaw the entire movie. Too bad the people actually involved in it all didn't foresee it in the same way. They had to go through it all. The alien in this movie will remind you of every filthy thing you fear when walking through a marsh. This alien is definitely the star of the show, a work of creative genius.<br/><br/>The cinematography showing the earth and the space station was credible and beautifully done. If you're going to this movie to drool over Reynolds and Gyllenhaal, don't bother. Unsexiest movie ever.<br/><br/>Good performances from everyone, especially Dihovichnaya and Sanada.<br/><br/>It's worth about 7.5, I suppose. If this kind of film appeals to you, go see it. But don't expect a light, feel-good experience. And, um, maybe we really shouldn't explore Mars."

I didn't care - the set and special effects and the suspense made up for it.<br/><br/>And while I will not give away the ending, the ending always counts for 1/3rd of a movie's rating for me and I gave the ending a perfect score.<br/><br/>Btw, when you are watching a science fiction movie that is about horror you know you're going to find something to carp about, whether it's sound in space or people doing inexplicably stupid things (2001: A Space Odyssey being an exception).

","Great intense movie to watch, the ending was definitely shocking and least expecting. I wish and want a prequel to this. I think it lacked a lot of other aspects such as more in-depth story behind the living organism threatening the ship in space but in my personal opinion I think this movie is quite underrated and deserves more credit as it was thrilling to watch."
"alex-klein2424","6","1","4","13 June 2017"," Done Before and Better
","If I had to sum up this movie in one succinct sentence it would be this: A poor mans remake of Alien with a rich mans budget. The reason for that is visually, this is a really cool film. While Alien had very pushing the envelope effects, any older movie will have a tough time standing up to current day graphics (2001 notwithstanding). <br/><br/>As a story, it is exactly what you expect. A space station just brought back some rocks from Mars and have found life, which they incubate and grow on the space station. Turns out this life is not nice and wants to kill. The race is then on to not only kill this creature but to make sure the space station and this threat does not reach earth.<br/><br/>I found myself constantly comparing the film to Alien, and while there is no central character, the plot cannot be ignored. That is not to say it is a bad movie. The opening title shot was really cool and Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gylenjelloronalddalh were both fantastic. The suspense was also great and I found myself constantly on the edge of my seat as this creature grew and killed. What was cool was the creature was never portrayed as evil, just as someone else trying to survive in this crazy thing we call space.<br/><br/>What I did not like was there were constantly frustrating parts as people didn't do what they were supposed to do to ensure the safety of earth. One scene in particular where a certain character ruins really smart plans was particularly irritating. With that said, the ending was a surprise. I saw it coming a little early but still found myself happily shocked. The movie, beyond Alien, looked as though it took some inspiration from Interstellar, 2001, Gravity, and Passengers. Some parts making you roll your eyes and others making you smile.<br/><br/>This is the perfect movie for those Alien fans who are already creating their rubber costumes of the alien in preparation for Alien: Covenant. It should whet their slimy appetites, but if you are spooked by space or broken dangly hands or slippery strong alien squids with ambivalent agendas then you might skip this one."
"cjan","6","1","4","10 June 2017"," Same Old Alien and Starships Storyline

I kept the all movie guessing the next move right and even the even was predictable. This is one time movie for me. Although well done and great cgi (or some like that) effects. It just could not raise a goosebump from me."
"marc5477","6","1","4","9 June 2017"," Not too bad but the science was lacking
","Basically a remake of Alien except that the alien is more like the Blob. Absolutely no new thoughts went into the making of this movie. They did attempt to make it more scientific but they failed badly at that. The glaring problem is that you in reality, you would never try to resuscitate an alien life form even if its just a cell. The reasons are plain as day for anyone with an inkling of biology knowledge. Given it was biological in nature (dna based or similar), if you do revive said organism, it is highly likely that your microbes will destroy it or its microbes will destroy you. The odds of two organisms from two completely separate ecosystems to be compatible on a micro scale are practically zero which is the flaw of almost all alien based movies that have physical interaction. So anyway, the science was borked from the second they found the cell. No scientist over the age of 12 would have done what these morons did. But then you wouldn't have a movie right? Not an action movie at least. Which is where this one was not too bad in the same way that Alien is not bad. But the big difference is the age of each movie. Alien was great in its time, but today, such films are a dime a dozen and boring. Since there was no originality here and even less research, I cant see myself ever wanting to see it again.<br/><br/>Watch it once as an action film if you like semi-realistic action. Skip if you are expecting sci-fi. Its not science, just plain fiction."
"onecrazydane","6","1","4","5 June 2017"," Why, why, why?
","It's a complete mystery to me why Hollywood keeps making movies about the discovery of ET organisms with people that act like completely untrained idiots when handling said organism? I don't need to mention Prometheus but, hey, I just did. Prometheus is far better than Life, though.<br/><br/>The best line in ""Life"" is Ryan Reynolds telling the Ariyoon Bakare to stop treating the Mars bug like a buddy, ""Im' your buddy"". Yes, very good point. Unfortunately Hugh the Scientist is more interested in caressing it in a sexually loaded manner. It completely kills the suspense.<br/><br/>Like, is Hollywood mandated to make as many movies about evil ETs and ravenous super organisms as possible? What the hell is this? It's like propaganda almost. Can anyone ever make something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind again (not counting Paul)? Also, did we really need a moody, deer eyed Jake Gylllenhall's character to remind us how much our leaders are messing up our planet and that's why he really likes ""ISIS""? And why does his character seemingly blame all of humanity for it? Who wrote this, Dick Cheney? Great cinematography though. Really quite epic camera-work.<br/><br/>What a shame."

The boring story is not as boring as it would have been if the budget was low.<br/><br/>Still, some major flaws in story-telling make this an average flick. The pretty alien does not look scary at all. The characters are not introduced properly. The whole plot is disjointed, we get the facts of the story served without any sense of purpose.

I rated 5. With a fine, well-crafted plot, especially not so many logical flaws and dumb actions from ppl who are in reality handpicked and well trained and tested but act in the movie so dumb that I have the feeling boy scouts would have done better.<br/><br/>Without a with dumbness ""infected"" crew this movie could have been a new classic of space-horror.

"restlesstymes","6","1","4","26 March 2017"," Meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either
","Okay so we've seen it right? So many times with the saturation of films from the sci-fi genre of late: Independence Day: Resurgence, Passengers, Star Trek Beyond, Star Wars: Rogue One and more - that was just 2016! What's more, there are more than 10 that are considered sci-fi coming out in 2017! We've also seen stories about murderous aliens so many times, when walking into this film I thought how is it possible to tell this same old story in a different way? How in the world does is this film going to set itself apart?<br/><br/>Well .it doesn't. Its good, there are moments of originality but not totally a new journey or refreshing. A la Gravity, the film includes vastly stunning shots of space that I enjoyed, but I will leave it to Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson to determine the accuracy of those scenes!<br/><br/>Lots of great scares, I was petrified for a lot of the first act (I have to admit it doesn't take much for me though), but I feel like it really dropped off as it progressed, at least until the ending. There was a palpable effort to kick up the drama in this film but I think it had an adverse effect. It seemed to slow the movie down at some moments and while I understand the intention of incorporating those scenes, some of them seemed to make the film drag a bit which was annoying. That said, there as a major twist that I enjoyed but, it's not that much of a surprise if your paying attention.<br/><br/>The film begins with the crew on the International Space Station with an organism widely believed to be the first evidence of life beyond Earth. This little Martian critter appears to be docile at first but after a series of growth jolting procedures, begins to grow at an alarming rate. There is something to be said for the downside of eagerness and in the famous words of Jeff Goldblum's character Dr. Ian Malcom in Jurassic Park, ""scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should."" This quote rings true in this film. I think it speaks to the lightning speed at which things move forward, and it makes you wonder if we are overlooking potential danger as we progress. Moving too fast has its dangers and this hubris is the source of all the conflict in this film.<br/><br/>Overall Life is definitely worth a trip to the movies, I mean all the best part of the film are exactly why we go to see films like these in the first place: suspense, scares, and excitement. The cast overall was pretty awesome, Rebecca Ferguson as always is pretty exceptional (loved her since The White Queen on Showtime); I can't wait to see her in The Snowman alongside Michael Fassbender as Harry Hole at the end of this year. Ryan Reynolds was great with his typical comic relief shtick and smart ass quips. I did feel he was slightly underused, but I think it was smart for him to take a role like this - it was small but memorable. Jake Gyllenhaal is also great most of the time, but I felt slightly underwhelmed by him. He's always so good at playing the tortured soul and I felt like it was the same kind of performance I've seen him do many times over. I wasn't feeling it this time, to be honest I felt more depth from Hiroyuki Sanada as crew member Sho, following a poignant moment in his characters life. Speaking of Hiroyuki Sanada, it was a nice surprise seeing him playing a supporting role in this film, he played one of my favorite characters in The Last Samurai, Ujio. Espinosa did pretty good job and I did enjoy it even though it felt like something I had seen 100x before. This film echoed so much of the Alien films, but I guess when you think about it most sci-fi films with murderous aliens do.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely check it out but its not life-changing, honestly their press interviews for this film are slightly more entertaining.

"hypersonic8999","5","1","5","17 July 2017"," As horror it's good, as sci-fi it's very bad
","As a movie, it's enjoyable. The horror elements are well set and the story moves along nicely. The characters don't much matter, but they are good actors doing a decent job. It's the script that hasn't given them much to go on. The camera work is stunning at places and I applaud the director for making a technically competent film as far as visuals and acting goes.<br/><br/>The problems start when we enter the sci-fi part of the film, and more generally when we start talking about the script. As an idea it has potential. It's certainly not an original premise, but hey, I'm not gonna hold that against anything in human culture. Everything is ripping off something else.<br/><br/>However, the script suffers from a lot of ""this improbable and stupid thing just happened so the next improbable and stupid thing can happen"". After a while the whole movie degenerates into a series of these blunders and can start pulling you out of it. That's a big no no for any movie, and especially for a horror film where you rely on... well, horror.<br/><br/>**FROM HERE ON IT'S SPOILERS**<br/><br/>I wouldn't nitpick something like Alien, which has several issues as well. But Alien was made nearly 40 years ago. And its issues aren't so many to be a problem. This film just keeps piling from the beginning and they become so many that there's no longer cohesion. Without these, I would rate the film as anything between 8-10 out of 10.<br/><br/>The astronauts are incompetent. Just simply incompetent. Right at the point where the alien kills its first victim I have thought of a very simple and clear solution. Wear space suits and vent the station. Stick together and arm yourselves. Nope, doesn't even cross their minds until it's too late.<br/><br/>At this point I should mention I'm a biologist, and I've done a lot of work with relatively harmless pathogenic bacteria. My lab has miles ahead better precautions than their lab. And they have a CDC ""Doctor"" aboard whose basically there to make sure no one opens the door and nothing else. Their whole protection is a plastic incubator that is equipped with latex glass. Not even leather gloves. There's no emergency venting of atmosphere. There's no secondary shield to seal the incubator. The room's ventilation and sprinkler system is connected to the rest of the station. It's just plain stupid, and it's there to fail.<br/><br/>Then there's all those small information that make no sense: * The fuel runs out immediately after the film starts. Apparently, not one of at least 15 space agencies (today's numbers) have thought to resupply the International Space Station before the most critical and important mission undertook by humanity. And one that would place the whole station in quarantine until the mission was over (presumably).\ * I can see the alien being immune to fire and maybe withstanding limited times without oxygen, but it's also completely immune to toxic and poisonous substances and can withstand the vacuum, cold and radioactivity of space for hours.<br/><br/>* Also, the first 20 minutes it can't withstand the absence of atmosphere, afterwards it can withstand it forever, then towards the end it can't survive without oxygen for prolonged times.<br/><br/>* The humans fail to rescue one other human when they know where he is, they know he's probably alive and they know the alien is sealed away somewhere where it can't reach any of them. Then said non-rescued human proceeds to mess up everything.<br/><br/>* No one ever thinks of wearing a space suit so they can have that much extra protection from something that seems intent on drinking them.<br/><br/>* We have a flamethrower aboard the station, which goes against every single safety rule that has existed for space travel since Yuri Gagarin.<br/><br/>* No one ever thinks of trying to poison the organism, or even just mess up with its atmosphere when it's destroying the arm of one of the astronauts. They just sit there and watch.<br/><br/>* They just find the organism and revive it 5 minutes after putting it under the microscope. Seriously, WTF scientists? What happened to safety and precautions? Study what you have first. Then see about reviving it. Not only is it completely reckless and dangerous, even if the organism turned benign, they've just introduced a bunch of ethical complications to the study, when there were none.<br/><br/>* The ending is beyond stupid. The alien acts out of completely out of character, there's a twist that can be seen from miles away. The alien is stupidly intelligent. I mean it's so intelligent it beggars belief. Just because it has brain power doesn't mean it instantly can learn everything about piloting space shuttles, orbital mechanics, human psychology/behavior and dramatic irony.<br/><br/>* The humans mess up badly at the end. Not only do they execute a reckless plan, they don't make sure they maximize their odds of succeeding. They split up, when they know that the alien has only ever tried dealing with one of them at a time. They perform a plan that hinges on the alien not overpowering them (which it can totally do). Part of their plan is that one of them returns to Earth. Why? You are breaking your own quarantine rules in the most extreme manner. What if that thing can multiply and one of its offspring comes back to Earth? * Most heroic sacrifices are not only wasted. They are unnecessary and stupid."

","Good movie with a good setup, focus, character development, tension and great pacing. It isn't original in anyway and certain parts are quite predictable, however the movie delivers everything marvelously with a great pacing and balance. Furthermore, the movie is very short only 1 hour and 30 minutes. So stop reading and start watching.<br/><br/>This may all sound familiar, we find a sample or organism in space and we try to analyze it only to find out it is hostile. It is the basic setup as Alien and/or Species; however is that a bad thing? Alien is considered a master piece by most and it is a recommended watch, Species not so much. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and when a movie is good we don't need to compare them, just enjoy them.<br/><br/>As aforementioned Life is quite short and within this short time the director is able to give us a hopeful beginning, tense middle with good character development, and a well enough ending. The cinematography is similar to the movie Gravity (2013) with a realistic view of space and the ISS. The music isn't anything special but it does its job to underscore the moments. What really stands out is the balance and pacing of the movie. The director knows how to setup a moment and how to pay it off later. Together with a fast pacing the movie almost never felt like it dragged on for too long (maybe a little at the end).<br/><br/>The movie's protagonist isn't one person but a group. It consists of 5 astronauts on the ISS doing research on a Martian specimen. Each member has their own function on the ISS and gets their own moment to shine in the movie. The antagonist, is off course the Martian organism, however the movie tells it from a neutral perspective, basically it isn't evil it just tries to survive.<br/><br/>That is it really. It is a shorter review than usual, but hey it is a short movie. Off course I can nitpick every small detail and give you all a detailed comparison with other movies, but this time it isn't about that. It is just me telling you that I liked the movie and that I can honestly recommend it.<br/><br/>It is a good watch.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7."
"javi-y-se-acabo","8","1","5","16 June 2017"," Life: Alien Remake? Almost, But Still Good
","Since I saw the first trailer I immediately recognized this as a direct copy from the classic that is Alien. This movie sure has some elements in common but it can stand at his own delivering a very entertaining movie, but sadly, always on the shadow of the Xenomorph.<br/><br/>It tells the story of six astronauts who are on an exploration on Mars and they discover a little living cell that ends up carrying them a lot of problems. This is the classic mysterious creature in space threatening the life of the astronauts but it's still well introduced and it keeps the tension enough to keep you staring at the movie through its whole duration.<br/><br/>The cast was very good but some of them were not well used and the relationship between them was not very well established, but specially Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebbeca Ferguson did a very good job. One thing of the story I didn't get was, why they bring the alien to the ship and why was that ship floating around? This is not explained. What really happened before the movie and I think this should have been explained better so it would have been a bit more interesting.<br/><br/>The design of the alien, although not great it was very good and anytime you see it sneaking around you start fearing of the life of one of the crew members, as well as all the visuals used for recreating the space and the ship. Also the soundtracks was very effective and added a lot to help to create this tension, but also it added feelings to the most emotional parts of it.<br/><br/>I would recommend you this movie if you want to watch an entertaining movie with great visuals and a very good cast."

No. Let me put it this way, LIFE is far better than the other space movie which came out recently, Alien:Covenant. Yes, believe me. At least this movie kept me at the edge of my seat. LIFE succeeds in doing this by making the antagonist unpredictable. Well directed, well acted and good music elevates the film into an experience we don't get much from movies these days. But the movie has its flaws. It's at times, how do i put it, illogical. This has got to with the script. There at times when we wonder how did we get here. The decisions and actions by the crew do not make sense all the time. But is it enough to spoil the movie. No. We can easily overlook it because the film as a whole was taken well. At times, LIFE managed to dread the creature discovered by our protagonists. I do not agree with the negatives that came when the movie released but after watching it I know its positives definitely makes this an experience you don't want to miss."

"rockman182","7","1","5","3 June 2017"," Life (2017)
","The space genre is booming and on top of that we've had a number of close contained space horror films. Alien really popularized this type of film and since then we've had a number of good and some terribly bad films of the sort. The trailer for Life didn't spark a lot of interest for me as it seemed too generic, however some of the review for it were quite good so I was interested to check it out. The film is solid, despite not really offering anything new or overly original to the space horror genre.<br/><br/>The film is about a space crew who come into contact with a life form from Mars. Although the world and space crew are initially excited about the contact that was made, it is soon discovered that this mysterious life form (named Calvin) is dangerous and smarter than initially thought. Calvin starts killing off the space crew one by one and becomes bigger and more dangerous as the crew scramble to try to kill the life form and save their space station.<br/><br/>The film isn't exactly original and you can kind of see where it is heading, however the film does provide thrills and keeps you entertained throughout. The film benefits from having a pretty excellent cast, Gyllenhaal and Ferguson especially. Calvin is a menacing villain and you do want to see that sucker get destroyed but you have to stand by and which as it becomes stronger and stronger and more invincible. There is a long take and the cutting in the film is good for a space film and is sufficient enough for depicting thrilling moments. I really liked the ending of the film, its shockingly great and has potential for a future.<br/><br/>As far as Venom connection goes, yes stock footage was used in the trailer from Life and Spiderman 3 and the writers of Life did write a script for a Venom film. However, I think maybe its a coincidence. I wouldn't be bothered by this actually being a horrifically brutal origin story for the symbiote that is Venom. Honestly, the studio could reel it in later and use it to lead into the Venom film that is supposedly planned. Life still works just as well as a stand alone film, prequel or not prequel.<br/><br/>7/10"

","A 3 because it was kind of fun. If you like space movies, you have to check it out, how can you not. Many spoilers ahead!!<br/><br/>It insults blacks because the only black man in the movie plays with this alien, completely and totally oblivious to the fact that it might eat them all. He doesn't care! He thinks it's cute. His actions doom them all (and us).<br/><br/>It insults white people because the woman that is in charge of quarantine has not trained the crew for quarantine. In fact, she keeps them all in the dark about the last protocol (being pushed out into space in case of infection) thus endangering the Japanese guy, who had he known about said protocol would not have headed in that direction. She fails to anticipate anything! The gloves are lame, and why are they using gloves to begin with? They would be using a robotic hand. Not human hands inside of a glove, jeesh! And then the ease in which the alien can escape the lab? Not a very safe lab! <br/><br/>When the last protocol (being shipped out into space) comes to push them into space, surely it would be news down on Earth that something was wrong. I mean, Earth is watching, they've named it after all. Therefore, (here's the insult to Vietnamese fishermen) when Vietnamese fishermen open the space capsule when they can CLEARLY see that a pod from space has landed and there is a strange creature inside, this is saying that fishermen are SO STUPID and they NEVER WATCH THE NEWS and are unaware that life from another planet has been found, so maybe they better not open this hatch. Yeeeeah. <br/><br/>The French are insulted when the French doctor out in space decides not to push herself, alien attached, out into deep space. Instead she wants to come closer to the ship. I don't think so! At least she does try to be a hero at the end of her mission.<br/><br/>Back to the lab and its protocols, it just has to be mentioned. Surely this crew would know that if you have an alien creature which no one knows anything about, you are not going to open the door to the lab, period. It doesn't matter if Pope Francis or John F. Kennedy are in that lab, you are going to keep the door closed. Instead there has to be the customary ""open the door! I don't care about your protocols! Someone is dying!!"" nonsense. Puhlease.. that was done in Alien, and so we don't need to ever do it again, okay!!!!!!??????? They would not be that stupid.<br/><br/>Each sex acts ridiculous, and the black man, Asian fishermen, and white people are doofuses. Seriously, writers?<br/><br/>Finally, they keep saying the creature needs liquid. Carbon based. If so, why does it not explode or boil in space? It romps around outer space just fine...........how could that be possible at all? It has no space suit. <br/><br/>OH!!!!!! And how in God's name does it know how to pilot a shuttle???? How has it learned how to manually pilot an Earthling's space shuttle down to Earth? This is never explained! Was it human before? Was it at Earth? Are the shuttles we have created some basic brand that is taught throughout the universe? The alien learned ""basic shuttling"" in its life before Mars? What the hey people?????"
"elicope","8","1","6","11 June 2017"," In space, no one can hear you scream
","At first glance, the latest sci-fi movie coming to the multiplex, ""Life"" (opening March 24), looks like a thriller with the same kind of ""in space no one can hear you scream"" DNA that made the first ""Alien"" movie back in 1979 a cultural phenomenon. And you would be right. ""Life"" is not the first movie in the past 30-plus years set in space that wants to scare the heck out of you. And basing the scares around a creepy organism that we gullible humans find on another planet is tried-and-true. But there are little tweaks to the formula that director Daniel Espinosa and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (of ""Deadpool"" fame) do that makes this particular movie very fun to experience. What I respect a lot about this movie is, for a big budget blockbuster from a major studio such as Sony, it doesn't look to cater to all audiences. That's evident in its opening, which is a single shot that goes on for around five minutes or so — a very ambitious move. But Espinosa does this to cleverly kill two birds with one stone: the single shot gives us the layout of the international space station, where we will be spending most of our time throughout the movie; and also shows a major moment in the movie, the crew retrieving a probe back from Mars with a sample from the planet. We find out that the sample is the first proof of life on Mars. Then we're given the usual beats of the space thriller: getting to know the crew, including the wise ass Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds); the person in charge of the mission's risk management, Miranda Bragg (Rebecca Ferguson); Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), who will be doing the experimenting on the Mars life form, and Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), who has recently broken the record for most time in space. Jokes are constant and we're shown that back down on Earth, where everyone is celebrating the news of the discovery on Mars, a school has been rewarded with the honor of naming the Martian — calling it Calvin. But, as you would imagine (or if you've seen the trailer), something goes terribly wrong. Calvin turns out not to be the cute little thing it first looked to be and soon is crawling throughout the ship looking to kill the whole crew. Oh, and it's growing in size, by the way. From then on, the jump scares are constant, as well as homages to ""Alien"" (even Calvin having a tracking device on it so the crew knows where it is on the ship and Ferguson doing voice over diary logs a la Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character) And I would be the first to say that this is a total rip-off of ""Alien"" if it weren't for the last five minutes of the movie, which makes the entire film worth the watch. I'm not going to give it away — all I'll say is Ferguson is certainly not this movie's Ripley and the story turns out to be nothing like ""Alien."" ""Life"" is the perfect buy-the-ticket-take-the-ride Saturday night movie. If you're looking to cuddle up and squeeze your partner's arm for 100 minutes, this is for you. It's a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time and has an ending you will never see coming. But if Sony is smart it will make this movie a one-and-done. If it's not made into a franchise, I could see ""Life"" becoming a cult classic. With a disregard to pander to its audience (and the huge movie stars that inhabit it), ""Life"" has the potential of building a loyal fan base, and if Sony goes long tail with this, I would not be shocked if the next generation of movie lovers see this as a landmark title in the sci-fi genre. In the meantime, just ignore everyone who calls it an ""Alien"" rip- off."
"emreilbay","7","1","6","10 June 2017"," Poor decisions doesn't make a movie bad.
","I've red some reviews about people who complain about how bad the movie was. Most of the arguments were the poor decisions the actors made. Maybe the authors wanted dumb scientist in space, attempting to discover life on mars. They've made a lot of stupid decisions where you would thing ""Why?"" but that's what made the movie. If that one girl (who was the second victim) jumped in the deep space, maybe could've saved the others. But then the movie would end. The movie is about scientist people attempting to discover life on mars but fail and try to survive.<br/><br/>Second argument which people tought that made the movie bad was the logic behind the 'alien'. It survived in the space floating without oxygen but suffers when the ship runs out of fuel and loses his oxygen. There were more thing but I'm not going to cover them.<br/><br/>If you just want to enjoy a space movie who has not that much logic or good decisions (but hey come one, all of the horror movies with a killer has actors who makes bad decisions all the time and all movies with weird creatures like aliens in it has little logic) then watch this movie. Me personally enjoyed this movie. There were moments that had no logic but I didn't really minded."
"alex-anagn","8","1","6","8 June 2017"," Surprisingly Good!
","I was amazed by the amount of negative reviews for this movie. Yes, it has a very ""Alien"" taste to it and yes, some decisions that the crew made may not have been the brightest ones but it is still a very solid horror, sci-fi movie. <br/><br/>First of all, the cinematography is amazing. The pictures and the view from the space station on Earth are breathtaking. You really can feel the deep emptiness of space that is also very well contrasted with the atmosphere on Earth. There is a very distinct difference between the two and the director has managed to pinpoint it perfectly. <br/><br/>Secondly, i saw many complaints concerning the ""unrealistic"" plot or the ""lightheaded"" behavior of the crew. It is worth mentioning that we are talking about a fictional horror movie with aliens. The alien is not meant to behave logically because of the very reason that it is an alien, we have no idea what it can do or how smart it is. That is shown very well in the movie. There is first joy for discovering life outside earth, then great fear because of its huge potential, both in intelligence and in force. To address the issue of the crew being ""stupid"", you have to keep in mind that there is a considerable amount of panic involved in the characters. Try to put yourselves in the characters' situation: you are in a space station that is pretty much abandoned in space (no communication with earth), there is no way for everyone to survive since there are limited space pods and an alien life-form that looks like a freaking starfish and is able to squeeze your hands to shreds (at first at least) is on the loose and can attack any minute. Besides that, trying to find logic in every thing that happens in the movie just kills any magic or thrills that it might have.<br/><br/>Of course, it is not flawless and that is why I gave it an 8. That said, a good horror movie has to be able to keep you on your toes and LIFE executes that perfectly. The characters were quite engaging and I found myself quite concerned for them a lot of times. There are also great messages, like the need for human venture into the unknown and the dangers that come out of it, ultimately leading us to our downfall. I will leave any other interpretations to your imagination.<br/><br/>If you expect to watch a horrifying, difficult to watch but also in a way beautiful movie then go watch LIFE you will not regret it. <br/><br/>There is also a twist ending which is just extra topping on a very tasty cake."

","For any fans of Tess Gerritsen's book, Gravity, who were disappointed by the actual film of the same name, look no further! This is the closest we will ever get to seeing any semblance of that great book on screen. Sure, the film Gravity was good, it just wasn't anything like the book. Meaning, there were no killer microbes!<br/><br/>Plot is super simple, scientists onboard the ISS study rock/soil samples from Mars. They discover bacteria in the samples and successfully resuscitate it. This little alien then begins to cause terror to the crew and the ship.<br/><br/>Not sure why there's so much negativity in these reviews. It's a basic sci-fi thriller grounded in the present. There's no evil alien out to kill mankind or interstellar travel, it's just about survival. Is a bird evil for eating a worm? Are humans evil for eating any sort of meat? Is a cow evil for eating living plants?<br/><br/>Give me a break! Go watch this and enjoy."
"iandavidrastall","8","1","6","7 June 2017"," A Fascinating Way Around The Alien Franchise
","I love not knowing anything about a film beforehand, and that's lucky here, as I finished it thoroughly impressed, which ... that seems to be an uncommon opinion.<br/><br/>One thing that I found interesting was how this practically reboots Alien. It's as if the general fatigue over that franchise has allowed it to become its own genre, open to anyone.<br/><br/>I think of ""Life"" as psychological horror. It's certainly not that violent, and there aren't any jump scares. Its theme, which it states in the title, is the horror of the film. We see many aspects of life ... the birth of a child, the discovery of extraterrestrial life, musings on death, family, purpose. As in so many films that may fly under an audience's radar, the subtext and meaning is where the actual meat of the film is. The horror is the cruelty of nature.<br/><br/>I was also satisfied by the quality of the production. Absolutely believable. Compare this to Ridley Scott's ""original"", and there is simply no contest. Maybe at the tail-end of the Seventies it made sense to have futuristic technology look like an improvement over hole-punching machines, but it's 2017, and it's nice to see a realistic ISS, seamless special effects. And while ""Life"" does make a point of imitating the dialogue-over-dialogue feel of ""Alien"", it works just as well. In an homage to the ""original"", we get a brief dinner table scene with that same ominous sense that their comfort is just the calm before the storm.<br/><br/>The photography, the tone, the acting, the intelligent script, all beautiful. Is it satisfying for audiences? I guess not. So be it. I suspect this will receive a bit more respect in the future, possibly in the same way that Gattica did."

When the Commander realize she was dying during the space Walk she should've held the alien and jumped into deep space? When the first scientist got hurt, they should've dropped the temperature to put it in hibernation.

","This afternoon me and my friend Niall Ferguson went to Cineworld Union Square to see the new space sci-fi film Life starring Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson. <br/><br/>Life tells the story of the six-member crew of the International Space Station which consists of Rory Adams (Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds - Deadpool, Safe House), David Jordan (American actor Jake Gyllenhaal - The Day After Tomorrow, Nightcrawler), Miranda North (Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson - Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, The Girl On The Train), Sho Murakami (Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada - The Wolverine, Rush Hour 3), Ekaterina Golovkina (Russian actress Olga Dihovichnaya - House Of Others, Two Days), Hugh Derry (English actor Ariyon Bakare - Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Jupiter Ascending) that is on the cutting edge of one of the most important discoveries in human history: the first evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars the red planet. As the crew begins to conduct research, their methods end up having unintended consequences and the life form proves more intelligent than anyone ever expected.<br/><br/>Overall Life is an alright space sci-fi film filled with science, aliens, technology, space shuttles, the atmosphere in outer space, some violence, on the edge of your seat stuff, some close shaves or calls, some odd bizarre moments, sadness, tragedy, team work, togetherness, space suits and other things throughout the film.<br/><br/>So I will give Life an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Life is worth seeing if you like space sci-fi films like Gravity, the Aliens films, Prometheus, Interstellar, the Predator films, Apollo 13 amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Life in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later."

","You would think that with all the excellent, thought provoking science fiction written that the movie industry could come up with an outer space plot that doesn't involve some kind of disaster. However ""Life"" once again shows that script writers are myopically fixed on the same type of material which they regurgitate again and again.<br/><br/>While the plot is a bit predictable, the tension builds to nail biting proportions and the ending is...<br/><br/>A horrifying movie, but more than that, another cautionary tale about discovering life on Mars. Like the ""Europa Report"" which was equally horrifying, ""Life"" may be hitting on a truth that overly sanguine Carl Sagan failed to recognize: any life that has originated on planets in the Outer Solar System will have evolved to compete for extremely limited resources (to say the least). When confronted with a nutrient and energy rich Terran environment it will...<br/><br/>We may be overjoyed to discover extra terrestrial life, but might well live to regret it."
"shinytickles","7","1","7","26 March 2017"," An enjoyable B movie with a great ending
","I went in to see this film without any expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. While certainly not a masterpiece, it is still an enjoyable ride with a few surprises. The film has good technical aspects great great visual and an effective soundtrack. The plot is a little week and predictable at times, but the good direction and editing still generate some intense moments. Acting wise, it only qualifies as competent.<br/><br/>I won't recount the plot, since many other reviews have done so already. However I feel the need to touch upon the ending and I thought it was the single brilliant moment in the movie.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER ALERT - READ ON ONLY IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM ALREADY ***<br/><br/>Many people are confused about the ending as to why the both escape pods went in the wrong direction. The logical answer is that the space agency added a hidden 4th firewall after the fail-safe on the 3rd firewall (the ISS). The 4th firewall would be the escape pods. Before the start of the mission, both escape pods were secretly rigged to go into space instead of earth. These 6 scientists were never meant to be rescued in such catastrophic events. David disengaged the autopilot, and reversed the direction of his pod, thus ended back on earth. Miranda did nothing, and ended up drifting into deep space. She was screaming in her pod in the end because at certain point she realized what happened, and understood what her bosses had doomed all them from the start. In short, humanity self-destructed due its distrust in itself."
"patomartinezfgo","7","1","7","26 March 2017"," A good, fun, suspenseful film... Don't expect anything more
","""Life"" is the story of some scientists that discover alien life on mars and try to study it. Surprise! It doesn't go well.<br/><br/>I watched ""Life"" yesterday and can say that it is a very fun movie to watch. I really did have a good time in the movie theatre. The movie is suspenseful, the performances are good, the CGI is very good, and overall... its a fun movie while we wait for Alien Covenant.<br/><br/>It is impossible not to compare ""Life"" with ""Alien"". Both movies have similar plots and are kind of a slasher film but in space. Of course ""Alien"" is a better flick and ""Life"" is not trying to be better, its rather trying to remind the audience of the sci-fi horror genre which has been forgotten for some years now.<br/><br/>There are some problems with the film however. The movie tries to be this grounded and realistic scientific film but if you know a little bit about science, you can tell some things are pure bullsh*t. The movie also has an inconsistent tone, since in the beginning of the film, the creature only does things to survive and the movie seems pretty realistic; while in the last half, the creature just becomes a slasher killer for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Another thing to mention is that the cinematography is pretty dull and the screenplay is not that good by itself. Also, the characters are largely under-developed and you really don't care to much about them.<br/><br/>I must say that I really enjoyed the score of the film which is very suspenseful.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Life"" is nothing more than a fun movie you can go watch with friends and family and have a good time. It is nothing out of this world, but it does not try to be anything out of this world. It is just a reminder of the sci-fi horror genre with a killer ending (no pun intended)."
"kluseba","7","1","7","26 March 2017"," Predictable story line but great execution
","Even though ''Life'' really follows classic science-fiction standards by the numbers, it's a really engaging movie. Yes, the first twenty minutes take the time to introduce the settings and the characters. Obviously, the rest of the movie focuses on the monster that is going to kill the crew members one by one. It's as predictable as it gets when I'm telling you that the atmosphere inside the vessel will be intense, that there will be a few breathtaking scenes taken in space and that some characters will be ready to sacrifice themselves in order to save others. Of course, the famous lead character is the one to survive until the end. And yes, there is going to be an inevitable twist at the very end. On the other side, I must admit that the movie didn't follow all the wrong stereotypes. There are no unnecessary side stories such as emotional conflicts between the characters that act in a rather mature way and we are not exposed to a cheesy love story either which makes the characters more believable.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws in the predictable story department, this movie in the vein of the classic Alien flicks still deserves to be watched on the big screen. The visual elements in the vessel and in space never fail to impress me but also have a realistic touch to them. Special effects such as body horror elements and explosions in the space station are added in small and efficient doses. The fact that ninety-eight percent of the film take place in space give this movie a refreshingly streamlined approach and since ninety-five percent of it are taking place inside the vessel, the film develops a claustrophobic vibe. This atmosphere is enhanced by a subtle yet gripping soundtrack. The characters feel down to earth and are portrayed accurately by the actors and actresses. They might not deliver the best performances of their careers but manage to give the movie a realistic touch. In the beginning, I was skeptical that the plot seemed to rely on a cast that absolutely needed to be multicultural which feels unnaturally forced in many films but it makes sense in the context of an international space mission.<br/><br/>The most interesting element about this film is obviously its antagonist. Instead of introducing us to a big and strong monster in the key of Alien or Predator, this extraterrestrial life form constantly evolves its behavior and shape which adds to the rising tension in the movie. The fact that the monster acts unpredictably yet intelligently and learns very quickly about its survival instincts and tactics makes it a genuinely scary opponent. The monster's capacity to adapt to any threat makes it so respectable while its physical appearance is so unspectacular that it feels quite realistic.<br/><br/>In the end, apart of the predictable story line and the first twenty minutes which are necessary to introduce the setting but somehow lack intensity, Life is an atmospheric, intelligent and realistic science-fiction-horror movie that will please those who love classic material like the Alien and Predator franchises."
"Lewis_Heather787","7","1","7","26 March 2017"," A good film overall, however a bit of predictable ending!
","The trailers for this were really good, that with the fantastic cast that was ""onboard"" for this film, I was pretty interested to see what this film had to offer. <br/><br/>The positives of the film, firstly the visuals. The look of this film is beautiful and stunning throughout, there is never a frame in this film that doesn't look brilliantly lit and shot. The visuals of the film obviously go hand in hand with the CGI in the film which is also perfectly shown in this film. I believe sci-fi films these days have hard time with special effects looking different from each other and trying to look better than each other. When comparing this films visuals and effects to films like Interstellar and Arrival this film does hold up OK but not as good as other recent sci-fi films. <br/><br/>The acting across the board is good and extremely solid, this is obvious when you have the three main leads being portrayed by talented actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson. The other remaining cast members also all have good solid performances, however this film never really has a stand out which I think it was crying out for at times. <br/><br/>The use of suspense and tension is perfectly executed in this film, there are some parts that are really nerve wrecking. I think the fact that the alien or Calvin does look visually frightening they use methods of suspense and tension building in the scenes to influence and promote the feel of those scenes. I personally haven't seen a recent sci-fi film use these elements as well as this film does and really works hand in hand with the environment of the film.<br/><br/>Now the negatives of the film, firstly the story. The story of the film for the most part is quite interesting and very grounded which makes the stakes higher and characters more realistic, like it could be actually happening now. However towards the ending of the film it became quite clear how the film was going to end, because the opposite outcome had been dropped hear and there by characters throughout the film. Without trying to spoil it I think it would have been better if the director had cut back and forth between the two capsules with both shots show no difference in shakiness or motion. This would have made the audience guess as to which escape capsule was at a specific location. Finally the film should of cut to black before we get to see who is inside one of the capsules, this would of left the film open ended and make the audience wanting more, that's just me any way.<br/><br/>The other main negative is the character build up and stories, which are really poorly done. There is a pathetic attempt in trying to show the characters back story by either showing stuff about their families or their motivations for being in the international space station. I believe that if there was a little more time spent in building up the characters back stories and relationships between each of them, we would of cared for them more especially when Calvin becomes alive. If for example there had been a little 5-10 minute period before either they were on the space station or some time before the incident we could learn more about the characters and get a better connection to them.<br/><br/>All in all this is an enjoyable watch and sometimes un-watchable due to the horrific nature of the alien and the superb use of tension. This film is 70% out of 100 due to the great visual and effects, good performance and brilliant use of tension. However the story negatives and characters stories does let it down a lot because they should be the backbone to the film. If you like the sci-fi / horror genre then you probably enjoy this however it is not on the same level as an Interstellar or Arrival!"
"vaportrafik","8","1","8","28 March 2017"," Not bad, but...

Maybe i chosen an ""unrated"" actor-crew...i don't know.<br/><br/>BUT!!!! i like this movie!!"
"swilliky","7","1","8","28 March 2017"," Decent sci-fi horror
","Sci-fi horror is an awesome genre and Life is a decent addition with solid alien terror in a claustrophobic space station. The movie begins quickly with the crew of the International Space Station catching a flying vessel that contained samples from Mars. All of the information is relayed through voice-over by Commander Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) to drop us into the plot and get the alien terror rolling. The movie takes a bit to let us know the crew as David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) deals with being in space for a record amount of time, Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada) celebrates the birth of his child, and scientist Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) experiments and becomes enamored with the alien creature named Calvin. He becomes so obsessed with it that he accidentally breaks quarantine and the alien goes into hibernation. <br/><br/>As the Hugh tries to wake it up it strikes back and breaks his hand, wise-cracking spacewalker Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds) moves in to get him out of there but is viciously attacked by the growing creature. Worried about it escaping the laboratory, Sho and Commander Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya) try to shut down the vents but are unsuccessful at sealing the room. The alien only becomes stronger as it picks off the crew members who work to capture and contain it.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","7","1","8","25 March 2017"," A modern day doppleganger to 1979's Alien
","Life is not going to be this generation's ""Alien"" (especially when we have another one coming out this summer) but I will say it is probably one of the best movies that repeat the old formula of Alien.<br/><br/>Director Daniel Espinosa of Safehouse and the writers of Deadpool, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick give a fresh and grounded take on the old monster-on-a-spaceship formula. Imagine 1979's Alien but set closer to the present with the realistic NASA science and technology seen in 2013's Gravity. Seeing the film's events take place in these zero-gravity compartments with close quarter rooms creates a claustrophobic effect while still being stunning to look at. Espinosa creates an amazingly long opening one-shot sequence that shows how large the ship is while introducing the characters but also showing how tight and confined they are within it. Also expect to hear a big nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey in the opening score.<br/><br/>The characters work as these great personalities with whom you develop some fondness over. No one is an antagonist or a selfish jerk but serve as real people who become desperate in a situation they are unprepared for. While Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson are decent in their roles, the supporting cast members like Olga Dihovichnaya and especially Ariyon Bakare were the real standouts of this film. Bakare's character as the scientist Hugh who develops a fondness for the creature at the start was really the most compelling and complex character out of the entire crew.<br/><br/>But the best character is the monster of the movie nicknamed ""Calvin"". While the lifeform's design is not as original as compared to the classic Xenomorph, its personality, and intelligence makes it scarily unpredictable. When Calvin ""awakens"", it starts as something innocent and almost cute. But once it feels like it is threatened, Calvin goes on the offensive and evolves to become a more formidable and deadly being. The creature's methods of killing are disturbing and feel very malevolent and twisted.<br/><br/>What throws me off from completely loving this movie is the final act. The first two acts are great because they are simple. Act one is discovering the lifeform and Act two is trying to kill it. But Act three becomes overly complicated without being properly setup and leads to problematic decision-making. And the way the film ends I was not a fan. The twist felt very cynical and depressing while still being very easy to predict. I enjoy certain twist endings like recently in Snowpiercer and 10 Cloverfield Lane because they elevate the story and themes. The ending this movie chooses felt like it was just there to be different without having anything to offer. In the end, it makes the efforts of the characters feel like a waste of time and progression. <br/><br/>Life is not original by story-standards but knows how to capture the same moments of tension and suspense that made the first Alien film memorable along with great characters. While the ending is its biggest weakness, its strengths work to make this one of the more enjoyable sci fi movies in recent years."

","It could've been better, but it's still thrilling and a lot of fun. One reviewer even said it's illogical, but it's a Sci-Fi movie about alien life!! If you liked Passengers and Alien, then definitely watch this. Just don't expect an original story, that's all. It ends perfectly in my opinion."
"doorsscorpywag","8","1","9","4 June 2017"," Life and death in space a fun ride
","OK we all know it was a bit of a borrow from Alien. But The Hunger Games did well doing a makeover to the brilliant Battle Royale so sometimes this thing works.<br/><br/>An international space station built to receive samples of soil from Mars and it's 6 crew start the show rather over dramatically having to capture the probe sent from Mars. A bit daft but the cast was good and were fleshed out a bit to be rather likable.<br/><br/>The Biologist finds a single celled organism and the world now knows for certain what has been obvious to anyone with half a bit of sense that we are not alone in the Universe.<br/><br/>Of course anyone who has seen science fiction will know that it can't be happily concluded and all Hell will break out soon enough.<br/><br/>One thing we do know from Movies is Earth sends some silly people into space in the future. Ridley Scott's disaster of an Alien Prequel Part 1 & 2 a perfect example. And this space station is no different but the story is good moving at a reasonably fast pace with some stirring set pieces and a damn fine conclusion.<br/><br/>Obviously as the organism grows and shows signs of intelligence we only need someone to make a mistake and soon enough a pressure outage makes the organism become dormant. After living dormant on Mars for who knows how long it should have been a guess it was a pretty hardy little critter. But the crew must have missed Alien and use electricity to stimulate it. Big Mistake.<br/><br/>Anyway after an Alien like series of set pieces that were pretty good they resolve the problem. Or Maybe they don't. I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>A cracking twist ending and a pretty solid piece of Sci Fi. Of course people did silly things but if they did everything professionally we would not have a story. And after the disappointment of watching Alien: Covenant I enjoyed this piece of hokum.<br/><br/>I give it 8#"

"bankofmarquis","7","1","12","25 March 2017"," Tense thriller reminiscent of Alien
","As faithful readers of the BankofMarquis Movie Reviews know, I am a sucker for ""Ten Little Indians"" style monster flicks.  You know...the kind of flick where a finite group of people are stranded in an isolated location and a monster (or an Alien) picks them off one by one until just one (or two) are left to battle the monster/Alien.  I even put out a TOP TEN list of these flicks a few years ago.<br/><br/>LIFE, the new movie from Swedish Director Daniel Espinso (Safe House, Child 44), follows very nicely in  the footsteps of these films as it tells the story of 6 Astronauts on an International Space Station orbiting the Earth that encounter an Alien Life Form that will threaten the very existence of life on Earth unless they can figure out a way to stop them.<br/><br/>This film could have been another ""pleasant enough for a rainy, grey Saturday afternoon sort of thing, but Espinosa did something interesting here, he cast some VERY strong actors in this movie and their work sets this standard monster movie just a slight notch above others in this genre.<br/><br/>Jake Gylenhaal has become a ""mark of quality"" actor for me.  He just doesn't pick bad movies to be in and he doesn't give a bad performance.  Such is the case here.  His Dr. David Gordon is fraught with what Gylenhall usually brings to the table, quiet, confident quirkiness that is tinged with just an edge of uncertainty.  Add to this the ""charisma a go-go"" of Ryan Reynolds and the steady sincerity of Rebecca Ferguson and the core of this film is strong indeed.  Add to this an International cast of Hiroyuki Sanada, Olga Dihovichnaya and Ariyon Bakare and we have one of the strongest groups of ""cannon fodder"" that we have seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>But make no mistake, these films rise and fall on the Monster/Alien that is attacking and in Life, they have a darn good one.  Named ""Calvin"" this alien (like the one in ALIEN) starts small and continues to grow throughout the film to become a formidable, seemingly indestructible force.<br/><br/>The effects work well enough (though you can tell, at times, that the Astronauts aren't floating but, rather, being pulled on wires) and I wish I could have told the Director to be more original in his ending, but all-in-all I was very entertained.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that this film is being called the third ALIEN film.  I don't think so - that would be John Carpenter's THE THING.  But, if you wish to call LIFE the 4th Alien film, I would be fine with that.<br/><br/>And so will you.<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  Solid B<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"Theo Robertson","7","1","15","26 March 2017"," Movie Bingo. Full House !
","Getting a bit bored with watching Iranian New Wave cinema I stroked my chin wondering what would qualify as the complete polar opposite . Sci-fi horror ? Maybe. After all for the vast majority of human beings we simply go to the cinema to be entertained and being thrilled and chilled by far fetched fictional horror is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Hollywood has been churning out science fiction big hitters in the last few months via ARRIVAL and PASSENGERS but this film LIFE - yet another SF movie with a minimalist title - seemed to be one that would really appeal to me . Only downside is that even critics who liked it such as Mark Kermode noticed it's a film without an original bone in its body <br/><br/>!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!! <br/><br/>Well one thing we can all agree on is that the professional critics are all singing from the same hymn sheet . Right from the out-set when we're introduced to the international multi-ethnic cast and when you've got that then it's best not to become attached to anyone who doesn't have white skin and speaks English as a first language. It also helps if you stop asking yourself questions like ""If they're supposed to be clever scientists why do they so many dumb things ?"" You know why . It's because scientists in films - unlike the audience watching - have never seen this type of genre film and if they did something sensible the film would stop long before the 90 minute mark. It's what is known as ""The Idiot Plot"" <br/><br/>Unless LIFE is the only sci-fi horror film you've seen then if nothing else you can have a lot of fun spotting all the other movie references . By the one hour mark I'd ticked off every box , shouted ""FULL HOUSE"" and wondered if I'd be getting any award for my observational skills . Nothing was forth coming but any rewards come via the traditional escapist way of storytelling . LIFE is rather diverting escapist popcorn entertainment . The predictable manner of the narrative isn't really a negative criticism though the director's technique of constantly using close ups to generate tension and having constant intrusive music be played is slightly overdone. You'll also probably work out the shock ending before it arrives on screen but despite all this - or maybe because of it - I found LIFE a very entertaining movie"

","I remember watching advertisements for this film years ago, and then it fell off the face of the Earth. Suddenly, I remembered this film existed and became eager to watch it. While I will say this film does a PHENOMENAL job with the intense scenes, that's about it. It is just a slasher space film, but this time the slasher isn't Jason, it's Calvin. At the end of the film, I asked myself if I knew any of the characters names. Somewhat to my surprise, I couldn't. Again, this is a slasher film, but getting to know the characters a little more is always helpful, and it makes their deaths more meaningful. Overall Life was a poor execution of a space slasher film, and I don't speak for others, but I would much rather watch Jason-X."

"killercharm","4","0","1","13 June 2020"," This movie made me tired
","I have no problem with the similarity to Alien and other movies where people have to battle an omnipotent creature. Just because Alien was made doesn't mean that storyline is taboo. It was done before Alien many times and after many times. It will be done over and over because that's one of the reasons one creates a nonhuman entity, to give it seemingly all powerful capability. Alien doesn't own the idea, but I still look for a story well told. This is a lame story told by competent technicians. A pretty, well-made movie with poor writing is just that. I'm a horror fan, a horror fanatic, to the point that I buy into the whole ""people in horror stories do stupid things, get over it"" conceit, but if you start with astronauts they are supposed to be a wee but intelligent and a wee bit trained. If every single one of them reacts to the admittedly unnerving situation stupidly, even the ones who are watching the story unfold and have time to gather their thoughts, well then you've destroyed too much credibility. It was bad enough that they 1. took so long to rescue the Hugh Derry character or 2. rescued him out of the lab at all, but for every single one of them to blunder so blatantly became tedious. Once Miranda North tried to get back into the air lock, and once they tried to HELP her back in, it was like Why Bother? My other beef is that they never touched on the fact that the alien was only defending itself. They took it from its home planet and started giving it shocks! They never once tried to communicate. I will say that there were some gripping moments during the chase inside the space station. That's not enough."

","I so want to enjoy this movie more than I actually do, and much of this longing is spurred on by the creature design and development. The folks who came up with this menace are genuinely intelligent and creative people, and their work shines brightly. It is an insidious and curious creature, much like mankind, and has a varied maturity rate and reacts to stimuli in manners that aren't unrealistic. Its movement patterns and adaptations all reflect a life born of zero g environ.
Unfortunately, the script writers didn't spend near as much time with their human counterparts.
Here are some facts that counter the very basis of this movies drama and plot:
The ISS is no where near as large as portrayed in this movie. It's far more confined and claustrophobic. It is also no where near and poorly lit (before the alien) as portrayed.
Many of the characters are too human, and rely heavily on their emotions to make life and death decisions. NASA doesn't recruit or send people who can't or won't immediately handle the stresses bestowed on them in a rational manner.
There is no question that there are real life protocols this film chooses to ignore, especially concerning first contact. NASA and other government funded projects have think tanks upon think tanks who have dreamt of this scenario, not withstanding the vast collective of fiction in all media to draw upon. They have checks and balances.
To hinge this films entire plot around constant human error is a slap to those professionals' careers and achievements.
But it is a Hollywood fiction, so maybe I should let it pass?
No. One of the rules of great writing is not to deny your premise, a mistake instantly made in the first 20 minutes of this film.
Kudos to ththe effects and design teams though. They saved this film from being completely unbearable."

"CriticalRaccoon","5","0","1","12 February 2020"," Okay, but far inferior to the movies it blatently rips off
","Is it weird to call a movie painfully okay?<br/><br/>Life (2017) is director Daniel Espinosa's (Safe House, Child 44) foray into the space horror genre which can best be described as an adequate disappointment. Yes, that makes sense, let me explain.<br/><br/>I can say that without any doubt that you have seen this movie before. Oh, probably not Life (2017), but I mean the numerous other films that it is either homaging or just plain ripping off. The primary film is, of course, Ridley Scott's class film Alien with a sprinkling of Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in there too. There's also a lot of elements from the criminally underappreciated Danny Boyle meditative space thriller Sunshine (2007), and I'm not just talking about the fact that Hiroyuki Sanada is somehow in both.<br/><br/>It's sometime in the near future and a probe from Mars is returning home with soil samples that contain micro-organisms which are the first sign of life outside of Earth. Our intrepid crew - includes Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson - all race to catch this craft aboard the International Space Station. It's confusing what's going on as we've never been introduced to any of these characters, and this long tracking shot of events does both intrigue and befuddle me as no other shot afterwards ever does this (yay Gravity I guess). Things go as well as can be and surely enough they bring a single-cell Martian life form back from the dead. It's an interesting few moments - a chance to reflect on what pure discovery is, and one about the very nature of life itself. When the film does slow down it does so in smart, sometimes provocative ways.<br/><br/>This being a monster movie, you know that Calvin will, of course, not remain the most friendly of creatures. When the lead scientist makes one small error and Calvin returns to sleep, the trained experts aboard the ISS come up with a solution: electrocute it with a handheld cattle-prod. I'm sure you're as shocked as I am that this was, perhaps, not the best of ideas.<br/><br/>Calvin wakes up, gets defensive, and attacks the scientist via the most aggressive handshake I've seen since the classic film Hot Shots. It gets out because this ""quarantine lab"" has a vent system that's hooked up to the rest of the station, then proceeds to start munching on whatever food it can find and grows up to the size of an octopus. Seriously, this station's idea of ""quarantine"" is a single door and a glass box with rubber gloves.<br/><br/>What follows is a bog-standard Alien knock-off, complete with things being shoved down throats and a ""no matter what, we can't let this thing get to Earth"" moment. As they hunt Calvin it's clear that these characters are ill-prepared and inept to the point of farce. They try to burn it, suffocate it, blast it into space, all with disastrous results for them, including screwing up the ISS's orbit and making it fall towards Earth - thus potentially threatening all of mankind. I get that the film wanted stakes higher than just the safety of the crew, but could you at least somehow have Calvin be the instrument of the impending doom, not the characters doing it themselves?<br/><br/>In the end, of course, when it's down to our final characters, Life (2017) presents us with exactly what everyone in the audience saw telegraphed. It oddly didn't rip off Alien's end - instead going for a more The Outer Limits finale. After the final shot fades away and the credits begin, it's almost gleeful in the way it cuts to one of the most inappropriate end credit songs I've ever heard - almost the only original thought the movie had. Life (2017) may finally have ended, but if a film leaves zero impact, did it really happen?<br/><br/>You notice how I didn't bother to name the characters? Yeah, that's for a reason. The crew aren't really made up of characters, more like they're made up of three actors you recognize, and three that are 100% part of the dinner menu. We know their profession - with Rebecca Ferguson reminding us she's a quarantine officer every chance she can - but otherwise they're just random people. I do wonder if the first ten minutes of the movie are just missing due to the lack of setup. Heck, a defining trait of one of the characters is that they are paralyzed from the waist down; a revelation made about halfway through the movie which reinforces my belief that scenes are just missing.<br/><br/>That leads me into something else that bugged me throughout my entire time with Life (2017): I just didn't care if our heroes lived or died and felt no fear for their safety. Life (2017) is made up of many scary parts. Space, being trapped in confinement, aliens, imminent death, all of those things are scary. They just don't work here. In Alien we knew who the crew were with their unique looks and personalities; it gave us a long and proper introduction to them and we feared for them as they faced down death-incarnate. Life (2017) never gives us a chance to know who we are supposed to worry about. The creature, too, doesn't really become the thing of nightmares it's supposed to; if the crew never really look terrified of it then why should I?<br/><br/>Remember how I called Life (2017) painfully okay? Yeah, for me this film at times was agonizing because it's just too competent. The film itself, in isolation, is decently acted and paced, and has a few moments that do utilize its setting rather well. Absent other films I would be fine with recommending it as an enjoyable piece of science fiction cinema. In a different universe I'd probably even like Life (2017). The pain comes from knowing that this film exists in the same universe as far superior ones, and no amount of competent filmmaking in Life (2017) will stop me from saying that you should just see Alien instead. This is the rare movie that I'd say would be a better film if it was worse.<br/><br/>If there's a word to describe my feelings sitting through Life (2017) it's this: melancholy. It's one of the most ""okay"" and least original movies I've ever seen and it doesn't ever try to be anything more. There are some tense scenes, it's relatively well made, and I can't really say I ever got bored by Life (2017), but I just didn't enjoy it as much as the stuff it's blatantly borrowing from. I was just left with the feeling like I should go watch Alien, Gravity, or Sunshine (2007) instead; Life (2017)'s only impact is to remind you of better movies."

The alien never once showed any form of intelligence in regards to how to control computer systems, and by the time it took over the guys body, they would have already been floating into deep space. Whereas the other capsule, even though taking a hit with some debris, for the sake of the plot, completely malfunctions.

","There as never been so much drama and action in space.<br/><br/>In the start, the movie reminds you heavily of some Star Trek episodes. But here, they seemingly were determined to leave out the meditative, thoughtful climate and ignite the full action instead. And there is a lot of it, from start to end. For the sake of it, any reflective behaviour as expected by astronauts is left out. In fact, towards the end you wished that ""firewall stage 3"", to blow up the space station, would been have put into action in first place.<br/><br/>I guess it could be amusing entertainment stuff in the real ISS station, where I imagine the fun is given in spartanic doses and the life might be pretty boring.<br/><br/>CGI and settings are very nice, 4 stars for them.

"daryopeek","6","0","2","8 July 2019"," It's like slasher movie in space setting
","Life takes my interest due to the usual premise but there are A-star Hollywood actors in the cast list. What makes it so good? Upon watching up until the 30 minutes or so mark, the movie only reminds me of a slasher flick with space context, no additional comment. But, at least this movie invent new villain unlike Jason X.<br/><br/>Honestly, by the time demise happens, some of their actions are laughable, because the only argument lies in the ""protocol"" and there are no exploration of the space station, the true nature of the thing, the raw problem solving, and others elements that make me gain interest to the movie. I believe other sci-fi movies trying to give lots of technical procedures to make us enchanted, this movie follows pretty much the same, instead they don't make it real catchy/smart. You'll going to remember stupid actions by targets in slasher flick are comparable with this movie. The only thing that makes me keep watching this movie is to know whether the ending or the climax will be similar like slasher movies.<br/><br/>The actors in the movie also don't have many scenes to show their acting, however some of them fall flat and just makes the buildups using backstories and so on went off. Is it the direction they are going? If yes, I feel this movie is too prolonged on telling the stories that never going to be used. It's like a slasher though, how many times you told this family is so lovely and attached, they die and it's over.<br/><br/>The only thing that I like is the ending that so different than many sci-fi horror films, it is brave to be that unconventional. Since this movie doesn't attract me in the first place, the ending just makes a nice touch to make me think ""Okay, you just redeem yourself. But I'm not going to love you religiously"""

But remember s good monster movie is a roller coaster ride not Shakespeare ok ? And it recovering only almost twice its production cost of 58 million - which as everyone in Hollywood movie business knows is not a win unless it brings in 3 times its cost is labeled a flop. But all that finance Mumbo Jumbo aside, I felt the flick was quite terrifying and visually well made. The monster looked credible and well developed visually, growing and expanding its size and capabilities as it took on more food ( a mouse and then humans! ) it seemed quite scientifically to make sense - anything that could live in a space hibernation dormancy for billions of years must have developed as a superior dominant life form over a much longer time period and so have a quite highly developed predatory intelligence and adaptability to all extremes and as the plot projects it seems it likely may have wiped out all life on mars..... thus to the scientific and fantasyland moviegoers can see a quite credible and horrifying monster that just possibly could exist out there is space somewhere... And foolish little humanity comes along and enables it by ""investigating its life capabilities"" as so creates the exact nourishment for the perfect killing system we cannot stop, out fight or out think. Quit an ultimate terror to contemplate in real life huh ? I think so. SCARY!"
"tillman-89878","7","0","2","22 September 2018"," Alien meets Gravity with a dash of Evolution
","Spoilers ahead<br/><br/>Reading some of the other reviews there seems to be a concensus that ""Calvin"" was piloting the pod at the end so I want to address this first. It wasn't. Jordan (Jake Gyllenhal) spelled out what his plan was: the escape pod is auto-piloted to return to earth and he was going to override this to steer the tragectory away from the planet. He literally said if he takes his hand away from the controls too soon the autopilot would take over again. It's this that we see, Calvin gripping his arms so he couldn't reach the controls. Whether this was intentional (not in the sense that Calvin knew doing so would kick the autopilot in but more likely it knew whatever Jordan was doing would be a threat to it's life) or it was just attacking him and doing so was a fortunate move from Calvin's pov I don't know.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film. Yes it's clear that the plot is heavily influenced by Alien and obviously fails to reach the bar set by that classic. But I think setting the story closer to home, in present day and on a craft that actually exists adds a sense of ""what if?"" that Alien doesn't have.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, though Ryan Reynolds was playing Ryan Reynolds a little too much for my liking. Yes the decisions the crew make during the film are questionable (and that's being polite), but I can let that go in order to move the plot along. If they had applied logic the movie would have finished an hour earlier. And the logic at least was not as bad as that seen in Prometheus or Alien: Covenant.<br/><br/>I only really have two criticisms of the film. 
1 was that Calvin growing from a single celled organism to the cgi squid that seems to be the favoured depiction of alien lifeforms by Hollywood these days in so little time was too reminiscent of the single celled organism in Evolution. But at least there was an attempt at explanation. Alien is one of my all time favourite films but one thing I've always disliked is that the chestburster grows into the Xenomorph we all know and love in very little time without seemingly consuming anything to accelerate its growth. Here at least we're told it's consuming things like coolant to make it grow.
2 is that early on in the film Calvin survives outside in space for approx 10 mins and the crew assume it's storing oxygen. Later the crew try to kill it by trapping it in sections of ISS and starving those compartments of oxygen. Sorry but if it can survive the vacuum of space an oxygen free room ain't gonna do diddly.<br/><br/>Overall I doubt this film has much rewatchability but it was a decent effort with some great 'made you jump' moments that happily filled a couple of hours. The twist was obvious from the moment the lifeboats undocked but did not lose its suspense despite this. It's set up nicely for a sequel that I doubt we'll ever get. Which is probably a good thing, if this film was Alien closer to home a sequel would undoubtedly be Aliens closer to home."

","I enjoyed this movie, the acting is solid, and I like the characters. It's also quite horrifying, it builds suspense well and it remains enjoyable to watch throughout. The main reason why I decided to leave this review is because it definitely doesn't deserve all the 1 star reviews, people saying how unrealistic it is, it's just plain annoying. It seems like everyone thinks they're some sort of physics professor or rocket scientist in that they think they know everything, like how can these small details about a sci fi movie being 'unrealistic' ruin the experience for you. And besides, it's better than all the Marvel garbage that's been horribly overproduced in recent years.<br/><br/>If you fancy watching a solid, suspenseful sci fi/horror, with a decent storyline then I totally recommend giving it a watch. And sure, some extra attention to detail concerning 'realism', and some more stylised cinematography could have elevated Life closer to 10/10. It may not go down in history as one of the all time greats in sci fi/horror, but at the same time is far from being a B-movie."

I really wanted to love this movie because I enjoy the genre and I am a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal's acting. I went into it expecting to love the movie, but of course I was a bit disappointed by the aforementioned criticisms.

Seems folks've decided it's a premise rehash of the ""Alien"" series. I say... eh... sure, it's a kind of hurdle that the film would need to clear to hold our attentions. But I feel the film clears that particular hurdle nicely. It makes stylistic decisions that mark it as a clean, new approach to the whole sub-genre of ""contact"" films. At any rate, sizing it up against ""Alien(s)"" to me seems like a tepid basis for a negative evaluation.<br/><br/>What I appreciate is how enormously crafty the whole enterprise (of making this flick) is. The writing, pacing, editing, direction, everything comes together to make something... artful. And I *always* like to see artfulness in a movie. Not enough of that.<br/><br/>There may some divergence from this view on the basis that the film plods, or otherwise fritters itself away with a deficit of needed ""action""; I say; the balance of action and interstitial quiet dramatics as the crew attempts to resolve its ever-morphing ""issue"" is perfect. One of the things I really loved about the flick was the writing; the dialog. I was surprised to find that the writing drew me in with its simplicity and plaintiveness. You really believe these are folks on a space mission--highly educated and trained, with distinguishing qualities of character--but ultimately just folks... you, me, anyone. Great, great writing, and seen too, too seldom in movies these days. Refreshing!<br/><br/>So all that's really left is an overview of the story management, and technique in general.<br/><br/>I'm thankful that the story had an decent ending. Ending a story well is like an end-game in chess; the hardest part of the game. I thought the flick ended a damn sight better than all too many others.<br/><br/>In terms of general technique, I found the sets, visuals. and effects in general to be fine and conducive to the suspension of my disbelief; I could ""relax"" and take in the harrowing narrative.<br/><br/>Will you like the movie?

"BlueFox94","6","0","2","26 August 2018"," Life: A Monster House...in Space!
","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)<br/><br/>With the Alien franchise delivering a new installment in a few months and just a few years removed from the emotional and visual roller-coaster that was 2013's Gravity, I felt positive about this new ensemble sci-fi thriller directed by Swedish director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Child 44). It boasts an international ensemble cast, which includes Ryan Reynolds reuniting with his Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, and forecast its arrival with memorable trailers - many centering on the moment where the cute little alien creature turns on the scientist studying it while his crewmates watch. Either a thrilling b-movie or a compact, ambitious, and intelligent sci-fi thriller could result from this venture. Having now experienced Life (the film, not my own), what irks me and will irk me for some time is that the film tries to be both and barely manages to be tolerable.<br/><br/>Set in the present day, Life follows a six-member, multinational crew currently inhabiting the International Space Station, tasked with retrieving a returning capsule from Mars and examining the soil samples contained within while in Earth orbit. British biologist Dr. Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) manages to extract a dormant, single-celled organism from one of the samples and revive it, much to the delight of his crewmates. The organism matures in a short amount of time into a multi-celled, stimulus-sensitive organism that quarantine officer Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) notes is ""all muscle, all brain, and all eye."" The schoolchildren of America, monitoring the mission from the surface, decide to call the organism ""Calvin"". Several days later, when an atmospheric accident in the lab causes Calvin - now a palm-sized, fluorescent, flower-shaped creature - to become dormant once again, Dr. Derry suggests prodding Calvin with a mild electric shock. The rest of the crew - Russian Commander Katerina Golovkina (Olga Dihovnichaya), American medical officer Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Japanese engineer Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), and cocky American pilot Rory ""Roy"" Adams (Ryan Reynolds) watch from the opposite side of the glass as Dr. Derry inserts his hands into the protective gloves stretching into the quarantine cage and begins to re-animate Calvin with the electric shocks.<br/><br/>What follows is every astronaut's nightmare - a slaughterhouse in space, where there's nowhere to escape, a lifeless void separates them from potential rescue, and much of the crew's time and mental power is spent early on trying to also keep the expensive house intact if possible.<br/><br/>From the trailers, one can grasp a modern-day mashup of both Alien, the 1979 sci-fi horror film by director Ridley Scott, and Gravity, the 2013 space thriller from director Alfonso Cuarón, with the multinational crew from director Danny Boyle's 2007 film Sunshine tossed in as well (Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada appears in both Sunshine and this). The opening sequence in which the crew scrambles to secure the approaching Mars capsule that has sustained small asteroid hits during its transit certainly emulates the opening to Cuarón's film with its smooth long-take approach and well-choreographed blocking of actors. From there, the story coasts through the first month of their orbital mission, until Calvin's decisive electric shock treatment.<br/><br/>About the time that the shock treatment leads Calvin to turn against the crew, I start to sense that director Espinosa has yet to fully deliver the dramatic thrills necessary for me to become invested in the ensemble's plight. The rest of the film, outside of the opening capsule retrieval sequence, offers close camerawork and editing that generates a fast pace, unlike the spacious environments and ominous, patient progression of Alien. This fast pace, furthermore, limits drastically the screentime for the proper fleshing out of the individual crew members, especially when one can tell who's most likely to survive the end of the film based on star power (or a promotional image, like the one above). Compare that to Gravity, which centers almost entirely on Sandra Bullock's character.<br/><br/>The problem ultimately lies with the rudimentary treatment of the characters, many of whom I barely remember upon leaving theater aside from some basic details, the manners of dying, and who survives. Life attempts to bring together a patiently layered ensemble showcase with what's basically a one-woman show, not to mention a complex horror think-piece that hides the monster instead of showing it (like in this film) with a simple journey of getting from A to B that bolsters incredible technical craft. Even for a skillful director, it's almost impossible to marry the approaches to those two types of stories without compromising on character development.<br/><br/>The instinctive reaction to fall back on older films suggests another central flaw of Life - it falls short in offering anything original and memorable. As a sci-fi thriller, it meets modest ambitions by evoking other cinematic sci-fi landmarks and little else, and audiences are mostly just along for the ride, rarely treated to a thorough build-up of tension, much less fear, when registering the characters' choices. It comes off as forced and unimpressive when the end of act two, deus ex machina moment of rest for the surviving crew members gravitates around a children's nighttime story and not a meditation on fate, purpose, and perhaps God's hand in their eventual demise. The sole displays of power in this film are the gruesome, bloody, traumatic deaths - the kind common in a tired slasher film, which alone says enough.<br/><br/>What, then, is Life? Life reminds filmmakers and audiences that they'll need more than just the concept to create a truly horrifying work of cinematic sci-fi, even though the concept tends to deliver a competent work anyway. Competency, however, can only last so long and one can guess that director Daniel Espinosa and company would've preferred not only the commercial success (having amassed only half of its production budget in its opening weekend worldwide box office), but the lasting legacy that will most likely elude this film by 2017's end.<br/><br/>R.N.B."

Overall, I give this movie a 6 because of the suspense of the movie, and for trying something a little different compared to other alien movies.

As members of the crew conduct their research, the rapidly evolving life-form proves far more intelligent and terrifying than anyone could have imagined.<br/><br/>Plot - 3.5/5<br/><br/>Altough Life's plot isn't anything original, it's still in the higher end of the movies regarding this concept. Not only does it create a suspensful atmosphere through the whole film, but it also seems like a realisitic situation humanity might face if we ever found an outside being (which is something i enjoyed about this movie). I have to say though, the script is slightly messy, making the story predictable during the third act, making some key points in the story not as impactful while watching the movie.<br/><br/>Characters - 3/5<br/><br/>Probably the weakest part of the movie. The characters in this movie are so ignorant and make so many stupid decisions that at the end you stop caring about them. Also, most of them are pretty bland, not showing much personality, making scenes with long dialogue really boring. Most of the time i never thought that this characters knew what they were getting into while in this mission, which made the movie less believable.<br/><br/>Acting - 5/5<br/><br/>No surprise on this. Gyllenhaal, Ferguson, and Reynolds give amazing performances, which helped a lot with the tension the movie was trying to build up. The other astronauts also offered great performances, and it's really sad that all these actors potential was wasted due to the poor handling of the characters.<br/><br/>Direction and Editing - 4.5/5<br/><br/>Daniel Espinoza delivers his best movie yet. It's beautifuly shot, really well edited and crafted. Both the opening and ending scenes are really well done, shiwing the potential that Espinoza can do when given a good script. It's sad that he didn't work as hard with the main plot and the characters than he did on the visuals, but overall a great job from him.<br/><br/>Visuals and Soundtrack - 5/5<br/><br/>As mentioned various times through this review, this movie is gorgeous to look at. The cgi looks really believable, even though it's present basically in 90% of the movie, and at no point did i doubt this couldn't be real. The main alien on this movie is really well done, with an original design that makes it both terrifying but good to look at. The soundctrack helps build the tension, and it isn't overused or overplayed in the movie.<br/><br/>Final Grade. B+"

","Continuing the lineage of films such as ""It!

All of the action is in/around the ISS's 'zero-G' environment, which is very well done, and provides an opportunity for a novel and imaginative creature design. The film has some pacing problems, with interludes of dialogue (about the children's book for example) dulling the mounting tension and there too many plot holes (see 'goofs' section) to get really caught up in the story. The behavior of the alien is inconsistent and its capabilities vague and 'convenient' (for example, it needs oxygen yet can survive in a vacuum when the plot needs it to do so). I also found the tension quickly deflated every time the characters referred to the predatory Martian as ""Calvin"" (I don't know why the writers indulged in this conceit, can you imagine ""Alien"" with Ripley and Dallas scouring the 'Nostromo' with flame throwers looking for a 'Calvin'?). Unfortunately, ""Life"" is like a lot of recent big CGI-driven spectaculars, great to look at as long as you don't think too much about what you are seeing."

However, Life has a couple film aspects that were great to see on screen. First, this was truly an all-star cast lifted by Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson. Second, the monster's CGI was excellent, and its own origins and development are interesting to the story.
As a whole, the storyline and editing where managed with precision and made the movie very fluid and go by fast.

","Life<br/><br/>This movie is always going to be compared to Alien.
No matter how much restraint a film reviewer has. Eventually the comparison will be highlighted.
So I'm not going to beat about the bush. I'm just going to come out and say it. This movie is the closest thing to an Alien remake as we are going to get, and by no means is this meant as a negative. 
Life compared to the recent Alien sequels is a masterpiece.
However if you compare it to Ridley Scott's original Alien movie or James Cameron's slightly superior sequel then we may have a problem.
In isolation Life is bloody good movie.
Director Daniel Espinosa has sculptured a taught nail biting suspenseful horror thriller. The likes of which hasn't been seen since the first two Alien movies.
While the plot is very similar to what has gone before I can't help but admit I thoroughly enjoyed this modern take on an old formula.
You all know how it goes. A group of overly curious scientists find a life form from another planet. They proceed to poke and prod it until it becomes rather pissed off and then sets about offing each one of them in a progressively more gruesome fashion.
It's been done before countless times but that doesn't stop the audience having a good time.<br/><br/>The good time had is down to the superb cast, the mostly excellent CGI and fine direction.
The script is a mediocre affair that generates enough interest in the characters to have the audience care.
A fine actor such as Jake Gyllenhaal is given just enough to do even if his character is the most under developed.
Ryan Reynolds plays himself, yet again this is not a criticism. I could watch the guy in anything.
Come on he's Deadpool for goodness sakes.<br/><br/>This is a fine looking movie.
There's hints of films that have gone before. The likes of Gravity, Sunshine and even Event Horizon.
One particular scene involving the female lead Miranda played by Rebecca Ferguson and an escape pod is almost identical to the scene with Sandra Bullock in Gravity.
Once again not a criticism, just an observation that the director has a fondness for the genre.<br/><br/>The creature causing all the havoc is wonderfully realised on screen and is most visually effective in its juvenile state.
The first attack inside the lab involving Hugh played by Ariyon Bakare is very creepy and gruesome.
This is where it is apparent that suspense is going to play a key role throughout this movie.
The creature loses some of its realistic texture as a it becomes larger. Becoming just another CGI creation that fails to trick the eye.
A real positive regarding SFX is the attention to detail the CGI wizards have taken in regards to the creatures movement. It is very close to that of an octopus and its frantic scurrying is most unnerving.<br/><br/>There's a claustrophobic feel to the entire production which adds to the suspense. The feeling of helplessness oozes from the screen as the Alien creation outwits the cast at every turn.
A particular scene involving Hiroyuki Sanada's character and a sleeping chamber further exaggerates the sensation of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>I believe this movies biggest asset is the lack of expectation that was placed upon its shoulders.
If this movie had indeed been presented as an Alien sequel or remake then I think it would have failed on the same level as the recent Alien Covenant.
However having this film marketed as a vehicle for Gyllenhaal, Reynolds and Ferguson it allows the film to demonstrate its own attributes.
As aforementioned this is a taught suspenseful thriller with just enough individual ingredients added to make a satisfying end product.
It's not a clone of what's gone before, more of a nod or thank you to Sci Fi greats of the past."

This pains me to read. For one simple reason. Just because Alien deals with an alien coming on-board a spaceship and killing people on board, doesn't mean other movies can't tackle this subject. Remember, we live in a society where all stories has been told. There are only new ways of telling the same story. Taking that into account, I found it very interesting to take the Alien setting and place it so close to earth in a realistic environment. We have the ISS. There are experiments being done on ISS. An alien like Calvin doing irreparable damage does not seem so far fetch anymore. It hits a lot closer to home! Saying a movie is bad because it resembles another movie, is the same as saying a Honda Civic is bad because it has the same parameters as a Toyota Corolla. It doesn't work that way, people!<br/><br/>So with that out of the way. Jake Gyllenhaal definitely carries the movie. Aside from Ryan Reynolds, he's the most interesting character in this movie. Close 2nd is Hiroyuki Sanada, with his character becoming a new father right before everything goes awry. The captain, played by Olga Dykhovichnaya and the ""Firewall specialist"" played by Rebecca Ferguson are less interesting however. They both seem to have this awkward expositional purpose to everything they say. As if the writers sort of created them in order to convey important information to the audience, that could've been done smarter.<br/><br/>Now, addressing some fellow reviewers who have talked about lack of protocol talking to superiors and the way they work, not being up to normal astronaut standard. Maybe watch the movie and let yourself sink into the universe instead of clamping on to details that are so utterly unimportant? Just because you haven't heard astronaut personal swear on those YouTube livestreams you watch for your ""Research and fact resource"" doesn't mean it doesn't happen. And people react differently in emergency situations. The world within the movie is set up in a special way, and those are the facts of the movie. That's the point of movies! So instead of scrutinizing something that is well within the boundaries of the movie, enjoy it for what it is instead!<br/><br/>So to summarize. A claustrophobic thriller about an alien lifeforms killing humans. You can't expect the next Oscar Winning, instant classes, instant franchise-able movie. That's not what the movie is about. Watch it for what it is! If you do that, you may very well enjoy it as much as I did. Which, I will urge everybody to do in the future. Watch each single movie for what the movie is, and not for what other movies are or will be. Especially if the movie you are about to watch have nothing to do with, say Shawshank Redemption. Then don't compare the two! I only say it because sadly, I see it done far to often. This movie was enjoyable, but if you want to watch a deeply philosophical piece of movie history, that will make you question your very own existence, well then maybe a Science Fiction Thriller is not the way to go."

","Film makers are under pressure to invent. 'Life' definitely introduced a novel concept by Calvin, a complex life-form exclusively comprised of multi-functional (or omni-functional?) cells. I insist, though, that such beings – while making an interesting thought experiment – are highly unrealistic.<br/><br/>Throughout evolution, multi-cell earthlings have grown fit to various environments by developing some complexity. In turn, complexity seems to have always arisen from specialization at some level. That's how we have several kinds of cells in several kinds of tissues in several kinds of organs. Now, I am not suggesting each body part can only have a single function. For example, feathers facilitate motion, but also insulate and protect, not to mention impressing lady birds. But they do not really contribute to metabolism, nor to structural support, nor to the nervous or hormonal management of the body. That would be too much. Obviously, some mechanism honed to one purpose cannot excel in all the totally different functions required for survival. And that is a pattern going well beyond the realms of biology.<br/><br/>Based on comparative advantages, there is a division of labour and accompanying trade between computer parts, individuals, businesses, departments, nations, teammates in sports... you name it.<br/><br/>Or think of polyhistors, who could only thrive before sciences accumulated the vast knowledge of modern times. Nowadays, even mediocre dentists or linguists or plumbers will - in their own fields - probably beat them. Also, a team of such mediocre specialists will beat a polyhistor in every way.<br/><br/>It is only in relatively lukewarm, non-competing environments where aspiring polyhistors can succeed.<br/><br/>In fact, Calvin would have had to originate from such a lukewarm environment, and make a slow, dumb, sickly creature on teeming Earth. (Unless, perhaps, Calvin, too, was designed by some ancient civilization for military purposes...)"

I'm sure you can expect where the plot leads. I think that it's unoriginal, but it's well written and it works, so I can't complain.<br/><br/>Also there's the cast. The cast is good: some known faces, some non so popular, but there's a lot of talented people, and it shows. This combined with a lot of moments that make you feel unconformable, not scared but a bit uneasy, make the movie good to watch.<br/><br/>The problem I have with this movie is that is really forgettable.

","A team of scientists discover a rapidly evolving species on Mars and bring it aboard their International Space Station in order to study it. Things quickly get out of hand when this 'being' manages to break free from its isolation chamber and begins to hunt the crew down one by one.<br/><br/>Life borrows from a great number of films, but it's clearly most heavily influenced by Alien. This in itself doesn't make it a bad film - although on the same note it's also far too safe, predictable and by-the-numbers to be considered as a great work of art. To its credit though once the 'being' escapes the film does become relatively entertaining and the idea of the being picking the scientists off one by one does give the film some intensity - director Daniel Espinosa uses the isolated setting well giving the film a real claustrophobic feel to it - anyone think he's watched the original Alien film on a number of occasions? <br/><br/>As entertaining and enjoyable as Life is to watch it does have certain issues such as poorly developed characters who we don't really learn much about. Naturally this leaves them as merely fodder for the creature rather than people we can actually care about. You'll also have to endure the usual rigmarole of characters making dumb decisions which seem to happen to get the pulse racing as opposed to these decisions being based on logic for example.<br/><br/>Overall then there is some good and some bad here, but I expected an entertaining and enjoyable Alien style knock off and that's pretty much what I got. It didn't blow me away nor did it surprise me, but it entertained me and that's what really matters."

Best part is the ending, the last 2 survivors come up with a plan. There are 2 escape pods, one will lure the creature into it and go into deep space with manual override. The other will make it to earth. Well, the pod going to earth hits debree and is sent of course. And as though the creature is reading the guy's mind, it prevents his hand from holding the controller and it goes to earth.

"jrarichards","6","0","1","13 October 2017"," Does so many things right, and yet...
","On a clinical, objective level, Daniel Espinosa's ""Life"" can easily be regarded as one of the most proficient pieces of sci-fi ever made. A story set in the International Space Station mimics that environment and equals (if not exceeds) ""Gravity"" in allowing us to feel we are really out there in space. It's immaculate and at times awe-inspiring. Beyond that, the spoiler warning is on here anyway, but it is probably no secret to anybody (not least given the title), that this film introduces us to a life form from Mars and has sought - and truly managed - to offer a more convincing portrayal of same than has EVER been achieved on screen before.<br/><br/>So far, so good, but the above use of the words ""clinical"", ""objective"" and ""immaculate"" is not random, for somehow the above virtues cannot overcome a degree of disengagement that the viewer (well this viewer at least) seems to feel. And this happens in spite of an entirely plausible and well-thought-through storyline.<br/><br/>The first problem, then, is that ""Life"" comes on the scene, not as the first, but as maybe the eighth movie concerning hostile (Martian) alien life-forms brought onto a space station or base. And however slick it may be, that means going over ground that is somewhat familiar by now.<br/><br/>The second problem is the ironic fact that at times this work looks too much like a space mission (and hence not like a movie). Ironic that authenticity might be a bit of a turnoff, but here it works that way. It's hard to recall a film in which Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal get to look like extras, but here that is so. That ensures that less-well-known actors actually do better here. Brit Ariyon Bakare and Brit/Swede Rebecca Ferguson appear (movingly for we British audience-members) with Union Flags on their uniforms, while Hiroyuki Sanada has the Rising Sun on his, and Olga Dykhovichnaya the Russian flag on hers. Perhaps we don't have such great expectations of these lesser stars and so on the whole they don't disappoint. But ultimately it may just be that we out here in audience-land are now too spoilt and too jaded to welcome this efficient and occasionally inspired piece of work as we really ought to.<br/><br/>A pity then, and all the more so since one of the goals of the film - rightly enough - was to force us to contemplate what might ACTUALLY happen were life ever to be found somewhere else in the Solar System.<br/><br/>Given all of the potential positives, it is the genuine hope of this reviewer that younger watchers at least will find this ultimately solid piece of work a bright, shiny and thought-provoking revelation as it has every right to be. But for we over-50s, neither superb effects nor reasonable plausibility can overcome that certain sense of deja vu."

","Some probe that collected samples on Mars returns and docks to the ISS. The scientist there starts feeding a cell found on Mars. It does respond and grow. More cells grow that are like stem cells, they serve several functions and aren't specialized. They each are muscle, nerve, and photoreceptors at once. The little creature does respond initially to touch. At some point it goes into hibernation. The scientist decides to zap it with electricity to wake it. It works, but now the creature that looks like a starfish, is angry, grabs the guy's hand and breaks it. It then devours a mouse nearby. Then it grabs the electrical probe to cut through the glove and now it escapes. Another astronaut, a big mouth American decides to play cowboy and rescue the scientist from the isolated lab. He does succeed with the rescue, but fails in his attempt to burn the alien creature, which is called Calvin. It in turns grabs him, kills him and somehow feeds off him and grows even more right in front of the eyes of the rest of the crew, which now tries to keep the firewall intact. But Calvin escapes to the outside where it survives no problem and destroys the ISS's communications. When the commander does a spacewalk to fix comms, the creature kills her as well.<br/><br/>Calvin makes it back inside and terrorizes the rest of the crew. Earth control sends another spaceship to dock to the ISS and push it into outer space because occasionally the ISS falls into decaying orbit threatening to make it to earth. And apparently, as always in these movies, on top of everything, they are short on fuel. The issue here is that no matter what, the martian lifeform cannot make it back to earth. That's also the mission of the English CDC astronaut on board--ensure by any means possible that it doesn't happen.<br/><br/>By now, the remaining crew decide to use the escape pods. One to send Calvin to outer space and one to make it back to earth. But only one person can fit in each pod.<br/><br/>Life surprised me. I didn't expect such an entertaining and exciting movie. Like most of these space movies at first the camera work is just too orchestrated and annoying in all it's turns and rotations. Eventually once we focus on the story things improve a lot. There's some attempt to give this ultra-multicultural cast of characters some depth, but it didn't really work. Not to mention that I didn't care about any of these people. Calvin steals the show, as a visually fascinating creature, at times beautiful yet menacing. Much of what happens in Life is the usual stuff that happens to characters in sci-fi space movies, nevertheless, it's done so well in this movie that it had me completely involved."

The strength of Life lays in the fact that all characters do have a leading role and that some die rather quickly. It's a new way of making films or series these days, Just look at Game Of Thrones or The Walking Dead, they do the same. But mentioning both series, they do offer gore and horror and a lot of red stuff.<br/><br/>Life doesn't do that but the effects are also stunning.

Rebecca Ferguson is in this film and similar to gyllenhall she does a decent job despite the fact her character is pretty boring. Ryan Reynolds is in this film and he is easily the best part of this film, he provides his usual charismatic charm that makes him the one really likable person in this film. The rest of the cast are really underdeveloped and you won't really care about any of them. The story of the film is as mentioned before not original, you have seen it all before and there isn't really anything that stands out. That is except the ending which I really loved, no spoilers but it really was a unique interesting ending. The script started off pretty strong with some pretty decent witty dialogue especially from Reynolds. But the drama is very bland and I didn't care for the dramatic moments in the film.

A perfect opportunity - alien in space, alien is latched, just detach the tether and push yourself as hard as possible off the side of the station. Maybe even use some Martian Iron Man tricks. Done, roll credits. No, instead we see a Martian-level of stupidity before the airlock, and when the right choice is done... well, it has zero impact, making the whole sequence - a protracted drama.<br/><br/>3. Alien in the safe zone While we clearly see the alien in space, and everything goes according to plan, after another protracted drama, we find that the alien was attached to one of the crew members. Insert Jackie Chan face. For a second I thought - it's another one, a new plot twist, something they haven't foreseen. Nope... It's the same alien, just somehow teleported. And, of course, the good scientist was so selfless that he didn't bother to tell anyone. Mindblown.<br/><br/>4. Interstellar spoof Okay, if spoofing Prometheus and Gravity was not enough, we needed Interstellar spoof, where one ""suddenly"" mentally disabled crew member decides to pretty much brute force a lockdown door. And, like the previous traitor, this guys is attempted to be saved, against all sanity. And, of course, there is a mandatory ridiculous decompression scene. Guess you can check that out. As for that whole Interstellar spoof... well, it ended pretty much the same as Interstellar. Except for the unparalleled epicness, of course...<br/><br/>5. Freezing scene I saw this scene before. It's the same stupid protraction as in Gravity. You sob, you freeze and then boom! - you find a solution. I literally counted seconds. It was so pointless and clichéd...<br/><br/>6. Finale If there was one more terrible movie to take lessons from(not counting Interstellar) - it's The Mist. Also a movie that was not bad by itself, but the writing and the characters absolutely ruined it, especially the finale. Well, Life is the same. Just worse, of course. You get a choice: a stupid happy-end, Gravity style or... the other thing. Frankly, nothing could be worse than Gravity, and I'd personally prefer a logical, sobby, but happy end. Instead - we get The Mist. In your face. Deal with it. Because this movie - is not getting any sequels.<br/><br/>7. Alien After all, why was this alien so feared. Yes, it's kind of resilient. But it's not mind-controlling. Not replicating. Not innately contagious. It gets out on Earth, the worst you get - is Cloverfield. Even Xenomorph or Zombie viruses can be contained, but this weirdo? Suddenly getting all Ripley about it. Such a waste of ISS...<br/><br/>8. Crew members In the end, one of the crew members ""reports"" the whole situation, saying that ""five other astronauts sacrificed themselves and must be honored"". But did they now? The first ""corpse"" disregarded the protocol and jeopardized everyone. In fact, saving that scientist at the cost of your life - allowed the same mentally disabled scientist to snatch the alien to the safe room, pretty much sacrificing not ""himself"", but everyone else. The commander, instead of doing the right thing, did the pointless thing, as described above. Not exactly sacrificing. The fourth member went full on Dr. Mann with predictable consequences(only there was no Cooper this time...) And the fifth astronaut... well, you can see for yourself.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Life is not ""that"" bad. There are definitely worse movies. In fact, it looks like an improved Gravity. Because besides the painful stupidity - you at least get some plot, some thrills, ""something"", while the premise is almost identical. It can be watched, with LSD and popcorn, but, unfortunately, should not be remembered."

"englisher101","4","0","3","13 July 2017"," Horrid Script
","The film was utterly obnoxious to me. Some have forgiven it being a horror film, but I found this much worse than cheesy horror films which I find considerably more appealing.<br/><br/>For a start, the characters in this film are not bimbos and teenagers who party all the time. It's somewhat forgivable when characters like these do incredibly dumb things since they obviously aren't the best and brightest and might even be intoxicated/high. There's also often an element of camp to many of these horror films which makes seemingly shoddy writing and unbelievable decisions made by the characters somewhat charming, humorous, and acceptable.<br/><br/>When we have a serious film like this featuring elite astronauts and scientists who are obviously intended to be well-trained making incredibly dumb decisions repeatedly, it just comes off as unbelievably weak writing.<br/><br/>Another problem I find with this film is that it tries too hard to explain itself. This leads to two disparate problems:<br/><br/>1) Makes a lot of the film seem absurd. This is a problem I'm finding with a lot of sci-fi films made in the past decade or two. The writers obviously aren't scientists and they shouldn't need to be in order to create a decent science fiction story.<br/><br/>When things are left somewhat mysterious and unexplained, even science geeks will forgive the film as they did with far more ambitious concepts as found in Star Trek, Alien, Terminator, etc. However, when the writers get overzealous in trying to explain away the mystery as Phantom Menace did by trying to explain the Force through Midi-Chlorians, it can make even ordinary people roll their eyes at how lame, ridiculous, and unbelievable the film's concepts are.<br/><br/>In this sense, something that is left mysterious or even somewhat magical is far, far less absurd and far easier to digest than something which is given an absurd technical explanation. The writers of this film did not not appreciate the benefits of leaving things mysterious and, even without being a science geek, I found the film absurd on so many levels.<br/><br/>2) Kills a lot of the suspense. This film not only gets absurd trying to explain itself technically, but a lot of it follows a pattern with respect to the dilemmas the crew faces.<br/><br/>There is this pattern throughout the film where the crew encounter a dilemma and they have to explain it to the audience so that the audience understands the technical nature of the problem. Within minutes typically, another crew member comes up with a technical solution to the problem.<br/><br/>This is to be expected to a great degree in a sci-fi but where the film kills a lot of potential for suspense is that most of the dilemmas only last minutes until the dilemma wanders off to a new section of the ship (sometimes literally) creating a whole new dilemma.<br/><br/>As a result, a lot of the film is just dilemma followed by explanation of the dilemma followed by a brainstorm for the solution to the dilemma and, within minutes, a whole new dilemma and a repeat of the previous pattern. All of this explanation in between doesn't allow the film to linger on one dilemma and build up a lot of tension and suspense and drama as can typically be found in even mediocre horrors and thrillers.<br/><br/>Overall I found this film to fall completely flat. Some were able to forgive the script. I couldn't get past it and just found the film incredibly bland and obnoxious in ways that had me cursing the writers of the film."

","I'll start out by saying that I wanted to like this movie very much. I was anticipating it. I've been waiting for another monster movie that I could really dive into and have it give me that feeling like the first Alien movie gave me. Unfortunately, Life just doesn't deliver.<br/><br/>It has a great premise and a fantastic cast. I was hooked on it from the first trailer I saw. That kind of thing where you go ""oh man, this is gonna be good!"" The fact it had Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds was a great selling point for me. After all, Gyllenhaal was riveting in Nightcrawler, one of my favorite films of his. And Ryan Reynolds has been one of my favorite, snarky smart-ass actors for years. I think he was born to play Deadpool.<br/><br/>Here's problem one: Jake is an actor that shines in character studies. He's to be pondered over, inspected. He can make a slight gesture with his face, and it's almost better than any line he could say. This isn't that type of movie though. It's a popcorn thriller without many thrills. He's under utilized as an actor, and there isn't a lot for him to do. It's just not his type of movie.<br/><br/>Problem two: Every scary movie utilizes jump scares these days. It's the cheap way to get a scare out of folks. It's easy, and that's why it's used so much. Real suspenseful ramping up of a tense moment, building the anticipatory reveal and successfully pulling off a righteous scary moment isn't an easy feat. There aren't any skilled scary moments in this movie. All ""BOO!"" and no ""guess what's coming...""<br/><br/>Another problem is that Ryan Reynolds is also under utilized. very much so. If you see it, you'll understand what I mean. <br/><br/>Finally, the ""monster"" is just weird. Not particularly scary. Even when It ""matures"". The CGI is standard and there are no special moments that make you think ""wow, that took some skill as a digital artist"". It's lazy CGI, and it's not a very creative antagonist.<br/><br/>I felt as if I didn't see a full movie after I left the theater. It was unsatisfying to me. Others may feel differently. It definitely didn't stay with me, and unlike Alien, I didn't feel creeped out afterward. It's not fair to compare it to Alien, I know. Alien, after all, had me looking over my shoulder when I left the theater. But maybe when writing these stories and making these movies, they should try to compare it to the best out there, at least in execution and creativity."

This movie is classified as a sci- fi, so i'm not going to detest factual details surrounding the alien life-form. However if you wish to create something of an alien figure, please use your imagination and not the imagination of some calamari-hungry idiot that thought it would be great to have an 8-legged, slimy squid patrol the airship that can live with/without oxygen, and is flame retardant. This thing must have a weak point of some sort, but the producer left that part out and you're sort of wondering what other futile tricks the crew have up their sleeves. It was also convenient for the spaceship to lose all comms to earth the moment this seafood basket became hostile.

"Mike_Devine","4","0","1","9 July 2017"," Ironically titled 'Life' is a second-rate space thriller
","Daniel Espinosa's space thriller/horror effort 'Life' aims high on the creativity meter, as the film tries to recreate success achieved by a select few other films in the genre. Despite the intentions, the end result is a second-rate procedural thriller set in space that is closer to 'Apollo 18' than 'Alien' on the spectrum.<br/><br/>'Life' starts out fairly innocuously, with a global six-person crew manning the International Space Station (ISS) on a mission to collect a sample collected from Mars in the hopes of finding some signs of living organisms. As expected, the crew finds a small single-celled organism (innocently named ""Calvin"" by students back on Earth) that ends up growing to a point where...well...it becomes more of a liability than an accomplishment. From here, we witness the cat-and-mouse chase that takes place on (and around) the ISS as the crew tries to prevent further damage from the discovery.<br/><br/>On paper, 'Life' should benefit from the A-list cast, which includes Ryan Reynolds as a ""guns blazing"" American cowboy type, Jake Gyllenhaal as a more pragmatic, intellectual astronaut, Idris Elba as a dedicated scientist, Rebecca Ferguson as a CDC rep and Hiroyuki Sanada and Olga Dihovichnaya as experienced pilots. However, the script does not allow these actors to excel for various reasons, whether there are ""early exits"" or the dialogue they're forced to recite is underwhelming. It's fair to say Ferguson does the best job with the hand she's dealt, but even so, it's not a memorable performance.<br/><br/>But it's not just the script or the cast's fault. There are so many resemblances to other more superior films - whether 'Alien' or more recently, 'Gravity' - that 'Life' does not come off as all that original. While the special effects are good, they're about what you'd expect, and while there are interesting themes explored, including the purpose of life, the scenes that feature these feel like they were inserted jut to keep the film from feeling too much like a traditional ""murder by the numbers"" horror movie. Finally, the ""saw this coming"" finale does not do anything to help the film's cause.<br/><br/>'Life' should have more accurately been called 'Death,' but that probably wouldn't have resonated with moviegoers quite as much."

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Picture and sound are great, I have a powered subwoofer in my sound system and this track really shook the room in certain scenes.<br/><br/>I am a scientist and I pay moderate attention to advancements in astronomy. For years there has been a high interest in the question ""Is there life elsewhere in the universe""? Just from a 'probability' perspective, with billions of galaxies and each having billions of stars, and untold numbers of stars with planets around them much like our own Solar System, one point of view is that we would have to be very arrogant to believe we Earthlings are the only intelligent life. <br/><br/>The story here involves a six-person crew on the ISS (space station orbiting Earth) receiving an unmanned pod that had gone to Mars and took soil samples. The crew, which included a doctor, were to conduct tests to determine if the soil samples had any component of life. <br/><br/>The production values are superb, the actors are experienced and good. The real star of the story becomes the alien life form that grows from a soil sample. In a contest back on Earth school kids get to name it and this alien life form becomes known as 'Calvin.' Calvin never makes a sound but as ""he"" grows and develops the crew face bigger and bigger challenges to keep it contained. <br/><br/>We really enjoyed the movie, it makes one think of possible consequences as we get closer and closer to actually doing something like this.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS: The life form continues to grow and develop, it has to kill for its nourishment, in the end only two remain, they decide to protect Earth by coaxing 'Calvin' into one of the escape pods with one astronaut and he would aim it to deep space, sacrificing himself to protect Earth. The other pod would reenter to Earth after the ISS had been destroyed. 'Calvin' had become so intelligent that 'he' overpowered the astronaut and directed to pod to re enter to Earth and as the movie ends we see some Asian fishermen coming to his rescue, opening the hatch.

That was the year that my new wife was born. Not so long ago, we watched ""Alien"" together and, to say the very least, she was underwhelmed, I assume because of its subtlety and quiet build-up of the tension that's so much required in a GOOD SF movie. Younger people (well, younger than me anyway) demand and expect explicit shocks and in yer face horror; they just don't understand the subtlety of Alien and other movies like the original Blair Witch and others such as ""Full Circle"" (aka ""The Haunting Of Julia""). They want the obvious; they want ""blood and gore and veins in ma teeth"", they want heroics, they want a love story, they want human sacrifice, they want all the usual scripted s**t.<br/><br/>I guess that's why ""Life"", the unutterably bad load of old tripe that this is, got the go-ahead to be made.<br/><br/>The premise and the construction of ""Life"" is almost identical to that of the original ""Alien"" but without the suspense, the logic, the scientific underpinning that's necessary to make a truly good SF movie (as the original was).<br/><br/>It was all so very obvious that this was an unashamed remake of Alien.

"tomgillespie2002","5","0","3","1 July 2017"," Feels short, which is always a good thing
","When promotion started for Daniel Espinosa's space-set horror, a popular fan theory emerged that the movie was in fact an origin film for Sony's upcoming Venom movie, in which an alien symbiote arrives on Earth and attaches itself to Spider-Man, or so the comics and Sam Raimi's terrible Spider-Man 3 go. It speaks volumes about fans' eagerness to attach an original story to some ongoing franchise as part of a bigger, expanding world, as is the fad nowadays brought on by the success of Marvel's nine-year strong 'cinematic universe'. Life is not a Venom origin movie, but is in fact a throwback to popular, adult genre movies that flourished in the 1970s and 80s, although the potential for sequels is purposely there. That said, you have no doubt seen this movie before, as it rests comfortably into a well-worn formula and has no qualms about its own lack of originality.<br/><br/>The crew of the International Space Station manage to pull of the dangerous feat of capturing a fast-moving probe returning from Mars carrying soil samples. The six-strong team, captained by Russian Ekaterina (Olga Dihovichnaya), quickly discover that the package contains evidence of alien life in the form of dormant cells. Biologist Dr. Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) manages to revive one cell by turning up the temperature, witnessing the alien's rapid growth and quick-learning. Back on Earth, school children name the discovery 'Calvin', but on the space station the creature becomes aggressive, attacking Derry and causing the rest of the crew, consisting of medical officer David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), quarantine officer Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), pilot Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada) and wise-cracking engineer Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), to flee for their lives. Soon enough, preventing Calvin from reaching Earth becomes the top priority.<br/><br/>Drawing inspiration from the swirling camera-work of Gravity, the horror bursts of Event Horizon, the culturally diverse line-up of Sunshine, and, most of all, the claustrophobic man-versus-beast panic of genre classic Alien, Life offers nothing new to the genre, and will likely be all but forgotten in a few years. If you're expecting atmosphere, characterisation, gore or surprises, this is not that movie. However, your enjoyment of the film will depend on how quickly you come to accept the formulaic way it goes about its business, and the sooner the better. While it's nothing like the dizzying innovation of Gravity, Espinosa's film offers some spectacular visuals, blurring the line between reality and CGI. It also feels short, which is always a good thing. Life is a time- waster; something to switch your brain off to and kill 100 minutes. You may wait for a twist or the story to change direction, but it doesn't, and when the film attempts to deliver a surprise, chances are you'll have already guessed it."

This is the age of TL;DR, so let's get right to it.<br/><br/>Ryan Reynolds as Rory Adams and Olga Dihovichnaya as the International Space Station (ISS) commander Ekaterina Golovkina were the standouts, Reynolds for being his usual frat boy persona (which somehow worked in the stuffy setting of the ISS) and Golovkina for really nailing what a commander of a high-tension environment made up of large multi- national personalities should be; patient, temperate, and unquestionably in charge. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast were not noteworthy, except Jake Gyllenhaal, who once again makes a block of wood look like something you'd want to spend time with. Seriously, put those puppy-dog eyes on an actual puppy, you'd get some real emotion.<br/><br/>As far as the premise, if you can get around the fact that once again we have a primitive life form that is seemingly indestructible and unstoppable against all modern technology and the laws of physics, then the alien (the indomitable Calvin) was actually a likable villain. I know I was rooting for him, and I bet a lot of you will be too. <br/><br/>As far as the ending, saying you can see it coming from a mile away is an insult to all miles. Daniel Espinosa and Rhett Reese/Paul Wernick painted the story into a corner from which there is only one possible exit. Nobody -- NOBODY -- is going to be surprised.<br/><br/>I mean, the milquetoast earth orbit flick finish has already been done. It's called Gravity, and it also sucked.<br/><br/>3 of 10. Wait for the $5 bin. <br/><br/>OUT."

It's not that hard to research what you're writing! With that out of the way, let's dive into this mess:<br/><br/>Pros: 1.) Cinematography. DP Seamus McGarvey did a fantastic job. There are quite a few long takes, which I love, and I believe they were done very well. 2.) the visual effects are incredible. The film is visually stunning. I'll raise my glass to that.<br/><br/>Cons: Virtually everything else. Where do I even begin? 1.) idiotic plot line. The alien needs oxygen? How?...Mars is 98% CO2...oh, but you decided to say he was able to hibernate for millions of years, since a time Mars had much more oxygen...just, lazy. 2.) idiotic plot line, again. Yeah, it's that bad. Calvin (the alien...), escapes the first firewall by cutting through the glove with some electric pen tool he broke when the biologist tried to wake him up with it. You're telling me a few weeks old alien figured out how to do something that took millions of years for humans to figure out? Lol. 3.) you guessed it...plot line.

If the writers are of average intelligence, then the good guys would appear to be of below average intelligence.<br/><br/>There are sections of glaring time fillers where nothing is happening to advance the plot.

Right from the opening scene of catching (like a baseball catcher) another spaceship hurtling through space. C'mon! And Hollywood does have a thing for portraying astronauts as frantic, highly emotional and volatile - that's just totally wrong (these people are trained to be problem solvers, to use their heads). And the whole lack of adherence to even a basic quarantine protocol - we are talking about an alien life form here - is just so annoying and cliché. Insert character that insists on just opening up the door and going in and saving the guy that's just been infected/bitten/whatever - how many times have we seen this?<br/><br/>I give this a 3 because I love sci fi and the acting was quite acceptable (they did their best with a very weak script)."

It always amazes me how such creatures (like in Promethesus) gain strength and size at a rate which beggars belief. At least ""Calvin"" (the name selected by a school on Earth chosen from among 11,000) is seen to grow by feeding of its human hosts giving some plausibility.<br/><br/>It's survival in airless space is somehow due to its ability (maybe like whales) to store oxygen, and somehow its tissues are durable enough to resist hard vacuum severe enough to pit aluminium.<br/><br/>But the killer for me was the ""surprise"" ending where David Jordan (Gyllenhaal), sacrificing himself to pilot a lifeboat with the creature into deep space and away from Earth, finds himself suddenly switched with Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) who is supposed safely returning to Earth. How the heck could that possibly happen??? Completely illogical and unsatisfying even if it gives the desired ending (Calvin gets to Earth and will presumably devour all humans..).<br/><br/>Great CGI but once again demonstrating that sFX do not the movie make..."

Yes, there are numerous differences, but many more similarities. The prime directive of the film is the same: A total survivor that will do anything to live. <br/><br/>The ending, although done in a quite cagey manner, was entirely predictable; especially if you are familiar with Daniel Espinoza. He is still an excellent director, but I thought he was out of his realm on this film. That said, I believe he can and will improve as a director.

","Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) study a one-celled organism from MARS named Calvin. All seems harmless enough until one astronaut decides to wake it up using electricity. Well, that angers Calvin and things go from bad to worse. How would you feel if someone prodded you with a touch of electricity? <br/><br/>This was okay and maybe not as good as some previous space movies. The sets within this ISS are visually good. and we liked seeing everyone glide around in zero gravity. The dialogues are low key and one must listen carefully. The music was also low key and didn't make its presence known hardly at all. This could have used more pictures of space, in general, showing the earth from time to time. But wait, Calvin has escaped and there's no time for any of that You would think there would be a lot of tension not knowing where Calvin was at any given moment, but that was not the case here. Concern yes, but no real tension. Here the music could have played a more important role. Didn't happen.<br/><br/>It is decided to kill Calvin and not let it get to Earth and destroy civilization. The belief is that this creature was the cause of all devastation on MARS. Well, killing Calvin is easier said than done. This Calvin creature is one smart organism, which, by the way, has now grown quite a bit. (This can't be good.)<br/><br/>Now to be fair doing a movie within really tight quarters is hard and this was done in very good fashion. Maybe this had a bearing on everything as it wasn't Star Trek where everyone has a lot of space to move about. The Editing was excellent. There were a few feeble attempts at humor that went nowhere. <br/><br/>One thing did surprise me: No one suggested they try to communicate with Calvin. Hmmmm<br/><br/>There is nothing scary in here once you get used to Calvin and the CGI is nothing but spectacular. So the rest of the movie has astronauts trying to kill Calvin to insure it doesn't get to Earth.<br/><br/>Notable: Ryan Reynolds as Rory and he was the first to try and kill Calvin.<br/><br/>No one stands out as the main guy until near the end when David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) get together and decide how to handle Calvin. And even then it's all even-handed, okay still low key. <br/><br/>All In all this is slow-going but watchable. The ending will surprise you as it did me. (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."

Just a bunch of random people at some space station collecting information about Mars? Finally they end up finding something and then it all goes south from there. <br/><br/>How it manages to just go downhill is way beyond me, I mean, did they also find the stupidest people to randomly drop on that space station? How were they selected? What purpose did they really serve? Did mankind rely on these people for some reason? There are so many questions and none of them got answered.

For a start they could have just cut their losses and not opened the door to the lab that had a rapidly growing tentacle monster inside it but then they go on to use a flamethrower?! I don't imagine that's safe on a space station, not to mention the fact that it burns through oxygen. It really seemed like the American characters made some of the most horrendous decisions that had me almost shouting at the screen like wanting to let the woman with a killer octopus latched onto her leg back into the station - is the director trying to make a point about Americans. There were so many chances for the crew to sacrifice one of them to eliminate the creature but instead they take stupid risk after stupid risk ultimately resulting in them all dying. How does this creature even exist on Mars though? There's almost no oxygen in the Martian atmosphere - even in a dormant state. To top off the stupidity of it all, at the end, they manage to send the lifeboats the wrong ways and the people on Earth proceed to see an injured man and a space octopus in the capsule and open it anyway?!

The ending is totally forced and unnatural and makes virtually no sense, whatsoever. You can tell it wasn't the original ending as the script was written.

The station is MUCH too small for this type of movie, which is why they set the original Alien on a gigantic space mining ship.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have ripped this movie a new one with all of the plot holes, bad writing, and faulty logic in this one.<br/><br/>Ryan Renolds appears to have wanted ten mins cash and is in the movie for that long it seems, quickly dying off. Unfortunately, his positive, wise-cracking character, who quickly realizes first that studying alien life on a tiny space station is just plain STUUUUpid, but nobody listens, is the highlight of the movie...<br/><br/>Jake G. does his usual bare acting capability and comes across as a PTSD Iraq war medic stuck on the station to keep him away from humans and reduce his VA payments. He is brooding, depressed, moody, and drags the movie down.<br/><br/>The creature is most believable and scary as an infant, and quickly as it grows becomes a badly done cgi mess that is not believable and inconsistent.<br/><br/>A final note, this movie was made several years after a Russian cosmonaut on the ISS declared they had discovered unknown life living on the outside of one of the ISS windows.... yet no mention is made of this, either in the beginning or in the credits.

I mean, you don't catch a bullet with your hand, do you? <br/><br/>Alien cell is brought onboard ISS where the crew constantly argues and rudely interrupts one another. <br/><br/>Alien cell is not put in a compartment which can be jettisoned or where it can be properly contained<br/><br/>Alien cell is is apparently all types of cells in one and can feed of oxygen (seriously, come on) <br/><br/>Alien organism becomes self-aware and decides to eat anything organic to grow<br/><br/>Director has no clue on how fire works in zero gravity<br/><br/>Alien organism is immune to heat, cold, radiation, electricity, pressure and whatnot.<br/><br/>Director thinks that communications arrays require coolant fluid in order to operate, that there are no backup communications on the ISS except for the main one and that with the thousands of telecommunications satellites you cannot get a signal in orbit. <br/><br/>Crew does not evacuate until everything is nearly destroyed<br/><br/>Earth tries to push ISS into deep space with a small lifeboat capsule sent from earth. This really annoyed me, because such a small capsule cannot have the propellant/fuel to to push the ISS anywhere it will simply extend its orbit slightly. Secondly, what a stupid decision that is, there are even 2 onboard astronauts, how would they even return? Why the hell not detonate a ICBM next to it, that is close to the only thing that might slightly have a chance to deter its course! GAWD! <br/><br/>Lastly, it is the acting, it is so over dramatized in order to try and make the movie seem good. <br/><br/>And that British chick in the end screams as if she wont return to earth shortly after, she never leaves orbit! DIRECTOR, if you are going to read about how orbital mechanics works at LEAST frikken read about how they work!!! Just because you make a burn for 5 seconds in any direction around earth and slightly push away from it, doesn't mean you wont return STRAIGHT BACK!!! You need to burn for a LONG TIME to even break earths orbit and align yourself with another planetary orbit. And leaving the solar system? We haven't even invented something that can go out and explore deep space!!!<br/><br/>Best example? Halleys comet! It does leave our solar system but always returns because guess what, it is caught by our suns gravitational field which means, it is ACTUALLY IN ORBIT AROUND THE SUN!<br/><br/>LEARN SCIENCE BEFORE YOU MAKE A SCI-FI MOVIE! <br/><br/>Enjoy this one CinemaSins, I know you are going to have a field day with it, can't wait to see you guys roast this garbage on YouTube!"

","I could not find any new idea, a waste of good actors<br/><br/>Premise: I very appreciate Daniel Espinosa's works. He's a young director but I can already notice his technical growth. He has not missed the rhythm and the adrenaline neither in his work ""Safe House"", nor in ""Child 44"". Furthermore, I cannot say whether he has been lucky or he had the right sponsors or he was just enough good in working with such actors as Denzel Washington, Tom Hardy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Noomi Rapace, Ryan Reynolds, etc. (not in order of importance). I saw an evolution, from the adrenaline thrilling of a well acted Safe House to the epic/dramatic thrilling of Child 44, Masterfully interpreted by Tom Hardy, playing with a strong Russian accent all the movie. But here I stop. I did not see any originality in Life. I felt an agglomeration of special effects, of important but unrelated actors, monsters, without a true story before and without a real future after. During this superficial Horror/Fanta scientific tale, I could not notice anything original. The Alien from Mars does not need explanation, the destructive alien that aim to kill the species in order to survive itself, the alien the kills. Does it sound familiar? This work was a mix of many others, including some quotation of not-masterpiece-movies such as ""Gravity"". Aggravating the missing of originality, the choice of not deepening the character's profiles, quoting themselves during the most dramatic scenes, never giving a real pathos and drama along the movie. They have been given soon, they have no other dimension but the one in the spaceship, except during few moments not well integrated in the history, such as the one of the birth of one astronaut's child on earth. It's a 5 cause I still give chances to Daniel Espinosa and thanks to the huge investment done for this movie. Neither the good Jake nor the misspend Ryan could save it."

","I can't believe Ryan and Jake would do such a bad movie. It's like revenge of the liberals in space, good intentions with nonstop horrible decisions that put everyone's lives in jeopardy throughout. Plot is incredibly weak. Repetitive bad decisions from supposed professionals run rampant. I recommend you find something else other than this sad movie."
"justinwfirestone","4","0","5","15 April 2017"," More like ""Death,"" am I right?!
","I learned a few things while watching Life. First, there are no shoes in space, or at least if you bring your shoes into space you don't wear them. You do wear boots when you go outside in space, or maybe rather out into space, from being inside a space station or space craft. Then again, what does it mean to ""go outside"" if you're already in space? What's beyond the edge of the universe, anyway?<br/><br/>However, I do think everyone gets a pair of space boots in space, but I'm not sure whether you have to wear them on the way up or whether you can just put them in your space luggage and keep them stowed until it's time to actually go out into space. Oh, and space socks are just regular socks, it seems, but they must keep the thermostat pretty low in space stations because most people wear their socks when they're inside. It is totally unclear to me, however, whether you should wear socks under your space boots when you go outside, because there are lots of cosmic rays that heat you up quickly and it would be counterproductive to the whole space- suit-coolant feature of a space suit.<br/><br/>Oh, I digress.<br/><br/>I also learned we now appear to have a new movie genre, maybe the first since Torture Porn. It's called ""Humans Act Like Idiots in Space and Get Killed by Heretofore Previously Undiscovered Alien Life."" In fact, ""Life"" could have, and probably should have been, titled ""Death,"" or ""Everyone Dies,"" or ""Crappy Movie.""<br/><br/>Life is dark, and life is a jerk. Life likes to penetrate your mouth with its tentacles.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is a terrible actor. The soundtrack is far too grandiose and bombastic. It all ends with one of the most obvious and telegraphed plot twists of all time.<br/><br/>Don't waste your life on Life!"
"ausrinekuzaite","5","0","3","14 April 2017"," Disappointed :(
","Where should I start...I am passionate sci-fi fan myself, you can hardly find sci-fi movie that I had yet not watched. After seeing the trailer of LIFE I had huge expectations. Sadly, my expectations where not fulfilled. I will tel you why. First of all, let's have in mind that in real life astronauts are extremely highly trained PROFESSIONALS. However, through whole movie characters of the movie demonstrated exaggerated amount of irrational emotions and behavior. On the moments, when some of the most intelligent and trained people of humanity should already have a plan and act, they where crying and wining... OMG it was so painfully annoying to watch!!! Could they put at least some logic while developing characters? What is even more sad, is the fact that all these actors are brilliant, sadly they had to act on trashy plot and dialogues. Almost all characters acted like 9 years old school children would in similar situation. The impression of unprofessionalism and lack of doing ""what they should do"" amazed me...The behavior of the characters was even less logic then the fact that this magic life form was growing and developing so unbelievably fast.... ""good bye air, good by moon, good bye my expectations for the high quality sci-fi movie"". 5/10. I give 5 only for a good idea itself and nice special effects, but the end result has disappointed me."

","this film lacks originality, tension, wit, suspense. whatever. you know from the trailer that something bad happens. so there is no surprise there, either. people do dumb things all through the movie. a pet peeve of mine. the screen writers wrote Deadpool, from last year, so they must have had easy access to ryan Reynolds. there is sequence about 3/4 through where I had no idea what was going on. stick with alien from '79."

","I enjoyed ""Life"". It is a well-made movie, it has great tension between the actors and it takes its b-movie premise very seriously. And all of this makes me give it a rating of 5, but it won't get more than that. I don't expect over-the-top concepts and super-twists from a monster-in-space film, but what I expect is ONE SINGLE ORIGINAL IDEA per film. Not 2 or 3 or 4. Just 1. And ""Life"" fails. It is a rehash of many films. Don't get me wrong: Many films, especially in the horror genre, are rehashes. Nothing wrong with that. -- Just 1 new idea. 1. That's all I ask for."
"lale-ba","5","0","3","4 April 2017"," Decent clone
","Ridley Scott's Alien"" inspired entire generations of movie creators and it continues to do so 'till this very day. Daniel Espinosa's Life"" is one of the exact replicas of the 1979 masterpiece of SF horror and it does its ripping off relentlessly. There is no proper introduction, just plain old action and horror. The concept of the dormant alien creature (aka Calvin) that does its growing by devouring the crew of the Interantional Space Station is something we already saw more than once. All that follows represent one great mashup that stretches out to the ending credits. The A-list cast will do their parts without mistakes (especially Gyllenhaal), while the CGI will be heavily influenced by the makers of Gravity"". Script will wander off pretty early in the movie, so expect no serious and scientifically justifiable plots. Life"" will not surprise you, but will succeed in amusing you, especially if you were raised on the trash SF horror of the '80s."
"artsytype1-607-224200","6","0","3","2 April 2017"," Could Have Been Lots Better
","Two of this movie's big stars, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds, are not fully formed characters. That was very disappointing and left me not caring about either one. Another disappointment, the movie never really left the space station. I'll make some comparisons to really successful space movies - Alien, Interstellar, Gravity. Those movies at least took the viewers out of the cabin into space, and they took time to develop characters. The theme of smart alien life out of control was a relentless pounding on the senses. Better to lighten up on the viewer periodically, and then start the pounding again. Gee, this could have been really good. Instead I see it as a B horror movie in comparison to the big guns I mentioned above. I can't recommend spending money on it in the theaters. But it's worthy as a rental."

Ah, sorry, no. Survival of the gene pool. =&gt; That means: Spread. Reproduce as much as possible. What do bacteria do again? Ah yes, stop reproducing and hop around like a bunny..</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>evolution to a life form where every cell can equally give any functionality, and work together to create a common entity =&gt; sorry, no, that is not how evolution works. And no, that is also not how meta-organism work, or any generation of complexity. It is inherently divergent. A meta organism would always find potentials for diversification.. and only in its germs could possibly preserve this pluripotency. This could have been a nice plot (actually the background of Alian)..</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>scientists in first contact with extraterrestrial Life make all ""human-looking"" mistakes possible.. Yes, of course that is very much the protocol. Lets touch it. Lets put sharp things in the chamber that could destroy the gloves. Lets not burn it in the chamber.. Ah, a nice scientific one was: Lets first crank the heat up far above mars level.. and then afterwards change the atmosphere, because, well, if it is not this gas at this temperature, i expect it to be another gas at this temperature.. all kind of the same :)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>oh yes, once it has touched someone but left, lets make a ceremony for that person and touch him/her as much as possible. It is not a cellular invasive organism we are talking about (like every humble virus on earth or bacteria in your toilet).. no danger here...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>it seems the organism grows, but does not profit quite much from its behavior. I would suck every source of nutrients and water empty there. The people. (nice plot as well). Which it doesn't.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>of course, the black scientist is the one being deeply spiritually touched and convinced that it is a good idea to nurse his baby right beside his comrades ! :D Really.. when does world get over such stereotypes.

","Starts out well enough and contains literally ALL the requisite (and time-worn) space movie clichés, then very soon into the story it becomes more an amalgam of other space horror films we've all seen multiple times over the years. Be prepared to be faced with the need to suspend disbelief and boredom. There's literally not a single new thing in this film compared to a few dozen (at least) similar films that came before it."
