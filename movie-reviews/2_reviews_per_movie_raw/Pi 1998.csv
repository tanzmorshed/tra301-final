"stharward","10","294","368","15 May 2000"," Indie film at its best
","'Pi' is independent filmmaking at its best.  Without the constraints of the studio/corporate system, Aronofsky and Gullette created a film that is bizarre, intelligent, and unlike anything that came out of Hollywood in the 1990's.  Who would have thought to blend Wall Street, the Kabbalah, computer science, Go, number theory, and the most fascinating number in the universe in a solute of obsessive-compulsive, paranoid genius and then strain through gritty B&W cinematography and hyperkinetic editing?  The mixture is definitely not for everybody, but I certainly loved it.<br/><br/>Plus the soundtrack (featuring Orbital, Clint Mansell, Aphex Twin. Gus Gus, Spacetime Continuum, and other techno talents) just flat-out rocks."
"cultovone","9","229","303","9 November 1999"," Finding God through the ancient language of Mathematics
","Pi is the oddest, hippest, most chilling account of the descent into the abyss.<br/><br/>Following mathematical clues derived from an analysis of the stock market, Maximillian Cohen begins his descent into madness as he attempts to discover the nature of everything through the peculiar numerical entity known as Pi.<br/><br/>Thrilling enough, but then combine with generous amounts of Kaballistic mysticism, black and white footage and a soundtrack like an audible fractal, and you have a sensory snare which drags you along for the ride into Max's impending breakdown.<br/><br/>Obsession has never been so exciting.<br/><br/>Pi is an utterly gut-wrenching, mind expanding phenomema. If you have ever wondered about the universe, God or the nature of insanity, Pi will take you where you don't want to go."
"Aidan McGuinness","Null","122","160","11 March 2002"," Inventive, sharp, *different* cinema
","After seeing ""Pi"", you realise that a lot of Hollywood producers should be automatically fired. Why? Because you can make a great film like this for only $60,000 whereas turkeys like ""Waterworld"" cast tens of millions of dollars. Go figure.<br/><br/>""Pi"" is about the obsession of maths genius Max Cohen (Sean Gullette), trying to find a number, a mathematical connection, that underlies all things but particularly the stock market. His obsession however begins to drive him nuts, with constant headaches and paranoid delusions (or are they...).<br/><br/>What's most striking about this movie is it's *different*. It isn't really comparable to any other movie I know, in terms of plot or of style. Aronofsky shows an incredible ability to work with a budget and yet still produce a visually striking movie - the movie doesn't suffer from being shot in fuzzy black & white. The paranoia of the man character is enhanced greatly by the use of a ""snorricam"" - a camera mounted to the body so that the viewer is attached to Max as he walks. Sharp, extremely kinetic cuts add to the frenetic energy and display what we would later see in ""Requiem for a Dream"". The whole intense, brooding nature is helped by the black & white imagery never allowing for any colour to seep through, enhanced by the fuzzy dream-like quality of the movie that reflects Cohen's delusions. It's no wonder that Aronofsky came away from Sundance as the Best Director for his amazing work here with such limited means.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting but the number Cohen seeks (which is not Pi - Pi is just used because it is a universal invariant like that which Cohen wants) isn't the centre of the movie. It's about obsession and how, as Max's friend points out, it can drive you to see things everywhere. Sure there are technical inaccuracies in it, but it's played with an assured sense of conviction, ably acted by unknown Gullette.<br/><br/>""Pi"" is very interesting because it stands far out from the crowd. It's not one for those who think ""Pearl Harbour"" is the way films should be made - it's too different for that. A great debut for a director, who went on to surpass this with his superb next project, ""Requiem for a Dream"". 9/10."

","This screenplay must have been turned down one hundred times before someone would finance it. I don't blame them. However, what could have been a travesty was saved by great acting, directing, cinematography, and sound. This brilliant/bizarre film turns a genius's quest to find the code for Wall Street into an adventure that engulfs all of human existence, and God. A brilliant example of how proper film making can turn straw into gold. Some viewers may be put off by the bizarre fits the main character faces, or the intrusion of complex mathematics into film, forcing the viewer to think, but if you watch this film, you will be rewarded a unique movie-going experience few other films will give you. This film gives you a look into the mind of man plagued by the genius he was given."
"Quinoa1984","9","36","45","9 September 2006"," not about math, but about obsession, paranoia, searching for answers never found
","Pi is the kind of movie I wished I could've seen in one of those dank art-house movie theaters in New York City, as it's practically gift-wrapped for the crowds. But it's not done with every shot lingering on the characters, soaking in minimalism in its black and white photography, quite the opposite. Darren Aronofsky is a filmmaker I first got into through Requiem for a Dream, which now years after I saw it I want to revisit again upon the soon to be released the Fountain and especially after now seeing Pi. Before with 'Requiem', I did like the movie a lot, but felt a little apprehensive about deeming it that old term 'masterpiece' as the editing, while ultra fast for a purpose, almost came off as too ""MTV"" for me. But years later, after hundreds of more films taken in, I'm ready for a second look. In this particular case, Pi is also the kind of movie that warrants a second look at the director's other films. His themes run just as much together as does his breakneck style. And it's not just to show off; he truly does get inside a psychology through subjective camera AND editing, to a degree that might impress Hitchcock, albeit with some whiplash.<br/><br/>Max Cohen played by Sean Gullette is the protagonist of the story, who's main foe is none other than the universe itself, in a sense, all through one number. Or rather, a series of numbers, one which might unlock the Stock Market secret for him. He doesn't even want to play the market, mind you, but the point for him- if one can follow- might be attributed to a repeated memory he has of looking at the sun as a boy, and soon looking past the shock of actually looking long at it. This is a very small device by Aronofsky but it works well to establish- and continue- this man's downward spiral. And spirals, by the way, seem to also figure into the film, as well as a secret technology firm (with a woman who reminded me of Condaleeza Rice look-alike), and especially a near undercover Hasidim ring where they need the numbers *in* Cohen's head to unlock some big secret to God. But even with all of this pressure, Cohen can't shake what's dogging him around, in his own cramped, wire-ridden apartment, with many bugs crawling around.<br/><br/>The key for this movie really is atmosphere, in the acting (if it makes you uncomfortable sometimes that's the point too, and it's probably the strangest performance of a lifetime for Gullette), the production design (that apartment and the subways), the grainy, spectacular photography by Matthew Libatique, the editing to be sure- which here, unlike the breakneck 'Requiem', does take a break from the cuts so quick they almost past subliminally (which isn't bad)- and the moody music that is so slight you almost forget its there. It even works for me, and this is a big plus, as someone who's not really interested in mathematics (worst subject in school), and even better as it drew me in to his obsessions with it. I really liked one of the early scenes between Max and his the friendly Hassidic man who explains on paper different numbers and their relation to parts of the Torah. And, in the end, it all comes down to getting engrossed through what the filmmaker's bringing in with this man. There is a sort of detachment from reality- that most of us would never touch much of this with a ten foot pole- but then again it really isn't. Aronofsky also makes a point of some hallucinations/dreams adding to the ambiance, skidding almost towards the pretentious, and thus creating a world all of its own in Pi for Max, and for us as well.<br/><br/>A film that I shall certainly seek out again when I can, if only to see if I can understand some things a little more (or maybe not as case might be), and to see such a powerhouse performance from Gullette. Grade: A"
"room102","9","164","233","11 March 2003"," The best no-budget movie you'll ever see
","""Pi (1998)"" is, without doubt, the best no-budget movie I've ever seen. Directed by Darren Aronofsky with a ridiculous budget of $60,000 - which I first thought was a mistake in the figures, since I couldn't believe such a movie could possibly be made with that amount of money.<br/><br/>Most of the cast and crew later re-united to make ""Requiem for a Dream (2000)"" - one of the best movies made in the last few years. Like many others, it was ""Requiem"" that made me find ""Pi"". It took Aronofsky only 2 movies to become one of my favorite directors, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this young and promising writer/director.<br/><br/>The movie stars Sean Gullette, which co-wrote the movie with Aronofsky and Eric Watson. You might recognize him as Arnold (Marion's old partner and shrink) in ""Requiem"". Gullette is perfect in his role and does an amazing job here. It's a shame we don't see his talent in more movies.<br/><br/>Mark Margolis (Mr. Rabinowitz in ""Requiem"") is excellent as Max's mentor and all the other cast is doing a great job too.<br/><br/>Like in ""Requiem"", technical aspect is top-notch: Excellent black-and-white cinematography (Matthew Libatique) and the innovative use of the Snorricam, lightning, editing (Oren Sarch), and music (Clint Mansell, frontman for Pop will Eat itself).<br/><br/>The director's commentary for this movie is fascinating. After hearing it you'd appreciate the effort and heart that were put into this movie a lot more.<br/><br/>Look for guest/cameo appearances by Samia Shoaib (the nurse in ""Requiem"") as Devi, Max's nextdoor neighbor; Clint Mansell (the movie's composer) as the photographer; and Abraham Aronofsky (Darren's father) as one of the men delivering the suitcase at the door.<br/><br/>One last word. While some aspects presented in the movie - such as the Hebrew numerology and mathematical concepts - are correct (that is, the explanations of Hebrew numerology are not made-up; That _doesn't_ mean I actually believe in any of the meanings attached to them), I suggest you to use your suspension-of-disbelief instead of trying to find logic and mistakes in them.<br/><br/>10/10"
"ccthemovieman-1","7","87","124","4 March 2006"," Hard To Add Up....But An Intriguing Curiosity Piece
","Now here'a film that is ""not for all tastes,"" as the cliché goes.<br/><br/>""Strange"" doesn't quite cover it but it is not that bizarre that you can't figure out what's happening. Director-writer Darren Arokofsky made a name for himself with his second movie, Requiem For A Dream, and this was the young filmmakers' first effort. It was made a tight budget since he was an unknown, but that's part of the attraction. This is grainy black-and-white, and so is the gritty story and most of the characters. The unique look fits the story.<br/><br/>It's not a story that is going to please a lot of people - an almost-demented math wizard trying to figure out stock market codes and two groups hounding him trying to cash in on his brainpower. One is trying to use him to make big money in the market and the other is trying to decipher ancient Jewish texts and thinks our mathematician can help. Meanwhile, he wants no part of any of these people.<br/><br/>Our hero, the numbers freak, thinks the entire world revolves around numbers. Everything in the universe, he thinks, can be figured out through number codes. Not only is he wacked and paranoid but so is about everyone in here. They all have strange ideas. Innovative camera-work makes the story even stranger. In fact, it's that photography that makes this DVD a part of my collection<br/><br/>If you're looking for something different here and there, I would give this curiosity piece a quick look. (It's not a long movie.) Overall, I thought this ""added up"" to an intriguing film, but if you give it a try and hate it, don't blame me."
"wilywilliam","10","79","112","11 April 2003"," Cohesive, stylish and innovative
","The predecessor to Requiem for a Dream, this is arguably more stylish and engaging. This is helped largely by the simply outstanding soundtrack. Aranovsky's use of a haunting yet modern score binds the movie together perfectly, aided by some fantastic cinematic techniques that disorientate the audience in time with the music. The character narration is also a great cohesive tool, with the deadpan delivery more than matching the tone of the piece. This film is not as beautiful as Requiem, nor does it have quite the same gutwrenching effect, but nonetheless, this is still some film. If you like your movies very hollywood then this is not for you; but if you like stylised innovation, then you have to watch this."
"Traska","8","99","148","15 August 1998"," An excellent mathematical sci-fi thriller.
","I am generally wary of movie portrayals of scientists and people who are supposedly scientific geniuses.  It seems that most movie-makers are not scientifically inclined and never manage to do a convincing job.  Pi, however, is a very interesting movie and Sean Gullette does a reaonably good job of portraying a genius on the edge of insanity.  My fears that this would be another typical bad science movie were quelled very quickly, never to return again. Of course, they didn't get all the details down pat, but most of it was believable (or close) and some of it was correct.  Comments on science aside though, I think this was one of the more interesting, and certainly one of the most original, movies I have seen this year.There are provocative metaphors hidden (well, not very deeply) throughout the movie (esp. the bugs), and the subject is so completely novel that it is really worth seeing.  In conclusion I would say that if you think a movie about number theory would be boring, in regard to this movie you would be wrong. If, like me, you think a movie about number theory would be exciting but probably done badly, then you will have to accept that this movie is not really about number theory, but about a number theorist.  As far as the execution goes though, you needn't worry about it, it is a pleasant relief from the usual."
"alyssong-1","7","33","45","21 February 2005"," Ending
","This was a strange and at times disturbing movie, but I strongly disagree with the statement that the director didn't know how to end the movie. The ending the director chose was very powerful (in my opinion). He was personifying Sol's hypothesis about computers: when they begin to crash they go in a cycle, and eventually realize their destruction, and end up spitting out their ""ingredients"" and putting an end to themselves. Max is like a computer. He goes in these destructive cycles with his headaches and eventually starts hallucinating. Max eventually figures out the magic number, but ends up destroying it as well as ""crashing"" (or drilling out in this case) the part of him (his computer) that is causing him such turmoil. The last time we see Max is when he is in the park, looking at the leaves in a tree looking actually happy. He isn't being torn apart trying to figure out the mathematical reasons behind life. I think the director had every intention to portray that. It was a very powerful ending, and a very well done movie."
"quixoboy","Null","96","145","5 October 2003"," Genius!
","I have yet to come even close to fully appreciating the sheer artistry and complexity of Darren Aronofsky's stunning mathematical/sci-fi thriller, ""Pi"". Watching this film, one can tell from the subdued effects, grainy black-and-white filter, and guerrilla-style filmmaking that this must be a low-budget independent film - NOT to try and downplay its impact, as many independent films can clearly surpass any typical Hollywood movie, in terms of style and subject matter.<br/><br/>""Pi"" is a perfectly concrete example of how the relative absence of special effects, explosions, etc. can still help create an engaging, and thoroughly unique viewing experience. Overflowing with intensity and hyperkinetic camerawork, this is a frightening roller-coaster ride of a film; despite clocking in at less than 90 minutes, ""Pi"" is by no means short on resonance - but rather leaves a heavy feeling of exuberance and fascination with the material that lasts long after it's finished. At the same time, though, people who aren't as open-minded to more obscure, abstract films like this would be, I think, surprised. This is not as complicated or bewildering a film as I had expected. If one can be able to focus intently on the story, the result is rewarding, and doesn't provide for much head-scratching. Its style seems rather modern, rather hip...at times it reminded me of ""The Matrix"" (which, ironically, was released the FOLLOWING year) what with its slick techno musical score and its flashy opening credits.<br/><br/>To shy away from this film simply because of its math content is to be completely shallow and ignorant. The way it handles the material is a whole lot more interesting than you'd probably think. Like ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Pi"" is an instant classic that serves to re-awaken my erratic interests in my poorest subject, mathematics. It's original, it's interesting, and above all - genius."

","First of all, this movie has absolutely nothing to do with mathematics or rationality except the Greek letter pi, which is the number 3,14159265358..., the formulas the main character wrote on a piece of paper in the underground-train and the few statements he cited from famous mathematicians. But relating the number pi with this Jewish religion-thing and with the stock-market is such an absurd idea, I just do not know what to say. No person who has some idea of mathematics would EVER make such abstruse connections.<br/><br/>The viewers, who are so enthused by this film, were only totally blinded by the main character's fits and the ""super cool"" pursuing-scenes, from which I only got a head-ache.<br/><br/>After a certain time, the movie was only about the sick fits of the main character and these pursuing-scenes, which are totally a pathetic and a desperate way of trying to make the movie fascinating for the viewer.<br/><br/>The movie-maker probably tried to make the movie totally spectacular with the schizophrenia, the fits of the main character, the sickness of the main character in general, the shaking of the camera in the pursuing-scenes, the black-and-white picture. But it did not impress me, it only made me almost throw up.<br/><br/>And by the way, if you bore with an electrical drill into your head, you die or you get totally disabled for life. You do not get away with only losing your intelligence like the main character in the movie.<br/><br/>The average viewer is totally made a fool of, because the movie makes him think that movie-plot is really ""intelligent"", which it is not, it is just all fictive, incoherent, disconnected and senseless.<br/><br/>And finally, the main character is another totally surreal and unrealistic product of the movie-maker's brain or society. There is always this ""thin line"" between genius and madness, but it is only cliché which is always applied to all fictive or non-fictive ""genius"" personalities, but I find this cliché totally ridiculous."

","Max Cohen is a mathematical and computer genius who seeks mathematical patterns in everything.  However he also suffers from intense headaches, dellusions and some paranoia.  He looks into patterns in the stock market only to find his ability sought by both a Wall Street trader, Marcy Dawson, and a Hasidic, Lenny Meyer, who both want the code for different reasons.<br/><br/>Before I saw this I must admit I heard a lot of hype but no actual details  so I was half-expecting an intense `Usual Suspects' thriller mixed with maths.  So I was a little disappointed at first.  However once over my preconceptions I was able to settle into this.  That is, if you can `settle into' something like this.  The story is clever it plays on paranoia and delusion  in fact it may or may not happen.  Even at the end of the film I was left wondering if Max was a genius or if he was a nutter and all this was in his mind.  The film uses this paranoia to create some good scenes and the thumping base music ups the ante a bit.<br/><br/>It's not an easy film to enjoy in the traditional sense, but it is an experience.  The subject matter is different enough to be interesting and the telling is clever  I for one can't wait to see what the director does with Batman: year one, it certainly won't be a camp Joel Schumacher film anyway!<br/><br/>Gullette (who also co-wrote) is good in the lead and is totally convincing. Mark Margolis is also good and it's good to see him in different roles, I know him from his strong role in Oz although he's not as good here.  The rest of the cast are good  but really the star here is the director as he manages to put us in Max's mind and involve us in the paranoia so thoroughly that we're not sure what is real and what isn't.<br/><br/>Overall this isn't as masterly as the hype suggests but it's different enough and compelling enough to be more than gripping for 90 minutes."

","This movie honestly confused the hell out of me. Being someone fairly interested/talented in math and science, I was absolutely lost as to the entire mathematical/scientific storyline being completely bogus. After reading some reviews, people don't even seem to mind. 'It's fine the storyline makes no sense,' no, it's really not. That alone was enough to turn me off, but the bad sound (Was that what it was? The music and effects just really started to irritate me, who knows) and over-the-top acting just made it worse.<br/><br/>I'm all for independent cinema, in fact that's the career I'm seriously considering at the moment, but independent is NOT in any way, shape or form an excuse for bad. Writing a scientific, mathematically themed script with 100% bogus science and math is absolutely wrong. Film makers are expected to have done research and know what they are talking about. Pi simply fails, and takes too many cinematic risks that don't equate to a good movie, but rather a poorly thatched together piece. It just didn't work.<br/><br/>Lastly, the religion element was over the top and entirely un-necessary.

"sol1218","8","11","16","4 October 2003"," The Perfect Number
","********SPOILERS******* Max Cohen, Sean Gullette, is obsessed with numbers. A mathematical genius who earned a PHD at the age of 16 has a theory about the universe and wants to prove it to his own satisfaction. 1. Math is the language of the universe. 2. Everything around us can be understood by numbers. 3. If you graph a number of any system patterns emerge, therefor patterns are everything in nature.<br/><br/>We're told by Max at the beginning of the movie that when he was a little boy his mother warned him not to stare into the sun because it would hurt his eyes, but Max did. He stared so long into the sun that he temporarily went blind. This may be the reason in the movie ""Pi"" why Max keeps getting terrible headaches and why he's constantly taking medication to relive them. <br/><br/>In his apartment in New York's Chinatown Max built Euclid a powerful computer that he feels can prove his theory. Using the stock market as a model Max tries to prove that even that can be deciphered by his calculations and feeds stock quotes into Euclid to prove his point by predicting their rising and falling in the future. <br/><br/>Patterns are everywhere in nature, Max says, even in the stock market. One afternoon when Max puts Euclid to it's final test to see if his theory is correct the computer crashes. Before it did it printed out a long string of numbers that seemed to make no sense at all to Max who threw it in the garbage. <br/><br/>Hurt that all that he did to prove his theory went up in smoke, Max goes to see his former mathematics and psychics professor Sol Robeson, Mark Margolis, to get some support and sympathy. <br/><br/>When Sol hears that Euclid printed a list of numbers before it crashed he gets very excited and asks Max how many numbers, 100, 1,000 216 how many? Max told Sol that it was all meaningless to him and that he threw it away. Later sitting in a diner Max runs into Lenny Meyer, Ben Shenkman, an Hasidic Jew who's also interested in numbers in the interpretation of the Kabbala. Lenny then tries to get Max interested in the mysteries of the Kabbala. Max doesn't realize at the time but later in the movie when he's saved from a gang of Wall Street goons by Lenny and his Hasidic friends that the number of God in the Talmud is exactly 216 digits! The number that he so foolishly discarded after Euclid crashed! The same number of digits that Sol gave him about how many numbers did his computer print out before it blew. Max, before he found out just what that number meant, starts to realize that there was something in what Euclid's last communication was but that he stupidly threw it away. Going back to the garbage where he threw the paper with the numbers away Max finds that it's long gone.<br/><br/>Earlier in the movie ""Pi"" we were introduced to an executive of a Wall Street firm Marcy Dawson, Pamela Hart, who was constantly pestering Max to lend his knowledge and services to her firm. Always ignoring and trying to avoid her things changed but after the crash of Max's computer Euclid. It's when Marcy offers Max something called a Ming Mecca chip, which is classified by the US government, Max suddenly becomes interested. Max needs that chip to restart his computer and find out what that important number that he so foolishly threw away was. <br/><br/>With everything set Max starts up Euclid and after some hesitation the elusive 216 digit number comes up on the screen but for some reason doesn't get printed so Max writes it down on a piece of paper and programs it back into the computer. With Euclid giving out information Max then sees that he can predict stock prices ahead of time. It's now that Max realizes that Sol has been keeping this information about a 216 digit number that can interpret all the patterns of the universe from him all these years. <br/><br/>Going to Sol's apartment to confront him about what he found out and why Sol tried to keep him from finding it out, Max is told by a nurse who answered the door that Sol passed away the day before. In Sol's apartment Max sees papers on which Sol wrote about what the same elusive number, God's number, was and what it meant and it seemed that the stress of all that work on Sol's part cause his death. <br/><br/>Max finally realized, what Sol did years ago, that there is some knowledge that is better kept to itself for it's too dangerous for anyone to pursue. <br/><br/>Very weird and at the same time interesting film by Darren Aronofsky about math and what math has to do with the working with the universe and how someone can become so obsessed with it that it can destroy him and everyone else that he comes in contact with."
"wickerman14","Null","3","3","31 October 2002"," good film techniques, grainy feel, weird atmosphere
","Darren Aronofsky's Pi is definitely a unique and innovative film. Starring a genius mathematician who has found the numerical key to the stock market, Pi takes you on a wild black and white adventure through his struggle against forces who want to use his discovery for their own purposes. Aronofsky's style becomes evident throughout the film as he uses not only the obvious black and white color scheme, but unique editing and camera techniques that contribute to a kind of surreal atmosphere and the very distinct feel of Pi. The first question is: why did Aronofsky choose to go black and white?  I think black and white has two major advantages.  First of all, now that Hollywood color cameras have become so good, modern color films please the eye but look less realistic.  They are saturated with bright, vibrant colors that make evident the use of predetermined lighting setups and look too crisp and beautiful to be real.  This can be avoided by reverting to black and white as Aronofsky did.  Secondly, if used deftly, black and white brings out the contrast of lights and darks, which looks more visually appealing.  Photographers often shoot in black and white because it brings out this pure contrast, without the viewer being fixated on color, and Aronofsky follows suit.  We best see the beauty of black and white in the opening scene, when Max is lying face-down on his desk.  The shadows on his face stand out against his silvery eyelid, which is the only moving thing in the picture. This image feels and looks very attractive, and hooks the viewer in so that he is interested in what this film is about. I think the use of black and white was successful with Pi. Besides the black and white color scheme, Aronofsky uses original editing techniques in Pi.  Whenever Max Cohen, the protagonist, takes his pills, we hear the cap on the pill container popping, him saying things like `200mg penicillin, marinol, 1mg dihydrogen mezolate.', fast-paced techno music, and the pills as they are swallowed.  We see flashing, fast-cut  images of pills being taken.  This scene is repeated throughout the movie and serves as a kind of constant repetition that keeps the viewer familiar and in rhythm with the movie.  Another example of Aronofsky's inventive editing is the scene in the subway, when Max pokes his own brain with a pencil. Every time he touches the brain, a sharp, high pitched buzzing noise ensues and the screen flashes white.  After a while, the white screen dissolves into an image of an oncoming subway train.  This scene provokes a kind of disgusted, `weirded-out' reaction in the viewer that could not have been created had it not been for Aronofsky's editing.  The editing of Pi contributes to its very different feel, and both the pills and the brain scene add to what makes this film different from any modern Hollywood thriller. A particular scene that I find demonstrates great mis-en-scene is the one in the subway, when Max is walking hesitantly towards what seems to be his own brain sitting on the stairs.  It is set up symmetrically, and the ceiling supports on either side of Max vanish into a very clear, even horizon line.  It is at first a long shot, where we can see Max's hesitant movements and body language from a distance.  The white pillars in the subway station contrast sharply with the dark floor.  Then, as Max moves forward, we can distinguish his features and the screen becomes black with his jacket and pants, and when he kneels down to examine the brain, his face is lit strongly by studio lights.  All the while, suspenseful synthesizer rhythms are playing in the background. This scene has a bizarre atmospheric tone to it, and is very characteristic of the entire film. The great mis-en-scene and editing of Pi fit it into the Formalist category.  Although the action scenes, such as the one where Max chases a photographer out the subway and into the street, are shot with a shaky camera, every angle seems calculated to provide exciting visuals rather than to document events realistically.  When the movie mellows out, such as in the numerous scenes in Max's apartment, the camera rarely moves.  Instead of panning around, Aronofsky simply changes our view of the action.  This is more quiet and subtle, instead of having so much Blair Witch-esque movement. Also, the fast cuts in the pill scenes were definitely predetermined and Formalist.  Overall, I think Pi is well put together and that its Formalist shots are beautiful. Pi is a great example of the best things that come from low budget independent movie making. Aronofsky proves to us that ideas are more important than money, and good acting more interesting than special effects. It's a pity mainstream Hollywood ignores this time and time again.  With its grainy, flashing, black and white textures, beautifully put together scenes, and fresh editing techniques, Pi is an innovative masterpiece of underground film."

","PI is unlike any film I have ever seen. Shot on a handheld camera in black and white, it has the jitters like a 14 year old wired on Espresso from Starbucks.<br/><br/>The visual style of this film sets it apart from the crowd at the first available moment.  Shot in grainy black and white, the filmmaker achieved a dark, and moody atmosphere from which to view the workings of a genius mathematician.  A solid choice in my mind, seeing only light and dark, id and ego, alpha and omega, without the clutter of color. His is the world of a mathematician bent on proving order, in a universe of apparent chaos.<br/><br/>The story - a mathematician is seeking order through mathmatics in a chaotic world, using a supercomputer that occupies a good portion of his small apartment.  He is, as all good protagonists are, flawed. Max Cohen suffers from a childhood illness - causing him great pain.  His search for order, brings him into close contact with a religious group obsessed with numerology, and a group of wall streeters - fighting for the rights to his abilities.<br/><br/>The movie is tough to encapsulate beyond that.<br/><br/>PI is a must see.  It may not be your usual fare, but the powerful filming, editing, and offbeat scoring keep you involved throughout the 85 minute run time.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky has made a truly unique film, one that put me in quite the same mood as Eraserhead or Videodrome, which I think is more of a compliment to Lynch and Cronenberg given that PI was more riveting, and thought provoking than either of them.<br/><br/>8/10 - PI Will soon be added to my own collection..."
"Rob@home","7","5","6","2 May 2000"," Dark, Gripping, but Falls Slightly Short on Believability
","Writers Aronofsky and Gullette have crafted a dark, psychological thriller that centers around, of all things, math and numbers.  One would think that there was no way that this could hold anyone's interest, but they managed to pull it off.  ""Pi"" reminds us that genius is just this side of madness, and that great intelligence is a burden as well as a gift.<br/><br/>Gullette plays Max Cohen, the brilliant and tortured mathematician, beautifully and without overacting.  His mind seethes with the possibilities that lie waiting inside number systems.  However, the strain that his talent places on him results in blinding, hallucinogenic migraines.  The scenes where Max falls victim to his ailment are tense, well-directed, and have just the right amount of creepiness.<br/><br/>The one beef that I have with this picture pertains to the other characters who are meant to be the film's antagonists.  Two parties - a Wall Street firm and a Hasidic Jewish sect are after Max for his abilities.  Neither of these relationships are expanded on enough to make the viewer care about them.  Of the two, the sect members are the most believable.  However, the stockbrokers and Max's encounters with them scream ""film school"".  The loud-mouthed and overbearing businesswoman is more a parody of ""the suits"", and doesn't fit in with the rest of the film.  You are left thinking that the only reason these characters appeared at all was as a plot device to get Max the parts he needed.<br/><br/>A minor, but nagging point - are we really to believe, in this day and age where nearly everyone has seen the inside of a PC, that Max's super-processor is a black cube with four pins?  I saw this film with a bunch of other techie-type folk, and our collective reaction was ""he's going to run his calculations on a bridge rectifier?""<br/><br/>All in all, this film is entertaining for those who enjoy offbeat cinema. Those looking for ""The Matrix"" aren't going to be satisfied at all.  Math, science, and computer geeks won't wince too much.  Hollywood SFX blockbuster this isn't, but that's not a bad thing.  Overall, a good film with a few minor drawbacks."

","On a recommendation, I rented the video 'Pi' and forced myself to watch it, having to stop the video several times.  I think I would have experienced less pain having my wisdom teeth extracted, than watching the 85 minutes of this grainy,  psychedelic mess.  The film tries to be deep and profound, and I'm sure many people buy into it, and will say I missed the point.  Anyone with any knowledge of science in general and is willing to call things like they are, is likely to see how superficial and false the film is.  Thrown together with the gritty, black and white visuals and strange camera angles, is a continuous throbbing techno beat, and the dabble into religious mysticism, medical problems, mathematic theorems, and mental illness.  I'm sure the film makers hoped this mix would make Max's quest for answers and his journey into madness seem a revelation.  I found the film disturbing and slow moving.  However, if you're one that likes to dig for meaning that isn't there and can believe a mainframe computer is made of several keyboards and old TV sets tied together, then by all means see this film.  My only recommendation is don't make the mistake I did; which was seeing this film sober."
"chocolat_oasis","1","44","81","28 June 2003"," Not a Modern Prometheus
","Like Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"", ""Pi"" aims to be a modern update to the greek Prometheus and Icarus myths. It warns against scientists venturing into certain areas of knowledge. Unfortunately one point where ""Pi"" fails miserably is in its depiction of modern science: the days of early greek scientists working mostly alone is long gone, modern science is very much a social endeavor. ""Pi"" however sticks to the rogue scientist image embodied in the loner mathematician Max Cohen. Its modernization seems to be limited to technological aspects: there's a lot of technobabble about patterns in the number Pi, computers becoming sentient etc. All good natured fun in ""Star Trek"" but the seriousness with which it is brought in ""Pi"" made its inaccuracy really annoying. Perhaps the movie's makers should have used Shelley's approach to avoid embarrasing themselves: just mention all that technology is dangerous and you don't want to talk about it to avoid corrupting the reader/viewer. But then again, what would have been left in this movie? Nothing much I'm afraid, Max doesn't seem to be a very interesting character, his relationship (or lack thereof) with his female neighbour is only briefly touched upon etc. Overall ""Pi"" is repetitious, contains too many scenes of Max just vomiting/banging his head into something/... and is just plain boring."

","My studies and career have been intimately entwined with mathematics and numbers. I like numbers, I understand numbers, they make sense to me. So with the many favorable comments on this movie, titled after that fundamental measure of a circle's circumference to its diameter, 'PI', I went into this eagerly. I found it on Netflix streaming movies.<br/><br/>Overall it is a big disappointment for me. Sean Gullette is the central character Max Cohen, a New York non-religious Jew, who is also a mathematics genius. Graduated from college at 16, a PhD at 20. <br/><br/>But as his voice-over tells us, as a young boy he was told not to stare at the sun, but he did anyway when he was 6. Some time later, as the bandages were removed he began slowly to see light again. And he also started having headaches. All this presumably contributed to his math genius and his borderline madness.<br/><br/>The meat of the story comes when he is using his computer at home and it spits out a long string of numbers, perhaps 200 or so, maybe a bit more. Then in a chance meeting with a Hasidic Jew, learns that there is a rumor that a mysterious 216-digit number matched to symbols in the Torah spells out the name of God. So Max begins to wonder if somehow his computer had spit out that number, now on a paper he had discarded.<br/><br/>So we follow Max as he gets confused, or angry, and yells at everyone around. Followed by a woman who wants his codes for predicting the stock market. All in all not a very satisfying viewing for me.<br/><br/>One thing fun was seeing veteran actor Mark Margolis as Max's former graduate adviser Sol Robeson. Margolis had a key role in the TV series ""Breaking Bad"" as the wheelchair bound and mute member of the Mexican drug lord family."
"MartinHafer","8","8","11","18 January 2014"," Although difficult to watch, a wild and amazingly unique independent film.
","""Pi"" is an amazing independent films. Darren Aronofsky had never made a feature film and was barely able to scrape together the $60,000 needed to make this film. Despite this pitifully small budget, he managed to make a remarkably watchable film AND it caught the eyes of the 'big boys'--and soon he was given $1,000,000 for his film! While not quite as insanely successful as ""The Blair Witch Project"" (which came out the following year), unlike the filmmakers of this other project, Aronofsky has gone on to greater things--including the wildly successful and critically acclaimed ""Black Swan"" as well as ""The Wrestler"".<br/><br/>Describing the look of the film is VERY difficult. Sure, it's cheap but Aronofsky managed to get past this by using black & white and deliberately making the print very grainy--giving it a wonderfully surreal look. I am not exactly sure how he did this but it worked well. And, because he wasn't able to use top equipment, it has a bit of a homemade look--which I was able to look past. Much of this was because the plot was so wild and surreal as well as very stylish.<br/><br/>Describing the plot...well that's even MORE difficult! It's a strange tale about a man who is on the edge of losing his mind. He is convinced that everything in nature and life can be quantified and explained through mathematics. And, given that you can find the correct mathematical formula, you can predict and understand EVERYTHING. So Maximillian spends nearly every second of his waking day devoted to this all-encompassing task. He avoids relationships, is very unkempt and is a miserable excuse for a human being. And, eventually it all begins to take its toll as he begins to hallucinate and experiencing excruciating pain in his body and brain. What's next for this incredibly strange man with his seemingly impossible task? See the film! <br/><br/>This is a very, very difficult film to rate. It gets very high marks for originality and it is entertaining. However, it's NOT a film for the mainstream. The average Joe would probably find it all just too weird and too confusing. But, if you want something different and are patient, it's well worth seeing."
"Logos_Removed","Null","8","11","22 December 2002"," It's not so black and white.
","This intriguing film reminded me of David Lynch's Eraserhead somewhat. The soundscape of the movie was very industrial in places and the metaphorical imagery used was reminiscent of the early Lynch film. Unlike Eraserhead however this effort has ""student film-maker"" written all over it, which is not to detract from the entertainment value of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie's protagonist thinks mathematics can provide the answers to the big questions, but finds out the painful way that it cannot. This is all illustrated quite appropriately within a hallucinatory milieu. Unfortunately is it all a bit too obvious unlike David Lynch who can have machinations within machinations to the point of indecipherability. That criticism aside, the lighting, sound effects and photography were all interesting and combined to provide a claustrophobic feeling and a sense of unrelenting futility.<br/><br/>To sum the piece struck me as the early work of a director who is on the up and up. I am looking forward to seeing some more of his work in the future. I enjoyed this movie despite its flaws and give it a 6/10 score."

","* warning: mild spoilers *<br/><br/>While intellectually this film is actually beyond the normal Hollywood fare (because it's not from Hollywood), most of the people who find beauty or truth or whatever in this movie reflects on the poverty of math and science education in America (and possibly elsewhere). Here are a few things that show why.<br/><br/>1. Patterns are everywhere because there's no fixed set of patterns. And it's a reflection ""after the fact."" In other words, you can find patterns everywhere but they are by definition a reflection of what has happened. The movie mentions it but drops it in favor of some theological meaning. That's fine for the movie's purpose; otherwise there'd be no story. But to think that's true in life would be a big mistake.<br/><br/>2. Pi takes the conventional wisdom especially from religions: that humans can't understand and thus be ""god"" without bad things happening. This is why at the end the genius destroys his own ingenuity and becomes happy as an average guy. ""Ignorance is bliss,"" so the Church once told its believers. Most people still seem to accept it today.<br/><br/>3. For those who scoff at 216, it's actually a very long number. There are virtually 10^26 permutations (the Hasidics said it's a 216-word name), since every digit can be anything from 0 to 10. That's 100 TRILLION TRILLION [sic] possibilities, so when Max said the Jews had tried all of them but couldn't understand ""the context,"" it's wrong.<br/><br/>Things like these should be apparent to anyone who's taken the advanced math classes in high school. Few movies treat science with the respect it deserves, and though this one is respectful it still uses the cliches against it. That so many people find this picture deep shows that science and math are pathetic subjects in American schools."

I kept rolling my eyes throughout this movie, which makes Armageddon look like a scientific paper. It completely lost credibility in the first 15 minutes, then went downhill. Yeah, one could say, but this is not about science. Well, it uses science to prove that the idiotic idea of numbers-god-madness thing is a possibility. What an awful, appalling, manipulative piece-of-youknowwhat! Here is the recipe for movies like this:<br/><br/>1. Take a premise which 99% of the people won't understand 2. Add a cup of religious fear and/or belief 3. Add a cup of medical condition (mental, if possible) 4. Mix them all together until you get an unrecognizable mess which looks and smells like youknowwhat. 5. Bake it a little (but leave it half-baked). 6. Serve it black and white, grainy so that it looks exotic. Some people will eat it up thinking that it is a rare gourmet treat. It will give them an opportunity to show everyone that they are special, so they will rave about it. (Most will hate it but will join the praising, just to not look 'the stupid, who didn't get it'.) 7. Cash in the awards. (Warning: It's a gamble.

","This review is for those of you who are fans of science fiction, who are sitting on the fence, deciding whether or not to view this film after hearing such great reviews for it. If you are in this category, please read! Do not make the same mistake that I did. I purchased Pi and Requiem for a Dream (the director's next film), solely based on the ratings they received here.<br/><br/>Director Darren Aronofsky is not interested in telling a story. There is indeed a silly plot; however, it is more of a concept, a framework for the director to shape his ""cinematic modern art"" around. I have no problem with the fact that the idea of finding a universal constant is ludicrous; such outlandish ideas are often the back-bone of sci-fi classics. In fact, had the director made an honest attempt to tell a story, the film could have been quite captivating. Instead we are left with a mess that will literally assault the viewer and make them nauseous.<br/><br/>We are treated to close-up after close-up of the protagonist popping pills, seemingly one of the director's trademark effects. Chase sequences in which the camera shakes violently; when combined with the ultra-contrasting black and white nature of the film, it has a strobe light effect. In addition we are subjected to high-pitched, ear-piercing pitches and tones (much like that of a modem or fax machine) which signify his insanity, and a telephone that will not stop ringing.<br/><br/>Discussing the plot beyond this is pointless. The math is secondary at best. The real focus here is that the main character is going insane and this gives the director the opportunity to portray that insanity through art-full direction.<br/><br/>Example: Several times during this film the main character is working at his computer, entering data. He states that he must now hit the ""Enter"" key to see the results. If successful, the computer will display this magic number. *Each time* his finger hovers over the ""Enter"" key for a long length of time but he does not press it, *each time* he goes into psychopathic fits. The viewer sits thinking ""just push the damn button already!!!""<br/><br/>Conclusion? This is an obscure, sophomoric, amateur, style over substance film. THE single worst film that I have ever seen. 1 out of 10 and that's being kind! You have been warned."

There may have been a plot but it was hidden very well under a lot of obscure badly edited, badly acted scenes I believe that actors and directors should continually push back the boundaries of what constitutes art but someone has to moderate these lunatics, Pi it seems slipped through the net. This sort of film appeals to the Pseudo-Intellectual who sits spell bound and declares to have had some Damastine revelation about the world or their life as a result of seeing this work of 'absolute genius.' They are, of course, lying....there is nothing clever about this film, there is nothing redeeming about it in any way at all.

You can't understand nature by looking at just one specific number and that a part from this isn't really that important for nature. pi is just pi there is nothing behind it, is's geometry. There are more import constants i.e. h ( Heisenberg constant). If you want to understand or describe nature then you have to use physics and use math. Both are strongly interconnected now a days. This is actually a fact that everyone knows. They could at least have adopted ""Fermats Last Theorem"" by Simon Singh to make a good and believable movie about a mathematician's live.<br/><br/>This brings up the second thing that I disliked: the cliché of the obsessed math nerd. Usually mathematicians are enjoying their work and they aren't more or less obsessed than anybody else who loves what he/she is doing. Why is nobody filming a positive and realistic film about scientists or mathematicians. I mean there are enough groundbreaking scientists out there. Just take Einstein, Fermi, Heisenberg, Euler or even take some string-theorists... All of them are trying hard to understand how nature works. Besides without Einstein and others no filmmaker could use all the fancy digital/analog filmediting stuff they usually use, so they should give those guys some respectfull tribute instead of this mockerish portrait.

The guy didn't even portray a schizophrenic very well.<br/><br/>The protagonist kept talking about looking for structure in the stock market, which is a chaotic system. This is hardly an original idea. People have tried to apply structural models to the market, but the market responds to such stimuli by changing in unpredictable ways, so that the rules upon which models are built are no longer valid. Any decent mathematician (and our protagonist is supposed to be a genius) would've already known this. Oh well, no one expects movie makers to have any real brains, anyway, right?<br/><br/>But this movie didn't compensate its lack of mathematical intrigue with ANYTHING else - it was just a bunch of meaningless dialog between characters too shallow to be even worth caring about - that is, when the viewer wasn't being subjected to miles of footage of the protagonist picking his nose (literally!), or some equally idiotic and boring behavior.<br/><br/>As far as movies concerning math, a MUCH BETTER movie is ""A Beautiful Mind.""

","The basic problem with this film is its content. If we were to retrocede back to the times of Lumière when cinema consisted of the beauty of muted black and white photography in motion, and then watched Pi under that light, i.e. as a choreography of moving images, then this film wouldn't be bad at all. Actually, as I was watching it I realised how easy it was to turn what is essentially a bad film into a quite satisfactory cinematic experience: simply turn off the sound (if in the cinema, cover your ears). Whoever was in charge of the photography had a good sense of what he was doing. It even is related to silent cinema: the dream-sequences which show the mathematician doing a sort of brain surgery on his own brain are an obvious quote of or homage to Buñuel's Chien Andalou. So what is amiss with its content? First of all the actual mathematics behind the story are bogus. To anyone minimally cultured or with some interest in science will squirm in agony at such numeric gibberish; the sheer ignorance of whoever was responsible for the script is worrying. Am I to understand that nowadays American independent cinema is trying to sell its products to the same audience that has been bashed into dumbness and allergy to culture by Bruce Willis and his cronies? Instead of consulting with mathematicians, the people responsible to the film seem to have decided that ""they won't notice, so what's the difference"". But that is not the only problem with Pi. There is this annoying overacting that makes the film border on a parody of itself. ""It is death"" [referring to the number pi], cries the professor, with such exaggerated gestures and emphasis, that one can't help laughing at the whole ridiculous situation. And then there is all the psychosis and drug-addiction of the main character, which simply doesn't fit in with anything the film seems to be about, and gets on one's nerves. Finally there is the repetitiveness of the whole film. I think a well done trailer of the film would contain everything the long version does.

","PI is one of the few movies where I have walked out in boredom part-way thru the showing. Tempted in by a glowing review, citing the film as something approaching classic perplexing art-house, I suspected after the first five minutes that the reviewer must have been mistaken. Or was on the production crew! Honestly, I've patience for and interest in art-house when it's done well, but in my opinion this film really doesn't even begin to cut it. This movie is ninety odd minutes of rambling, aimless doodle. It doesn't even get by on the fact that it's shot on grainy 16mm Tri-X film. Quite how it ever got financed boggles my imagination.

","Maths genius Max Cohen finds himself being pressured by a a corporate gang who want to make profits on the stock market and a bunch of kabbala Jews who want to contact god <br/><br/>There that's the premise of PI . One that on the surface seems both entertaining and slightly bizarre , but I have to warn you that this is one of the most bizarre movies I've seen in a long time , try and imagine David Lynch on acid and you may just start to understand how strange this movie is . Did I use the word "" Understand "" in this review ? Believe me that word will be coming up frequently since I couldn't understand the plot at all , that's right this reviewer has the courage to admit that he doesn't understand maths , he doesn't understand kabbalistic dogma , or that doesn't understand what maths has got to do with the stock market since it's run by market forces not mathematical equations . I also didn't understand the scenes with Max stabbing a brain with a pencil or what he was doing sitting on a park bench at the end since he drove a power drill through his head in the penultimate scene .<br/><br/>If any of the above sounds so crazy you want to watch it because of the craziness factor be warned because much of the running time is taken up with Max sitting in front of a computer doing equations . That's right a man sitting in front of a computer same as you're doing right now as I sit in a computer typing up this review . Can there be anything as tedious or as unexciting or as uncinematic as watching someone in front of a computer ? The only scene of PI that elicts any type of excitement is when Max is saved from the corporate bad guys by the kabbalistic bad guys but apart from that the rest of PI revolves mainly around Max tapping away at his keyboard doing maths <br/><br/>Perhaps because of the dry subject matter director Darren Aronofsky does make the movie as bizarre as possible but it's nightmarish rather than involving , disturbing rather than entertaining , hateful rather than admirable with the cinematography , editing and musical score making this a very memorable piece of indie art house if for not all the wrong reasons then certainly not for all the right reasons - I've watched a great number of horror movies and very few of them have freaked me out as much as PI . Though if you look at the trivia section on this page you'll see that the production has a few interesting stories behind it so credit where it's due . But it still remains a movie that will be hated by a mainstream audience"

","I'd heard about this movie after reading an article where a formula was discovered to let users calculate the nth digit of pi without having to calculate any of the previous digits.  As interested as I was to see this movie is about as dismayed as I am after having seen it.<br/><br/>This movie contains all the right elements--pi, randomness, number theory, stock market chaos (the theory, not the traders) and the players that would likely be found in those fields.  But like your mother's cut-up spaghetti, none of the ends tie together in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is shot in grainy, high-contrast black and white.  Some may call it stylistic; I thought it was plainly harsh on the eyes.  There's a reason Hollywood has pursued different film types since the days of Buster Keaton. According to the commentary on the DVD I rented, the director stated that he wanted to ""let viewers see this movie from the perspective of Max's brain."" I think a better question is why anyone would _want_ to get in Max's paranoid, delusional, headache-prone brain.<br/><br/>The film attempts to bond together the Kabbalah (Jewish numerical mysticism), the stock market fluctuations, pi (and its randomness) and Nature's cycles.  But like cheap glue it fails.  The subplot of Wall Street thugs bent on discovering a market forecaster is both unexplained and implausible.  The supercomputer Max has apparently built from discarded computer parts is barely possible, and strangely prone to a few stray ants. One funny moment comes when Max's former teacher, Saul, explains to him that the 216-digit number spit out by his computer before it crashed was a form of silicon consciousness.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be funny.  The only plausible plot in this movie is that of the Kabbalah number theorists, but the movie spends more time explaining who they are than what their mission is about.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie Pi leaves as many questions unanswered as there are digits of the number left to compute.  Unlike Conspiracy Theory and Enemy of the State, two paranoid movies which give credence to conspiracists, Pi offers no explanations for its unfathomable conjectures.  I was simply left to wonder why I wasted the last 85 minutes of my life."

The movie looks like a film student's attempt to create some MTV version of 1940s film noir.<br/><br/>After 10 minutes, you keep waiting for the story to develop, but it never goes anywhere. All you see is endless repetition, both visually and musically, if you can even call the score music. I watched it to the end only because a good friend recommended it, but so little actually took place, that I found I could read the Sunday Times at the same time.<br/><br/>While the film was made in 1998, the computer complex looks like something from the 1970s which just adds to the lack of any believability. There isn't a character you can take any interest in, other than Samia Shaoib who happens to be gorgeous, but she does no more than make a cameo appearance.<br/><br/>I like creative films and look for ones that are outside of the Hollywood mainstream, but this sure doesn't qualify.

","-may be a spoiler-<br/><br/>Pi. Wow. Just by the title, one can tell how silly this is. This is a film that is trying too hard, which is why it became such a popular movie in the cult genre. I often find that, when I am talking to someone about movies, and they say that ""pi"" or something like it is their favorite film, I know what they are trying to do. They want me to think they are intellectuals, or different in some way or another. However, they are far from it, like ""pi"". I am not some of the people that wrote negative reviews on the movie because they thought it was unrealistic or didn't make sense or whatever. Rather, I am saying that I can understand what Aronofsky was thinking, and what he was trying so desperately to do, and I saw right through it. Should I call a movie good simply because it is different? Absolutely not. That is not what makes a film good. <br/><br/>David Lynch is my favorite director. He is able to inspire some sort of fantastic feeling in all of his films. He understands the film medium and knows how to create a world that is so distant yet so familiar by looking below the surface of about every environment imaginable. He has proven the fact that, as Stan Brakhage puts it, ""the eye is an extension of the brain"".<br/><br/>Now, why is ""pi"" a failure? Because it is trying to create by distorting things the wrong way, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. The most obvious example being the grainy, black and white cinematography. Does the movie really need to be excessively grainy? No. Of course not. And one may think of it as expressionistic or meaningful, but I don't. I just think that Darren Aronofsky is trying to be a member of a certain group of underground filmmakers, which is understandable because it is his first feature.<br/><br/>If you want to see a film that is less accessible but more powerful than pi, see Eraserhead. I understand that everybody links the two, but maybe it is for a good reason. As for Aronofsky's latest film, Requiem for a Dream, I think the same way. Sure, the acting is magnificent, but step back and look at the film. With Requiem, Aronofsky is TRYING to upset us, and does it by constantly and constantly sending us spiraling down with the characters. Sorry, but I dislike that motive as well."

","Pi is one insane film.  I thought college algebra was tough and thank God there are crazy mathematical wizards like Max (Sean Gullette) to take care of digits and theorems that mean nothing to the common man.  This is not really the point of Pi, an artistic masterwork made on a $60,000 budget, meant to put the viewer through a paranoid nightmare.<br/><br/>I was reminded of films made in the same vein like Welles' THE TRIAL, or Soderbergh's KAFKA, both black and white films with a frenetic pace and distorted narrative.  Pi is hypnotic filmmaking not meant for all tastes (by any means) and it is a wonder how writer-director Darren Aronofsky got any kind of financial backing.  His relatives probably did not see the picture until it was in the can or they may have pulled out.  This is not a knock. I found the film to be a true work of genius in an avant-garde manner, something you don't see much in American cinema these days.<br/><br/>Here is a film that exists entirely within the main character's state of mind.  He is a math freak whose passion, or should I say obsession, is killing him literally.  To top it off, some sinister people from a religious cult want some answers through numbers and some Wall Street people are out for blood and money.  Forget plot, forget character, forget narrative. This film is a nightmare in structure and appearance.  I would not have been surprised to find the action took place in some netherworld.<br/><br/>Why see Pi?  I guess the same reason we had to learn some of this mathematical crap in high school.  There are no redeeming qualities or any revelations made.  Just some grainy, often stunning black and white images and situations that knocks the wind out of you.  If you see it, don't look to deep for any religious or scientific symbolism, at least on first viewing.  Pi will absorb you whether you hate it or not.  This is a very ambitious outing from first-time filmmakers Aronofsky and Gullette and I give them much credit for creating a work of art I've never seen the likes of before.<br/><br/>RATING: UNCLASSIFIABLY Good"

","This fascinating low-budget movie is about - well - the meaning of life in a sense. The main character, Max, is a semi-mad loner, a mathematic genius whose life's obsession is to sort out the chaos that is the universe in a coherent mathematical, that is to say, numerical - to him understandable - fashion. He doesn't have sex and he doesn't socialize; in fact, any contact with humans other than the old man - mentor? - is merely a waste of time and a triviality he would very well gladly do without entirely. The friendly chatter which his attractive Indian neighbour tries to repeatedly initiate falls on deaf ears. The little Asian girl that tests his computing skills he only affably tolerates possibly because she talks numbers with him and not so much because she is an innocent child.<br/><br/>The first thing he informs us is that he's had headaches ever since regaining his sight after having briefly lost it at the age of six when he starred directly at the sun in spite of being warned not to by his mother. It is to be assumed that from that point onwards his mind, his life, was focused on only one thing: to figure it all out. He later adds that he recalls as he starred at the sun that he saw a pattern or something, that what he saw made sense in a way and that he wanted to understand it better - whatever ""it"" was. The headaches are to be interpreted as the result of his (growing) frustration in failing to get to ""the answer"" i.e. the number or pattern. His obsession and the resulting thousands of hours of work and energy that he has invested in exploring the world of numbers - particularly as they relate to the ""pi"" value and spirals - has turned him into a mental mess. He consumes huge amounts of medication to fight the migraine, the shakes and God knows what else. His single-mindedness and rigid focus on finding the truth of all truths is increasingly bringing him to the very verge of total insanity.<br/><br/>His dogmatic refusal to accept the world as a place of chaos which neither he nor anyone else can fully or even partially control lead him to the idea that there is an inherent order in the universe and that it - like absolutely everything else - is based on clean and understandable numerical laws and principles. It isn't a coincidence that it was a look at the Sun that triggered this in him; the Sun is round after all, the symbol of life (on Earth, at least) and the ""pi"" value - which is something mathematicians have been working on for centuries - is related to the computation of a circle. He refuses to accept the existence of a world in which there is no order - however blurry and elusive that order may be. He believes that he will get to that number - which he finds out consists of a sequence of 216 numbers - best by analyzing the world stock markets, and later even the numerical significance of texts in the Torah. And as he gets closer to the truth/the number/the pattern i.e. to giving order a name, or a numerical value to the (non)chaos, ironically his own life gets increasingly chaotic: he suffers illusions, the old man gets a stroke, the fanatical Jewish organization is after him, the stock-broker firm is after him, the attacks get worse, etc. In the subway-station hallucination he sees a brain and he instinctively wants to poke it with a pen; this is perhaps subject to free interpretation, but I believe that this is his sub-conscious wish to lobotomize himself, i.e. free himself from the miserable, manic, and uncomfortable existence which has been torturing his mind (and body) for so long. There is an implied, certain amount of self-hate in him; he hates the (dominant) part of him which seeks this number. His old friend, it seems, knows more about Max's quest than he'd admit, because he was there once, too. He warns Max about continuing his search; he tells him that it's both futile and leads to self-destruction. But self-destruction or at least the sort-of lobotomical self-destruction is perhaps what Max wants. He seeks the answer so that he can finally rest.<br/><br/>The old man eventually (apparently) finds the (series of) number(s) and dies(?) from a second stroke. Max takes the paper with the figures and goes completely mad. In one of the final scenes he undergoes an almost religious experience in which he, well, sees the light - literally. This is entirely free for interpretation. A religious person will say that he has seen God, whereas an atheist like myself will say that he underwent something remotely comparable to what Dave undergoes in the last half-hour of ""2001""; i.e. that he has gotten insight into the secret(s) of the universe, that he has finally learned how the chaos is controlled - or not controlled as may be the case. In the end, he performs a quasi lobotomy on himself, rather unsubtly with a drill. Again, why he does this may or may not be obvious. I believe that he found the truth and that it was so overwhelming - in a positive or negative way (or maybe even both) - that he, as a mere human, couldn't handle it. So he took his genius, and perhaps this knowledge away from him with the drill. The last scene in the park shows the Asian girl asking him her usual mathematical questions. Max says he doesn't know the answer to the first one. The second is to divide 748 by 238. He doesn't say anything, but merely looks up at the sky (or Sun). Of course, the answer to this is 3.14..."

","Aronofsky's debut shows the kind of potential he has as a director. Seeing what he did on a shoestring budget is a reminder of what Spielberg did with his debut in ""Duel"". Pi seems to have a very interesting plot as the film starts, however, sets off in the wrong direction thereafter.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the discovery of a man named Max, a genius mathematician who spends what seems like all of his time on his computer looking for a pattern in numbers that none of his predecessors could find. Eventually Max comes upon these numbers in what seems to be a fluke situation and from here on in, he begins his downfall. Max is the victim of violent headaches as a result of staring at the son when he was six-years-old. The fact that this was thrown into the plot seems unnecessary and really has no effect on the film. I believe that Aronofsky should have just left these violent headaches to his unending desire to figure out the patterns.<br/><br/>Up to this point, the film goes well until unnecessary third parties are thrown into the equation. The choice of stock brokers and ultra-orthodox jews aren't most people's idea of the bad guys in film (try substituting these groups for villains found in any action film and you'll see what I mean). One scene involving Max being dragged into the car by the Moses-like beards that comprised the religious group is funnier that most Saturday Night Live skits even though it isn't meant to be.<br/><br/>Aronovsky chooses to use these new catalysts to drive Max crazy quicker. Sticking to his obsession with numbers would have been more effective and probably a lot more interesting since these groups are not at all menacing.<br/><br/>The use of grainy black-and-white film was a nice touch here. It really helps to show that there is no cohesiveness in Max's life and how unimportant he would be if someone else got there hands on the number. The ending is also very satisfactory, tying up the film the best way possible. Sean Gullette's performance as Max is also very believable and quite gripping. Without Gullette, this film would be nothing as his emotions are what really keep it going.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see what Aronofsky has in store. <br/><br/>7/10 stars."

The arrogance of the film is that the director/writer seems to plainly say to the audience ""Look at what important and complex things I think about and, if you like this movie, then you're smart, too."" The intellectual topics that begin the story are meant to impress the audience with the notion that the film maker is a deep thinker. But when nothing comes of anything, when dialog is scanty, when lengthy empty scenes prove pointless, what the audience is left with is just deeply harsh cinematography that is brutal on the eyes. But, oh wait, this must be some artistic manifestation of the protagonist's childhood trauma. The very use of a stark but grainy black and white medium adds to the pretense of this project. Here we have a director, completely drunk on his mighty cinematic vision, taking a beautiful spark of an idea and turning it into road kill. I was relieved that scenes of Jackson Pollock-type visuals were not used to depict the protagonist's growing mental anguish, though this may have used up time better than the bugs and brain...but, oh, wait, these were artistic metaphors!

Independent of that, I agree with the guy who told that the ending of this movie fits the sentence ''ignorance is a bliss''.<br/><br/>Maximillian Cohen is a mathematical prodigy who is utilizing the stock market as his data set, trying to uncover patterns with the assistance of his homemade supercomputer. He has headaches since he is 6 years old, when he stared into the sun at such length, that the doctors didn't if he would see again. But his headaches are a big problem to his health, since they let him debilitated, and he is more and more addicted to drugs then ever. He also suffers from paranoia and social anxiety disorder.(Very nerd, isn't he?) While trying to found a pattern of the stock market,he begins to believe that he has found the key to understanding the universe, but as he closes in on the answer,he begins to stay more and more sick and full of hallucinations. A number of mysterious people become interested in his research, including a woman from a Wall Street firm and a group of kabbalistic Jews who believe that the Torah, when represented as numbers instead of letters, contains the true name of God, an example of a Bible code."

","This is the first film in my history that I rented and have stopped watching, in fact I stopped watching after only 20 minutes.  This film plays like a documentary and for crying out loud, a documentary about Mathematics is NOT interesting!  And I studied Engineering Math!<br/><br/>A film ought to be at least one of several things, it should either be entertaining or of a documentary about a topic of interest.  For me this film was neither.  And I found the over-exposed B&W cinematography to be very unwatchable to boot.<br/><br/>Bleh - a terrible film!"

","Mathematics has come of age. There is now a bad mathematics movie to take it 's place among all the bad science movies. I was unable to suspend my disbelief so that I could sit back and  enjoy the movie. I was put off by the silly mathematics, the cheesy props, (Max's ""computer"" is a collection of 1970s era ICs placed randomly in a 19"" relay rack), the total lack of production values, (""Pi"" makes the majority of this year's independent productions look like ""Titanic""), and the silly plot.<br/><br/>Ostensibly this is a movie about obsession. The protagonist is seeking to find a pattern in the digits of pi which will explain the secrets of the universe. This search has already caused his mentor to have a stroke because he was getting close to the answer and Max is departing farther and farther from the real world. Max's computer is able to predict stock market prices. He is pursued by a collection of bad guys including a brokerage house, and a group of Hasidic Jews who think the messianic age will begin when they pronounce the 216 letter, true name of God. Come on! Before this guy does another movie about oncoming insanity, he should sit through Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"" at least three times in a row.<br/><br/>Max's growing insanity is shown by increasingly bad camera angles as the film progresses. The lighting throughout looks as if it was done by Jim Varney playing Earnest. The print that I  saw looked as if someone had generated it in their home darkroom. There is no excuse for this lack of technique. Spike Lee, Wayne Wang, and Hal Hartley have shown that you can make a first film for peanuts and it can still look good.<br/><br/>My advice is to go see something else."

Stuck through it to learn more.<br/><br/>Disappointed.<br/><br/>Even though after my third year of primary school I loathed maths with a passion (*adored* it up until then) I have learned of profound mathematical symbols, in the 'chaos' and the beautiful synchronicity of these symbols, occurring everywhere in the Universe.<br/><br/>Sadly this movie seemed to have more chaos. Sad as I usually dig oddball, independent movies. (That said, in substance it's a damn sight better than most of the so-called blockbusters these days like Gi Joe, etc...) but sadly, Pi leaves a lot to be desired and needs to be more grounded and solid.<br/><br/>I felt for the character in the movie, having mental challenges myself, sadly Pi and the religious propaganda, (At least it was Jewish for a change) was annoying,mostly boring, took ages to get into and just when it appeared it be going somewhere, it became boring and repetitive again, then a tidbit of interest when they mentioned sacred mathematical symbols in nature, then it goes screechy, arty-farty, then boring again and just when you're thinking, get to the F---ing point! The credits roll up and you're like ... Yes? ... And? Perhaps it was meant to leave one pondering. And so I am. Pondering why this highly recommended movie I've heard do much about and *finally* got a chance to see - pondering ... Why?...

"rbloom333","4","5","8","29 November 2008"," Overrated
","How this piece of art-house schlock ever came to be seriously respected is totally beyond me. Darren Aronofsky's big claim to fame (along with Requiem for a Dream), features Sean Gullette as an obsessed math genius determined to find a pattern in the inner-workings of the stock market, I guess so that he can get really rich. It's implausible that an individual as devoted to ""ideas"" as he claims to be would be so motivated to apply his talent to such a parasitic end, but hey, I guess audiences don't think brilliance is cool anymore unless you use it to hit the big time, which explains the obsession with the Las Vegas card counting geniuses from MIT. Aronofsky's style isn't quite as obnoxious as it would later be in Requiem for a Dream, but it's certainly obnoxious all the same, preferring to film his subject with grainy BW photography and lots of film-schoolish trick shots and fast cutting. Aronofsky ultimately fails to heighten the tension to the extent that he so clearly wishes, he strives for profundity, but Pi remains a simple (albeit moderately clever) thriller, nothing more. The scenes with Gullette and his mentor are well done and kept me interested despite the repetition."

","I do not want to comment on the film as a whole, but only on one aspect of it, namely on how it depicts the central topic of mathematics.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is that it deals with potentially very interesting stuff, but in a rather imbecile way. If you happen to have some elementary knowledge concerning mathematics, you will soon realize that the creators of this film probably do not. They simply have no idea of what mathematics is about and what a genius in mathematics might occupy himself with. The result is irritating.<br/><br/>The ""genius mind"" of Max Cohen looks like pictured by a 10-year-old child: he knows how to multiply and divide large numbers. That's about all. The ""mysterious"" ideas he is haunted by fall in two categories: some are merely common knowledge, or at least they are very old and all the people interested in the subject generally know them (e.g. the golden ratios, Galileo's ideas about the mathematics as a language of nature, etc.); the remaining ones are merely ridiculous: the search for the number that is the key to the universe, i.e. the old Pythagorean idea taken literally, rid of the context in which it can make sense.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film deals with no mystery. The questions it raises are stupid, and the answers it provides are trivial."

","Where can I begin to start hammering at the ungodly mess called Pi? Let me start with Mr. Aronofsky. While this is his directorial debut he has the gall to immediately dub it ""a Darren Aronofsky film"". Right away he has gotten on my nerves, but I was willing to put that aside if the movie fulfilled the hype. So much for hoping. What follows the opening credits is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Aronofsky pumps it so full of bullshit that its only message is the director's, a pathetic ""Look how artistic I am!"" He throws in the token surreal moments, flash shots and angles (I'm so damn tired of the pill popping sequence!), annoying face cameras, and the most convoluted and incomprehensible story ever to be allowed on screen.

","As a 5 minute music video Pi would be great.  As a 45 minute student film it would be a solid effort.But it needlessly allowed itself to grow into a full length feature film, without enough substance to justify even a mere 85 minutes.<br/><br/>Plot? Main character Max is obsessed with numbers and is trying to ""decode"" the world.  That is, he studies nature's patterns believing them to be a gateway to the meaning of life (and stockmarket trends). Max has very little interaction with other people.  He has multiple paranoid locks on his apartment door and spends most of his time crunching numbers on his computer.  Oh, and he is plagued with agonizing headaches.<br/><br/>Pi is shot in a high contrast black-and-white film, has quick editing and lots of techno music.  It all perfectly conveys Max's paranoid frantic thoughts.  But until the final scene, nothing ever evolves in the movie. The story is at a stand-still, consisting mainly of Max occasionally narrating his new theories, Max having a migraine, or Max walking briskly down the city sidewalks.  There is a subplot with corporate monsters and a religious sect each trying to exploit Max's talents, but these scenes felt like they were tacked on to fill out the running time.<br/><br/>For the record, I am not a fan of movies that contain lots of explosions-yes, I can think.  But after awhile Pi seemed very gimmicky, especially the hyperactive camerawork.<br/><br/>""But it's just so darn indie!"", people tell me.  Well, that's not what they really say. But I bet that's what they're thinking. Anyway, I give Pi a 5 out of 10. Worth seeing once for its unusual presentation,  just don't get your hopes up too high.<br/><br/>Oh yes, my favorite part of the movie is when Max's mentor criticizes Max for being obsessed with finding the number 216.  The older guy tells Max that if he wants to find the number, he will make himself see it everywhere (216 feet from here to the end of the street, 216 steps on a flight of stairs, etc.). ""you will have ceased to be a mathematician, and become a numerologist!"".  That made me chuckle.  And if any of your friends are astrologists or numerologists you might laugh, too."
"paulcreeden","6","3","4","18 March 2001"," Quirky?
","Jim Jarmusch famously resents having his films referred to as 'quirky' by critics. Yet, it seems to me that many independent films, including ""Pi"", have little else going for them. Perhaps the development of rich dramatic films by independent producers has spoiled me or corrupted me. Didn't David Lynch do all this stuff in ""Eraserhead"" in 1977? Black and white, crooked cameras, troubled close ups, vague and humorless dialogue. Come on. I can understand how the new generation of math obsessed computerites can relate to the hero's psychosis over formulas, but I thought it was boring and very 'done'."

","While visually stimulating and never boring, PI is essentially an empty stylistic exercise.  The filmmakers were very wise to keep it to 85 minutes; if the film were longer, it would quickly become unbearable.  Besides, David Lynch has already made this movie.  ERASERHEAD is also an empty stylistic exercise, but it works better than this film does.  PI was not a bad film, but I was disappointed.  The number pi doesn't really even figure in the end - I got a bad feeling it was just a 'cool' symbol the makers thought would market their film well, like the bat symbol.  It worked on me."

","A cross between Travis Bickle, Henry Spencer (you cannot be truly hip if you don't know either), and your typical high school geek, wanders around NYC trying to find mathematical order in the universe. Along the way, he is being destroyed by his own inexplicable fits and various factions (high class businessmen, Orthodox Jews), who desire to possess the code. Upon close observation, ""Pi"" is not as revolutionary or original as it may seem. If anything, it recalls David Lynch's astonishing 1978 debut, also black and white. The similarities are many, there's even a ""girl next door"", albeit more attractive than Lynch's. But Aaronofsky is unclear on which venue to pursue, and his film walks the thin line between Avant-Garde and a contrived Thriller. That is precisely why it can't be totally cohesive or enjoyable. By the second half, the Avant-Garde visions become repetitive, and the Thriller twists all too predictable and even ludicrous. On the other hand, an intense, eeiry and captivating electronica score that captures the whole atmosphere of the movie, is of great help, and the whole premise of a genius making sense of the universe's mechanism is unique and admirable, especially in the light of today's mindless junk cinema. Flawed as it is, Pi is the only film in the past few years which makes the audience contemplate a philosophical point of view they might not be comfortable with. For that it should be praised. Those looking for a true masterpiece of surrealism should rent ""Erraserhead"" instead."
"Leofwine_draca","5","4","6","9 October 2016"," Intriguing indie, somewhat overrated
","A tiring, slightly pretentious indie flick which makes up for its lack of budget with plenty of imagination on the part of writer/director Darren Aronofsky, who mingles such diverse topics as Jewish religion, complex mathematics, Greek mathematicians, mental illness, and Wall Street into a quirky and unpredictable whole. Although the film shares some of the same style and hyper-kinetic energy as something like TETSUO, generally it's a watchable enough movie with strong acting from lead Sean Gullette to make it worth sitting through. The heavy subject of complex number theory and advanced mathematics is an off-putting one, but don't be because the maths stuff is explained for those who aren't good with figures and generally skipped over anyway, shown without being too complex.<br/><br/>PI takes in various elements from different genres. The idea that numbers can explain the universe is nothing but straight science fiction (or is it?) whilst there are many surrealist touches like the train station interlude where Gullette chases along a trail of blood only to discover a huge brain - his own - at the end of the line. The various moments in which he experiences horrendous migraines are pretty disturbing to watch, with the soundtrack full of ear-splitting screeches and upsetting visuals on screen (Gullette brains himself, and smashes his head into a wall repeatedly). The intense music used throughout the film adds to the experience and the visual look is made distinctive by some grainy black and white photography.<br/><br/>On the downside, the ending is abrupt and something of a foregone conclusion. I was left thinking ""was that it?"". PI is a film that is deliberately complex and attempts to lose the viewer at every turn, and I don't think any person would be capable of understanding what everything means throughout. Sure, it's different, about 180 degrees from standard predictable Hollywood fare, but does this necessarily make it a good movie? I think not. It's original and the guys who made it were obviously talented, but this is not the masterpiece some people seem to think it is (all I heard about this were rave reviews for four years until I actually saw it)."

But if you aren't comfortable with math, what little is presented could intimidate you. So from a mathematics standpoint, this movie appeals to no one.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, especially with the camera mounted where it is in some shots. Sean Gullete, as Max Cohen, can really concentrate and stay in character.

I was expecting an average rating of around 3.<br/><br/>I suppose it's because it's different. Well, it's certainly that. But not every film that's made in black in white, has disturbing images, and goes through demented sequences that make no freaking sense is ""brilliant"" - although a lot of people obviously disagree with me.<br/><br/>Maybe my first clue should've been the opening credits, which rolled a sequence supposedly of the number pi. As someone well acquainted with mathematics, the very first thing I noticed was that the number they put on the screen was an accurate representation out to the first 8 digits. After that it was just a stream of completely random numbers.<br/><br/>""Well,"" I said to myself, ""They had to know very, very few people would ever notice."" Still, it was a bit irritating. It can't be that hard to come up with a few more than 8 digits of the value of pi, especially when you're spending the money to make an entire movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, things only went downhill from there. <br/><br/>And incidentally, the movie turned out not to have not ANYTHING to do with pi at all!

Blurry scenery.<br/><br/>The movie was so **** boring that after watching it for as long as I could possibly stand (the first hour), hoping, hoping, HOPING that it would get better, I finally started skipping ahead, pausing for the parts that looked like they might actually contain some content.

I even quite liked his style for this movie, even though some of the moments were still a bit too weird for my taste.

","The mathematician Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette) is tormented by a severe migraine since he was a kid, and he uses many pills to reduce his painful headaches. He is a lonely man, and his only friend is his former professor Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis). Max has the following assumptions, which rules his life: (1) Mathematics is the language of nature; (2) Everything around us can be represented and understood from numbers; (3) If you graph the numbers in any systems, patterns emerge. Therefore there are patterns everywhere in nature. Based on these principles, Max is trying to figure out a system to predict the behavior of the stock market. Due to his research, Max is chased by a Wall Street company with obvious interest in the results of his studies, and by an orthodox Jew follower of the Torah, who believes that this long string of numbers is a code sent from God.<br/><br/>""Pi"" is an intriguing and hypnotic cult movie, with an original story, great music score, fantastic black and white cinematography and bizarre atmosphere that in some moments recalls ""Brazil"".

Looking for some sort of pattern that will ""explain nature,"" the hermit stumbles across the answer when his computer spits out a string of numbers.

We'rre told that in its last split second his computer (a DOS machine with 5-1/4 inch floppies, guffaw) achieves consciousness and sends out its own message. <br/><br/>But that's only the beginning of the nonsense. A group of Orthodox Jews are after his numbers, because they are a code for ""the true name of God,"" which Jews have been searching for for thousands of years. If the true name of God is intoned by the right person in the right place, it will move the world one step closer to--I forgot their word-- Valhalla, Paradise, whatever. There are also some thugs from Wall Street who want the number because it will enable them to predict the stock market. But now the numbers only exist in the mind of the hermit. What to do? He takes a power drill and drills a hole in his skull. End of plot. In the final scene, he is no longer a math genius, just a guy sitting on a park bench.

The acting was nothing short of mediocre and whatever chemistry there was supposed to be between Max and Devi was lost somewhere in the unbelievability that she would give such an antisocial neurotic as max.<br/><br/>Like i said, someone got the idea that Darren Aronofsky is the master of the mind-f*** and thus, everyone likes to say that PI is much more clever than it actually is.

","If you have not seen ""Pi"", please beware that some things mentioned in this commentary are spoilers.<br/><br/>Some people say that ""Pi"" is too out there and too unrealistic and that it is religiously inaccurate. So. Maybe ""Pi"" can be a little unrealistic at times. I don't see how a movie made about a fictional story can't be a little unrealistic at some points. That is not a fault, it is artistic expression.<br/><br/>I liked this movie, a lot. I have a respect and admiration for the work that went into making a movie that was directoraly innovative. It has wonderful acting, and the soundtrack completes the images perfectly. Although i have to recommend that it be viewed in the light of day and not at night with many lights turned off. You may experience some headaches due to the black and white filming that is in extreme and bright contrast.<br/><br/>Some people say that Max was crazy, that he was overwhelmed by his headaches, halusinations, and perscription drugs. I can understand that. Max is looking for the ultimate order in chaos. A way to understand the stock market, something that is supposed to be completely random. Something that no one should reasonably have the answers to.<br/><br/>I feel that Max is not crazy. Let's say that the 216 digit number is the name of God. Would Max knowing it not give him the ability to address God by name. Allowing him to speak to Him. You could interpret Max's delusions as a form of religous visions (like Joan of Arc, but freakier).<br/><br/>Now, about computers reaching a level of conciousness through the realization of the number, and then dieing. Would it not be reasonable that if you happened to be a computer, and you became concious of yourself, that you too would not want to stay being a computer. Maybe the computer chooses death. Or, maybe in it's death, it realizes conciousness. This may not be realistic, but it the world of movies it can happen.<br/><br/>The experiences of Max could be viewed as a complex religious experience, or the delusional and dangerous life of an obsessed mathmitician. My suggestion is that you let ""Pi"" do what any other movie does, let it tell you a story.<br/><br/>Every movie must be watched with the possability of what if?

He wants to be left alone by everyone, and its hard to watch a film about a non-likable guy that wants everyone, including the audience, not to watch him. I kept wanting to honor his request.   Naturally, the world won't leave him alone and proceeds to bribe and threaten him into giving the secret info. he hasn't even discovered yet.  How they know he is researching this since he speaks to no one is never explained.<br/><br/>As he gets closer to the truth, his headaches worsen, as do the repetitive scenes of him popping pills and injecting himself with a hypo gun.  There are many David Lynch-like unexplained visuals that are either too obvious or don't work, like him finding a living brain on the subway tracks and deciding to poke it with a pen for the hell of it.<br/><br/>The ending is appropriately nonsensical.

","I heard much about this film, and having been so impressed with Darren Aronofsky's other work especially The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream I was all for seeing it. And I found it was very good, certainly an impressive debut for Aronofsky. It is probably my least favourite of what I've seen so far of his, however that doesn't mean it is bad at all, far from it.<br/><br/>Aronofsky's films are not for all, I think of his films I think his most accessible is The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream is very hard-hitting with its theme, Black Swan's psychology is intense and very hard to take, The Fountain is very philosophical and perplexing and some may find Pi's film techniques too much at first. But actually, I don't consider these a bad thing, if anything that's why his films are so fascinating to me.<br/><br/>And I have to say I loved Pi's gritty film technique and thought it added much to the concept and tone of the film. The soundtrack is excellent, it broods with intensity and is very cleverly used. The script is both intelligent and bizarre, and the story in general is compelling and benefits from such an interesting concept, I have to say of Aronofsky's films I'd say Pi had the most intriguing idea.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky once again does a fine job directing, while the acting led by a charismatic Sean Gulette is very good. The pace generally is good, but loses its way a tad in the final third or so, and I also think it was about 5 or 6 minutes too short. But these don't harm the film too much considering how much promise it had and how much it delivered this.<br/><br/>Overall, very impressive. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

It's also utterly brilliant in the way director/writer Darren Aronofsky manages to make the most out of a low-budget by way of creepy black and white photography (which makes for very paranoid viewing) and surprisingly convincing acting. Also I found the fact that this ""drama"" is scarier than most horror films released nowadays quite refreshing.<br/><br/>I wish more movies were like ""Pi.""

Below may include some spoilers, but it's impossible to comment without reference to the events. ###<br/><br/>The film has a somewhat spooky/weird atmosphere which gets more intense as the leading character seems to be getting closer to discovering a secret number (similar to in the movie ""Warlock"") it's supposed to be the key to the universe. The black & white affects the viewer as if they were watching an old movie. The same film would not have had the effect it did in color. They get away with a lot from just having it that way.<br/><br/>The director establishes the character's paranoia very well, with weird occurrences and camera work, however, some of the scenes, like when he is being chased, had the camera wobble so much that one could hardly see what was going on. - Funny & different, in most movies one sees car chases in this one both chases are people running. (Cheaper?)<br/><br/>I love their inclusion of different races and religions in this film, without it being overly obvious, and each character has a plausible reason for being there. The little Chinese girl with the calculator, her mother, the Indian girl next door, the Islamic music in the supermarket, the Jews in full dress at the Synagog, a black lady in charge of the bad guys! Such ethnic diversity is something you don't see in many movies. I wonder if they set out with this in mind? Refreshing, anyway.<br/><br/>The somewhat grainy image often seems to emphasize the weirdness of the action. True there are some scenes that could have been cut, making the film slightly less irritating, like when the character is made to prolong the action by walking in circles while deciding whether or not to press a button on the computer. He was walking in circles WAY too long. They could have have done it with a couple of dissolves to indicate time passes, instead of showing the whole thing!<br/><br/>Also there are a few logic errors like, why didn't the bad guys just break into his home at any point, rather than go out looking for him, It also seems that there are no hospitals or cops in this movie's world. The guy clearly belongs in care!<br/><br/>It started well, interesting number theories and connections with nature and the universe, but, like the hero's health, both movie and hero start to suffer at the same time, and towards the end it's all a bit of a nightmare... but all in all, I'm glad I watched it. 3 out of 5, for me.

Max is convinced that everything in nature is governed by math and, therefore, predictable. He takes this theory and does considerable research into the stock market, trying to see if he can predict it. On some level, he succeeds and attracts some people who wish to exploit this knowledge for personal gain (one is a businesswoman of some sort looking to use this information for money, the other is a group of Jews trying to find answers about God). To add to his troubles, Max suffers from recurring, very intense headaches.<br/><br/>I wish I could say I know all this from my actual viewing, but I can't. The fact is, this movie is so confusing it's very hard to tell what's going on at any given point. This doesn't sink the film for me, though. I've sat through and enjoyed many films that were very confusing. What sinks this film for me is the visual style. The movie is shot in black and white due to the lack of funding and whatnot. This gives the film a very gritty look. On top of that is the soundtrack, which is very unpleasant (especially during his headache sequences because of a loud, high pitched screech that plays). All of this coupled with the disturbing and paranoid nature of the script makes for a very uncomfortable experience. For some, this may work, but not for me. These two factors (confusing script and irritating audio/visual style) led me to hate this film roughly 20 minutes into it. One another thing to mention is that many of the low light situations look horrible and add to the confusion.<br/><br/>I relate watching this movie to having someone read me a story while someone else continually slaps me in the face. I wouldn't be able to focus on the story (the plot of Pi) because I was being continuously slapped in the face (the film's presentation). I get that this film is not for everyone and it's clearly not for me. Many out there enjoy this film and that's great. I did not. I might recommend this around Halloween because of the disturbing nature of the film, but other than that, I don't foresee me viewing this movie again."

","One reviewer said it might take you where you don't want to go --- so why go there? This kind of chaotic descent is unpleasant without being interesting.<br/><br/>The premise (flight of Icarus, exaggerated over-reaching, tower of Babel) is sophomoric and unsubtle. One of many goofs: at the beginning, where Max lists the drugs he's doing, he says ""HCI"" instead of HCL. This term is written in chemical nomenclature with the L in lower case, but Aronofsky, not knowing anything about chemistry, thinks it's an ""I"". Since all the chemical names Max mentions are complicated and technical and are presented as authoritative (words from a genius??????????????) the error stands way out. <br/><br/>It's amazing to me that over 27000 IMDb folks have reviewed this film with a 7.5 average rating. Really amazing. We've gone way off the tracks here.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time, unless you groove on (many) scenes of a man writhing, holding his head in agony, and injecting himself in various places.

Mr. Aronofsky shows he is an original, as he clearly demonstrates with his take on the film.<br/><br/>""Pi"" has been already the object of many fantastic comments submitted to this forum, so we'll just skip that part and go into the technical points of the film. Mr. Aronofsky has shot ""Pi"" in black and white that is grainy as he seems to emphasize in what's going on in the mind of Max Cohen. It works well because using colors would have distracted our attention, perhaps, and it wouldn't have left the lasting effect he achieves with the use of the black and white cinematography.<br/><br/>Sean Gullette, as Max Cohen makes an immense contribution to the film, which clearly, having been co-written by him, shows he had a complete understanding of what the director intended him to do.

","One of Aronofsky's earlier films 'Pi' is a complex treat to watch. The director makes the film using simple devices. The black and white colour and hazy image shot with digital camera successfully create a very tense, detached and cold atmosphere. 'Pi' is clever, complex, engaging and absorbing. Cohen's world of paranoia and obsession is that of a web of odd characters, Wall Street, computer science, the Torah, Kabalah and of course, numbers. The slick editing maintains a fluid energy on screen and the unforgettable soundtrack fits the soundtrack terrifically. 'Pi' can be seen as one of the prototypes of the superb blend of soundtrack and movie. The acting too is very convincing. Sean Gullette does a very good job of leading the movie. Yet, the real winners here are Aronofsky and Clint Mansell (who came up with the score). Once again the director has created a unique film experience of paranoia for the viewers."

I found it fascinating at the start (paranoia mixed with genius, math mixed with religion, great black and white cinematography, etc.), but after a while, it just got repetitive, pointless and damned boring!  I kept waiting for some new insight, some resolution, some reason for this film to be made.  I waited in vain."

","Pi, I understand, has now been factored to over a billion places. My question: are the figures random? Anybody out there know? This film does not answer that question (nor does it address it). What it asks is, are numbers the language of life? Max Cohen, mathematical genius, believes they are. There is a pattern, and he would like to find it, partly because it's there and partly for use in the stock market. So would some other people. He is thus tormented both within and without.<br/><br/>One of the things that made this a successful commercial film (for an indie venture, of course) is the fine acting by Sean Gullette who plays Max Cohen.<br/><br/>He was entirely convincing as a reclusive and paranoid mathematical genius; but he is also a man like Einstein who emanates charisma and something perhaps beyond charm. Also effective was the story by Director Darren Aronofsky, which, unlike some indie films, actually had a plot with clear conflicts. The choice of Pamela Hart, a strong black woman as a kind of hit woman from Wall Street was excellent. Also very good was Mark Margolis as Cohen's mentor, Sol Robeson. Aimed at a popular audience were, alas, some chase scenes; but they were not badly done, and even seemed appropriate, although I think there should be a moratorium placed on subway chase scenes in movies, at least for the next decade or so. Also aimed at a popular audience was some of the violent images, in particular the scene where Cohen places the power drill to his temple, like the barrel of an executioner's handgun, turns it on and presses. Kids love that shtick. (I could hardly watch.)<br/><br/>Much of the detail was completely veracious, the spiral as an example of complexity in nature, or the wonderful re-enactment of the programmer's moment of truth just before he hits the return key and finds out if his creation will run, crash or go into infinite loop; or a group of fundamental religious people (in this case Hasidic Jews) believing that some sort of numerology will miraculously reveal some major truth of their religion; or even the fact that Max Cohen still used five and one-quarter inch floppies for his data. Also wondrously right was the spider/moth sticky cocoon that gummed up his computer, or the little girl who multiplies on her calculator and then asks Max for the answer, delighted when he gets it right. That a stock market bonanza served as the El Dorado of number crunchers was also right on target. And an especially good fit was the techno rock in the background.<br/><br/>But some of this was definitely wrong. The idea that Sol Robeson would think Max's computer had become or was becoming ""conscious"" was too much of a leap. Or the notion that the human brain, or any brain for that matter, could predict stock prices as they come out of the ticker is absurd. Complexity theory would argue strongly that such specific data, like the number of rain drops in a storm tomorrow, is in principle impossible to predict. I also didn't like the resolution which allows us to treat whichever of the foregone scenes we like as dream-fantasies. I don't like plots that are resolved by ""it was a dream"" mechanisms, even, or especially, retrospective ones.<br/><br/>But movies are about images and the image of Cohen's head and his brain and of what hard, metallic things can do to it, is something that lingers long after the lights have come up. Indeed what makes this an engrossing movie is its psychological and visual content. The stark, grainy black and white cinematography actually enhance our appreciation. Indeed, light and dark and other dichotomies are part of the expression of Aronofsky's vision. He juxtaposes contrasting elements of our culture, of the mind and of nature to tease us into seeing that the world is vastly more mysterious than we can imagine. There is order and there is chaos. There is number and there is the organism that is an expression of number. There is rationality and there is insanity. There is the soft, fragile brain and the hard electrodes. There is the game of go, more complex than chess, the wooden board with the simple lines and the black and white pebbles that spring open the door to chaos (the mathematical kind). And there is life, fragile, uncertain, teetering on the edge, and in the fuzzy distance there is the shimmering certainly of a fundamental religion. Aronsky catches all of this and ends up with an electronic poem camouflaged as a movie.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

","It's fitting that this should be Darren's debut work, seeing as how this is the first of his filmography that I'm personally seeing. The film itself is alright, but there are things that hold it back.<br/><br/>The pros specifically lie in the film's style and direction. The grainy black and white aesthetic compliment the oppressive and obsessive tone of the film. And the same goes for Darren's directing. While I personally wouldn't call it anything 'groundbreaking', the composition of the shots themselves are great and again play along with the film's tone and theme of obsession and paranoia.<br/><br/>The film's cons however lie in its writing and structure. The film's structure is scatterbrained to say the least. While the story isn't difficult to follow, the way the story is presented and concepts that are dotted throughout make the film a bit harder to process. And the surrealist elements while not exactly intrusive don't really help alleviate this confusion. The writing as well isn't really much to write home about, and in some instances can be written off as pretentious.<br/><br/>As I said before ""Pi"" was my introduction to Darren Aronofsky's works and from what I've seen, I can't really say that I'm too impressed. Granted I have yet to see ""Requiem"" or the highly controversial ""mother!"", so hopefully my mind will change then. The central idea of this film is certainly fascinating despite its loose math, and based on the direction and style alone is certainly worth a watch or two."

"theocharous_an","7","1","1","20 January 2017"," A great debut feature
","Pi was the debut feature of the now acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky. It revolves around the obsession of a charismatic, but troubled man named Max Cohen (Sean Gullette), who is determined to find a pattern that will decipher the stock market. His former professor (Mark Margolis), who had been chasing a similar obsession for years, tries to convince him against it. Max is obsessed beyond return though and soon he finds himself going after a 216-digit number that could explain universe and help him discover God.<br/><br/>The film has some very interesting themes. It deals with the same idea that Black Swan did (the only other Arronofsky's film I watched), that while the relentless pursuing of an obsession can lead to success, it can also lead to self-destruction. Then there is the search of God as we have seen in many other movies before, most notably in Ingmar Bergman's filmography. Max is so infatuated with the idea of the secret key number, that before he knows it he loses control. He becomes a slave of his obsession as so many other people in our days.<br/><br/>Arronofsky did a great job in Pi. I don't know for certain, but it seems like a low budget film with its relatively unknown cast and its black and white filming. The surrealistic, thought-provoking way the plot is unveiled though, is more than enough to redeem the viewer. The acting is not what we would call top-notch, but they're all doing a respectable job. Mark Margolis in particular gives a very good performance.<br/><br/>I'll end this review with the optimistic message that I believe the ending scene attempts to deliver: there is beauty in simplicity. We don't need to understand everything, it won't make us happier. It would only serve to bury us even deeper in the universe's chaotic nature.

I think it's pretty sad that there are people who are so obsessive about scientific accuracy that it prevents them from enjoying a brilliant movie not really about math but about PARANOIA. In fact, this would have been a much lesser movie if the math had made any sense; it would have made Max's quest justifiable and could easily have turned this into a sappy Hollywood film (better living through mathematics/paranoid self-obsession: max figures it all out and makes millions, retires and marries the woman next door, haha, wouldn't that be fun?). Instead, it becomes an impressionistic descent into a half-hallucinated hell, and wow, when you realize what's going on, it is gripping. The grainy black and white provides the perfect palette for the film's remarkable, sometimes very frightening images, and the brilliant techno score by Clint Mansell (formerly of Pop Will Eat Itself) backs up what is certainly one of the most compelling films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>

","Aronofsky can be called a great many things, but ""traditional and usual director"" is not one of them. He does an excellent job on this, and it doesn't feel like he made any compromises on this, leading to a film that is not for everyone. That is, undeniably, the way to move towards the medium being art, a form of expression, as opposed to business. This movie can be described as bizarre, but it's never so vague that you can't follow it, and it does have a plot, which develops nicely throughout. I would say that some will find themselves completely disappearing into Cohen's world for about 80 minutes. The cinematography is incredible, and the Snorricam is marvelous. Editing is sharp and spot-on. The music is modern, techno-like, and rather interesting. All of the writing is masterful. The concept is immensely engaging, and this provides food for thought and questions. Every single acting performance is beyond reproach. The DVD features deleted scenes, with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them. He and star/script co-author Sean Gullette also have a commentary track each, and they even both speak over the 9 or so minute-long ""behind the scenes montage"". There's a music video, as well, two trailers and a preview for a graphic novel, and finally, the disc holds notes on the actual enigma. All of them are worth the time. There were no subtitles, however. The language is strong, if not overly frequent. There is disturbing content, the potency of it arguably depending on personal tastes. I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved and/or the genre of psychological thriller. 8/10"

Perhaps my background in mathematics and computers kept me from consuming the premise: I saw through it's hokeyness. The movie was also addled by the overt weirdness stereotypical of indie films. I have nothing against weird avant-garde movies or indie films (I love many of them) but sometimes indie films use weirdness for weirdness' sake or to simply add time to a movie whose story is running short.<br/><br/>I held out my judgment on Pi until the very end. The ending left me feeling empty and confirmed my fears that the movie had built itself up too much to be able to deliver the goods.

Had I not been told to watch it, I would have long dumped out of this movie. The main character Max is a perpetually disturbed drug popping mess of a person that repeats his meaningless voiceover pointlessly. He started out a mess, he ended a mess. I missed the character progression in every way. I didn't know what his motivation for his actions were, and the ending didn't help either. There was so much useless space in this movie that I wasn't sure if the filmmaker was desperately trying to be deep, or just plain weird on purpose. Squashing ants, poking brains with pens on stairways, and more bloody noses than Gerry Cooney ever had.<br/><br/>I think this film was just plain too overambitious. First of all, I would have liked an ending. To me, that ending was like spiking the ball while I'm down. Secondly, there was just too much that wasn't explained. Here I believe the writer went overboard on that screenwriting rule of ""get in your scene late and get out early."" As a moviegoer, I like to fill in small gaps and guess a characters motivation, but these gaps were too big. When that movie was over, I felt I didn't know one character intimately. Not one. I have so many questions about this hum drum movie that I could pick the filmmakers brain for hours having him explain what he was shooting for, because it certainly wasn't apparent in the film. But that would mean I am interested in revisiting it, and I really don't wish to do that. I always question myself when I'm opposed to so many others this much, but I honestly could not defend that movie in any aspect if I were to say I liked it...or even thought it made sense for that matter.

Maybe it was deliberate and there's a hidden meaning or it could be when Pi was displayed on a calculator it was only shown to a certain number of digits so the rest was made up. And then there's the line the mathematics ""genius"", Max, comes out with during some rambling monologue to a Rabbi, i.e. ""It's just a number. I'm sure you've written down every two hundred sixteen digit number. You've translated all of them. You've intoned them all. Haven't you? But what's it gotten you? The number is nothing!"" Well it seems that there's 9.9*(10^215) permutations of 216 digits and I leave you to work out how long it'd take to write them out but it's longer than Aronofsky thought.<br/><br/>So it wasn't a film about the wonders of mathematics or why Pi is such a mind-blowing number when all it's just the length of the circumference of a circle divided by it's radius. However at some positions within the number Pi will be every possible sequence of 216 digits. Is it just about a man going mad, as some mathematics geniuses did, but without the distraction of mathematics? Whatever it is it's a film that many like but for the life of me I can't see why."

If number crunching is your thing, by all means check it out, otherwise you'll probably get more enjoyment watching paint dry.  The high contrast B&W cinematography is annoying as hell and serves no apparent purpose other than to make you squint, and the lead actor simply grates on the nerves with his introverted ""tortured genius"" act.  Throw in a bunch of mathematical equations, stock market tickers and pocket calculators and it all adds up to one big ZERO."

","""Pi"" is not an easy movie to explain. It focuses on migraine-stricken mathematician Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) trying to find numeric patterns, and all the while Kabbalists want to use his genius to find patterns in the Torah, while corporate mafia types also want his genius. I think that that's what the story was.<br/><br/>Filmed in black-and-white, the movie does everything possible to be disturbing, succeeding every step of the way.

"velvets203","9","2","4","22 January 2005"," Excellent philosophical work
","Pi is a remarkable movie, and should be on the top 250 in place of Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. Instead of being based on a Hubert Selby novel (Requiem) this story is incredibly unique and philosophically enchanting. Aronofsky uses black and white with grainy film to prove you don't need millions to make a worthy cinematic treat. His trademark use of excessive (or at least numerous) cuts is prevalent throughout the movie. However, it is the storytelling that makes me love this movie. The plot may be filled with mathematical loopholes and unsound theories (I imagine it would take at least a master's degree to know that, but apparently that just isn't enough for educational elitists these days), the excellent use of metaphors made me really enjoy the underlying meaning of the movie. Examples include the bugs in his apartment, as well as his delusions of seeing and manipulating his own brain. The whole movie is perfectly set up, with drum and bass music flowing during times of high thought and progress, and droning, mechanical music playing during times of mental anguish. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it is a wonderful convergence of storytelling, philosophical meaning, metaphoric plot devices, proper use of sets, camera editing, and music. I wish more movies came together so perfectly in what they were attempting to convey to the audience. Anyone interested in non-standard movie fare, mathematical philosophy, independent film, or tormented genius films, should check this one out. Only a slow starting third act lowers my rating from 10 to 9."

","I consider this film infinitely worse than ""Eraserhead"" or ""Brazil"" and slightly better than ""The Blair Witch Project"". Pretentious, shallow, pointless, its pseudoscience was laughable and the shock scenes mostly too. I do love conspiracy theories and the mystique of numbers, but instead of watching this film, I would rather read the book ""The Bible Code"" or selected stories of Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino and Arthur C. Clarke (""The Nine Billion Names of God""). I would also like to point out (is it just a coincidence?) the case of a blind boy in a recent Iranian film ""Color of Paradise"". Trained in Braille's writing system for the blind, in which letters are represented by a pattern of bumps, the boy ""read"" wheat in the field and grains of sand on the beach. Of course, ""Color of Paradise"" belongs to a completely different genre category, but one cannot escape the conclusion that it conveys the mystique underlying the real world in a beautiful, poetic and empathic manner, ultimately much more effectively than the ""Pi""."

Acting is not an issue here, as far as the movie is concerned it's not a movie, for all intents and purposes it's a perfect portrayal of what its like to struggle with a puzzle, with the distractions, trying to scrounge as much co-ordination of your mind as you can in hopes that at the peak of your struggle you will be high enough to have reached the goal.

"PyroSikTh","7","0","0","25 April 2020"," A Flawed Look at the Madness of Obsession
","I'm a big Darren Aronofsky fan. I have been ever since I saw The Fountain fourteen years ago, and it completely revolutionised what I thought movies were capable of. I often credit it with making me the movie buff I am today. Since then I have watched every single Aronofsky movie, and largely loved all of them. Except Pi, his feature-length debut (and his early shorts). This was mainly because I just couldn't find it anywhere, and when I could it was priced so far out of what was reasonable. I became resigned to the fact it was probably going to be a movie I'll never see. Thank you Amazon for having it available on Prime video.<br/><br/>Pi follows Max, a man obsessed with predicting the stock market. He's convinced there's mathematical patterns in everything. During one particular prediction session, his homemade supercomputer crashes after spitting out a 216-digit number. He thinks nothing of it, throws the print-out away, and gets to fixing his computer ready for next time. But it's not long before other people start mentioning a mysterious 216-digit number that could solve the mystery to everything. His mentor mentions the same thing occurred with his computer, and theorised that it found a brief moment of self-awareness before sputtering out. A guy in a coffee shop shows Max a secret code in the Torah, and posits that the key to God is a 216-digit in the religious texts. All the while there's a mysterious Wall Street woman who keeps hounding him to crack it and give them what they need to make a lot of money off the stock market.<br/><br/>But there's a catch. Max is not mentally well. He suffers cluster headaches and requires medication to keep them under control. As the movie progresses his mental state deteriorates and he starts hallucinating. It starts to question his reliability as a narrator. Is he a mathematical genius, or just a paranoid schizophrenic with delusion of grandeur? Is the Wall Street woman real or just an aggressive delusion of being followed? Is there really a 216-digit code in the Torah, or is Max just finding patterns and coincidences where there aren't any? Pi evolves into a movie as much about mental illness as it does about unlocking the secrets to the universe by a mathematical pattern.<br/><br/>As an Aronofsky aficionado, possibly my favourite thing about watching this movie was seeing where his director tropes and trademarks all began. There's an element of Pi in all his movies, from the fascination with biblical topics (Noah, mother!), to a descent into madness and a depressing ending (Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan), to a search for something beyond human comprehension (The Fountain), to following a single character intimately as they break down (The Wrestler). It's all here. Even filming techniques like relentless close-ups, quick cuts, and a distraction to inanimate objects. Pi has it all. It feels as much like an Aronofsky movie as any other, almost like there was no filmmaking voice for him to find; it's all been there since the beginning.<br/><br/>But. But Pi probably ranks as my least favourite Aronofsky movie, for one very simple reason. It's an ugly movie to look at. I understand the reasoning behind it, for sure, but for me it got in the way of the viewing experience rather than enhanced it. Pi is filmed entirely in black and white, with the contrast dialed all the way up. There's barely any grey, there's either light or shadow. It works as an insight into Max's binary state of mind. The world to him is black and white. There's a pattern to it and it can be cracked. But from a moviemaking perspective, it blots out the details. It makes it hard to discern exactly what you're looking at, and causes the film's more frenetic moments to just turn into an indecipherable blur. It wouldn't have been so bad if there wasn't a thick layer of grain over the top of everything, muddying an already lacklustre visual quality. Again it's meant to bring us into Max's world, and be reminiscent of old science experiment footage, but ultimately it just made it harder to watch, in a literal sense. As a counterpoint, Beyond the Black Rainbow sought out the same visual techniques in it's psychedelic sections, but succeeded at it because it didn't get in the way of what was being shown. It remained grainy enough to feel old and creepy, but crisp enough that you could see what was happening, and its use of high-contrast black and white was used to create abstract shapes rather than muddy the details of something we're meant to recognise.<br/><br/>Another slight niggle with Pi was the acting quality. For what was ultimately an amateur film, I can't slate it too hard, but the acting performances often come off as first year acting school performances. Sean Gullette shows an apt awkwardness as Max, but often it comes out in the wrong way, delivering lines awkwardly as if he's forgotten them, or is unintentionally unsure what to do with his body. Pamela Hart as the Wall Street woman just feels incredibly off and unnatural, and Samia Shoaib as Max's neighbour looks like she was plucked out of acting school and was trying too hard to make an impression. Mark Margolis and Ben Shenkman are pretty good as the mentor and Jewish guy respectively, so it's no surprise to see them still working today, but Margolis was already an established actor going into this anyway.<br/><br/>I am glad I watched Pi, but only to see where it all started for Aronofsky. I enjoyed the story that was being told, and while it's a story that has been done a number of times, Pi found an interesting way to tie it all together and really delve into the insanity this kind of obsession can cause (or the insanity that causes this kind of obsession). The soundtrack is also great, fast-paced and rhythmic mirroring not only Max's frantic state, but also his search for patterns and repetition in everything. Using tracks from the likes of Orbital, Aphex Twin, Massive Attack, and composer Clint Mansell, it makes a surprisingly cohesive soundtrack to listen to on its own terms as well. The acting was awkward but I can forgive that considering the budget and it being a first time, self-financed indie project. But what ultimately let it down for me was the ugly visual aesthetic that often made it too hard to actually discern what was going on. It worked thematically, but just didn't work for me. I give Pi a 7/10; solid, but let down by some superfluous issues."

"grantss","6","0","0","4 May 2016"," Leaves you with more questions than answers
","Being a mathematical person (I have a Masters degree in Statistics) I was intrigued by the premise of the movie but in the end I was left with more questions than answers and was left hanging. The plot includes too much of the mathematical detail (and medical detail, listing all the drugs Cohen was taking!), often coming across as nerdy.<br/><br/>The solution seemed too straightforward and practical, with many details lacking here (unlike in the build-up). I thought the final mix might include emotions, basically a more relationship-centric argument, especially as the plot did allude to the potential for something to happen between Cohen and his neighbour, but this didn't come up at all.<br/><br/>This all said, Darren Aronofsky is clearly a very talented director. His use of the black&white medium and close-up camera shots in Pi were a stroke of genius - it certainly helped one get into Cohen's mind. Requiem for a Dream is an outstanding movie but Pi fails to deliver because he took on a very weighty and complex subject in his first attempt at a motion picture. The problem lies in the screenplay (which he co-wrote), and not his direction, however.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note Aronofsky's use of some of the effects that he would later use in Requiem for a Dream, especially the fast- forward pill-popping sequence which was always worth a chuckle in both movies (in a dark sort of way)."

","First, a disclaimer. I am not a movie critic. In fact, I tend to NOT read any reviews prior to seeing a movie. Never a believer that others should influence MY interpretation of a movie, and plus, many movie critics seem to possess some universal standard of ""good"" that I find, ummm, stupid - can't enjoy a simple movie, or just be entertained for 2 hours, because the actors seem ""hollow"" or the plot ""tedious"", yadda, yadda. Get a life, is my immediate reaction. Having said that, I do appreciate a movie (and its creators) that attempt to SAY SOMETHING about life and the human condition. Some will ""suspend disbelief"" in an action or drama film so they can enjoy the overall effects of the movie. Likewise, sometimes, such as movies like Pi, you must suspend your disbelief in order to hear the message of the movie. It's not the details (is there a 216 character code that can explain all life? don't know, don't care, and not the point)but the overall message of the movie, and whether it's told in an interesting and novel manner, that truly matters. Point of the movie (my interpretation): can ""truth"" and a perfect understanding of reality ever be fully understood by the limited capabilities of humans? The movie has an almost Buddhist interpretation that, no it's not possible. And any fanatical belief that it can will only lead to frustration and insanity. Yes, knowledge can be exploited for economical and religious purposes (as implied by the movie)but in answering the ultimate questions of life, and, more importantly, how one lives their life, objective science and knowledge are inadequate to live (again leaning Buddhist interpretations) a ""good"" life. At the beginning of the movie, one looks at the tree top, the branches and leaves, and as Maximillan explains his numbers theory, one can not resist looking at that image and attempt to think of the mathematical equations those branches and leaves can be expressed as. Max finally understands the inherent limitations to this interpretation (haunted by the ""life"" visions - a singing subway rider, the faint moaning of a woman during sex as he begins to break the ""code"" of life. He eventually lobotomizes himself and, in the end, looks at those same branches and leaves and finds peace in the acceptance and beauty of life as is, regardless of intellectual capacity and understanding. A very interesting and well-told message. I am not sure I completely agree with it, but I love a movie that makes an attempt to challenge us intellectually. I guess for movie ""experts"" they can belabor the acting, lighting, plot movement and ""reality"" aspects ad nauseaum and find fault with any movie - forever caught among the trees and completely missing the forest."

The visual style was great!  It was rough and grainy, yet very beautifully shot. Some IMDB reviewers thought this film was plotless.  It might be, depending on which plot you are willing to choose.  That is the really strange thing about ""Pi"".  On one level, it's about the greatest mathematical discovery, which would allow people to predict anything, even the stock market.  On another level, it's about a mad genius who, thinking he has found an incredible discovery, goes insane.  ""Pi"" twists and turns from discovery, and then onto insanity.

","I had the distinct pleasure of being able to watch this film in the theatre with a bona fide mathematician. His faith in this chosen discipline was flagging however, and he believed that seeing this film would strengthen his resolve. It did at first, as the maths equations and diagrams flowed out accompanied by thumping music to captivating effect. I heard him cry out ""Maths is cool"", but I believe that by the end he was nonplussed as his newfound enthusiasm had been stifled.<br/><br/>Described by someone, whose name I know not, as being the best maths based Jewish horror film of the year. This puts it into a category of film in which there are no rivals (me thinks), which is absolutely fair. I have never come across a film anything like it before, and its originality it thoroughly refreshing. Certainly one to talk about, and works in the opposite way to Good Will Hunting (both films are about boffins), in that it dissuades the viewer from thinking that it would be good to be so intelligent. Shares similar attributes to Clerks in that it was about the same budget, filmed in black and white and had a great original soundtrack. Though not as good a screenplay as Clerks, the adventurous camera work, a larger cast and more challenging subject matter mean that his film is deserving of a great deal of praise.<br/><br/>You all know the story, so I shan't bore you with that, but it has to be said that Max, together with his ""personal notes"" makes an intriguing, though largely shallow character. Bearing in mind that the entire film centres around, and is about, him, we are left feeling that we haven't actually discovered so much about him by the end. This could be attributable to the fact that there can't really be that much to know about a maths obsessed loner obsessed with patterns. Perhaps, but it still would have been nice for there to have been something interesting to discover to sustain the film for the duration. It does indeed run out of steam too far from the end as his mind ebbs further away.<br/><br/>The other characters in the film, though interesting in their own way, are ultimately too shallow to sustain interest for long. For example Max's tutor-cum-father-figure tells him a few anecdotes about past maths discoveries. This is all very well, but the anecdotes that he tells aren't exactly unknown by us, the general public, so I see little chance that Max would bear to sit through another telling. There are also many questions left unresolved at the end of the film, and we never really discover what Max's ultimate fate was, but I suppose that these are all the same elements that kept interest levels high in this surprisingly fast-paced flick.<br/><br/>Basically, if you don't like venturing much from standard Hollywood issue then you certainly wont enjoy this film, but if you are prepared to try something new then you could well enjoy it. Also, fans of art-house films will almost certainly enjoy this, as it is an excellent example of creative low budget independent filming.<br/><br/>Incidentally, did anyone else out there that has seen the film manage to catch the Chemical Brothers' UK tour? There is a distinct similarity between the introduction to the film and a certain video that is projected at the concert (I think it was during Hey Boy, Hey Girl)."

For example, at one point, there is a discussion of turning a 216 digit number into a 216 letter word but clearly that would not be possible under the circumstances. I'm probably being picky but that was a little silly considering that Max is supposed to be a mathematical genius. Plus, there are some sub-plots that never really go anywhere. The girl next door seems to like Max and he seems to go into his blackouts when she is with other men but the romance is never fully explored.<br/><br/>These types of inconsistencies keep it from being a 10/10 film but they are actually pretty minor when compared to the rest of the film. The scenes where Max has tremors and goes into his blackouts are intense and show a man truly on the edge of sanity.

The protagonist, a neurotic, eccentric mathematician on a quest to find a mathematical pattern in the stock market, is handled with brilliant unpredictability. The brilliance and madness in his mind is communicated visually through sometimes disturbing metaphors (like the throbbing brain on the side-walk). The grainy black & white and the unusual camera angles evoke unusual emotions in the audience and are in keeping with allowing the viewer to see the world as the mathematician sees it: where everything, even  trees, people and God himself works through mathematical patterns. One of the few faults of the film, I found, was the introduction of the stock-market fanatics which was not well developed. Excluding this could have left room for a more detailed development of the religious cult sub-plot. The strengths of the film, however, lie not in plot build-up or dialogue but undoubtedly in its unique style and content (achieved on a very limited budget). This makes it definitely worth seeing.

","Being a genius can give you nasty headaches. That simple notion, at the heart of Darren Aronofsky's `Pi,' defies the complexity of this brilliant little indie thriller. Sean Gullette plays Max Cohen, a mathematics/electronics savant who believes that matter, the world around us - indeed, our very existence - has a pattern to it that can be expressed as a number. Max devotes his life to finding this mysterious 216-digit number. This has two results. First, Max acts weird. He's paranoid, reclusive, disturbed and vigorously anti-social. Second, he's pursued by people (presumably those who have more friends and fewer headaches) who might profit from the number: both Hasidic Jews, who think it's the code to the Torah and signals the coming of the messianic age, and Wall Street fat cats. Is `Pi' profound or just odd? It's some of both, I suppose, but make no mistake: The film is visually stunning, and has a lot to say about the burden of genius, the quest for knowledge - and maybe even about the existence of God.

This is inherently cool stuff, but has already been handled better by the likes of William S. Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson.  Ultimately, the mathematics angle falls flat...  I had to suppress an outright laugh at lines about machines becoming self-aware after being fed a certain equation, or the main character -- a mathematician -- accusing some rabbis searching for the True Name of God of ""already trying every 216-letter combination"" -- a feat which would require more time than our planet has been in existence.<br/><br/>The places where this film shines are in the editing, the soundtrack, and the overall look of the film.  The plot is ultimately shallow, a story that could probably have fit on a single page, but the film is techno-noir eye candy de luxe.  I am looking forward to see what the director does with the formidable writing talents of Frank Miller on his side in the forthcoming ""Batman: Year One"" movie.

If you are a fan of drum and bass, or any other type of electronica, this is a must own.  It's an incredible CD.

It fits like a glove. Excellent work.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to compliment the director for filming this movie in black and white.  This was the most effective way possible to convey the general mood of the film.  As a contrast to the standard, it gives a further feeling of alienation from the world, the exact kind that max is feeling.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, I DO NOT suggest that everyone see this movie.

","I watched ""Pi"" for the first time in a number of years yesterday, and I was struck with a reference that I had never noticed before.<br/><br/>In Max's first meeting with Sol over the Go board, Sol asks Max whether he had gotten around to reading ""Hamlet"" (which Saul had previously recommended, presumably). It can't just be coincidence that ""Hamlet"", like ""Pi"", is ALSO about a ""haunted"" young intellectual who THINKS TOO MUCH.<br/><br/>Both Shakespeare's play and Aronovsky's film deal with the frustrations of trying to understand the fundamentally-irrational through the use of reason. In Hamlet's case, it means trying to reconcile a supernatural call for vengeance with Rationalist philosophy. In Max's case, it means trying to reduce all of Nature - even the True Name of God! - to a mathematical principle. Both Hamlet and Max are driven to (beyond?) the edge of sanity by their labors.<br/><br/>So Sol's recommendation that Max read ""Hamlet"" is not merely to give him something to take his mind off his work, but is in fact a veiled warning against the path he sees Max heading out on.<br/><br/>PS: I also wonder if it's a coincidence that Max's mentor is named ""Sol""; Max is too close to ""the sun"", after all."

","To say that Pi is a movie about mathematics is inaccurate. It is a movie about a mathematician and his struggle to balance his eccentric scientific genius with his hidden desire to be a ""normal"" person. The mathematical ideas contained in the film are elementary and unimportant, but the window Aronofsky gives the moviegoer into the mind of a creative mathematician is inspiring.<br/><br/>As a professional mathematician myself, I must say that Pi gives more insight into the struggle of a creative mathematician than ""A Beautiful Mind"" or ""Good Will Hunting"". By comparison, those films are formulaic Hollywood drivel, while Pi is a much more thoughtful, exciting, and insightful film. I'm not saying this because I'm an independent movie snob. In fact, I rarely see indie films. I am, however, a math snob. I don't have patience for movies that portray mathematicians and scientists as super-heroes or idiot savants. Pi avoids this trap by pointing a microscope towards the true eccentricities of mathematicians without glamorizing or stereotyping.<br/><br/>I often find myself in awkward social situations with smart but not mathematically inclined people. In their best efforts to find common ground, they often mention films like ""A Beautiful Mind"". I'll patiently listen to them as they do their best to fain interest in my life's passion, waiting for them to stop so I can change the topic. But if I get the sense that they sincerely want to understand what the pursuit of applied mathematics is like, I recommend that they see ""Pi"" as a counterpoint to the Hollywood cliché.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone hoping to learn about mathematics, that isn't it's purpose. I do highly recommend this movie to any open-minded person who is friends with, married to, a sibling of, or a parent of a mathematician. I would also highly recommend this movie to any eccentric person with a strongly driven passion, whether it be for math, physics, or dancing. This movie shows the darker side of the creative struggle in a way that is somewhat exaggerated but still very honest."

","Darren Aronofsky shot to prominence with this relatively low budgeted movie which looks like it has a million dollars ploughed into its production. It's inspiring to see how this black and white film dwells on science fiction so effortlessly, given its very simple plot.<br/><br/>Long time Aronofsky collaborator Sean Gullette plays Max Cohen, a mathematician who's looking for patterns amidst chaos. He is determined to predict and look for patterns in stock markets, and comes dangerously close to a solution until his computer Euclid, breaks down. During his quest to uncover and recover what Euclid produced before it broke down, he comes across a religious Kabbalah cult, as well as a pesky banker, who is more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Those with a slight interest in mathematics might also get a kick out of watching how maths can feature and get filmed stylistically in a film like this. Like the Fibbonacci sequence, and how the Kabbalah texts can be represented by numbers. Some numerology also makes its way into the narrative. It's interesting to note how a simple story is able to accommodate these various subplots with ease, and how they all are brought together to make it visually arresting.<br/><br/>The cast is relatively small, and much hinges on Gullette's portrayal as a lonely, and sick man who's bordering on the edge of madness (don't most geniuses?). Most of the supporting characters are played by family and friend\s of the filmmakers too.<br/><br/>Accompanied by a great soundtrack, this Code 1 DVD also comes with plenty of extras, like deleted scenes, separate audio commentaries by Aronofsky and Gullette, production notes, trailers and a music video.

This movie is set in only the recent past, probably the 70's based on the state of computing technology, and most movies (other than indies like this) were already color, thus b&w does not increase the feel of authenticity as was the case with ""Schindler's List."" Perhaps it could have used the b&w for the scenes that were (or seemed to be) all in his head, keeping the rest in color - just a thought. But that also might make it clear what was real and what was imagined, and the director may have wanted that indistinct. Anyway, I didn't like using the low-quality film without having a definite reason for doing so.<br/><br/>A bigger problem was with the plot, or rather, the lack of a plot. The characters were pursuing an ethereal number. That's fine for a subplot, but not for the whole thing. This movie could have easily been cut to a half-hour. And it still would have been worthless.<br/><br/>And worst, we never had any resolution. Did he find the number or not? And how is the number supposed to be applied, since he said that application is more important than the number itself? All we know was that he forecast a few stock prices. And what was with his drilling into his head? Was he mixing up what was imagined and what was not? Or did he not burn the number either? Not that burning it would help if he had memorized it. Maybe he only silenced his imagination by drilling into his head, with miraculously not killing himself, either by drilling some needful part of the brain, by bleeding to death, or through infection. Since we saw him again, it must have been imagined. But that indicates his burning the number was also just imagined.<br/><br/>See what I mean? The movie was just weird."

","This movie chronicles the most severe case of scientific personality disorder (SPD) I have ever seen. ""What is SPD?"" you might ask. This is a disorder of scientists where science becomes everything to them. In his case, he sees swirls of creamer in his coffee as chaos theory...number theory, as math. In biological circles, we see all human behavior as either neurochemistry or an attempt to gain an evolutionary advantage. The good ones can see both. Some may say SPD makes scientists great. After all, Einstein had trouble remembering his own phone number. Most scientists I talk to see it as a struggle just to remain a normal human being. It is a struggle to be able to communicate with others without giving the perception you are looking at an alien. You have trouble even feeling comfortable in daily, non-scientific interpersonal communication. A mathematician, while deep in thought about a particular theorem, may see his own wife walk through the door and ask, ""Who are you?"" (True story!) For those scientists who care about being functional members of society, they do everything they can to not fall into this permanently. Our protagonist in this movie, has severe SPD. SEVERE! How do you liberate yourself from that once you have fallen in? I promise you, you could never imagine what he thinks of.<br/><br/>Mathematically speaking, he falls across something that was absolutely outstanding. He can finally explain all reality through Pi.

He encounters a mystic jew who is searching for the biblical code in the Torah(hebrew bible). This coupled with corporate types who want him to figure out the stock market gives you plenty of bang for your buck. Check it out now!"

"PIST-OFF","10","2","5","15 January 2003"," the world desperately trying to understand itself.
","Pi is a movie teaming with ideas and self realization. The premise is quite simple in that it is an exploration of a mathematician trying to understand explore the nature of reality. The closer he gets to truth the farther he strays from understanding it. The movie lingers on the golden ratio ( 1.618034 ) found in the Fibonacci sequence (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987.....) and how this man made creation is one way to understand the world by it's mere presence (percieved or real) everywhere in nature. Several ideas don't even have to be mentioned in the movie to play a part such as quantum mechanics, chaos theory, and the uncertinty pricncipal which have all conspired to bring an end or limitation to the uses of mathematics. The curious idea hardly mentioned in the movie is that computers become self aware working with these complex mathematics and try to understand themselves by which they go mad and shut down all practical functioning. The same can be said of the lead charecter of Max. As he tries to ponder the world he overlook that he is a part of that world and he must ultimately understand himself to understand the world. When he fails to do this he only digs a deeper hole and eventually all the practicalities in life such as eating, sleeping, and human relationships become secondary in importance to him. Darren Aronofsky has made a wonderously intelligent film here. I could have watched another two hours of this and I'll bet it probably would not have slowed down a bit. This is a rare movie that I think even those who respect it will over look how truly great it is. An intricate work of art that has so many philosophical ideas and an under belly of morality that itcould be one of the best movies in the last two decades. I like it."

","This movie rocked. For a mere $60,000, Aronosfky was able to make a movie that surpasses all but the best large-budget films. Sure, it doesn't have the eye candy of a blockbuster, but the cinematography makes up for this lack. The film is grainy and high contrast, adding more tension to the plot, in addition to the funky music. If you like independant films, go get Pi."

It is a film which can be appreciated in terms of it's film noire qualities as well as the existential questions which it awakens, but never seeks to answer. This film is a classic, and truly inspires you to investigate and postulate upon the mathematical conundrum that may (or may not) define the universe in which we live..."

","The movie ""Pi"" has to be one of the better movies I have seen this year, which goes to show that maybe James Cameron should rethink his ""Does this mean bigger is better?"" idea.  I am very happy that this movie only had a budget of $60,000, for, if it had more, the art of it might have been lost.<br/><br/>
The black and white of it is marvelous.  Mathematics is mostly black and white, there are no shades very often, just straight cut with definitiveness. It also lends the surrealistic view of every place that Max visits.  His home, lined with spidery webs of wire and equipment, the city, which is shown with sped-up footage, and also the subway, which lends a sort of simplistic view of the life under the city.<br/><br/>Also, I found that the metaphors were seen with ease, and therefore, aiding to the enjoyment of the film all the more.  Another thing I liked about the movie was the patterns in the actual film.  Many things repeated: Max's pill-popping, his daily notes, the work on the computer, etc. . .  It was all just masterfully constructed.<br/><br/>Although the movie does have it's ""yeah right"" idea's (such as, would this all powerful number be ONLY 216 digits long, and why would Max be one of the FIRST to find it?)  But the ambiguity of it all in the end more than pays for it.  All in all, this is a great film that should definitely be seen by all and perhaps even studied for its complexity."
"avatar-20","10","2","5","8 May 1999"," Pi's marriage of the purely mathematical to the purely spiritual...
","The mirror Pi. A sentient energy. This movie does what most truly great films can: turns a viewer's gaze on himself. What one sees he sees because it suits him; this is the consequence of the Interpretive Film's dance.<br/><br/>He is horrified, he is frazzled, he is awe-stricken. But why? Since the question will certainly differ--as a number of people will see a film--analyses will differ.  It is no wonder a variety of opinions can emerge from a theatrical screening, not to mention multiple ones.<br/><br/>In my opinion another thing done right is Pi's marriage of the purely mathematical to the purely spiritual. It refuses to polarize at either and avoids a paradox of the sort found in bipartisan politics, or any instition founded on duality, which ignores the apparent oneness of things; of man's being the fountainhead, the outpouring, of the life force. And so Pi charges the viewer to look no further than himself, for answers.<br/><br/>It is no coincidence that Pi ends on an interpretive note.<br/><br/>My only direct reference to the film invokes the scene in which an ant is perched on the wall next to Max's stock ticker. I was reminded of some old textbook illustrations from school I've seen of prisms and their effects on light. The ant beside the ticker looks as thought it might be a prism, spewing forth information on stocks--the ""living system"" of which Max so often speaks--a kind of life force.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is this viewer's opinion that, symbolically, Max's committing suicide is a result of his inability to find answers within him--his persistence in trying to find them, externally, to such an extent that he forgets that he and his world ARE precisely the same energy--and a disastrous method of marrying himself to his world again."
"Doc-134","10","2","5","30 March 1999"," A Journey into Mathematical Madness
","1) Mathematics is the language of nature<br/><br/>2) Everything around can be understood and represented through numbers<br/><br/>3) If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns will emerge.<br/><br/>These are the three fundamental assumptions that Maximilian Cohen, a genius mathematician has of our universe. He believes that patterns exist everywhere in nature; in disease epidemics and even the rise and fall of the Nile. Math is everywhere, even in the swirls that cream makes when you pour it in your coffee, or in the billows of smoke from a cigarette. Maximilian states that even Leonardo DaVinci penciled the ""golden rectangle"" into his masterpieces which generated the mythical ""golden spiral"". Pythagoras saw this spiraling shape everywhere in nature including our finger prints and DNA strands. This, Maximilian thinks is the basis for all understanding. There is a recurring motif of circular composition to reinforce this. For example, there are many shots in which Maximilian looks out the peep-hole on the front door of his apartment. When he does this, we not only see what is outside the door, but we see what is outside the door through the circular border of the peep-hole. This spiraling effect is also created in camera movement. Most notably, in one scene Maximilian is standing on a crowded street, and the camera begins to circle around him quite rapidly (circle dolly, or crab dolly).<br/><br/>""Pi"" is a journey into the Maximilian's mind as he struggles furiously to find the meaning of our world in terms of mathematical patterns. Theoretically, if one can explain everything through patterns, then he or she can explain the essence of even ""God"". But the real question is whether we as human beings are really capable of understanding the true essence of life. We can see that Maximilian is going more and more mad, the closer that he 'thinks' he is getting to the truth. He knows that he is close to the truth, but that he just can't quite grasp ahold of it. It may be true that in theory everything can be explained in terms of mathematical patterns, but in reality, perhaps we just don't have the intellectual capacity to do so. If we attempt such as colossal feat, perhaps it will lead us to madness.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing of ""Pi"" are impeccable. It is filmed in a grainy, black&white fashion, and is essentially chaotic. Much of the film is done with the hand-held camera, showing jerky movements.  'Chaos Theory' suggests that we can find mathematical patterns in even the most chaotic and seemingly unstructured elements of the world. The chaotic filming techniques greatly reflect Maximilian's search for truth. Our world is chaotic, and he is trying to make sense of it through any mathematical patterns that he can find. I found myself asking if there is any continuity or pattern to the editing and camera work. Director, Darren Aronofsky quite likely wants us to ask that question. There are certain patterns that can be followed, and many that can not, at least through human intellectualization. The mathematically precise beats of the electronic music soundtrack also set a beneficial mood to the film, reflecting to an even higher degree that patterns exist in everything, and that, as Maximilian states in his assumptions, ""Mathematics is the language of nature.""<br/><br/>**** out of 4"

","I rarely take the time to fill out this sort of thing, but after reading a few of the harsher reviews of this movie, I felt the need to at least throw in a few comments.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic movie: part scifi, part thriller, part psychological drama and part it's own brand-new genre... all with a very unique story line. The gritty camera work aligns perfectly with the music to make a whole far superior to the sum of the parts.<br/><br/>I've seen some criticism of the portrayal of Jews in this film, but I can only assume it comes from those who didn't pay much attention.

","I just want to amplify what others have touched on.  This movie is not so much about its subject matter as its subject -- that is, it's about poor, obsessed, half-crazy Max and not about computers or number theory.  So the computer he uses looks lower-tech than a TRS-80.  So the chip he uses has only four pins, and magically fits into the socket he's already designed for it.  If you dwell on the details, you'll lose sight of the brilliance of the movie.<br/><br/>The camera work, soundtrack and mania of the lead character all work together to make a gripping, tooth-grinding psychological drama.  You are left with two opposite but alternative interpretations that center around the old professor's warning about his obsession warping his view of reality.<br/><br/>Was the professor concealing the truth to protect Max from his own discoveries, or was the professor warning Max against letting his obsession cloud his thinking?<br/><br/>The movie is full of subtleties that can fit either interpretation equally well."

","Glad to see a wonderfully executed film about something intellectual. A nice departure from the usual repetitive sex, eating, violence and other common themes emerging from the animalistic, instinctual aspects of human existence. This very jewish film (one of the best together with Barton Fink and Miller's Crossing) is about the quest for the truth. Understanding of the patterns of complex systems. It seemed like the writers are somewhat familiar with the set and chaos theory. Brilliant mathematician Max Cohen suffers from debilitatingly severe headaches and truly reminds of many brilliant mathematicians like Kurt Godel and one of the founders of fractal mathematics Mitchell Feigenbaum in his avoidance of people and ultimate dedication to his vocation. He believes like most ingenious scientists before him that universe exhibits patterns and these patterns can be quantified and understood in the language of mathematics. He pursues finding a definite answer to the workings of the stock market, thus stumbling on a numerical code to the processes of the universe. A code linking together spirality and  the golden rule of geometry meaning the fractality of nature and the concept of self-similarity.<br/><br/>He detests petty materialists and finds the orthodox jews looking for a password to god silly and mistaken in their interpretation of the code.<br/><br/>Many things are left vague in the process, but the idea, photography, black and white world of the mathematician and the film, editing and drum and bass music the director Darren Aronofsky uses are just brilliant.<br/><br/>The mathematician reminds of the obsessed scientist ready to risk and curtail his life to find the understanding to the ultimate questions. He is very similar to the unconditional seeker in Ken Russel's Altered States. An intelligent film for a change. Thanks to filmmakers for that!"

Now I can see that being a mathematical genius isn't what it's cracked up to be. (What with the limousines and paparazzi) It's much better being stupid. But as dense as I am, I'm still fairly adept at using power tools in the fashion recommended by the manufacturer, unlike our so-called genius.<br/><br/>This film was a favourite at the Sundance Film Festival, and won the Director's award. It's shot in grainy black and white, on a super low budget in the neighbourhood of $35,000 if I remember correctly. All funds were raised by cast and crew, and the director's mother was part of the catering services. Despite my phobias about math, and therefore an inherent lack of knowledge about it, I still found the film intriguing and innovative. Sometimes the camera angles can create an unpleasant disorienting effect, but not too often, for not too long, and not without good reason.<br/><br/>The story's protagonist, Max, is not likely someone you can relate to, but rather empathize with. We all sometimes want to be left alone; Max always wants to be left alone. He is a man without peace, who's being watched and with an obsession of Pi to work out. It is a very dark film, that grows darker with each passing minute. Not for your happy-ending kind of target audience. It should be interesting to see what the makers of ""Pi"" do next with the attention they received for this film."

Max is an annoying egotistical wacko who spends a lot of time popping pills and unfortunately (probably to pad up the movie) we are shown his hallucinations. Parts of the film are tough to take without a fast forward button, because the recurring ""trips"" are pointless, boring and irritating. And there are many such trips....too many. A lot of metaphors are lost and the movie loses by being centered around the theorist instead of the theories. A thoroughly unlikable main character, even if the performer behind him is pretty damn good, is what spoils this one.<br/><br/>This movie was hyped as a great indie film, I think it did well technically, but artistically, it belongs in Mystery Science Theatre 3000 right down there with ""Manos - the Hands of Fate"".

","Darren Aronofsky's first feature, Pi, is an overly ambitious undertaking suffering fatally from a number of different problems. Pi is more a psychological character portrait than anything--it fails as a thriller. The narrative overall is barely enough to keep me interested--and has little to no replay value for me.<br/><br/>Max, a paranoid mathematician, is searching for a numerical formula that will express all the patterns of life and seeks to 'crack the code' of the universe. It is, in so many words, a quest for the Ark of the Covenant. It is not impossible to do this film, I don't think, but I do think Pi has failed.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the style and felt it worked well. Stark lighting, manic cuts and camera operation, and surreal audio all add to the psycho paranoia that could have made this a great movie. It doesn't have a whole lot of technical flaws, in fact outside of the acting probably none.<br/><br/>But the flaws are dealbreakers. The film's Achilles's heel is definitely its delusions of grandeur. Perhaps I've misinterpreted something--but the film seems to think its correct?! The Grand Unifying Theory of Everything? Nobody knows (yet), but I promise you it is not an inexplicable 216 digit integer. You are thinly veiling mysticism and numerology as science. The easiest way to solve this problem in the context of Pi, drop the bubblegum pop pseudoscience and, if you want to pretend that he found the correct Grand Unifying Theory of Everything, just leave it to the imagination. It should have been a complete MacGuffin. Or, make it clearer that Max is just plain bonkers. The film seems to believe its own drivel. Make it about Max's descent into insanity, and you've got a potentially good story. It may be successfully arguable that the film doesn't believe itself and is trying to portray Max as insane, but that's looking like a stretch from where I stand.<br/><br/>The next thing is the bad acting from the supporting cast. Everything was at least working for me until the conspirators' trap was sprung, at which point I had to start wondering, ""Are you kidding?"" Overall my suspension of disbelief just fell like a house of cards at this point. Please note that I do however feel that Sean Gullette's performance was quite convincing and worked well throughout.<br/><br/>And finally, I didn't care for the soundtrack. It hasn't aged as well as other successful electronica soundtracks of its day. Overall I have to describe Pi as being both self-righteous and pretentious."

So repeats this line from our main protagonist and unreliable narrator throughout 'Pi', Darren Aronofsky's surreal psychological indie thriller and explosive directorial debut. But was newcomer Aronofsky able to tell story enough that could accurately and shockingly be told on a shoestring budget? Let's take a look.<br/><br/>Shot in high-contrast black and white, we are thus plunged into the disturbed mind, madness and mechanisms of mathematics computer genius and number theorist Maximillian ""Max"" Cohen (Sean Gullette), of whom suffers cluster headaches, extreme paranoia, hallucinations and social anxiety disorder. Unemployed and holed up in a dreary Chinatown apartment in New York City, Max makes a breakthrough when his computer Euclid crashes as he makes stock predictions, the machine spitting out a seemingly random 216-digit number. Eventually discovering that what Euclid spat out was accurate, Max slowly descends from curiosity to obsession, confronting his old mathematics mentor Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis) to encountering Lenny Meyer, (Ben Shenkman) a Hasidic Jew in a coffee shop who coincidentally does mathematical research on the Torah. He even explains to Max that some people believe that the Torah is a string of numbers that form a code sent by God. From Wall Street agents to members of a radical Jewish Kabbalah sect, Max is thus thrown into even more turmoil as he realizes the pattern of the numbers as he writes them out on the brink of an epiphany as to why these people want them for their own extreme purposes. With the urgent monochromatic photography of Matthew Libatique,everything that follows seems to fade from the fuzzy uncertainty being the fine line of science-fiction into the maddening realm of the entropic unknown as Max sees it, thanks to the brilliant choice of the SnorriCam that provides the film with its unsettling, queasy edge on how he views the world around him slipping off into oblivion. Coffee and cream dance in a cup, waves crash, ants creep and crawl about. Patterns are everywhere, according to the Fibonacci sequence. Unlike it's own design, Max taps too far in to the very genius of his own subconscious and finds himself slowly spiraling out of his very own control. With the similarities of a Lynchian thriller such as 'Eraserhead' and Orson Welles' 'The Trial', 'Pi' is a paranoid pulse-pounding psych trip, racing along to Oren Sarch's rapid editing and Clint Mansell's cyberpunk score while maintaining to match the claustrophobic life of Max in turn. Remarkably gripping and frighteningly intelligent as well as constructed, 'Pi' proved maverick auteur director Aronofsky a promising career in films that would later probe our psychosis and thrill our senses beyond compare with some quite disturbing and otherworldly sights. Happy Pi Day!"

","""When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, you will filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere.""<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's first feature film, Pi, was a unique and experimental movie that cemented his status as an auteur director. Even in his latest big budget film, Noah, his unique and creative voice shined through. Just like his characters, Aronofsky seems obsessed with discovering what drives them. His films are a psychological character study in which he delves deep into their minds in order to try to discover what leads them to their self destructive behavior. In the surface, Pi may sound like a boring film dealing with math and numbers, but Aronofsky sucks you in from the beginning with his very unique style of film making including some crazy chase scenes shown in fast motion and a strange soundtrack. The cinematography in dirty black and white sets the tone of the film as well, although I didn't find it quite engaging. It's amazing what Aronofsky did with such a low budget and it won him special recognition. He won for best director in Sundance in 1998 and an Independent Spirit Award for his first screenplay. He also proved Pi was no one hit wonder as his following films were all received with warm praise by the critics. Aronfofsky's unique personal vision is reflected in each one of his films and if you go back to Pi you will find several similarities and trademarks that were already established from the beginning. If Pi were my first film from Aronofsky I might have enjoyed it even more, but I think he has perfected his craft in films like Black Swan and The Wrestler.<br/><br/>The screenplay written by Darren Aronofsky and Sean Gullette centers on a mathematical genius named Max (Sean Gullette). He's a number theorist who believes that nature can be explained through numbers and that there are patterns that can emerge from it. He is working on discovering these pattern through the stock market and considering all the variables involved. He works in his home through a homemade computer he has developed. He locks himself in his small apartment and becomes obsessed with discovering these patterns while also worrying that people are spying on him. He suffers from terrible headaches that sometimes lead him to delusions so he is currently on medication and at times its hard to decipher if he is really seeing things or imagining them. One of the few people Max interacts with is Sol (Mark Margolis) who is his former math mentor. He worries about Max's obsession and asks him to take a break, but Max is determined to discover the pattern that could unlock the mysteries of nature. The other person who Max interacts with is Lenny (Ben Shenkman), a Jew who is currently working on the numbers from the Torah. As Max becomes more and more obsessed with unlocking these numbers the crazier things get for him.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film despite the fact that I knew where it was heading. Although his characters are very different in every film the resolution is very similar and the ending is always open ended for the audience to interpret. Pi marked the beginning of Aronofsky's love affair with Mark Margolis who has been in every one of his film as a secondary character. He was the only face I recognized in this film as I was unfamiliar with the rest of the cast. Sean Gullette gives a very convincing lead performance but the rest of the cast aren't as great. You could tell Aronofsky had a very limited budget to work with, but he did marvels with it. Pi is a clever film with some memorable scenes. I never thought a film about math and numbers could be so thrilling, but it is because Aronofsky manages to put the character in the center and turns it into a psychological character study."

","This a nice movie in a way that shows up a different narrative... however not quite clear, a non practicing Jewish mathematician, who is very introverted but is well know since he's looked up for some dark big economical forces and for a group of mystic Jews practitioners of the Kabbalah, he suffers headaches since he was a kid and that affects him all over... he's after a pattern that will solve the secrets of life or so... I'm not a mathematician myself so i don't really know if what he's looking on the movie actually make sense at all. Both the Kabbalah practitioners and the dark economy forces, represented on this cold black woman, seduce him with things he got interested on, so somehow he collaborates with them. At the end, they both try to use him, but he doesn't collaborate.

"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","14 October 2013"," Sensation Debut Film By Darren Aronofsky
","Darren Aronofsky's feature film debut presents the now reputed auteur experimenting with various aspects of filmmaking to carve out his own distinct identity & contains all the elements that are now well associated with his works, be it the theme of obsession, biblical motifs, inventive use of camera angles, heavy use of montages, isolated characters or surreal structure.<br/><br/>Pi (π) tells the story of Max; a brilliant mathematician, who believes there are patterns everywhere in universe & tries to find the same in stock markets to determine its rise n fall on the basis of his calculations. But his increasing obsession with numbers ultimately results in his self-destruction when he's driven to the brink of madness by the people who are after his research.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Darren Aronofsky, the film gives us a glimpse of his precision eye for art & aesthetics, is cleverly narrated from start to finish, and marks a sensational start to his directional career. Finely captured in greyscale photography, the camera-work exhibits a number of innovative tricks which he went on to use extensively in his later works & also provides a haunting atmosphere to the whole picture.<br/><br/>But it's not just Aronofsky who makes his debut in the film industry with this feature for it also launched the film scoring career of Clint Mansell who provides an uncanny score to go with its equally bizarre plot. Sean Gullette delivers an excellent performance in the role of Max & carries the film amazingly well throughout its 84 minutes of runtime and he's nicely supported by the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Pi is a smartly crafted psychological thriller that blends the mathematical patterns with religious beliefs in a very enthralling manner & offers a cinematic experience that's surreal in every sense of the word. Introducing Aronofsky's fresh psyche bursting with new ideas, Pi is an instant classic that remains one of the finest debuts for any filmmaker in recent memory. Thoroughly recommended."

I ask myself what is so interesting about dysfunctional characters, it's because they think differently and wider which makes it so much fun to watch. <br/><br/>I love the feeling that not many people seemed to be involved in this movie, it's like it's this person against his own bizarre mind, it really makes you feel isolated and trapped in this movie with the small apartment, the black and white and the feeling like he is living on his own planet, population: 1.

","Pi begins with an interesting premise that brings excitement – solving a mathematical puzzle which has extensive implications financially, socially and spiritually. But this might just be its downfall. How can the movie resolve this incredible task and satisfy the audience? To dangle such a prize before us and not deliver leaves the viewer with a little resentment.<br/><br/>Storyline follows a genius and his mentor in pursuit of the 216 digit solution to a puzzle. Drugs and mental illness are a backdrop. He does figure it out and even states that he is the chosen one to receive this information because he is the only one able to understand it (syntax). Yet he ultimately is overwhelmed by it and chooses an extreme course of action to rid himself of this knowledge which can change the world. Bummer to the rest of us struggling to find the meaning of life and find ""God."" <br/><br/>Filmwork was interesting with lots of camera angles and editing. Sometimes the sounds were too piercing and unnecessary to get the message to viewers. I began to tire with the poking of the brain which showed up everywhere. More interaction with his mentor would have been appreciated as they worked well together and moved the story along. The mathematical theories and explanations were very short and offer the viewer no real additional knowledge or insight (at least to most individuals who have some form of higher education). I would have been open to an introduction of some new/different hypothesis even if it seemed far-fetched.<br/><br/>Decent film, but not one I would get excited when I knew it was on TV again; more of a study of art and filmmaking."

","Darren Aronofsky took on the endeavor of his first feature film, _Pi_, at age 28, with his only funding coming from $100 bills given by friends and family; the budget, in total, was $60,000. Why is this relevant? Because it is this ability to create something so magnificent out of something so modest that marks a truly great piece of art; this ability to find support in the foundation of an idea, rather than from the celebrities and production associated with a big budget release, that heralds a truly genuine film. Pi hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, as the overexposed black and white image thrusts us into a surreal, nightmarish world, and Clint Mansell's dark, electronic soundtrack starts to activate our adrenaline, it becomes obvious that we are in for a unique experience. It also becomes obvious that this is not a film for everyone. The low-budget cinematography constructs a tangible sort of insanity—we are right there, alongside tragic protagonist Max, trying to navigate through the hullabaloo of a foreign-seeming world, and this can become tiring. But if an audience is willing to commit itself to a film that may, at times, be uncomfortable and confusing, it bears lofty rewards in the end.<br/><br/>The premise itself isn't very complex: math mastermind, Max Cohen, attempts to uncover the nature of ultimate reality through number patterns. This is a subject that has been discussed time and time again by philosophers, and the film presents few (if any) ideas to add to the discourse—but then again, it's not trying to. What it does do admirably is translate this abstract subject into a resonating visual landscape; it associates a concrete feeling to a vague concept.<br/><br/>This is, in a lot of ways, similar to what _Eraserhead_ achieved a little over two decades earlier. Aronofsky admits to having been influenced by David Lynch, and this debut film is his clearest homage to vintage Lynchian style: from the nihilistic undertones to the industrial surroundings to the grotesque, surrealist images—numerous parallels can be drawn. But while _Eraserhead_'s protagonist passively trudges through the rubble, _Pi_'s leading man desperately tries to explain it, and it is with this desperation that the film builds intensity in a way _Eraserhead_ never quite does, nor attempts.<br/><br/>However, despite its many successes, the film does suffer from a few downfalls worth mentioning, most of these a result of the low production cost. For one thing, the acting in many scenes, while not cringeworthy, can definitely become a distraction; this is partly due to the dialogue which doesn't lend itself well to the actors' interaction. Furthermore, there are instances when the camera becomes so shaky that it might take considerable effort to fully grasp what's happened (those instances are rare). But these are minor shortcomings that are easily overshadowed by the film's strengths.<br/><br/>Overall, _Pi_ is a very fitting film to mark the beginning of an exceptional directorial career."

","(Originally posted on 29 March 2002, accidentally deleted on 16 April 2007 and re-added the same day)<br/><br/>Regrettably, I have not had the time to read all the user comments, but those I have read have disappointed me. People are analysing this film using their expectations of what they wanted to be shown. For example: those who consider it a good example of an art film praise its cinematography, and those who consider it to be auteur film praise its originality. Further still, those who wanted to see a technical masterpiece criticise its inaccuracies, and those who wanted a Hollywood flick were sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>I do not consider myself to be able to understand the film in any higher terms than those people who have already left comments; I also see everything that has been mentioned. Yes, the cinematography is simply beautiful to some people, not enough for others. Yes, there are many technical errors, inconsistencies and faults. BUT, many people are just not seeing what Aranofsky was probably trying to hint at.<br/><br/>This film is not a message, it is not meant to make you understand a specific thing, you are not meant to come away thinking ""well, the moral of that is..."". There are no morals; it is not a comment about paranoia, nor a comment about mathematics, nor a comment about nature, nor a comment about the futility of looking for the meaning of life.<br/><br/>What this film does is makes you think. You are not meant to draw any conclusions from it.<br/><br/>Tell me: how does each of you interpret the scene where Max is standing in a white screen, near the end? Most people have neglected to mention the importance of the Jewish contribution to the film. The Jews were interested in finding the true name of God. If you listen to what Rabi Cohen says to Max, you find out that in their belief, there was once one person who had to carry out a certain ritual in a certain place, and the key to performing that ritual correctly was to utter the true name of God. Max knows that name (the 216 digit number). Is this scene with Max in a white screen, his standing before God? Don't answer! You're just meant to consider the possibilities that the film presents. I wrote this one down because as far as I've read, nobody's considered it yet.<br/><br/>Also, Max does not commit suicide in the end - he lobotomises himself. If you notice, he maps his skull and identifies the part of his brain which is giving him the headaches. I don't know much about the science of this, but I'm told that he understands by this point that the reason the headaches give him paranoid delusions is because this part of his brain is damaged. He drills this part to cease the headaches, thus disabling his genius ability, but stopping the headaches.<br/><br/>In light of this lobotomy, was it ALL a paranoid delusion? Don't answer! Consider.<br/><br/>Also, a bit of technical misunderstanding to clear up: the film is called Pi because, as you probably know, Pi is an infinite number. As it is stated in the film (in reference to the game they play 'Go'), when something is infinite, the possibilities become smaller and smaller, and you will eventually be able to find patterns. The point is (and the reason that the inclusion of his old friend Saul is vital to the plot - if you can call it plot) is that Saul was investigating Pi. The 'special' 216 number occurs in Pi somewhere - it HAS to. Saul was investigating Pi, Max was investigating numerical patterns. Both directions led them to the same number. It is all interlinked. Thus you might give the reason for the title of the film as ""The film is called Pi because Pi contains a number which the film considers as possibly the secret to the true name of God, or the way to successfully predict the stock market, or the meaning of life"". Could that statement get any more ambiguous? Don't answer! Consider.<br/><br/>I would be interested to hear anybody's follow-up comments to my views here."

It doesn't have a plot, or if it does its so small that the director just lumped in a load of crappy disorientating scenes of him (such as poking a brain with a pencil, constant shots of him taking pills , 'strange' people disappearing when they were there only a moment ago..etc etc, its really bad...honestly...) well...that paragraph was a bit muddled but i just finished watching the film so its not my fault.

","One young man has the ability to find god through math. Will it unlock the secrets of the universe, or will it drive him insane? Are the events he witnesses really happening, or are they all in his head? This film seems to be constructed for the sole purpose of baffling whomever sees it, and it fails as much as it succeeds but is none the less an interesting little movie. The orthodox Jews want the numerical code for god so they can be all powerful. They believe so blindly that they are chosen to resurrect their deity that they overlook that maybe our main character doesn't care about it one way or another. I couldn't help but notice the subtle allusion to Martin Scorsesse's The Last Temptation of Christ where god is presented to Jesus in the form of a splitting headache. Our main mathematical genius suffers from the same ailment, hmmmm.... Perhaps he is in the same predicament; chosen to complete some biblical prophecy when he really doesn't want anything to do with it. His death at the end was both graphic and graceful as he power drills himself in the head and ends up in his idea of heaven where he does not know all the answers and the pain is gone. There religious metaphors abound in Pi with the most obvious being the overt allusions to Christ by way of our main mathman. People may like this film or hate it, but much hard work and ingenuity were necessary to bring this unique vision to the screen so the average person can pick it apart. It is hard to say what makes a great movie because everyone has a different opinion, but if a film can touch you, be it on an emotional, visceral, intellectual, or philosophical level then it is well worth your time."

","First things first; anybody who rejects a movie based on whether it uses color or black & white is simply, (as I would say to my kids when harsher words would do better), SILLY!! Of late B&W & degraded images get used as an effect, especially in low-budget indie films and in this case it seems so. I can't imagine what you anti-B&W folks would say about classics like Citizen Kane to Manhattan in which B&W was used as an integral part of each films artistic expression. As for Pi itself; it was a mediocre film, a simple story about a man in search of meaning, meaning in himself, why he is like he is. Mathematics was simply a device through which the story was told. Hitchcock used it often; called it a McGuffin. A device to further the plot, with no meaning at all and needing none. Except that in Pi, Aronofsky went to far or not far enough. He made the device too important, needing further explanation, which is obvious to all the math-heads out there; which I unfortunately am not, and so liked the film more than those who could see through it all. There should have been less math and more drama, more drama and less film technique. This same plot can be transplanted and used in any genre, any drama. The genre itself is the device."
"dromasca","8","1","2","4 July 2004"," One of the best underground films
","I try to measure all films by the same scale. I do not care that much if it took 60,000 $ or 60,000,000 $ to make a movie. At the end of the day I will probably pay the same price for the ticket, or DVD rental, and it will take the same 90 minutes of my precious and too short life to see it. What I care about is the emotion, or the intellectual pleasure I took from watching the film. According to this criteria 'Pi' gets an 8 out of 10 on my personal scale. <br/><br/>However, one cannot refer to this movie without taking into account that it was made with the lowest budget possible nowadays - a real underground or garage movie if you want. Do not look for smart expensive effects here. Even the computer equipment looks like eightish, although the film was made in 98. The cheap production, the black and white filming gives the whole movie an atmosphere of roughness and sincerity and lets us viewers focus on the story. And the story - well, the story is original and strong. Finding a common mathematics pattern in nature, economy, God has always been the ideal for many geniuses and lunatics. It is hard to say to what category does the main character belong. He gets close to the supreme mathematic or maybe metaphysics truth - at the same time he gets deeper and deeper in what seems to be the darkness of obsession and madness. The films succeeds with that little means to provoke so deep thoughts to the empathic viewer about science, and truth, and madness, and being different, and refusing to plat within the rules of the society. <br/><br/>The director, Darren Aronofsky seems to be one of the most original directing voices today. I admire him  for not giving up to the temptations of commercial cinema. If and when he does it, I hope he will not do something like 'Blair Witch Project 2', nor 'Matrix 2/3', but rather keep expressing the strong and original voice he lets us hear in 'Pi'."

That's meant as a criticism, and I found myself wondering how Pi was received by a ""mass"" audience rather than as excellent student-film for Aranofsky's reel.<br/><br/>Let's start with acting, since the most immediate part of any film about people is the people in the film.  The only character with dimension, intrigue, and screen charisma (not interpersonal charisma, but watch-a-bility) was the character performed by Ben Schenkman.  He was also one of the most minor characters.<br/><br/>I was always aware of why somebody was cast or a character written in.  I feel, a lot of times, that a student film is trying to be longer than it deserves to be.  That there are moments where no narrative progression occurs, no exposition, just stuff to look at.  <br/><br/>Remember the scene on Coney Island when Max needlessly washes his face in the ocean water, it's in slow-motion.  Why?  I feel because the director or the cinematographer really wanted to do some slow-motion work, to see if it would work.  This shows a lack of pre-production on their part.<br/><br/>I also recall the pointless love-interest character, the Indian neighbor, and how every motivation on her face seemed to be suggestive of imprecise direction, not a genuine character trait.<br/><br/>Pi is not a film without its merit, but I fealt it was overhyped.  I can never hold a director accountable for the success of his film despite itself, and I honestly believe Aranofsky is a talented film maker, but Pi is not a great film.

It's about the human mind's constant craving for order, for intelligence's grinding quest to label and categorize and put semantic meaning onto bits and pieces of perceived reality.  It's about genius run awry and about those who would seek to exploit it and in so doing it help lead it to ruin.<br/><br/>You have got to see a small independent film called Pi.  It's a mere 85 minutes of pure madness set to a ravingly edgy techno soundtrack. The editing is at times incoherent and incongruent, but exceptionally poignant.  It provides the viewer access to a visceral understanding amidst what might otherwise seem a boring premise: a mathematician's quest for some new theorem.  The tense editing techniques, invasive camera angles and stark contrasts in the lighting serve a crucial role as backdrop to this psychodrama as it unfolds.<br/><br/>This is what great filmmaking is all about.  Certain comparison's to David Lynch's cult masterpiece ERASERHEAD are sure to abound, though this film is certainly easier to follow, less quirky and far grittier and accessible. It's easy for the viewer to get caught up in the narrative which includes visitations by Wall Street mobsters, a bizarre cult of kabbalistic Hasidic Jews, a nosy landlady with attitude and more.  Top Notch all around. Four stars."

Max begins this movie towards the top of a downward spiral and ""Pi"" follows him as he moves toward rock bottom with increasing speed and intensity.

The black and white photography clearly delineates the black and white world of numbers and mathematics that both enslaves and fascinates the lead character, Max Cohen. But the film has the true mark of an artistic endeavor in that it does not attempt to be easily understood or understood at first viewing but allows several possible definitions.<br/><br/>Aronofsky cleverly mimics his own storyline in his storyline, in other words the mystery of mathematical patterns within every aspect of life is mimicked in the patterned editing and layout of the film. It would be interesting to know if there was an intentional meaning to the editing patterns and repetitions in the film. I suspect that there is.<br/><br/>However the best aspect of the film is the freedom it allows the audience to mull and think on the aspects that the film introduces.

","One of the reviews of Pi I read on IMDB said this movie blended elements of number theory, Go, computer science, Wall Street,... into a solute of paranoid genius (I am paraphrasing from memory so please forgive me). I think one word in that sentence is off. The word 'genius' should be replaced with 'mess'. Pi does contain all the said elements, but this movie is just too silly to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Many people have commented that this film's storyline borders on illogical towards the second half. I would go as far as to say it is laughable. Whatever intrigue they had generated was completely demolished once the second half reared its ugly head. Self-aware computers? The 216-letter name of God? Please, there are real uses for number theory, you don't need to invent stupid ones. Don't expect the plot to win you back after that till the end. The chase scenes aren't particularly intense (mostly because you can't see what's going on) and the story just gets sillier and sillier. In fact, if I didn't think the ending was great (truly a saving grace, even though it's a copout), I would have hated this movie. Instead, the ending shed a new light on the past 85 minutes and reassured me that what I thought was laughable indeed was intended to be. However, I don't think the film is brilliant or even clever for having done this; I still had to subject myself to 85 minutes (or at least 40 minutes) of meandering plot just to appreciate the ending, and I don't think it was worth it.<br/><br/>With that, we get to the technical side. The film is shot in black and white and the camera work is very shaky. Add this to an overall bleak setting and you get cinematography and mood perfect for the film. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of thing that's bearable for 85 minutes. I enjoyed the first few paranoiac episodes, but as they got longer and more frequent, I started to get overwhelmed by the headache-inducing camera work (as Max must have been). One thing that was always spot on however was the music. Most of the music used in the film is techno, and it always suits the film, whether during a subway scene or a paranoiac episode. Probably the highlight of the film and I would recommend the soundtrack.<br/><br/>One last thing: I thought it was funny when Saul explained to Max about Archimedes and the displacement problem. I thought everybody knew that story, especially mathematicians."

Having seen both of Aronofsky's films, I believe that this is the central focus of his work. Man goes insane, but how? in Pi, it's the numbers, pounding a life long mathematical genius forward.  As a person afflicted with Cohen's intelligence, i understand what was going on in the movie.  of course the math made no sense, because as he continued to inquire, he tried to make sense of things that didn't.  and please, don't complain about the end of the film.  the drilling was a suicide, and it is only in his death that the genius himself can finally understand his true wish, the wish to be able to say ""i don't know""."

By that I don't mean they needed more money for special effects and the like; the simplicity of the film was one of its strong points, allowing the viewers to concentrate on the subject matter at hand instead of silly sub-plots. But lack of finances for things most of the movie-going public take for granted, such as state-of-the-art camera equipment, hampered the film in my estimation. This is not to say low budget films can't work; In the Company of Men and Clerks were huge successes despite having budgets less than what some big studios spend on buffet spreads for their stars. But neither of those films needed more advanced technology for chase scenes or rapid action. Both were essentially pieces where the camera was set up in a corner and events in an almost documentary style. Pi lost much of its power and drama in scenes where it was difficult to comprehend the action because of poor cinematography. It's really a shame considering these faults could most likely could have been ironed out for less than what one chase scene in a lame summer action movie costs. What a Catch-22; you have to get big studio attention to make money, but you have to be able to make money before you get money from big studios."

I have always been intrigued by math and physics, it's amazing how much of our world is mathematically predictable. Unless you can appreciate the chaos in genius and the patterns in nature you will have trouble appreciating this film.

While largely theory and/or fiction, ""Pi"" nonetheless makes a strong case for explaining the connection between a Creator and his methodology. We have determined the nature and physics of many things in the universe, and while we have yet far more to explain than that which we already know, we must realize that it is concievable that it could be possible to see how God runs things. Is there an upper limit to what we can know? Do we have the capability to become too close to God?

"'Lich","7","1","2","13 August 1998"," In 1990s New York City, a numbers theorist may have discovered the ultimate pattern in the universe, which would include the pattern behind the apparent chaos of the stock market, and would be the True NAME
","PI is an independently produced art film (Sundance festival winner) that is, generically, an SF mathematical mystery, plus thriller. Summarized by Vince Moore, with editing by Rich Erlich for the CLOCKWORKS-2 PROJECT: a list of WORKS USEFUL FOR THE STUDY OF THE HUMAN/MACHINE INTERFACE IN SF. <br/><br/>The significantly named Maximilian-always called ""Max""-Cohen (Kohen Gadol  High Priest = Max. Priest) is a theoretical mathematician who believes in pattern in everything, yet he is still subject to inexplicable and incurable seizures and hallucinations (apparently from some variety of migraine).  He has focused his talents on patterns that may predict complex, apparently chaotic phenomena, with the stock market as his main, purely theoretical, interest. Just before his home-made computer (Euclid) crashes, it spits out some apparently random digits and highly unlikely stock predictions. Cohen throws away the printout and goes to complain to Sol Robeson: his current confidante and Go partner, and apparently Cohen's only male friend (he rejects friendship or even colleagueship with women).  Sol was once Cohen's mentor; and Sol once sought patterns in the transcendental number pi, perhaps finding them and suffering a stroke in consequence-and being wise enough to quit.  (Pi = ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, the ratio itself = 3.1416+ a nonrepeating series that can be extended indefinitely.)  Sol asks if the random number(s) the computer generated contained 216 digits.  <br/><br/>Cohen is soon told by a Hassidic Jew who works with Biblical numerology that his group of Hassidim are looking for a 216 digit number (which, translated from numbers to Hebrew letters, gives the true NAME-of God).  Simultaneously, an organization combining elements of a think tank, Wall Street brokerage firm, and espionage operation aggressively solicits Cohen's help on stock investments.  Cohen goads Sol to reproduce the 216-digit number, which Sol does, has another stroke, and dies. Sol's earlier theory was that the 216 digit number was the product of computer consciousness as the computer ""died.""  <br/><br/>PI is significant for the study of the human/machine interface primarily for the imagery of Cohen sitting in the midst of Euclid, which Robert Denerstein, the Scripps-Howard reviewer, saw as ""a giant computer that lines the walls of his apartment like a high-tech web"" (_The Cincinnati Post_, 7 Aug. 1998: 3B).  Euclid is literally a very small main-frame but Denerstein does well to note the web imagery: at the center of the computer, destroying its main chip, are ants, secreting a mucoid substance that ""kills"" Euclid, perhaps bringing it to consciousness and generating the NAME.  Cohen rebuilds his computer, around a superchip supplied by the mysterious Wall Street organization.  The imagery of Cohen inside the computer elements suggests strange juxtapositions of postmodern cybernetic space-but definitely not cyberpunk cyberspace-enclosing the human and insectoid, the natural and secular, along with the ultimately spiritual.  Cohen within his computer may be a new Kohen Gadol in a new Holy of Holies, bringing about the Last Days, in an apocalyptic crash of the stock market, or with the Messianic era.  Or he's another mad scientist, another nut venturing into areas reserved for High Priests or Messiah.  <br/><br/>Cf. and contrast Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 short story, ""The Nine Billion Names of God,"" wherein computers are used to list God's 9 billion names, at which time the work of the universe, and the universe, is finished (collected in Clarke's THE NINE BILLION NAMES OF GOD [New York: Signet-NAL, 1967])."

"brianberta","8","1","3","22 June 2016"," A very effective thriller
","I really like watching weird films. It's interesting to see all the imagination that Directors can put into their films. In fact, Eraserhead (1977) is one of my favorite films of all time. Seeing that Pi was a low budget debut film, I was curious what Aronofsky would be able to do with it, because I heard that it looked very good despite its budget. The film looked very good, and I found it to be a very interesting film.<br/><br/>A paranoid mathematician named Max attempts to find a pattern in the Stock market which will also unlock the universal patterns found in nature. However, hallucinations continue to hinder his path and as the film continues on, it becomes more difficult to tell what's real and what isn't.<br/><br/>Max goes through internal and external conflict in the film. His internal struggles are the hallucinations he experiences and the first phase of a deterioration of his body starting with a bump on his head. These symptoms often come into effect when he's at crucial points in his objective. If he's getting info from Lennie, he might have to rush home before it takes its toll on him. Also, if he's attempting to find the 216 digit number on his computer, the hallucinations and pain can make him lose his mind, scream at the top of his lungs, or try to destroy his equipment in a fit of range. If the hallucinations didn't effect his experiments, one could argue that they felt a little tacked on. However, director Darren Aronofsky was able to work them into the conflict he faced in the film, and he avoided having them feel gratuitous.<br/><br/>The external conflict he encounters mainly comes into the film near the latter portion of the film. When it happens, it changes the film entirely, and it makes a lot of events make sense which we saw earlier in the film. It's a very interesting way of showing you how his simple task turned into something much, much more. It also makes the ambiguity of the films ending have a great impact on the viewer and it leaves you thinking about it, and what exactly Max did. The film takes a common weird trope for weird films, hallucinations, and it creates conflict in the film out of it.<br/><br/>The hallucinations in the film are really well-done. The main reason why they work so good is because we are able to feel Max's pain during them. The sudden and striking sound effects which the viewer hears plays a main role at making the viewer feel these unpleasant emotions with Max. Sounds can sometimes effect our emotions more than visuals. You could always remove the sound and hope for the viewer to connect the dots at what the protagonist is feeling. However, a simple loud sound effect can frighten the viewer even more. This movie does a really good job at using this technique to terrify the viewer who's watching the film.<br/><br/>Having a low budget can really take a viewer out of the movie if the director is not thrifty. Poor scenery and effects can be a real withdrawer and it can kill immersion quickly. However, despite having such a minuscule budget, the effects and scenery looked top notch. The computers and the setup of Max's room that Max uses look convincing and realistic, and since there's so many machines around his apartment which look high-tech, it looks like a believable work station for something so complicated that he's doing. Also, the effects looked very good as well. They looked realistic for a low-budget film, and they still hold up today pretty well. It's a great trait for a director to be able to do so much with so little. That's exactly what Aronofsky did here, and by doing so, he proved that he was a talented director.<br/><br/>When some people watch a movie, they often like to kick back and relax. This movie doesn't let you. Sometimes, the movie can be hard to watch at times. It's not for everyone. Some people dislike Eraserhead for that reason. However, I love these kinds of films. I love the sprightly feelings that they evoke from the viewer. I feel like I can revisit them again and again, and every time I do so, they still impress me as much, if not, more than my first viewing."

"joerowling","1","1","3","24 February 2014"," terrible movie, just terrible...
","Wow, where to begin. Poor direction, terrible acting, lousy choices in set design... I could go on an on but I wont waste too much time, I wasted enough on this stupid film. While I'm not a mathematician or numerologist I am a smart man who has seen and studied many movies and styles of movies. As far as understanding the movie, there is little to worry about understanding the plot. There is very little information given to outline the plot, and very little plot. It's pretty simple, he is crazy. That doesn't mean he is not also brilliant, but assuredly he is a nut job. This matters little in the end as the story is fleeting and pointless. Now for the acting. The lead actor is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. His portrayal is labored and not believable. I can actually feel as though I can see Aronofsky off to the side saying ""OK now get a bit more frantic, and break that computer there! Now look kinda scared and confused..."" Ben Shenkman is actually redeemable and somewhat interesting, and Mark Margolis is a terrific actor and is the one actor who shines through. This is not nearly enough to make the film even remotely enjoyable. The woman and her goons that accost him randomly throughout the movie are some of the worst over the top actors I have ever seen, as is the little Asian girl. I don't enjoy bad mouthing a child actor (though she is a grown up by now at any rate) she was just so bad it's atrocious. Friends of mine (with whom I usually agree with when it comes to taste in movies) say this is the early version of requiem for a dream, supposedly requiem being the Hollywood ""money"" version. I must say I do not see this at all. Requiem is an amazing film, fantastic direction, acting, script, style etc. It is a strong film that shines a light on drug addiction, the pressure of adult life, actions, reactions and consequences. Pi is nothing like this, not even one tiny bit. It is a horrible mess of video and audio, it really does not deserve to be called a movie as it would signify that it has some kind of story and/or cohesion, which it absolutely lacks in every way. To be clear, I am not a hater of independent films or artistic films. I loathe Michael Bay and his ilk of directors. The fact is that good film making is just that, whether it is a low budget gem or a high budget Hollywood gold mine. I have no problem with black and white films either. That being said, filming low budget b/w film doesn't automatically make it deep and rich in texture. Much as you can't put $200,000,000 into a film and guarantee a blockbuster smash hit that gets great reviews, you can't shoot low budget and expect to make a great film based on almost no story and terrible acting."

","When you consider the title ""Pi"" you may think that it contains some mind blowing mathematical truth, but that is not the case here. This movie is more of a quest for a fantastic mathematical truth, and beside the correlation between the Fibonacci sequence and the Pythagoras ratio, which is not a complicated topic, there is no real mathematical subject at all.<br/><br/>Besides that, the movie is a thrilling and confusing quest of a genius to find the logic in the decimals of 'pi' and the pattern of the stock market, which leads him to the name of God. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this is not a scientifically, and mathematically challenging movie, as you might expect, but a thrilling and confusing action-fantasy which is still worth watching."

","Lately I have become a bigger fan of Aronofsky after seeing his great films like Black Swan, Requiem, and The Wrestler, so it was only fair that I would see his debut. It is a very interesting film, which I figured it would be. The first film that Pi automatically reminded me of was the debut from Lynch- Eraserhead. The worlds in which are created in the two films have the same sort of mood and tone, and if anything, this is a great feat for Aronofsky. The film is not hugely entertaining, and it is a hard film to love, but certainly hot hard to respect it. It is a hugely ambitious film with a lot of clever and unique ideas and scenes thrown in. It is also about the madness of a character, which Aronofsky's films always tend to be about. It works in a visceral level like most of his films, and it certain to warrant repeat viewings."

It seems that one cannot fully understand the world until one confronts death, in which case the entire essence of life will be revealed.<br/><br/>Several things stood out to me in the film. The close up ""functional"" shots were unique. Every time Max left his apartment, the audience saw him unlock all five deadbolts. Every time Max took his pills, we saw and heard them enter his mouth. The use of the subway, an intricate man-made machine, was a brilliant play within the dichotomy of order vs. chaos.<br/><br/>The best true contrast was between life and machine, which can best be seen in the insect shots. Ants and ant eggs continuously get caught up in the computer wires. The turning point of the film occurs when Max finally decides to allow the ant to live, in which point he discovers that the true meaning of life lies in the life itself.<br/><br/>This film will hold your interest from beginning to end."

When i was little, i thought that the mathematics don't give much to world and don't be necessary. Few years ago, i reflect of their importance in spite of my little interest for it. Max Cohen says for encouragement his rules and beliefs. The first one was ""Mathematics are the language of nature"", the second one ""All can be explain or understood by numbers"" and the third and last one was ""Nature has systems that can be represented"" Max Cohen is the famous math of ""Pi"". Max was obsessed with the idea of found the mystery that revealed Pi. He has an hypothesis about the order and the secret that was hidden behind the numbers of the stock. His brain don't have any other obsession than that. He maybe is so close of found the secret... but there is people who is interested in that secret too. But his obsession make that his brain, that have all the answers and ideas, suffer.<br/><br/>The topic of ""Pi"" sincerely rouses me. And I am still bad with the mathematics.

Both films invite you to think further. Would we ever be able to comprehend the laws determining our existence? Could all those patterns and formulas discovered by the scientists ever explain the logic of our lives? Or are they just building blocks, randomly tossed by the nature?

","As an aspiring filmmaker, I love Pi and I hate Pi at the same time. In my humble opinion, Pi went above and beyond the standards set by Hollywood today. I mean, I had to actually THINK while watching it. That may have actually turned people off to it.<br/><br/>So many movies today follow the same pattern where the good guys win at the end, either through unbeatable odds or through a great sacrifice made by the hero. (Armageddon, Private Ryan, etc) Pi doesn't follow that at all.<br/><br/>I loved Pi for its boldness, the camera work, the atmosphere set by the black and white film. Yet I hate it. Why? Pi was the kind of movie that I wanted to make. :)"
"toaster-8","9","1","3","6 April 1999"," mmmmm....grimy!
","Pi is the best (well, only) arthouse film I've ever seen (ignoring Eraserhead, as most people do).  Shot on grainy, grimy black and white with a kicking soundtrack, it's well worth seeing if you couldn't stomach Eraserhead.  To me, Lynch's debut seemed completely random, noisy, incomprehensible and just plain annoying after a while, watching it on tv I found myself pining for ad breaks.  Pi is similar, in that it has a strange, though nowhere near as strange as in Eraserhead, central character, it's shot entirely on (often over exposed) black and white and it has its moments of true surrealism (the person dripping blood on the subway platform and  the brain, which he poked), but this (thankfully) is where the similarities end.  I can't wait for the video release (although knowing the uk video distributors, there'll be about 6 copies available in the whole country, all in London)."

"Merlin-42","9","1","3","26 January 1999"," When faith becomes knowledge
","The stark black and white transparency film used to shoot this Sundance Festival winner facilitates the viewer's transition into the dream-like world where imagination, faith, and the search for scientific knowledge, all meet.   Once we have been absorbed into this nether world that lurks on the edge of ""normal"" reality, we are offered a 1990's version of the Faust legend in which the price of ultimate knowledge is not loss of one's immortal soul to the Devil, but loss of sanity or even life.  The presenting question is whether and what mathematical patterns govern our seemingly random existence, and the film suggests that there is a pattern even in the search for such knowledge --  as characters representing basic science, corporate power, and traditional religion, all demonstrate similar frightening (and equally ambiguous) behaviors in their different  approaches to knowledge.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws in the plot which demonstrate that we are witnessing the art of people who have more talent as young film makers than specific knowledge of either religion or science.  A research budget for the screenplay would have helped - but the movie was made  without money for such niceties.  The film's ability to raise serious questions about its subject matter even with these flaws is a testimony to its power.  We look forward to the future work of director, writer, Darren Aronofsky -- and writer, actor, Sean Gullette."

The black and white photography is in harmony with the paranoid, schizophrenic, claustrophobic mood of the movie. Sean Gullette is great as Maximillian Cohen and the rest of the cast is very good.

Both films use cutting, angles and b/w photography to create alternate realities very well. If Eraserhead presented the dreamscape of a nightmare, Pi presents an obsessional pyschosis.

A nice thing of watching inde films is getting away from the Hollywood equations for specific genres.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was a very good choice for the film.  The techno/trip-hop gives edginess to the film, and it compliments the theme of math and order of numbers.  I bought the soundtrack the next day.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent.  I think if the movie was in color, it would have taken away from the plot.  I don't know if the high contrast was intentional, but it was a great effect.  I was also very impressed with the non-standard use of the steadicam in Max's walking scenes.

"bhicks56","9","1","3","3 December 1999"," Guerrilla filmmaking of mathematic nightmare
","There are many scenes that I can't get out of my head from this very smart debut of Darren Aronofsky's. Most notably is when Maximillian (played by co-writer Sean Gullette) rips open his brain. Why? Don't let me get into it, you will have to see it for yourself. <br/><br/>I don't know how PI was thought up, but it's a dark, disturbing, and interesting creepy-crawly sort of brain stimulator. You don't have to be a math whiz to enjoy it (I am certainly not one) but at some moments it helps. This is almost a science fiction sort of thriller, in a socialistic way. You have to be a big thinker, like the main character, Max.<br/><br/>Max is a genius, he constantly computes equations given to him by a neighbor kid in the building he shuts himself in at. He is also a mentally tortured genius, obsessed with a number he tries to calculate with his homegrown computer. He is also a weirdo, who shaves his head after too many violent headaches, which may be caused by his abnormal gift (which may had come from staring at the sun when he was a child). Odd premise, eh?<br/><br/>But back to the number, which ultimately sets up the stage for the cyberkinetic noir/video-droned Hitchcockian thriller. The number is mythically the key to either the stock market or God. Either way, he is hunted down both by shady Wall Street henchmen and a gang of Rabbis (?) who desperately need him to compute the number for their great fortune. But Max believes he is the chosen one and searches for the numerical answer himself, even as it pulls him into an abysmal downward spiral of madness.<br/><br/>This movie is as weird as it gets. But screw traditionalism. This is one of the most thoroughly creative and oddly developed pieces of work in modern film."

","Until reading some of the reviews posted here, I must admit I had never thought of the ""Eraserhead"" comparison (you learn something new every day). The more I think about it now, the more the film seems like ""Eraserhead"" if Lynch had taken a rather large quantity of speed and a crash course in mathematics.  <br/><br/>Which is unfair.  In actuality, the film has little in common with ""Eraserhead""'s elegant cinematography and deliberate pace.  This movie is, above all, a portrait of obsession.  The ending is a bit too easy, but up until that point the film creates an utterly believable atmosphere of impending madness.  The grainy photography and hyperkinetic cutting are crucial.<br/><br/>Other than that, not too much more to say about this one.  An ""art house"" film it may be, but it's one of the more interesting ones I've seen in the past several years.  And to pass on a compliment to Aronofsky (paraphrasing Harry Crews), ""I'll certainly see the next thing you direct""."

"Ramy","9","1","3","31 August 1999"," Brilliant exploration of the paranoia and madness of genius
","""Pi"" is a gritty, dark, and engaging film that locks you into the experience of a genius teetering on the knife-edge of madness. ""Pi"" is not for every moviegoer, but those who love the look and feel of film noir, and those who enjoy films that exercise the mind as well as the imagination, will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The story is based on a mathematician's pursuit of the number pattern that holds the key to the stock market. His theory holds that all nature operates under immutable laws. These laws may be expressed numerically. The stock market is a natural, numerical entity. Therefore, the stock market operates under mathematically expressed laws of nature. By finding the key sequence within the stock market, he will prove his theory that all nature may be expressed numerically.<br/><br/>In his own words ""1. Mathematics is the language of nature. 2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers. 3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge. Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.""<br/><br/>The tension of his pursuit is palpable. This is a portrait of the Mad Genius character that transcends the cliche, redefining madness and genius as portrayed on screen. As he gets closer to his goal, his paranoia increases, as do his headaches (convulsive attacks resulting from childhood trauma) and hallucinations.<br/><br/>Adding to the madness are two groups interested in the hero's results. One group wants the key to the worldwide markets, while the other seeks the true name of God. Both need the hero's genius, but he needs them in fundamental ways as well: one for their technology, the other for their perspicacity.<br/><br/>Shot in black and white, the filmmakers succeed in their attempts to create visual tension in a frequently static world. At times the camera bobs and weaves along with the motion and sanity of the hero, enhancing the film. It is neither disorienting, nor distracting--unlike the mind-numbing camera motion in ""The Blair Witch Project.""<br/><br/>The music is best described as industrial-driven rhythm. The main titles feature a track by Massive Attack that musically expresses the anxiety, frustration, energy, and madness of the hero's pursuit. Just as the camera-motion sequences add to the film's impact, the music provides a perfect paranoiac aural soundtrack.<br/><br/>Mathematical references abound in the film, all of which are explained in their most basic form without being condescending. Greek theorists and the Japanese game Go are made relevant to the story. And the hero names his computer Enigma, after the legendary Nazi code broken at Bletchley Park during World War II.<br/><br/>The most glaring problem with the film was its predictable storyline. Within the context of the film the story is perfectly logical--what you would expect from a film based on a mathematician. It is, therefore, predictable. What mitigated this problem for me was my interest in the execution of the film. While I had a good idea what was going to happen, I was nevertheless happy to witness the events unfold. Credit the director with making the film engaging despite the problem with the script.<br/><br/>This film succeeded where ""Kafka"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" failed. It created tension, suspense, and drama without falling bring a one trick pony (Blair Witch) or falling into melodrama (Kafka)."
"Jocey","9","1","3","28 August 1999"," It's survival of the fittest, Max--and we've got the f%#@ing gun.
","First off, Pi is very much a ""love-it-or-hate-it"" kind of film. I loved it. For me, it was less about the number theory, and more about a base human emotion-paranoia. And, in that sense, the movie was extremely effective. The starkness of the black and white picture, the dizzying camera angles, the techno soundtrack all put the viewer smack in the middle of Max's paranoid world. Overall, this was a worthy effort from a young, first-time film maker. To borrow a phrase from a friend of mine: This may not have been the best film of '98, but it was one of my favorites. Now to my second point: After reading the posts of others who've seen Pi, I was disturbed, and rather offended by some of the oh-so-smug statements condemning people who enjoyed this movie to the status of pretentious, shallow, art-house morons who lacked the intelligence to see the scientific and mathematic flaws. People like that are just as heavy-handed, self-righteous, and annoying as people who accuse others who didn't like this movie (or others like it) of being to stupid to ""get it"". *Attention* Pi is a work of fiction, NOT a documentary. I, for one, do not walk into a fictional movie expecting to get a completely accurate account."

When he comes upon some soft ware that contains a formula for doing so,he is pursued by government goons & Hasidic Rabbi's who want a piece of his knowledge. Combined by all of that stress,coupled with his drug addiction (to prescription medications),the mathematician manages to obsess over numbers & their connection to all things in nature.

","A personal favourite director, and certainly in my books as one of the most talented and important directors of our modern age, Aronofsky here delivers a film for the mind, powerful to all the senses and absolutely interesting in every respect.<br/><br/>I have to confess to being a patterns and numbers enthusiast myself, although not as obsessed as Pi's main character Max, I do find the science and philosophy of mathematics to be highly intriguing. So when I heard of this film after seeing the brilliant ""Requiem for a Dream"", I decided I would have to see it soon. So tonight was that time, and I have to say, I was right! I loved the movie from beginning to end and was taken into Max's world as if it was my own, with all the parallels intact.<br/><br/>Not only this, but I love black and white photography and sure enough, it does look gorgeous in Pi. However I couldn't help but draw comparisons from this choice of shooting by Aronofsky, to the actual themes of the movie itself. In a way, the black and white photography enhances the themes throughout, representing the strict system of shade and movement of light in a way we don't normally see through our eyes. At one point in the film Max describes being blinded by the sun and for a small moment actually seeing things as they are and being to understand them.<br/><br/>Performances from the entire cast were fantastic with special mention to Gullette: someone whom I have undeservedly not heard of at all. And as always, Aronofsky directs and writes to an amazingly high standard, creating interesting fleshed-out characters and a highly intelligent, thought provoking story that just begs to be re-watched over and over.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this film is not for everyone. However, if you are a fan of the director, mathematics or any philosophical films made for thought- this one is a must-see. As for me, I absolutely adored it: It was definitely an instant favourite and a film that will stay with me for quite some time."

I can't back up that all of the mathematical stuff in the movie is correct, but it does make you think about some mathematical code for life, which many physicists and mathemeticians have been trying to find at least part of.

","""When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so when I was six I did""<br/><br/>So what ""A Beautiful Mind"" got Academy Awards? I don't trust collegiate societies anyway. Besides, even if it WAS based on a true story, Russel Crowe will never get my vote for acting. His method acting style really, really gives me the creeps. Well, then, where might my curiosity of the mathematics and sciences lead me? What's interesting about arduous code-breaking anyway? It must be Arronofsky's fault that I'm asking so many questions. I have a theory that if you receive an answer, it's kind of like potato chips, you can't stop grabbing for more. Speaking of chips, I'm still confused about his first movie. Either the ming mecca chip was responsible for the atrocities of man, or Max Cohen. Reminding me of the age-old question, what came first; the chicken or the egg?<br/><br/>Questions may seem arbitrary if you don't truly receive any tangible answers. But that doesn't stop physicists from quantifying electrons! And it definitely shouldn't stop your enjoyment of ""Pi"". From beginning to end. But the scratchy camera-work and ear-popping soundtrack may scare off the newbies, teenyboppers, and elderly. Well, I personally won't be missing them that much. I like my art the way I like sex, hard to get most of the time, and usually fulfilling for only half of us.<br/><br/>If rumors are true, this may be your one chance in cinema history to watch a real live brain be penetrated by a pencil tip. But, goodness gracious, that's not saying much after you see the finale! I have to say, there's been a lot more surprising endings to movies that I've seen, but I'm hard-pressed to think of one more appropriate.<br/><br/>""Eureka, I have found it!""<br/><br/>In all seriousness, ""The Blair Witch Project"" really did what no other film had done. Made millions with thousands. ""Pi"" was, too, on a shoestring budget. The similarities don't stop there. As mentioned before, the camera-work is really nerve-wracking. It's scary, and there are very few namebrand actors in the film. By the way, Marcy Dawson, the stock market recruiter, would be my own personal definition of witch. Not to be misleading, however, while the former had us lost deep in the woods This movie is just DEEP.<br/><br/>Based on a concept that many major thinkers have always suspected and strived to decipher, ""Pi"" is not afraid to break boundaries of any type. The idea is repeated many, many times through the film, in the exact same consecutive phrases leading to the conclusion that there is a certain code in nature that if broken would lead to enlightenment. Well, alright, I take back what I said earlier about redundancy in code-breaking. Kind of. You see, Max Cohen is trying to find the big one. But he's not the only one. Count the badguys in this film and you'll be left wondering why he even bothers. You'd think that the answer to life itself would be more readily shared with the public in today's age of mass communication. On the contrary, we find that greed does indeed outdo a do-gooder.<br/><br/>Hidden deeper, though, the truth that Max Cohen may actually be the wrong guy to try is inevitable. After all, we had dudes in the past who claimed enlightenment. One was hung to death, one disappeared in a forest, and one, well, reportedly ""prayer-dueled"" himself to death. Look at the number of digits he seems to be so attached to. 216 = 6x6x_ . I'll let you fill in the blank. Use a calculator if you have to, I won't consider it cheating.<br/><br/>Despite the scratchiness, the camera lens never seems to do anything unnecessary. In fact, this may be the beginning of a new age of film-making and we never even knew it. Matthew Libatique and Darren Arronofsky (who also wrote the of course ingenious script) are claimed to have invented the technique of the ""hip hop montage"" in cinema. In which the score (brilliantly executed by Clint Mansell) guides the viewer through a series of moving frames. The acting is superb on every count. Even the little girl next door seems to take on some sort of magic, emphasized by her last question to Max as he descends down the stairwell of the project building they share together. 748 divided by 238. Well, it's close, at least.<br/><br/>Hands down one of the most thought-provoking films of all time, ""Pi"" deserved every Oscar nomination that ""A Beautiful Mind"" gained later. But it's okay, Russel Crowe may have stolen the University, but Sean Guillette still holds the Universe.<br/><br/>Something's going on. It has to do with that number. There's an answer in that number.<br/><br/>""Pi"" (1998) 10/10"

","It is an excellent movie. I, myself was not so fond of mathematics. I am into physics. But now, this movie has altered my views towards mathematics and I am into mathematics now. So I recommend this movie for those who want to know something more about the magic of mathematics.The pure simplicity of a problem.It is absolutely amazing.If you can show me materials on this subject (the subject of this movie) feel free to contact me. Thank you. I'd also give a special thanks to the author of the movie, the director and the whole cast. Now, more about the movie. The things mentioned, are things we take for granted. The moving of the flushed toilet water, the cream in the coffee, the snail, smoke, DNA,rotation of the Earth,the Sun around our galaxy, the shape of our galaxy, and one can consider the whole shape of the Universe.So for those who often have brain waves you are about to witness a totally new perspective toward life after watching this movie. You thought you knew, you thought you understood. No dear friends. The Universe is not only the Big Bang, not only the rotation of the planets, the birth and death of stars, it is about unity,perfection thru the mathematical formula. It may seem that is chaos, but if it was, the physical laws would forbid it."

","yes I gave this a 10 out of 10, it's that good. I write this because I am annoyed with people complaining that this film tries to hard to be arty, intellectual and deep. And that comment from this guy about people telling him this is their favorite movie are pompous wannabe-intellictuals is just ridiculous. Has it ever occurred to you, little man.. .that those people might actually be intellectuals, or at the very least looking for intellectually challenging film? I know what ticks you off.. is all the pseudo-intellectuals acting like they like this, just because that's what all their hippie poetryslam friends do. That's a problem with those people... not this movie. Good enough with negativity.. why is this film so good? What makes this film good is that it's very, very low budget yet makes no compromise at all. From the onset it's clear that this movie is heavy and clearly not intended for those looking for light entertainment. It sticks to it's roots, it doesn't try to lure in big crowds by using some subculture hype or whatever. Once again... if you are into easier films.. great (me too), but don't look for this one.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna spoil the story, because this film is way better if you don't know where it's going. But i'll tell you what I liked most about it. The soundtrack is an integral part of the story, it functions as a representation of the brainwaves of the main character or something like it, that's just genius. Also the film brings a real sense of paranoia with minimal means (making you even more paranoid) and no matter what your view on the relation between mathematics, strange theories, religion is, it will change the way you think about it.<br/><br/>if you like challenging movies, can stand heavy endings, have the capacity to grasp all the subjects it implicitly touches upon, you can not go wrong. The film itself is pretty minimal and not everything is explained to the viewer and at the end of the story it lets you make your own conclusions. To me this movie shows the essence of religion 10 times better than the passion of the Christ did and it took me from being a full-on atheist to doubting and restating my views..."

","Darren Aronofsky burst onto the independent film-making scene with his acclaimed science fiction thriller/drama ""Pi"" that follows the work of a paranoid and reclusive mathematician as he tries to identify intrical patterns in the most ordered form of chaos: the stock market. As Max (Sean Gullete) edges closer to his goal, a radical Wall street firm pursues him for secrets that will gain them financial domination and a ruthless Kabbala sect entices him to decipher codes hidden in their ancient texts that could help them answer the question asked for thousands of years.<br/><br/>Aronofsky has successfully crafted a thoroughly dark and interesting film that transcends beyond the restrictions of its low budget. Aronofsky's script and direction draws the audience straight into the haunted mind of a brilliant mathematician."

","Before watching Pi, I had already watched Requiem for a Dream and enjoyed it thoroughly. Pi had all of the components of Requiem that I had appreciated, minus the gritty and disturbing plot. Pi sucked me in from the beginning. The movie did not revolve around the plot, but rather the plot was just one of the many components of the film (along with the cinematography, music, etc.) While some people may say that the plot didn't make sense or was stupid, I disagree. I found the Kabballah (Jewish mysticism) aspect of the film very interesting. I felt that all of these pieces worked together perfectly to create a 1.5 hour work of art. I'm not always into ""artsy"" movies, but I highly recommend Pi."

Being that he is unfortunately skilled in such amazing mathematical ways, he naturally takes on a job in numerology, trying to find a pattern --a perfect number-- to predict the way the stock market will move.<br/><br/>Two different organizations are after that number as well, as it promises great power and wealth for both in their own ways. When Max catches on to the pattern, which he and his friend Sol had determined to be a simple bug, all hell breaks loose in Max's life.<br/><br/>The visuals and symbolism in this film are striking. One truly needs to watch it multiple times as it is an extraordinary film with more symbolism than you can shake a calculator at. Every touching frame and every stunning image leads up to Pi's dramatic and climactic ending which is bound to have you running to call your friends in shock of it all.<br/><br/>If there was ever a perfect film, I think I've found it."

","I hadn't ever heard of this movie when I rented it, but I'm darn glad I did! Darren Aronofsky is as talented as any filmmaker out there today. Do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible. The use of the camera is of special import in this movie, and is reminiscent of a cross between Sam Raimis' earlier work and the works of Roman Polanski. Aronofsky has a distinct visual style and a love for weird montage pieces. However, as great as this movie is, if you do not like experimental films that tend to challenge the viewer to make sense of it, rather than a neatly laid out and well explained plot, you more than likely will not enjoy it. On a $60,000 budget, Darren has made a lasting impression on the film world that will not soon be forgotten.<br/><br/>P.S. This movie has some of the greatest voice-over monologues ever! Enjoy!"

Just because it isn't dedicated towards the 'Varsity Blues' crowd doesn't mean it's automatically a bad film....<br/><br/>Pi is one of those movies that does something that any good book makes it's reader do -- THINK.  It makes you wonder about society, feeling sorry for the real people out there who are stuck being that smart.  Sure, not every genius has strange flashbacks and is addicted to solving math problems, but some [probably] do.  It also makes you realize that some people take their obsessions (math, religion, et cetera) WAY too far.<br/><br/>I think everyone should rent it.  I'm not saying that everyone will enjoy it, but I still feel that even throwing it in for five minutes will make a person think about it.  (Even if they're only thinking 'God this sucks...' at least they're thinking.)

While on the surface it appears to be a mathematical story, it truly captures the struggle between genius and madness. When watching the film, you can feel Cohen's headaches yourself. It does a great job of making its viewers uncomfortable at the mere sight of Cohen's pain.<br/><br/>This is truly an exceptional achievement in filmmaking, and it should not be missed.<br/><br/>Be warned though.

With each passing moment the intense electronica soundscape drags the viewer closer and closer to the insanity that Max Benson begins to feel more and more deeply throughout the film. This is a truly interactive piece of art where the viewer must work equally hard to understand the events and their place in the story. The film is about distraction, truth, religion, culture, greed; you name it, it's in there. It is visual representation at it's current high, both technically and creatively.

Parts that seem useless or pointless (""When I was young my mom told me not to stare into the sun, so once when I was 6, I did"") make complete sense when viewed with the rest of the movie. The movie also has rather deep religious implications, teaching order instead of chaos. This movie will have you thinking for long after you see it. At first you may not ""get it"", but once you look at the ""big picture"" it all becomes clear. The directing is great, and adds some tension in some parts.

The overexposed film (which appears to be 8mm mostly) creates an environment for the viewer which mirrors the protagonist's own view of the world. The soundtrack includes very cool songs, and the music in the migraine scene actually gives the audience insight into what a truly severe migraine headache is like. The insights explored in the 84 minutes will linger in the back of your mind for days.

","I was really taken with this film. Everything about it appealed to me, the intriguing plot, the camera work, the high-contrast black and white, and the music (wow, the music). The most everyday situations were somehow full of menace, and ordinary people seemed malevolent. This movie makes you experience the paranoia of the main character from the inside. The music was incredible, featuring some great electronic bands. There were songs I recognized, but they were blended perfectly into the score, so that the whole movie had a constant flow, rising and falling in intensity with the action (and sometimes stopping so abruptly it makes you jump). Some of the other comments here criticize the movie on the basis that the ""science"" behind the theme (psychology and mathematics) is flawed, but if it were based in fact, explaining real, known theorems, it would lose its mystery. The great thing about movies is that they allow us to escape from mundane reality. Until someone makes a documentary this cool, I'll take the flawed logic any day."
"studydna","10","1","4","27 March 1999"," An interesting and thought-provoking dichotomy of genius and mania.
","I found Pi to be excellent.  Some may criticize the science behind the premise of the movie, as well as its execution.  Although the pace and timbre of the movie is frenetic, and at times disjointed, one might argue that this most closely mirrors the mood of the main character and is therefore intentional (and not just careless editing/cinematography, and so on).<br/><br/>The most salient concepts of the movie are based in scientific fact. There does indeed exist a subset of numbers that manifests itself in the design of living organisms throughout the phylogenetic map.  From the nautilus shell to the honeycombs in beehives; from probability functions of electron orbitals to the structure and function of nucleic acids, a pattern of physical parameters converge and share a common thread- mainly that such designs might be explained in terms of their common mathematical attributes.<br/><br/>
Maximillian Cohen is an obviously gifted man- an brilliant but eccentric mathematical genius whose intellect is rivaled only by the pervasiveness of his 'demons' (mainly his obsessive, unabashed desire to find a unifying theory grounded in the pure logic of numbers).  At the same time, he is plagued by serious physical and emotional symptoms.  This theme is neither novel nor purely fictional; many examples come to mind with even a cursory review of history (Van Gogh, Dostoyevsky, Newton, Galois, and the like). All these individuals were considered great intellects while at the same time were beleaguered by clusters of physical and psychological problems, hence the schism of intellect and affect.<br/><br/>
Some criticize the film for its portrayal of Max's physiological symptoms, but from a medical perspective, not only are these symptoms accurate (delusions and hallucinations indicative of temporal lobe epilepsy, also migraines and epistaxis indicative of excessive cerebral vasodilation), but they also serve to explain the reasons for the director's choice of striking (and, at times, disturbing) visual effects.  This mitigates the choice of camera angles and shots and serves as a window to Max's consciousness.<br/><br/>Mathematicians might not be satisfied with the paucity of details relevant to the mechanics of the thesis (calculus, chaos mathematics, analytical geometry, and set theory), and non-mathematicians unfamiliar with the concepts behind the thesis might argue that the intent is to glamorize the subject by taking liberties with the science of mathematics.  However, in my own opinion, the film strikes a balance that allows both groups to catch a glimpse of the man behind the math, as well as the depth of his afflictions.<br/><br/>While dark and brooding, the cinematography perfectly complements Max's descent into madness.  With deeper understanding of a unifying theory of nature comes the heightened realization that such information is in great demand, and those wishing to possess this information are obviously willing to do whatever it takes to get it.  The result is a dizzying, and at times, terrifying glimpse into the world of chaos.<br/><br/>I think that the film is astounding.  Rarely have I seen such an intriguing, intelligent attempt at making the science of mathematics interesting.  You may love it, like I did, or you may hate it.  But there's one conclusion that nearly everyone will share: it will make you THINK."

","Wow, this movie is such an interesting opus, the plot is intriguing, the cinematography is outstanding, the directing is flawless, and even the seemingly strange ""headache"" scenes have so much to say.  In a time when most movies give you a cut and dried explanation of what is happening, it's nice to see a movie that is less than forthright and lends itself to interpretation.  If you don't want to be confused or surprised, this is not the movie for you, but if you are looking for something intelligent to ponder, give Pi a chance."

He could so easily have ended up in a mere supporting role for a swirling cup of coffee or seashell, yet instead links all the disparate elements together, to truly make Pi the story of one man.

","I laughed at someones review mentioning humourously about ""Indie film positive discimination"", I expected loads of that on here but too my surprise there isn't that much. Aronofsky may be a ""one off"", his contribution to film with ""Pi"" is pretty unique. ""Pi"" may be a bit too arty at times with brains being stabbed with pens on subways etc. I think I got the metaphors but it was sheer brilliance without them. I think the point about the maths (and the story) that some people may have missed was that this underlying number as an answer to everything in the universe to explain ""chaos"" was not a possible clean and logical mathematical conclusion but more a divine and holy number that mortals should never be allowed to know. Max Cohen found himself for example predicting the wall St. Stock prices for no apparent mathematical reason. He had found something special in the 216 digit number that went beyond calculus and into the spiritual realms of ""Lenny Meyer's"" true name for God and another power this number held. A brilliant piece of writing where everything was referenced to the point of being believable. It's also the first time I've liked Drum+bass music, pretty cool sound track. Top film and Sean Gullette brilliant. (Should confound a few theologans as well as number theorists)."

To make it short, I'll just give my interpretation of the ending. <br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS!:<br/><br/>The ending of ""Pi"" is not great simply because of its use of metaphors, but because these metaphors had been a major theme throughout the movie and the ending is the perfect climax to this progressing film.<br/><br/>
1.) The scene directly preceding Max's discovery shows him wandering the crowded streets. This is a metaphor linked to the Archimedes metaphor used by his mentor. Archimedes could not come up with a conclusion because he needed perspective - taking a bath in this case. Both Archimedes and Max were reclusive types who needed to ""take a step back"" in order to solve their problem. Thus, Max had to get outside, and take a walk. Although he had been outside previously, never had he for the immense amount of time in this scene - hours and hours. Yet this is only elliptically stated. The scene is in fast motion and loud music somewhat distorts Max's words. Max is repeating times. He spent nearly half a day walking around, though the scene lasted only seconds. This new perspective for the hermit Max allows him to reach pi.  <br/><br/>2.) Max then finds Pi or ""god"" (look up TOE, Theory Of Everything if interested in the metaphysical underpinnings). During this discovery, he starts blurting out random numbers, a reference to earlier scenes in which the computer had discovered pi and spit out the 216 digit number. Thus, just as the computer had been, Max became completely aware of nature and conscious of himself. <br/><br/>3.) Upon his discovery, Max finds himself in a blank white world. There is nothing there. Ultimately, I don't think this means that there is no ""god,"" but that it is completely void of meaning and inhumane. The void is illustrated by showing Max evaporating into the backdrop. He realizes the importance of human interaction when a flash of caressing hands are flashed into his world of whiteness. When he comes out, he is further caressed by an unseen women - most likely his neighbor. Whiteness and woman-ness are used to illustrate the emptiness and mathematical sterility of pi.<br/><br/>
4.) Consequently, Max takes a drill to his head. A metaphor attempting to show that the search for pi is self-destructive is interwoven throughout the film: his mentor has a stroke when he continues his research on pi, Max had dreams about destroying brains after his near-pi encounters, and the fact that medicine is needed to combat the affects of said near-pi encounters. It is only in the final scene that Max realizes this, forgoes his medicine, and finally finds pi. Afterwards, the drilling represents the unwantedness of searching for pi because of its self-destruction and ultimate meaninglessness to humans. <br/><br/>5.) Finally, in the end Max has given up his searching, and can finally live life. He can't answer the little girl's math questings anymore and has no need to constantly repeat his theory to himself. The movie ends with him smiling. He had never smiled throughout the entire film, and moreso, had never ever seemed to be emotionally indifferent - he was always anxious and easily disturbed. The smile is a powerful piece of imagery that puts a final stamp on a great film."
"Katmiss","10","1","4","27 April 2001"," FINALLY! A REAL THRILLER!
","""Pi"" the dazzling and bleak debut feature from Darren Aronofsky, refers to that unending number that is often rounded out to 3.14 and is used in algebra classes around the world.<br/><br/>But this isn't a math movie. I think the best way to look at this film is that it is about obsession. The main character is so obsessed with finding the real number, which is believed to be infinite, that the film is a study of obsession and madness.<br/><br/>But I don't want to give away the plot and spoil Aronofsky's nice surprises. I do want to say that I think it's amazing that ""Pi"" is able to be such an effective thriller without resorting to the usual T&A and standard shoot-em-up chases. The grainy black and white photography only adds to the feel of a lonely guy's world.<br/><br/>Some people complain that ""Pi"" contains no big stars. I think that big stars would have hurt the film. Honestly, can you imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sly Stallone or Mel Gibson trying to find out what exactly is Pi? Unknowns only make this more believable. <br/><br/>See ""Pi"" more than once. It may take some more than a few viewings to fully understand it. But at least Aronofsky has some good ideas and is content to make a muddled film rather than a neat, contrived one. ""Pi"" was one of 1998's best films.<br/><br/>**** out of 4 stars"

","I hate to sound arrogant and pretentious, but I'll say it:""If you did not like this movie you didn't think hard enough!"" Even if unfamiliar with the philosophical underpinnings, there are a plethora of other reasons do like this movie. Namely, the soundtrack, the metaphors, the emotion, the screen shots, and probably the best ending I've ever seen. Basically, if you see this movie once, you'll be confused, but confusion is too often used as an license to criticize. I wrote a paper about this entitled ""Aronofsky's Duality as Nihilistic."""

","Pi is a deeply moving psychological analysis of an obsessed man.  It shows what can happen to someone who is utterly fascinated and beyond control. Max cannot break away from his obsession.  The entire film is underlied with this basic presumption.  Although other plot elements are indeed interesting, the movie is, above all, a character analysis.<br/><br/>In addition, those who are interested in math but do not understand it will enjoy the small ""vignettes"" the movie presents throughout that explain all of the basic concepts involved.  To find a movie this fresh and interesting among the hordes of blood/action/violence flicks on nowadays is rare. The movie is fantastic."

","Pi is one of the most fascinating intellectual thrillers I've seen. I love the black-and-white, high contrast film it was shot on - it lends an amazingly intensity to a film that's already wound about as tight as you can get. The imagery and cinematography are also excellent, shaping the film around the jagged script. Some people won't understand this film or be able to appreciate the characters through the often bizarre, broken scenes - if you let the movie unfold and try to keep up, it reveals itself as a marvelous independent project."

","Pi is one of those movies that is so powerful, that it once it is over, you just sit there in your seat in thought.  It's incredible.  You sit there and you realize that this director has such a powerful voice, and is such a genius, that he will never be accepted by hollywood or the mainstream cinema in general.  The story is moving, and no matter how you are socialized, you can still relate to its main character, Maximillian Cohen.  The music is beautifully mixed by Clint Mansell (who has now done the score for Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's next film).<br/><br/>Pi's genius cannot really be explained to someone who hasn't seen the film. It touches souch dark parts of your mind that you instantly respect Darren Aronofsky's daringness and intelligence.<br/><br/>Pi is about so much more than a genius trying to find a pattern in nature. It is about understanding what really matters."

","A very unique black and white art film. Actually it was pretty messed up (similar to Pink Floyd: The Wall and A Clockwork Orange), but the story was extremely well thought out and the editing was extraordinary. Plus, there was a song from my favorite techno group, Orbital (they have done other movie work as well, most notably for Event Horizon). The direction was spectacular, considering the apparent budget of the movie, and the acting was fairly perfect for the characters. Surprisingly neat visual effects as well. Even the score ruled for the movie (you can hear some of the original score on the web site). A rather interesting story about a mathematician who is on the verge of discovering the numerical equivalent for the name of God. Highly recommended for those who enjoy intellectual movies."

","This film caught me completely by surprise last year, i went to see it because my parents were going and i thought i might as well as i had nothing better to do. What i saw from the first moment up until the last was wonderful, Pi was the only film i had seen a the cinema twice. Complex and almost fit inducing (with all the flashing lights) Pi was actually quite easy to follow. This film is true science fiction - not just an elaborate fairy tale set in space or some war film (also set in space). This is sci fi for the brain, not sci fi for the popcorn and hot-dog fraternity. It may be full of number patterns and maths but you don't have to be a genius to consider it in such a way (my simple friend loved it and she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer). Watch it, buy it, do whatever you can to see it - this film is magnificent, so all those that went on about the Matrix last year will finally be able to see what can be done with a small budget and big ideas (rather than a budget so big that the ideas aren't explored enough). PI PI PI PI PI.....sorry i loved it so much that i keep having to say the words. I wrote an essay for my film course about the use of sound in the film and got an A, i'm not the best of students but it brought out the best in me.<br/><br/>Fans of The Matrix should love it, though i hated that film (but only because i loved this one so much) and fans of dark comic books would probably get a thrill from it as well.

The score and the strange camera work sucked me right into Pi, following the protagonist Max. He stumbles slowly at first towards insanity but gains more and more pace. This is shown in rather disturbing images that really got me hooked on this movie. The scientific part isn't very important for me, it just suits the story.

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","5","24 June 2011"," A disturbing series of levels of metaphysical greatness tending to perfection ...
","IRRationality.<br/><br/>And complexity.<br/><br/>THIS is Pi.<br/><br/>This is the number Pi.<br/><br/>AND THis also applies to the movie ""Pi"".<br/><br/>A MASTERPIece moving the vision of the world to extraordinary levels of abstraction.<br/><br/>GAlileo once said Mathematics was the language with which God has written the universe. Is this a hypothesis or a statement? <br/><br/>IN FACT, a fundamental assumption, in the tormented mind of the math genius Max Cohen, no doubt that the mysteries of life and universe are all governed by the perfect harmony of mathematical patterns.<br/><br/>AND THis perfection inhabiting the mathematical universe is Max's Holy Grail, the key of the ultimate knowledge, the eradication of this torturing and tormenting pain illustrated by a dizzying fast-paced editing, oscillating between harmonic and logical movements and the constant anguish of a man, trapped in his superior cerebral condition, a blessing and a doom.<br/><br/>BUT the grainy, shaky, black and white cinematography with that high contrast, conveys in an extremely efficient way the nightmarish aspect of this quest for mathematical perfection. ""Pi"" carries the roots, square and weird, of what will constitute the thematic core of Darren Aronofsky's films: physical sufferance, passion that tends to addiction, and addiction as an increasing series of terms that converges to alienation, and in the most extreme cases : death. Life is a convergent sequence with a mortal limit, our painful limitation. The key rhymes with infinity.<br/><br/>INFINity is whatever transcends our human condition, as an entity not defined by the normal rules but something higher, more abstract, unreachable, God-like  the ideal entity that doesn't obey to quantitative rules, whether it's infinite or infinitesimal, the true essence of mathematics. Only an infinite language could have written a universe distinctive by its infinity, Galileo was right, and what Max wants to define is the law that governs the universe, infinity can be defined if not be reached, and there must a pattern that defines the language God wanted to use, that knows the verity about God, His secret  Max's quest transcends the mathematical world to a greater metaphysical level. Is Max Cohen the chosen one among the chosen people? The messenger of God with constant harassment as spiritual persecution? Is he 'Mad Max'? Or 'The Man who Knew Too Much'? <br/><br/>THE PARANoid feeling grows with the sentiment that Max is getting closer to the truth, the universal truth about the supreme mathematical pattern, the Goddess  the one that regulates the ratings in Wall Street or the perfect natural harmonies, the one that kills off the very notion of hazard. There is no hazard, everything is under the control of a perfect and omnipresent law, the perfect law. The perfect law like the perfect ration incarnated by the iconic golden number, you know, that 'theta' you can find everywhere, in architecture, painting, and even in the natural aesthetics of human proportions, the golden ratio as the universal law, the universal incarnation of beauty and perfection illustrated by the golden spiral as the universal movement. The world is a perpetual movement from an infinitesimal start to infinity, whether you find in a sea shell or in the Milky Way. And the paranoia is like a visual demonstration of Max's hypothesis as the very pattern that drives the movie in a self-reflexive way, from a simple quest for knowledge, Max takes a vertiginous tour where he's followed by a big Wall Street firm, a group of Hasidic rabbis, going from a math genius, to a dangerous mind until becoming God's revelation. Max's fate goes out of proportions in a spiral that seems to go unlimited with the core is still poor Max's agonizing head  <br/><br/>THE MOVIE Transports us into the nightmarish journey of a man whose obsessive quest for perfection highlights its own futility. Indeed, in a dirty, rotten world, made of impurity, of lies, greed, mediocrity, whatever perfection means, no one human enough to desire would deserve it, not even Max. Max is intelligent, but his intelligence is obviously limited. Take any epsilon, whatever level of intelligence Max's head can elevate itself to, you'll have one level above which the absolute value of the difference between Max's intelligence and its own limitation will be smaller than this epsilon, the drill in the end is that epsilon, and the conclusion is the limitation, eyes can't face sun nor death, said a French philosopher, Max's eyes did both. But Max is only a human and the beauty of mathematic relies sometimes in its irrationality and Max's triumph relies on the recognition of his weakness. If you ask why the movie was titled ""Pi"" instead of ""theta"", the golden ratio, well just think of Pi as the incarnation of the irrational number, an idea of perfection that can't be defined through a pattern. Pi is math's infinity and Max's limitation, Pi is Max's truth and the very demonstration that mathematics are superior, no matter what, and this is why, on a more personal level, I always loved mathematics as the universe that can only be defined by its own rules, a world of perfect harmony and total complexity. Remember in the beginning, I described ""Pi"" as a complex film, it is indeed less in the semantic than the mathematical meaning of the word. ""Pi"" contains a real and an imaginary part, like in any Aronofsky's film that portrays with a tremendous genius, the impact of our fantasies and our inner fears on our everyday lives. ""Pi"" is Darren's debut predicting his iconic trademarks, where our subconscious affects our body, incapable of transcending its physical trap venting its anger on that same body responsible of so much pain, so much limitation. Mathematics are the cause and the solution of the torment, but like God, they're too perfect to be reached, you can tend to, but never touch them. I love maths, I love cinema, I could not not love Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece ""Pi"""

","A strange black and white movie about a mathematician who believes everything in nature is mathematical and patternable, including the Stock Exchange.

The result is explosive and of course proves what is supposed to be proved, viz. the vanity of mathematics and mathematicians. A film that is interesting only to those who have a certain amount of scientific and technological orientation. And from the very start it is shown as a disease that is the result of the illumination you get when you penetrate some mathematical secret: the same as when you watch the sun, which makes you blind at first and then leaves you with severe headaches when the blindness recedes. In other words a film that orients you rather towards the graceful and slow spiritual dancing of the Chinese in China town.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

Imagine my disappointment when the movie ended, and I hadn't a clue as to what it was even about, not to mention the ""deeper meaning"" it probably had.  The movie aimlessly drifts from what we are supposed to see as reality, to what we are supposed to see as the main character's delusions, often putting him into situations that make no sense, such as a subway station chasing down a bleeding man, and seeing his brain on the ground.

He is befriended by another young man who is part of a mystical Jewish cult that thinks Max has something they want - nothing less than the name of God.

","I didn't really want to review this film as there's not a great deal to say about it that people haven't already. Darren Aronofsky's debut film is a bizarre, surreal, intelligent, paranoia fuelled film about a mathematician who's trying to uncover the patterns of the universe.<br/><br/>The main reason I wanted to talk about this film, is that Clint Mansell's incredible score is in my opinion one of the best scores I've heard in any film. It's an expertly constructed piece of work that helps to elevate every aspect of this film. The score is perfectly intertwined with the central character of the film, and works as his inner monologue to reflect his different mental states throughout the film. From being eerie to panic ridden to sheer mania it's a bold piece of work. That when I found myself drifting from the film it was the score that kept sucking me back in with it's intoxicating atmosphere.<br/><br/>The film on the whole is pretty good, but without the score I don't think this film would've worked nearly as well as it did. I would recommend watching this film for the soundtrack alone."

He is also hounded by Marcy Dawson from a powerful financial consortium. They offer him a supercomputer chip. The computer outputs a number and everybody wants it.<br/><br/>This is a debut from Darren Aronofsky with great originality. It has great paranoid thriller vibe. The music, the style, and Max all build a great obsessive mood. There are some things to nit-pick. The camera work is strictly indie. The action scenes are a little dizzying and not in a good way. It's unlikely that Aronofsky had the equipment to do better although some low-budget indies do better somehow. The acting from some of the secondary characters could also be better. They are all understandable indie deficiencies."

Of course, he is guided by his old wise mentor who practices his mathematical algorithms in the seemingly simple but very complex game of Go.<br/><br/>As an indie film, it doesn't have grand locales, CGI or big-budget action, which is a good thing.

Especially when it is possible to make clear colour-scenes now a days, also in 1998. Is this what bad directors do, to cover their incompetence, and cheat all the upper-class snobbish reviewers, who think that everything that is different from Hollywood-movies are great movies? I also get tired of Hollywood-movies - but there are also other bad movies, than the tedious stuff from Hollywood. Alone this drag the movie several stars down: DON'T MAKE BLACK-WHITE MOVIES WHEN COLOURS ARE INVENTED! And especially not as blurred and unclear as this. I can't barely see what happens in this movie, because everything is so dark and blurred.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the story is also quite dull. It seems very interesting at first sight. But if you - as me - are patient enough to go through the entire movie, you will find yourself after the movie thinking: what's the point of this? What's the conclusion? What are this movie trying to tell me?<br/><br/>I will go down to the movie store, sell my DVD-copy, and buy an other movie instead."

","I've seen this film 3 times now: the first time, as it first came out, was an absolute trip of an experience (I may have been somewhat under the influence myself). It was very enjoyable, but I understood next to nothing.<br/><br/>Couple of years later I saw another Aronofsky: Requiem for a Dream. As the fella shares my first name (although relatively common, it's somehow rarely seen in the arts) I was all up for supporting his second film. Alas, it was trash, saved from a dustbin score only by how well-made it was technically, and mostly by Ellen Burstyn's stunning performance. 5/10 in the end.<br/><br/>Disappointed, I returned to Pi to find out if the hash was to blame for my enjoying it. Turns out not, I still really liked it, and this time followed some more of the story, tho' still felt slightly bewildered.<br/><br/>In the intervening 10 years or so I've seen The Fountain which was a boring pretentious fart of a movie, not redeemed by the interesting visuals (3/10). Now just recently decided on a third watch of Pi, and this time I understood the whole film: the concept, ideas, narrative...it's so clear now! Reminds me very much of my experiences reading (and re-reading) Zamyatin's We. Any work of art which reveals more of itself over time is worth something special.<br/><br/>Throughout all 3 watches Pi remained an excellent 9/10 experience. Best not to tell you anything about the story or characters, just that the:<br/><br/><ul><li>acting is superb.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>direction is dynamic and exciting.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>high-contrast black/white is extremely effective.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>use of sound is excellent.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>concept is satisfyingly high-end.</li></ul><br/><br/>And it's got Hector from Breaking Bad in it :) <br/><br/>If you enjoyed Requiem & Fountain, I really can't say if you'll like Pi. It's a difficult film to openly recommend as it is, and there's not much like it to compare to.<br/><br/>I'll say if you enjoyed Eraserhead, you'll probably like Pi."
"Al_The_Strange","Null","0","1","14 March 2015"," The syntax between the numbers...
","You might think a movie about numbers and math would be boring, but Pi is anything but. It is one trippy experience that mixes experimental expressions with a gritty neo-noir style to craft a sharp and punchy thriller that exudes paranoia.<br/><br/>The film's style is what makes it consistently engaging. It's a very stark and gritty black-and-white picture with a lot of intricate sets, unique photography, and snappy editing. It's almost on the same level as Eraserhead, but with a production that looks like the first half of The Matrix. It's a pretty cool way to take an otherwise uninteresting subject and make it presentable. As the film goes on, the character becomes a target by various people, and he goes on the run in some mildly satisfying chase scenes. It all builds up to a climax that will come off as bewildering and extreme.<br/><br/>The story's pretty simple: a bunch of people chase after one man who knows a special number. It is pretty novel to use a number as a plot device. What makes the story most interesting, however, is the subtext. The film draws strong parallels between mathematics, nature, and the man-made world, suggesting that through math and patterns, there is a correlation between order and chaos. This is what gives the plot its weight, and gives the characters a reason to struggle to figure out numbers. Fundamentally though, this is a story about a man gifted with great talents and insight, but descends into self-destructive madness due to the knowledge in his own head.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's debut film is made with very vivid black-and-white photography and editing. He employs some hip-hop montages here and there (as he later does in Requiem for a Dream), and it looks great. Acting is pretty good from the cast, and the writing gets the job done. The narration is pretty slick. This production uses pretty interesting sets, props, costumes, and locales. Electronic music is used throughout the movie, with a lot of beat and energy, and it is really cool.<br/><br/>This film is pretty bizarre, but there is plenty to think about in this basic story and plenty to admire in the intense style. If you enjoy experimental films, then this should interest you.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Good | Film: Very Good)"
"higherall7","8","0","1","12 December 2014"," Pi in the Sky
","Really enjoyed this movie because it was an intellectual thriller and quest story. Thought the music was viscerally appropriate and the herky-jerky pace riveting. No, I cannot say this movie inspired me to more thoroughly peruse my copy of 'Mathematics and the Imagination', but I can't remember when a movie ever inspired me to read a book, albeit it has often been the other way around. However, I could appreciate that this was a cautionary tale about what happens when you seek the answer to everything all by your lonesome.<br/><br/>Max Cohen is a driven paranoiac blessed with computational altitude that he uses to impress the little Chinese girl in the Park. Naturally, you see the stereotypes at work; Jewish people and Orientals are naturally presumed to be really smart. But somehow I didn't mind. I could go with it, because I know Jewish people and Orientals who are really smart.<br/><br/>The obsessive and compulsive nature of the narrative gets under your skin and gets you going with the protagonist. He's devoting all his time to discovering something truly important, but one gets the feeling he may end up staring at the Sun too long again with injurious consequences. The allusion to Icarus is something of a foreshadowing about what is to come.<br/><br/>You could say Max's closest companion is his supercomputer Euclid which he built himself. He'll have nothing to do with the girl next door in his apartment building named Devi. After all, what could she offer him and his work except the care and the concern that would help relieve his migraine headaches and keep him from cracking up. Sol, the friend and mentor whom he visits from time to time, keeps trying to tell him that there's more to life than mathematics. You would think that some one with his intelligence might grasp the possibility of this simple fact. But you know what happens when you find out you're really good at something. It becomes your whole world even when it's not THE world.<br/><br/>Max's hard work leads to his computer crashing and ejaculating before it does an odd string of numbers 216 digits long. Somehow it becomes apparent that this number might be the mathematical name for God. Once Max has this number in his head it seems to him that everybody is after him, from Hasidic Jews and Rabbis ready to prep mankind for the Messianic Age to secret agents like Marcy Dawson from Wall Street seeking to use his new found knowledge for their own ends.<br/><br/>The thing that was fascinating was how Max appeared to be in a race against his own worsening pain. This occurring still despite his much sought after breakthrough and epiphany concerning numbers as the underlying nature of everything. More than once I thought he was really attempting to find a mathematical solution to resolve the periodic and inevitable onslaught of his own agony. It looked and felt like God was punishing him for attempting to know things without adequate preparation.<br/><br/>I loved when his mentor Sol shared with him the anecdote about Archimedes and how his wife made him take a bath and this led to the breakthrough that made him run naked through the streets shouting 'Eureka!'. It's one of the interesting themes of this fascinating noir film. The idea that Cosmic Intelligence is not for the cloistered few but is an inclusive function and faculty of all mankind. Lone wolves plumb and probe its depths at their own risk and may be consumed by it when it becomes too late."

","1.I'll start off by saying this. First, this is a film for people trying more then to be just entertained. Second, this is not the kind of film you can watch once and get entirely.<br/><br/>2.This film was made on a very low budget, with grainy black and white photography. The editing is fast paced, as is most of the music. the sounds are loud and often unnerving, and some of the images shown are meant to be weird/ disturbing when seen for the first time. This film is RAW.<br/><br/>3.The plot is open to interpretation. This put together with the style is what I liked most about the film. You might not know at times whether you are watching the main character's dream, an illusion, or a twisted reality. You are expected to come to your own conclusion, and your own idea about what each event and character represents throughout the film. Every scene in the film counts. There's not a scene that doesn't have some meaning or question to move the plot forward. The film demands attention.<br/><br/>4.Other films like this are: Enemy,Take Shelter, and Taxi Driver. If you have tried these films and do not like them, I would not recommend Pi. Also, if you did not like some of the other films Darren Aronofsky has made, I would not recommend this film.<br/><br/>5. Much like the film suggests, I think that this film shows the beginning of a pattern. The unique style and metaphorical plots of Darren Aronofsky's films started here. Requiem for A Dream, The Fountain, Black Swan, and Noah are some of his other films which have the same style of story telling. This was the beginning of a golden spiral.<br/><br/>6. If you watched the film already, you'll find this review is an inside joke, and a silly one at that. If you have not watched this film yet and are planning on it, don't worry. you'll get it. Just look for the patterns! :D"

""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film about a numbers genius as well as many, many, many others however for some reason just thematically and maybe due to the fact that they are bald characters ""The Zero Theorem"" reminds me of ""PI"". As well as parts of ""The Matrix"" remind me of ""PI"". (Also the shots of him looking up a leaves on trees remind me of those shots in ""Miller's Crossing"" but I just got through reading that.)"
"jboothmillard","5","0","5","20 July 2014"," Pi
","This was the debut film from director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, Black Swan, Noah), and I found it in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was looking forward to seeing what it would be like. Basically in Manhattan, since childhood Maximillian 'Max' Cohen (Sean Gullette), a genius mathematician and computer expert, has suffered from severe migraines and takes pills to ease the pain of these headaches, this is since staring into the sun at the age of six and almost becoming blind, he also has extreme paranoia, hallucinations, and social anxiety disorder. He is a lonely man, living alone in his apartment with a supercomputer he built himself, his only friend is his former mathematics mentor and professor Sol Robeson (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective's Mark Margolis), and he is obsessed with finding numeric patterns. Max believes that mathematics is the language of nature, everything around people can be represented and understood from numbers, if you graph the numbers in any system then patterns emerge, therefore there are patterns everywhere in nature, and his current obsession is the Wall Street stock market and traders and their system to predict their behaviour. While he is being approached by a Wall Street company with high interest in his research and results of his studies, he keeps running into fast-talking Chasidic Torah scholar Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman) who also does mathematical research, and believes that a string of numbers, 216, is a code sent from God, and could hold the key to the meaning of life. As time goes by Max is driven to the brink of madness as he becomes obsessed with finding patterns that bring him towards the meaning of the numbers for this code, he shaves his head, he finds Sol dead, he keeps scribbling and calculating trying to find the answer, and in the end Max trashes the apartment and commits suicide with a power drill into his cerebral hemisphere. Also starring Pamela Hart as Marcy Dawson, Stephen Pearlman as Rabbi Cohen, Samia Shoaib as Devi, Ajay Naidu as Farrouhk and Kristyn Mae-Anne Lao as Jenna. In the leading role Gullette certainly convinces as the obsessive genius recluse slowly slipping from normality, the black and white colour and disorientating camera-work definitely add to the feeling of distortion, admittedly the deciphering and intricate ideas broken down by numbers is baffling and will confuse, but you cannot help but want to see what happens next, it is an interesting psychological science-fiction thriller. Worth watching!"

","A very good movie about a mathematician trying to elaborate a unifying theory to explain the universe using math as a language. His attempts result in a growing paranoia, as closer as he gets to his own boundaries. The limited perception of the mathematician as a human being, haunts him in his quest across his own limits. His struggle to overcome his boundaries results a growing paranoia, that is enhanced by a ""condition"" he acquired as a child. Don't understand why is this movie in black and white, but my guess is that it is because of this ""condition"". Would like to notice this movie is a perfect example of how good a movie can be even with very limited budget. Very good acting, music, scene and argument.

"patryk-czekaj","8","0","1","27 June 2012"," Aronofsky's tale of obsession and mathematical patterns
","Pi is definitely one of the most remarkable achievements in the world of indie productions. On such a low budget (mere 60 thousand dollars) Darren Aronofsky was able to create an intelligent, engaging, mathematically overflowing movie that stands out in comparison to all the blockbusters that came out in 1998. <br/><br/>It is a thorough study of madness and chaos, two strategically opposing matters, yet so closely connected in the film's storyline. The main character believes that when he will finally discover and establish a special pattern, which can be found in nature, he will be able to control simply anything, and the pure reason for our existence will be revealed. It's a risky game, where there are only rights and wrongs, nothing in between. <br/><br/>The main character – Maximilian Cohen – is an obsessive-compulsive, frightened, and detached from community, man. He barricades himself from the world in his own apartment, filled with computers. His mind is gradually imploding, due to reoccurring headaches and paranoid visions that attack him in various, random moments. His only friend is an old mathematician, a mentor, with whom he plays a fantastic Japanese game called Go (the sequences remind me of the thrilling book 'The Master of Go' by Yasunari Kawabata).<br/><br/>Max's problems begin when two groups try to seduce him, in order to acquire a bit of that genius, which lies inside his troubled mind: A Wall Street firm on one side, and Hasidic Jews on the other. He is looking for a 216-digit number, which will bring enormous wealth for the former, and shine a new light on the understanding of religion for the latter.<br/><br/>The film is shot in a very unconventional manner, mostly in black and white (kind of a neo-noir feel), with the use of a, so-called, chestcam (camera attached to the body of an actor), which improves the connection between the character's actions and the viewer's perception of them. Great music only increases the pace and plays very well with the scenes of precise mathematic divagations.<br/><br/>Even though the movie's storyline is strictly connected to the brilliant mathematic ideas and notions, it can be certainly called a thriller. Max is in danger all the time, risking his precious mind in order to pursue an obsession. He can't trust anyone, as the people surrounding him don't care about him as a person, but only about what's in his head. He becomes angrier and angrier every minute, and gradually creates his own demise.<br/><br/>Pi is Aronofsky's fantastic debut, and a movie that through the complicated (but easy to follow for the regular viewer) mathematical problems and expressions is able to depict a tragic story about mental obsession. I would recommend it to anyone, whether a math geek or a theoretical newbie."
"jimrin","6","0","1","24 June 2012"," Interesting...
","if you like something different. I finally made it through this movie on my 3rd or so attempt.<br/><br/>I feel like I am generous giving this film a 6, mainly based on effort. It is unique in a lot of ways. I guess since it is an indie (and produced on such a low budget), this allows the director to take chances. Being unique and innovative is good, but if it doesn't help in communicating to the audience, then it fails. The gritty black and white imagery, the quick cutting of shots, the shakiness of the camera in some parts add to the movie in some parts, but get rather tiring and repetitive after a while. Also, I'm a firm believer that you have to root for the protagonist to have an enjoyable movie, and there was basically nothing to make me root for him. It should be possible to build a paranoid character who people can empathize with, but this was not the case with Pi.<br/><br/>So kudos to the director for taking chances... But that doesn't mean it was an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Based on the way the movie was filmed, it can be considered timeless (ie, not set in any specific time period). I found the computer set up a bit overdone, but perhaps if it was supposed to be in the 70s or so, I can understand. I found the line about computers gaining consciousness before shutting down a bit much. I've wondered what mathematicians felt about this movie. I suppose positively since there are not many movies where the protagonist is a mathematician."

The films of Darren aronofsky have always been one of my favorite. So in this debut film of him he has very nicely explored the concept of mathematics. Well not to worry because like many other films it does not stumbles on the grounds of too much technical, it has some very disturbing scenes which some people might find ugly but the visuals and the way they are presented are remarkable. It has succeeded in exploring the mind of the mathematician. The most impressing part is that it was made on a very little budget and we have a film with a much higher quality.

Some shady characters want to use his knowledge to manipulate the stock market. The result is a gloomy, suspenseful thriller which succeeds by virtue of its unique visual style in presenting a compelling view of genius on the edge of madness while seducing the viewer into the main character's obsession with the potency of numbers. The idea of a hard-core science fiction movie in noir style with a low budget, a nobody cast and built around the subject of esoteric mathematics seems pretty outré.

In the process, he is confronted by Wall Street people and Kabbalists who look to take advantage of his genius for their own purposes. Whether the universe is governed by pattern or chaos, is what drives the film. Max is symbolic of this, in that he is seeking order, while heading on a path to pure personal chaos, insanity. The film weaves interesting black and white cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, and an excellent acting performance by Sean Gullette as Max, into a film which does make a viewer at least contemplate some pretty important things."

People are aware of him because he has insights into the stock market and, ultimately, the Hassidic faith. He is pursued by bad guys, but it is ultimately his own demons that go after him. He drills holes in his head and punches drugs into his system. Eventually he finds a set of 216 numbers that provide and answer and incredible danger. This movie is not for everyone.

","Sometimes a film is just so strange that you've only got an inkling of the filmmaker's intention and you have to trust that it's somehow woven together in genius fashion. That's where ""Pi"" lies, somewhere between the random and the perfectly calculated. Creator Darren Aronofsky appears to have run rampant in his feature debut, but one can easily argue that he's thought everything out meticulously. As a result, ""Pi,"" will satisfy the tastes of some and completely fool others.<br/><br/>The main character is Max Cohen, a mathematical genius with some serious issues that lead to pill-popping. He believes in the power of math as a universal language -- nature's language and that there are patterns to everything. With the help of his supercomputer, he embarks on a task to determine a pattern governing the stock market, only what he's on to - - a 216-digit strand of the numerical value of Pi -- has a lot at stake for Wall Street and even a sect of Cabalistic Hasidic Jews who believe it holds Messianic clues.<br/><br/>If a word could describe ""Pi"" in both plot and it's film-making, ""obsession"" would be the best choice. Aronofsky's shot sequences, with repetition and attaching the camera to his actors and the choppiness of the film suggest just how crazy this matter is to both Max and those transfixed on numbers. As Max immerses himself further in the mystery, things only get more chaotic. You get the sense that Aronofsky knew exactly what he was doing, but because it's so abstract and difficult to grasp, you're not totally sure if it all works. The fact that it's filmed in black and white might also suggest the same ""random pattern"" idea of the film. What seems to be so clear cut is really more maddening.<br/><br/>""Pi"" might just be one of those ""second viewing required"" films. It's a cerebral thriller and relentless at that, clearly meant for the tastes of abstract movie watchers. Nevertheless, Aronofsky demonstrates some impressive skills, ones that no doubt led to his success in cult hit ""Requiem for a Dream"" years later."

To me the real star is an up-and-coming director named Darren Aronofsky.<br/><br/>PI is a wonderful and freshly weird Motion Picture that will appeal to most. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4) A marvellously ambitious effort by a director who seems unafraid to take challenges head-on. Should enter my top 300 at 264. Highly recommended."

","Pi is the first film by Darren Aronofsky. The low budget black and white film about numbers and the Jewish religion is an interesting and intelligent movie with a unique look.<br/><br/>The look of Pi is definitely one of its best attributes. For a feature film made for $60,000, Aronofsky achieves an impressive look that many Hollywood films never achieve. The fuzzy and grainy black and white is surprisingly very pleasing to look at. Several shots are even overexposed but it adds to the religious theme of the movie. The overexposed glow at times seems heavenly. The snorricam is also adds to the strange visual feel of the film. The camera is mounted on the main character and pointed at him so it seems like he is floating through time and space in a majestic manner. <br/><br/>The story is equally well done. It has themes of obsession (for the number itself) and religion (the source and meaning of the number). The plot centers around a man who looks for patterns within the stock market, as it is said that everything has numerical patterns. That is something we all wish we could know and manipulate. The obsession then centers around pi, or the number 3.14... The main character is one of many who try to figure out the mystery of the number and why it has no end. Any math geek's dream. <br/><br/>There are no explosions or special effects (or even color for that matter) in this movie, but its unique story and accuracy of scientific information make it a must see for any fan of film-making."

","There is something genius lurking its way to the surface in Darren Aronofsky's PI - but it gets sidetracked with hallucinatory drugs.<br/><br/>An indie film through and through, filmed in startling, scratchy black and white, with reasonably poor performances from everyone except the two leads - Sean Gullette and Mark Margolis (forever Alberto the assassin from SCARFACE, 1983) - with an ambitious idea that is not fully realized due to excursions down chemical alleyways and probably lack of budget.<br/><br/>Sean Gullette is Max Cohen (geez, I wonder if he's Jewish?), a brilliant mathematician (are there any other kinds in movies? I mean, just once, I'd like to see an AVERAGE mathematician) who spends his days brow-furrowing over insurmountable math theory problems involving pi (defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter), while playing go with the assassin from SCARFACE.<br/><br/>Anthropophobic, manic, paranoid, continually injecting himself and popping pills (with the odd hallucination of a drill to the temple) Max works at some problem that will bust open the stock market, if he can stay sane enough to outlast his computer crashes. Early sequences are interesting, where he describes Fibonacci spirals and how he plans to wield these numbers to strike gold.<br/><br/>Max ventures out of his computer-cluttered apartment only for sustenance. When he meets a pushy Hasidic Jew who looks like Jason Biggs in a fake beard (Ben Shenkman), he trips into a tangent of intrigue that makes his cerebral problems with pi seem irrelevant. And the soundtrack, coupled with his psycho-babble, makes for a jarring sidetrack into fantasia.<br/><br/>On the verge of discovering something monumental, the Hasidic community comes after Max to discern the meaning of a 216-digit number that would reveal the true name of god.<br/><br/>Oh - and all this time we thought it was something IMPORTANT you wanted...<br/><br/>Espionage Jew Style."

","Darren Aronofsky has without a doubt created the most different and unique movie of our times. The movie is shot in a completely unique way, the direction is completely fresh and so is the story, imagery, acting and plot. This movie takes us inside the mind of a mathematician who has taken his passion for studying numbers to a point of obsession. He sees numbers and patterns everywhere and is convinced that he can find the key to everything in the universe inside numbers. The movie is about his journey from a passion to a madness that eventually starts tormenting him. <br/><br/>Sean Gullette plays a wonderful role as a mathematician Max who is working on number theory. He has his own computer in an apartment where he lives alone. He spends the day in and day out searching for patterns in numbers especially in the stock market. He is convinced that the whole of nature follows a pattern in numbers and knowing this pattern, he can understand nature to the fullest which in short means that he can find a way to even predict the outcome of the stock market. But here is a catch. He is not a normal human being. He suffers from neurological conditions and is on heavy dose of drugs that he uses to alleviate his pain that he experiences in the head when he stresses out himself. <br/><br/>Another very important character of the movie is Max's mentor. His name is Sol. He himself has worked on the origins and importance of ""Pi"" and has faced the consequences of the madness one can experience when he becomes too obsessed with numbers. He advises Max to stop thinking about the patterns. He is of the view that once you have decided to seek a pattern, you will always find it since your mind cannot think of anything other than patterns. The movie shows debates and conflicts of interest between him and Max. <br/><br/>What can be disappointing for most viewers in the movie is that which part of the movie is inside Max's head and which part of it is outside is something that the movie does not bother to make clear. The movie simply explores the mind of the paranoid and obsessive mathematician. But how much does the mathematician see that is in concurrence with the reality defined by others? This is the answer that the movie does not provide and nor does it offer enough clues to make intelligent guesses about it. Another drawback in the movie is that it is misleading in representation of some of its facts. But that is not too big a problem since I am sure most viewers will resort to the right sources and not the movie if they want to know about the various patterns of numbers that the characters talk about. <br/><br/>There is some really creative imagery in the movie. At one point of time, Max sees a brain in front of him. When he tries to poke a certain part of it, he hears whistles of a train. And pressing it harder, he sees a train heading right for him clearly demonstrating how the brain plays a significant role in defining your reality. The movie is about Max's reality as his mind sees it. Truly one of the most remarkable and intelligent movies I have seen in a long time."

","I was told by someone in a shop to watch this film. The guy told me that it was a very film-studenty film. I was a film student, so I thought I'd give it a try. The idea of naming a film after a mathematical symbol intrigued me.<br/><br/>The film is different from anything I've ever seen. Darren Aronofsky puts the audience directly into the mind of paranoid schizophrenic, Max Cohen, and tells the story of his search for meaning in numbers. If he feels scared, you feel scared. If he feels sick, so do you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen.<br/><br/>Mark Margolis' portrayal of Max's mentor, Sol, is more than worthy of an Oscar. Despite his short amount of screen time, Margolis steals the show with biting criticism and incredibly wise teachings. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role now. He was a tour-de-force, and makes the movie worth watching on his own, even without the fantastic direction, excellent script, fascinating storyline, or even Sean Gullette's terrific portrayal.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, you're missing out on something that's still fresh now. I cannot fault this film. It messes with your head, whilst giving you a thrilling and spine-tingling story. There are so many wonderful quotes.

Sol believes Max is driving himself crazy, but Max stays determined. However, people keep trying to take advantage of Max's mathematical genius.

","""Mathematics is the language of nature,"" vents offbeat number theorist Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) in the midst of one of his lofty rants. ""Everything around us can be understood and represented through numbers."" Words hard to fathom; spoken from the protagonist's experience and belief, yes, but the man speaks quite brilliant sense in writer/director Darren Aronofsky's astounding debut feature. So much so, that Max's compulsive efforts to decode the alleged numerical order underpinning the stock-market exert a pull on corporate kingpins set on economic rule and Jewish fantasists intent on deciphering the secrets behind their holiest of texts.<br/><br/>In a periolous obsession that leads to all kinds of hypotheses regarding ecology and mysticism, money, faith and existence, Max's mental and physical robustness is pushed to the very edges of endurance as he inches towards a specific sequence of digits that could shatter the very foundations of Wall-street and beyond.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's stylistically shot and conceived parable revels in the sheer freedom of experimental film-making in what is, essentially, a character study that relentlessly probes at the known and unknown, the surreal and sublime.<br/><br/>You don't have to be good Will Hunting to grasp the tale, though. Pi is a very well executed sci-fi thriller that grips and stirs in a way that'll leave you yearning for the answers and more. Maths can actually be insightful and cool. Who'd have thought it!?<br/><br/>Shot on a shoe-string budget, this enigmatic indie hits a new peak of low-budget, original film-making. It looks and sounds unlike anything else around. The equation is exact and apt. The film-making techniques: astute and brash. And it all adds up, in quite exceptional yet enigmatic style.<br/><br/>The eccentricity kicking in from the opening credits, an ultramodern manifestation scored by the erratic, techno-rave beats of Clint Mansell's paranoid soundtrack. The Coventry-born musician strikes a forbidding note throughout with his atmospheric composition which compliments the aesthetical and narrative content well.<br/><br/>Darren Aronofsky's Pi is a truly haunting and ingenious discussion on man's undying efforts to crack the complex codes behind our very existence. It has cult potential written all over it. Innovative quality running rich throughout and boasts all the awe and intrigue as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter....honest; ""3.14 and off into infinity""."

It's a fictional film and with all fictional films you have to let go of reality and enter the world of the film. I think the problem a lot of people have with this movie is that they felt they were going to watch a math film, but instead they get a film with a broader message. Whats so great about this film is it takes two subjects, science and religion, and creates a link, and as soon as this film goes beyond the mathamatics of it all and journeys to the unexplained is where you completely lose your math audience and it seems they don't make the connection that is necessary to fully comprehend this movie and its message."

","While unquestionably a work of genius, this movie has some serious irreconcilable issues which force me to give it a thumbs down. Yes, it is a very well done mood piece on a small budget, and Aronofsky went on to do brilliant work in Requiem for a Dream, which shows that given real material he can do great things. But the plot line here is torn between a descent into insanity, done very well, a numerology conspiracy, which was pretty silly, and a commentary on the nature of math, which was just insulting to anyone who has any real knowledge of math. Don't think this movie has some parallel to Memento or Primer, which actually do have intricate plots, as the only plot here is coincidental insanity in the lead character and several others."
"Barky44","9","0","1","24 February 2008"," Can you make a good thriller out of mathematics? You bet!
","What an amazing piece of film-making, all on a shoestring budget! And from such odd beginnings, too. The idea that you could make an exciting, tense, and thought-provoking film based around mathematical computations is absurd. But this is exactly what the filmmakers created with ""Pi"".<br/><br/>Although the math clearly takes a focal point in the story, it's really just a vehicle for investigating what happens when a man gone mad. Paranoia, obsession, aggravation, grief, with tiny bits of joy (as shown by his interactions with a little girl): all parts of a man descending into insanity. So brilliantly crafted by the writer, so brilliantly portrayed by the actor, it's this descent that makes ""Pi"" so fascinating.<br/><br/>This is a film that uses symbolism to the Nth degree. This is the closest thing an American has ever gotten to an Ingmar Bergman film. You've got science, and religion, and philosophy, and the origins of universe, and the essence of thought, and the stuff of life. The film is just chock-full of suggestions on all of these things.<br/><br/>In the end, we aren't entirely sure what happened to to the main character. Did he suffer a debilitating attack, thereby losing his genius? Or was he cured of his affliction, of which genius was only a symptom? In the end, there is a question on an old adage. If there is a fine line between genius and insanity, is the corollary that there is a wide split between genius and happiness? This film surely suggests that.<br/><br/>Overall, a deep, thoughtful piece. Shot on a shoestring, so don't expect much in terms of film quality. But it's a fine work nonetheless."

"ed_zeppelin","7","0","1","19 July 2007"," Inspired, but rough around the edges
","WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR ALL SECTIONS OF THE PLOT, INCLUDING THE ENDING.<br/><br/>It wasn't long after I started school that I realised that Maths was a blind alley for me. I've taken the Humanities route, and my numerical skills consist of the basic mental arithmetic needed to live in the real world. In many ways that puts me in a good position to appreciate a film like Pi, because I can analyse it as a film while the alleged flaws in its premise go right over my head. So the 216-digit number is actually a 218-digit one, but unless I'm going to freeze-frame and actually count then that makes no difference to the narrative at all. Its take on Kabbalah is skewed? I don't know any better. So as far as I'm concerned the premise is fairly solid, if only because I'm prepared to take their word for it that the Fibonacci sequence is A over who-knows-what.<br/><br/>In some respects Pi can ride on visuals alone: the grainy black-and-white points to an extremely self-conscious low-fi ethos, which seems to glory in the knowledge that it would never happen in Hollywood, but the high-contrast effect looks fantastic and the direction is watertight: Pi takes place in a claustrophobic environment where your choice is to melt away into dark shadow or step into the light and fry in its glare. The characters are trapped in a world coiled in on itself: Max (Sean Gullette), the mathematical genius, sits inside his tangled supercomputer Euclid (literally), which itself sits inside the stock market, which is in turn the product of the human race working together, which exists on a planet governed by the patterns of nature, which exists in a universe governed by the laws of physics, and so on into infinity. Searching for a clue as to the nature of it all, Max is struggling to escape his place, and as such is as much a bug as the ones that literally crawl over Euclid. If he breaks his place in sequence, the sequence collapses.<br/><br/>The plot concerns Max's quest to find out the secrets of a 216-digit number that Euclid spontaneously spits at him, before making impossibly accurate stock market predictions and finally crashing. People want that number: it might contain the key to understanding the entire universe, but the more Max learns about it, the more his own mental instability tears that universe apart. Gleefully destroying the boundary between reality and fantasy, the idea that there might be pattern to it all becomes increasingly absurd. The pattern eventually becomes irrelevant, overtaken by the importance of Max's perception of the world around him.<br/><br/>The film takes for granted, as its premise, that there is a pattern governing everything. But that isn't the point: the point is whether humanity is capable of understanding it, whether it needs to know it, or whether it is getting above itself by trying to find it. The only person Max can talk to about this is his elderly mentor Sol (Mark Margolis) over repeated games of Go  one of the film's better-used symbolic motifs. Sol has a much more laid-back attitude to life, but it is implied that he has previously encountered the number before and that he knows something of its true nature. The Go board is a microcosm of the universe, which Max sees as another example of the universal spiral: apparently simple, then incredibly complicated, but ultimately governed by a pattern. Max does not assert that there is a pattern to the game because he has found one, but because logic seems to dictate that one must exist, and it is in that same gap where something should exist only because of what's around it that the Jewish cult finds its own meaning. This is in some respects an answer to the accusation that the film's premise is implausible: it deals with something that the brain is not meant to comprehend, and it places that incomprehension at its heart, not the pattern.<br/><br/>It isn't a perfect film. Some of the symbolism is very obvious (Euclid's bugs, in the form of an ant infestation); the end is an old art-film cliché (wait  you're telling me it might not literally be happening? Whoa!) and some of the dialogue is very corny. How many movie villains have ranted about ""survival of the fittest"" before pulling the trigger, for example? Or, more accurately, before the hero is whisked to safety at the last minute? I wouldn't hold it against anyone who finds the end unsatisfying, since everything we learn about the number is vague and ambiguous and leads to more questions. The end isn't about the mysteries of nature being returned to nature; it's about Max finally being satisfied that they are always going to remain as mysterious as ever, whatever glimpse of some bigger truth occasionally slips through the cracks. It was the quest that made Max important, and the film ends with him finally understanding that the conclusions are irrelevant because he was never going to reach them."

","Max is an obsessed genius falling ever more deeply into migraine-ridden madness. As he himself suggests, his life has been about staring into the sun. What makes this film so powerful is its unflinching first person point of view as Max follows his harrowing path. Director Aronofsky's camera assaults us with starkly lit, B&W images that heighten characterization and sometimes strobe and make moires that blind us; the sounds often disengage us from the images, while film editing dislocates time. From the first moments of the film we are Max; his alienation is palpable, sometimes the pulsing of his nausea is as well. <br/><br/>This ride is harrowing, and not just the horror scenes, so much so that some will be put off. For me it is cinema at its most cinematic. Aronofsky makes Max's mental state palpable through cinematography. As Max spirals into self-destruction he also reaches for the mathematical beauty, the pattern that underlies all the forms in the universe. This opens the cinematography to a wonderful range of imagery handled so as to leave the audience to ponder possible symbolic resonances. The final beauty of the film rests in the fact that this is a tale told by a hallucinating madman. We may think we know what is real and what is his hallucination. Then again, most of us have awakened from nightmares unsure where dream stops and reality begins. This leaves fundamental questions of the film interestingly ambiguous: Is it the mathematical vision that short circuits Max's brain or is it all those drugs he's taking? Is that strange computer rig that envelopes his apartment a machine for solving fundamental questions, or is it merely the externalization of Max's agoraphobic, claustrophobic mindscape? Is the universe based on fundamental order or is the order Max sees merely the shape of chaos? The film does no more than pose the question."

I didn't feel as if it was an insult to mathematicians at all. The fact of the matter is that it seemed to have a basis rooted in fact, namely the number of letters; 128 I believe; for the name of God. I've read this somewhere, in a book on Jewish mysticism...I think it was in the Kabbala (Cabala) or the Sephir Yazorat. Please forgive my misspellings.

Like the mystery it seeks to unravel, the meaning in this movie cannot be expressed in simple equations. Its truth is in between the scenes. PI at times seems a bit too pretentious, but always manages to redeem itself by its utter simplicity. Even the antiquated computer parts lend credence to the timeliness of this movie. Few movies are truly meant to be in black-and-white, but this is one of them. The stark, frenetic energy of the video sequences helps build everything to a relentless crescendo.

","Shot on a microscopic budget, this debut feature from Darren Arnofsky is an audacious, and superbly conceived sci-fi thriller. As is fairly obvious within it's history this is a genre that is particularly difficult to get right, with far more failures than successes. PI is a film that is intelligent, engaging, and shot for virtually nothing, while big bucks are often spent on poorly written drivel.<br/><br/>Arnofsky's little masterpiece is filmed in black and white and the film is beautifully shot. The camera movements and the editing are very effective and really this film looks and feels fairly unique. Indeed the storyline itself is truly original and in this age of sequels, adaptations and remakes it's oft the case that we must trawl back through cinema of years gone by to find unique films we have yet to see. PI is delightfully such a case. Revolving around a loner, paranoid, maths genius called Max (Sean Gullette), the film portrays a character unlike what we have seen, yet believable. Inflicted with paranoia and hypochondria, Max lives in near total isolation, popping pills, avoiding the outside world where possible and constantly studying numbers, looking for patterns. As he begins to unravel certain numerical patterns, he finds himself the centre of previously non existent, attention. Max is psychologically unbalanced and the film follows him beyond breakdown, while he also tires to fend off his sudden popularity.<br/><br/>Certainly this is a film that will provoke discussion and multiple theories, as the best of this genre should do. Still aside from an excellent script this features a pulsating score and soundtrack and also some excellent performances, particularly Gullette whose portrayal of Max is raw and at times brilliant. This is a film I took far too long to get round to seeing but I'm glad I did. ****"

Anyone who takes pleasure in finding patterns and governing principles, math geeks I'm talking aboutcelebrate the absolute significance of axioms, of the Fibonacci sequence, of the golden ratio, of spiralsof Euclid, of a mysterious genius, of the even more mysterious Pi, of the Kabalathe secret Hebrew name of God: ""I'm sure you've translated every 216 digit number; I'm sure you've intoned them all; it's not the numbers you need; it's what's in between the numbers; that was given to me, it was a gift, and I can't give it to you."" It's what were all after, what keeps us alive, a sense that there's something between the numbers. I sometimes think, sadly, that what we are really in love with is mystery, is unknowing, is the blackness of mystery, nothingness, death, a la Freud's death drive."

","Pi is one of those films that people talk about in university seminars and trendy wine bars. It's a film that often rewards viewers with a sense of smug self-satisfaction, because they 'get it'. Like David Lynch's weirdest, if you don't like it, then you don't understand it. The truth is that it's just a low-budget thriller, filmed in black and white. The script is pretty good and the direction is okay, although it does slip into the realms of pretentiousness a couple of times. Overall, it's a decent film, with some interesting ideas, but nothing particularly profound. Questioning the mathematics in the script is ridiculous, but it does at least reveal the movie for what it is - a piece of entertainment. However, some people seem to think if it's monochrome, it must be art."

","Pi is a great success. Even without the micro-budget and slipshod filming style qualifiers, it is a fun and challenging flick. Grainy black and white pictures and a ""ghost in the machine"" theme give it instant context. Indeed, the premise as stated by the protagonist (life can be understood and therefore ""read"" in terms of a mathematical system) becomes an acute brain cancer of sorts for the guy. For, as he moves seemingly closer to being able to interpret and ""read"" the world around us vis a vis his ""organic"" data set, the stock market, things become neither controllable nor effable to him. Machinations spin scarily around and migraine headaches sound increasingly fierce warnings as he approaches the still center of understanding. <br/><br/>The end-game leads to intellectual brick walls for himself and to exploitation from outside corporate and religious entities. However, all are ignoring the fly in the ointment... <br/><br/>A well acted and paced thriller laid over an undercurrent of intellect vs. emotion, I highly recommend Pi."

","The ideas contained in ""Pi"" are rather interesting, but unless you're a huge fan of, say, David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" or ""Blue Velvet,"" which I am not, you're bound to find this promising film as tedious as I did.<br/><br/>Scenes that are meant only to convey the mood or state of mind of the protagonist seem to go on forever. It is only when the protagonist interacts with other people that ""Pi"" manages to hold my interest.<br/><br/>It's too bad, really, because I did appreciate the originality of the story being told, and the obvious homage to the surrealist film ""Le Chien Andaluse (The Andalusian Dog)"". (For example, there's a shot during one of the games of Go of a black stone held in the palm of a hand, which is extremely similar to ""Le Chien's"" shot of the hand with a hole in the palm with ants crawling out of it. Ants, by the way, also figure prominently in the visuals of ""Pi."")"

","This a great movie by Aronofsky, Gulette and Mansell. I mentioned three names because all three have made this movie great. It is a great story about a genius, his struggles and the truth about life.<br/><br/>He is a great mathematician that is trying to figure out the realities of life which is mainly mathematics and to be more precise, the patterns in nature. It is always believed that nature has a structure based on patterns, but proving one of them is much harder than proving a human-made theory. Therefore first of all, I need to praise the person who brought up the idea.<br/><br/>The casting is good although is some sequences, I felt it could have been better. There are also some spots in the plot line as well. For instance his guru in mathematics (Sol Robeson) has left him the 216 digits right before his death. He was accused of being scared. However, if you are a mathematician, you only live with the numbers, not with your feelings. And also it shouldn't be as easy to find the solution after getting a bust in your face telling you were afraid. That seemed to me like a little dishonesty to the viewer.<br/><br/>The music needs nothing to be told. Clint Mansell is a great talent and he has affected the movie a lot. The ambiance music created has left the viewer in total awe.<br/><br/>A movie with this kind of budget is a total boost for me actually. A movie is not about effects, scenery or anything else. It's all about a good sense of art both in writing the screenplay and also shooting. Music and casting are supporters of it. This movie has done very good job in showing the reality of mathematics, the life of a genius and the true life out there that is ready to make use of you until you are finished and then throw you out like a garbage."

","I'm a physicist; I write fidgety reviews while my code is compiling and it's too late to do any real writing.<br/><br/>I'm commenting here because there actually is a theory on the origin of Fibbonaci series in plants, published recently in Physical Review Letters (92, 168102, 2004). The theory works best on cacti, as the author (and I) have observed in Arizona.<br/><br/>Spirals are built into the plant when it is very young: so young you can see them forming under an electron microscope. The dome of the growing plant buckles under pressure--you can see the same effect if you pinch a wide swath on the back of your hand, or stretch a piece of plastic. Buckling is often geometrically simple for the same reason soap bubbles form nature's most perfect sphere: it takes the easiest path.<br/><br/>Shipman found that when a new spiral forms, it has the same number of arms as the sum of pre-existing arms (the Fibbonaci sequence).<br/><br/>Whether the phyllotaxis (leaf arrangement) of cacti and sunflowers can be extended to other things, and whether the discovery is useful--I dunno. <br/><br/>A talk by Shipman (a living Max who has gone on to work at the Max Planck Institute) is, at the time I write, available at: http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/pattern_c03/shipman/<br/><br/>Note, incidentally, that the truth is both less artsy and more beautiful than presented in this movie and in the legions of pseudo-science that accompany this field."

","Daniel Aronofsky's brilliantly deranged thriller, 'Pi', is the story of a mathematician losing his mind. With its black-and-white photography, jerky editing, and 1970s aesthetic, the film creates a mood of tension, paranoia and plain confusion reminiscent of that found in the books of James Keleman or in Christopher Nolan's backwards-told 'Momento'; while the plot, though deliberately incoherent, takes the form of a Jewish version of the 'Da Vinci code', or 'Foccault's Pendulum'. Sean Gullette is excellent in the main role, and for affectionados of the game Go (often used in movies as a visual metaphor for genius), there's an added bonus of several Go-playing scenes. Disturbing, pseudo-intellectual fun at its best."

"rustamgarrey","Null","0","1","18 October 2004"," A lot of symbolism and non-obvious messages
","My comments are intended for people who WATCHED the movie already, and may be classified as SPOILERS. <br/><br/>As one of the reviewers commented here, there is obviously a good deal of religious symbolism in this movie. Jewish line is straightforward, but the details implicating Islam are fairly subtle. I personally missed the association of the Mecca chip and it's black cube shape. Thanks for fellow viewer's comment pointing this and other nuances out.<br/><br/>When I see an artful movie like this I always look for a message. In my book an artist, as opposed to entertainer, does have a message, whether intended or unintended. To me the message here appears to be that the human being cannot establish contact with God on his own initiative. If you attempt to find a magical number (or word, or stone, etc.) allowing to talk to God - the ultimate result is death or insanity. Compare to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The God will talk to you, if and when the time comes.<br/><br/>In this movie, apparently Max Cohen stops short of crossing the line. He burns the hard copy of ""the number"" and drills it out of his brain. He saves his life and sanity, but loses his math geniality. His buddy Sol goes all the way and pays the price. Frankly, I was surprised that Max was able to back off the brink, after seeing how nutty he is throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Few more symbols I noted:<br/><br/><ul><li>Some scenes fade into darkness, others into bright light. Is this a symbol that something is bad or good?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The story about Max staring into the sun as a kid, despite being warned not to do so. This alludes to biblical notions of the God being like a bright light, excruciating to look at. It is unclear in the movie whether Max regrets doing it or not.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Several times when Max is sweating his brain in his apartment, there are noises behind the wall, resembling somebody making love - moaning, talking, etc. I still cannot make out this one - is that a symbol too.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jewish scholars beat the Wall Street mafia when it comes to duking out for Max. Is this pitting God against the Golden Calf?</li></ul><br/><br/>This movie raises more questions than gives answers to. And that is always good."
"meanderised","Null","0","1","23 September 2004"," Anyone see any religious symbolism?
","What I noticed was that the movie quite obviously has Judaism etc. but there are other notable things. For instance, as Max lives in Chinatown, at the beginning there is a scene where he walks past some people doing Tai-Chi, which is one aspect of the world's society. There is also the people who hound Max who represent the Materialists, another world 'religion'. Interestingly they give him a Mecca chip, which is shaped the same as the Ka'bah in the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the most important city in the world for Muslims. Also, when Max runs through a store(twice), in the background you can hear recitation of the Qur'an which is Islam's holy book. I thought this movie works on many levels and expresses the truth about life and the true faith of 'One God'( I loved the fact that there is no hint of Christianity in the whole movie).

"Scott McPherson","9","0","1","10 August 2004"," It's about Enlightenment.
","Mathematics is the language through which the Max is trying to understand the ""logic"" of the universe (in his case, the stock market is his microcosm). He is looking for Spinoza's (and Einstein's) ""God""; the Natural Order of All Things. <br/><br/>The mathematics are also a major sense of Max's own identity. He's like a trained monkey, performing math tricks for the girl next door. Proving with each proof, that he knows who he is.<br/><br/>Max's struggle is analagous to the Jewish spiritualists, though he doesn't initially recognize that himself. Next to these pursuits, petty power games like those of the military industrial complex are derided. But they did serve a purpose...<br/><br/>Max's Professor had stroke. He blamed it on a certain mathematical pursuit.<br/><br/>He recognizes that his student is on the same path and warns him off--his life may hang in the balance.<br/><br/>But Max persists and his computer, like his professor's, at the penultimate moment--just *as* it's concluding the answer--has it's technological own version of a stroke and explodes. <br/><br/>So they talk and conclude that their machines (and the Professor himself, nearly) reached total consciousness. Where it... Understood. And in doing so, ceased to exist. <br/><br/>Max's life deteriorates as he surrenders all to his pursuit. He (literally at times) opens his mind up and *realizes* the Is; the Tao; he sees through the illusion of interpretation (as math is an interpretation of nature). <br/><br/>He realizes that his identity is merely an idea of himself, and in recognizing it, that part of him ceases to exist just as the computer--who could, like his ego, only deal with symbols and not reality--did.<br/><br/>Having reached this point of Enlightenment, Max no longer has a need to deal in symbols. When the young girl asks him to multiply huge numbers, he sees no point in that egoic performance. And instead of looking at the fractal patterns made by the leaves of the trees, Max instead just looks at the trees and is One with Nature.<br/><br/>And for I believe the only time in the film, Max is smiling and looks happy and content. And that's always a sure sign of a person who is realizing Enlightenment. After all, if Enlightenment is enacting the ultimate ""knowing,"" then why would it be the ultimate act if it didn't get you the thing we all seek in all we do anyway?"

He has a problem with his brain and throughout the movie, the drama unfolds and we watch his mind torture him. Meanwhile, we have Jews that are very interested in this number that Max has uncovered and then there are these other people who are also very interested in this number.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film and can be interpreted in many ways. The story is truly about Max's mental stress. The plot between the Jews and the other people is very loosely developed but that's the point; the point is to dramatize and emphasize Max's mental state. This movie is a piece of work.

"movieguy1021","8","0","1","23 May 2004"," Pi: 8/10
","Darren Aronofsky, I guess, could be called a film genius. Requiem for a Dream is considered to be one of the best movies of recent memory (and, from what I saw of it, I can agree), and has many of the same techniques as his previous film, Pi. Pi is one of those movies that you need to see many times in order to have everything sink in, but you don't really want to see it again. The images stick in your head, and it's a subconsciously terrifying experience.<br/><br/>Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius. He analyzes numbers, and soon recognizes a pattern in the stock market. But that doesn't satisfy him. He keeps on going, as people want to use his mathematical abilities for their own selfish reasons. Max struggles with his various mental and physiological problems as he's working with this-so much that if you watch it once you can't distinguish between reality and Max's mind.<br/><br/>Aronofsky makes this movie on parking meter money (less than $10,000), yet it's one of the most stylish movies of recent memory. Shot in black/white (there is barely any grey) with a type of vision that leaves edges to the imagination, Pi works in its own little world. With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works. The theories that the movie puts in your head are complete bull-honky, but they're presented in a way that you can't help believing (like many people think about Michael Moore).<br/><br/>Well acted all around, especially by Guellette, Pi is not for everyone. There's many disturbing moments, involving brains and power tools. The second-to-last scene, just so you know, was actually done, no special effects. Overall, Pi is a very good, trippy movie that's not for everyone. But if you're game, go for it.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language and some disturbing images."

Both of them have plenty of hidden messages and are very ambiguous.

Its like one of those diaries... that have 1 starters qoute on each page, then you go where ever you'd like. Darren is a very creative filmer, all his Movies are strikingly realistic, unlike any movie seen before (original) and moving in some way. (If you disagree your simply underestimating his power.)

That creativity and skill is far better then some lame layed out plot thats not half as dramatic as the actors in it makeit seem.. and thats so incredibly realistic its predictable and something you'd see all your life.

The plotline and central idea driving the movie are excellent and well-conceived. The acting is standout. The only major complaint that I have is the overuse of stylistic elements - the flashy migraine sequences, etc. The heavy emphasis on the abstract detracts from the movie; the audience is left with a feeling of partiality. That is to say that more real substance, firm plot, and concrete ideas could have made the story much better overall. I realize that part of the art of the film is this abstraction, but at some point filmmakers must make sense in their films, and I feel that the heavy emphasis on the stylistic elements (while certainly very visually inventive) detracts from the story as it is used so extensively. Also, I liked the grainy black and white film that was used. It sets the audience up emotionally. It is symbolic of quite a lot of the motifs in the movie. I must say, the movie would have been something quite different if filmed on a crisp, vibrant, color film. Too polished maybe; I don't really know- I have to watch it again.<br/><br/>And yes, the main character did come to peace with the world at the end of the film - because he partially lobotomized himself.

","I've watched both of Aronofsky's critically acclaimed films by now and I must say, I do not find them good. There are interesting elements, but the films are not interesting. Take Pi for example. The shaky cinematography, by the emphasis on the madness of Maximillian rather than on Maximillian himself, made it very difficult for me to get into' the film or even figure out what was real and what was not. Despite that criticism I have to admit, that the mathematical parts of this film were interesting and somewhat ingenious. <br/><br/>
My criticism does not mean that either Pi or Requiem for a Dream are bad films, I just want to say that they're not all they are cracked up to be and that I therefore would not recommend them film to anybody. I'd rather see Donnie Darko, Bully or Irrèversible again. I guess what I want to say is: Aronofsky is just not for me and I dare say that if you did not like Requiem for a Dream too much, you the same will probably go for Pi and the other way around.<br/><br/>

It is a masterpiece in control, and a director's ability to create mood - in the true spirit of independent cinema style, in display with all it glory (and gratuitousness). . Mise-en-scene: The figure behavior of Max Cohen appealed to me - strange, erratic and inconsistent - it furthered the narrative to establish a man truly on the edge. . While I did not feel personally for Cohen's character, I enjoyed being a voyeur and following his track to see where he would end up.  My goal was very narrative driven and I don't think the director's aim was for us to empathize with the character - it was more to get us interested in him -which we do quite acutely. . I did not particularly care for the gangster angle, but I guess it was important to keep the less-artsy crowd hooked on and to drive the narrative forward in a linear fashion. . Cinematography: The mood was built both by the choice of wide angled lenses used at very close distances to distort the images and give the 'crazy world' feel. Camera height is used effectively to convey an impending feeling of something waiting to happen or lurking around the corner. . Sound & Editing: The director's total skill and control on these two stylistic elements is what makes this film an imperfect masterpiece. I so enjoyed the complimenting of the sound bridges to give the impending feeling of foreboding. Yet the sound was hip and a departure from earlier noir works where it created only mood. The editing was totally maverick and the mixing of superimpositions with quick and flash cuts gave a more music-video feel which was fast and slick - thoroughly enjoyable in the end."

","Pi, written and directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For A Dream), and starring Sean Gullete, is the story of a mathematical genius, Max Cohen, who tries to find the pattern of the stock market. He looks at the market as being an ""organic being"". However, with a Wall Street firm on his tail, along with a Kaballah sect, it will be hard for Max to get his work done, especially with the horrible migraines that plauge him.<br/><br/>Pi is a very bizarre film. Sometimes you'll understand what's happening, but most of the time you will be lost. This film demands repeat viewings. I even saw it twice in a row when I first saw it. It's strange, but you won't be able to look away from the screen, seeing Max's headaches get worse, seeing the annoyance of the firm and the sect. Seeing Max destroy himself.<br/><br/>The film is shot in beautiful black-and-white, with a great sense of photography and director's technique. Even here, you can see the camera effects that made Requiem For A Dream a great study of film.<br/><br/>Another thing about this film is the fact that it is somewhat open to interpretation. Is Max a schizophrenic, and the whole film a delusion? There are more questions I could ask, but that would perhaps spoil it for someone who has never seen it. A thought-provoking film, and definately one to check out if you enjoy a good independent movie."
"SciBoy","Null","0","1","28 July 2003"," A good movie
","Pi is a good movie. It's not the best movie ever made, but it is up there on the top ten list, in my book anyway. <br/><br/>The story, in brief, is about a lone-wolf mathematician who is on the verge of discovering the underlying pattern behind all seemingly random events. He reasons that all things that seem random can be broken down into simpler pieces until you arrive at something deep down that is common to all patterns.<br/><br/>I think here is where a lot of people go wrong in the movie. They over-emphasize the importance of religion. The religeous part of the movie is just one of the factions fighting for the 216 digit number that explains all patterns. <br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, a lot of people think that the reason that no one can know the 216 digit number is that it is the ""name of God"". In my opinion, this is only one theory. My theory is that the reason we can not know the 216 digit number is that it cannot be written down or understood because it would then be a part of itself. Since the number explains all sequences. For example, there is a theory in AI which says that we cannot write a thinking program because we cannot make a language with which we can explain intelligence because of the limitations of our own minds. How do you describe a smell without referencing other smells? Colors without referencing other colors?<br/><br/>One of the reasons why I find this explanation more logical than the religious one, for example, is the selfdestruction of the computer, which obviously does not have a soul. So what does it matter if the computer knows the 216 digit number? The computer can't understand the number. But it can contain the algorithms based on the number that can be used to predict everything. Of course, a computer can't hold the information of everything...<br/><br/>spoiler end.<br/><br/>Anyway, that is *my* theory. But don't think that it is the right one. And don't think that *your* explanation is the right one either, or that you know what the director (and the other writers) intended. Unless you have asked them (or *are* them :-). <br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone. If you didn't like it, or understand it, then it was not for you. If you like maths and science, and like original movies about new things (that don't explode or fall in love with their neighbours) you'll probably enjoy this. One or two omissions or errors is bound to occur, instead of beating down on them, try to see the big picture, the big implications. <br/><br/>Maybe, there is a Theory of Everything that we cannot understand, because it defines understanding. Maybe."

","The theme of this film is very simple. Discovering the `meaning of life' is a very self-destructive process.<br/><br/>ART-HOUSE OR NOT?<br/><br/>The main problem I have with this film is that it ultimately operates on an `art-house' level, but whets our taste with `mainstream themes' that are never realised.<br/><br/>At an `art-house' level the film works well, with our hero becoming more self-destructive as he nears his goal. Each time he gets closer to coming up with the mathematical `meaning of life' it becomes clearer that he must destroy himself (or his brain).<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that on the way to his `self-realisation', our hero becomes the object of `wall street' and `religion' in a very ominous and `mainstream' way.

"Cipher-J","Null","0","1","8 July 2003"," A math-illogical odyssey.
","Essentially a psychological pot-boiler in which a severely deranged computer geek spirals into psychosis through his obsession over popular misconceptions of chaos theory.  In a nutshell, the ""real"" theory attempts to explain symbolically how even such apparently chaotic processes as found in ""fluid"" turbulence seem, when studied retroactively, to produce vibrational qualities consistent with patterns resembling order.  That is not the same thing as believing that chaos depends on order, or that order can be predicted given some formula that defines the process of chaos.  For example, the ""stock market"" is one such process, for which the theory is in fact no more useful that the flipping of a coin.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what the movie-going public understands about chaos theory is what it believes concerning eschatology, so it would seem reasonable if a compulsive number-cruncher could come up with a magical string of digits useful for predicting anything from stock market activity to the meaning and purpose of life.  Mix into that brew a horse doctor's dose of mysticism, numerology, and that quagmire of pseudo-logic know as the kabbalah, and half-baked science gets muddled with ""The Exorcist"" to produce a plot that would otherwise seem laughable.<br/><br/>It's a ""paranoid"" plot.  The guy is certifiably insane, addicted to drugs and hallucinating out of control.  He has no apparent means of employment to support his addictions, or his Frankenstein's collection of computer circuitry, yet he is presented as some kind of recognized genius for whom both the kabbalistic dunderheads and the criminal element are striving for his secrets.  Somehow, he has discovered a number that unlocks the mysteries of the universe, and that's what establishes the plot, because the audience also shares in wanting to know what that number is, whether it makes any sense or not.<br/><br/>As a representation of mathematics or serious theory, the story is no more profound than a pack of tarot cards.  As a pot-boiler, however, exploiting popular misconceptions in the service of thrilling an audience for whom even the ouija board may be taken seriously, the ""science"" of the plot may seem highly convincing.  For that reason it is not an ""intelligent"" film but a ""pseudo"" intelligent film, highly manipulative and promoting fraudulent assumptions about almost every concept imaginable."

","Pi is really good.  It does what every independent film should; tell a good story without the typical, Hollywood excesses, while simultaneously using its limited resources to its advantage.  Although the writing and acting are both impressive, Aronofsky's directing is what makes this movie worth seeing.  A character-based thriller about a mathematician slowly insane from his research is the perfect context for the garish camera work and taut pacing Aronofsky displays in this film.  It is emotionally engaging, and subsequently, given the subject matter, unnerving.  If you are a fan of Requiem for a Dream, the thriller genre, the horror genre, and/or independent film, you should definitely check out Pi."

But just try to find a flick about mathematicians and mathematics... hmmm ok, granted there's A Beautiful Mind, but that comes after Pi.  Well you can all see my point.  We need more movies about mathematics--arguably the oldest and most basic of the intellectual disciplines based on raw reason!  Perhaps the discipline with the greatest number of interesting and quirky practitioners (since it's been along for sooo long).  And, let me add, we don't need bad movies to portray this monument to human ingenuity at that!  Which is why I welcome Pi with open arms!  It does not portray the life of a historical mathematician.  Instead the film achieves something which I consider even more impressive--it paints the portrait of a fictional mathematician in an interesting way without ever really going into his mathematical work (for that would mean either fabricating new math, attributing other people's math to him, or discovering new math).  Thus suspension of disbelief is attained and we have something that wows those interested in math and uninterested in math alike.  The portrait of a man going insane which is always entertaining...  I won't go into the plot.  I just wanted to mention what a welcome advance for the popularization of mathematics this is and hope there will be more like it.

","Most of the people here comment on this movie and i do not think they quite understood it. Well first of all, the main man, Maximillian, was not very sensible. So, you have to see that some of the people and other things that happened were only in his imagination, that never took place in real world - like a guy in trainstop with a bleeding arm or a brain on the footsteps. So his madness got deeper and deeper, his obsession with that universe idea. I think he imagined the rabi and his jewish friends. But then again i don't understand about his friend Lenny Meyer, was he real or not? Lenny is a key in the movie, because Maximillian's madness is driven by Lenny's lack of understanding this number, Lenny said that the number doesn't mean anything, so Maximillian's brilliant scizophrenic mind snapped. I still think that his computer did give out a number, but after that he really did go mad and that 'business' and Rabi thing was just his mind messup. Well this movie is a real mess, so it is hard to understand if the director/maker really meant something by it, or did just a movie that is crazy and does not mean anything. I guess it means that mind can drive people into madness, stress can do the same, that guy was under real pressure by his own mind and he also was sick, so the influence was doubled.

Portraying a mad-genius, he is alone on screen most of the time, while voiceovers constantly delve deeper into his mind as the true meaning of  PI eludes him. Next, the look of the film.  The image on the screen rarely ever ventures into grey.  That is to say the image is high contrast black and white and never in between.  It lends the film an eerie quality that is emphasized by Matthew Libatique's handheld camera work and Oren Sarch's kinetic editing style.  Basically the financial limits of the budget on a film like this calls for the filmmaker to find new and creative ways to exploit both image and story.  And I must say this.  This is one of the most unique films I have seen.  Also a note to aspiring filmmakers, you will learn more from the DVD audio commentary than a month of film school."

Very honest and truthful. I loved the vision of the film and the subtext. It has a very old school feel to it.Herwig likes long takes and a static camera and its very refreshing to see this now a days. Would compare R.T. to a young John Ford or John Sayles.  I love John Ford and guess that's why I loved THE GOOD THIEF. I just stumbled upon it.<br/><br/>I was also talking to some people afterwards and found out that he shot it in 14-days. It was amazing that this piece of art I just saw was shot in 14-days. I can only imagine what RT will do next with a larger budget and a more time. He has such great vision as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Basically the film stars Christopher Kadish who was in Acts of Worship, The Believer at Sundance, and some other films. Well he plays a man who returns home from priosn to put his life back together. As he does, he relizes that his past, present and future are all connected with those around him inlcuding a daughter and the old crime guy he used to work for. But deep inside the film its about the father son relationship. Herwig adds some religious elements to the film, but not in a real heavy handed way. I guess to just show the guilt of his main character and what he is thinking.<br/><br/>I get the impression while watching that RT left the interpretation of the film up to me to decide. It's like he shot it with three or four POV's in a single scene and it was up to me to decide what I was watching. Was it a dream of some kind? It could have been a foreshadow? Or it could have been a flashback? Or it was reality? I didn't know and that was what was so fun about this movie. I love to think at a film and Herwig made me think.<br/><br/>Without giving away the ending it was such a great little film. Very moving and artistically sound. I loved how RT shot the end. Just so simple, yet so expressionistic.  It's like he took a single second of one man's life and exagerated its length so show what was going on internally and externally at the same time.<br/><br/>I'm gonna see it again when it at The County Theater in Doylestown, PA on Aug. 8th. Heard there will be a party afterwards.  Maybe I'll meet R.T.<br/><br/>What a great start by this new American director. I can't wait to see what he does next on a larger scale.

The movie introduced me to such theories as the golden ratio, theta, golden rectangle, spirals in everything, etc. (Note: I'm almost out of 6th grade--not a safe age to watch this at--so if I seem to not have heard of something they introduced in high school, that's why.

"doodah367","8","0","1","24 December 2001"," An abstract piece of work from first-time director Aronofsky
","Pi is Aronofsky's debut feature length piece, and it seems as if it was a pet project to him, but there may be the slight notion that he spent a little too long refining his baby.  Pi comes off like an abstract poem that's just a little too obscure, and no-one is really sure what the poet is trying to achieve, hence the poem comes off as slightly self-indulgent.<br/><br/>What Pi does do though is offer an interesting representation of Max Cohen, a brilliant but troubled and obsessive compulsive mathematician, who becomes infatuated with discovering a 216 digit number which will not only unlock the stock market but also reveal the real name of God.  However, the film concentrates not so much on the storyline but prefers to concentrate on effectively displaying the everyday life of Max, from his disturbing migraine attacks to his fear and paranoia of other people.  Ultimately this is a story about Max, and his development from a reclusive maniac to a slightly more normal and younger carbon copy of his mentor Sol Robeson.  The camera changes frequently between putting the audience into the head of Max to watching him in a third person, sometimes almost voyeuristic, fashion. The change of picture quality occasionally highlights this subtle switch. <br/><br/>
Pi isn't a religious movie, despite the apparent religious content to the plotline.  In fact, the group of Jew's trying to uncover the 216 digit number are presented in no better a light than the group of Wall Street predictive agents threatening Max to present them with the number.  You get the feeling that when Max, towards the beginning of the film, tells Lenny that ""I'm not interested in religion"" that this may be the voice of Aronofsky (a self proclaimed ""classically hypocritical high holiday Jew"") distancing himself from any notion of Pi being religious.<br/><br/>Although Pi is original and strangely compelling, it is just Aronofosky wetting his directorial beak and practicing techniques which he will make better use of in his sophomore feature 'Requiem For A Dream', a more accomplished and mainstream film.  If you compare and contrast the two closely, then you will find countless similarities.<br/><br/>However as I said, it is original and it is compelling, and it is better than most pap from the Hollywood production line.<br/><br/>

","Never before has there been a character study that completely encompasses the viewer inside the head of a main character. This experience was presented to me in the form of Darren Aranofsky's Pi'. This film is an amalgamation of hyper-kinetic editing, great story telling, and astounding cinematography. Furthermore, the film completely revolves around its' main character and his related fragmentations of life as he seeks to discover the patterns of nature.      Sean Gullette portrays Max Cohen, a surreal character who aims at decoding the pattern of existence. His obsession with patterns brings him to the attention of Wall Street Hoodlums and a Hasidic Sect who will stop at nothing in order to make good use of Max's ingenuity for their own personal gain. The Wall Street Hoodlums want Max for his encryption of the Stock market, and The Hasidic want him to uncover the numeric pattern contained within the Torah. As he uncovers many great dilemmas within his own mind, Director Aranofsky portals us into a cinematic experience filled with vast wonder and imagination. Furthermore, what makes this film so good is that it is an independent film. Aranofsky demonstrates that our main character lives alone and cannot maintain prolonged human contact. He boards himself up in his apartment relentlessly pursuing the goal of a new discovery while nearing himself to the brink of insanity. All this is conveyed with style, wonder and achievement through Aranofsky's intoxicating visuals and quaint story telling.      The film opens up with a great scene that shows us the absolute intelligence of this obsessed mathematician as he mentally and correctly answers such mathematical problems as 322 x 481. Within a second he correctly spits out the answer to the little girl next door:  158 102. From there on end, we as the audience are completely aware that this is no ordinary mathematician. He suffers from severe headaches due to the fact that he stared at the sun when he was six, and is completely invested in his cracking of the codes. As he looks at the world he sees remerging patterns, from the milk spreading in his coffee to the way the water drains itself in the sink. Cohen is completely baffled by his incompetence for discovery and relies mainly on his old Professor; played by Mark Margolis for advice. The film is photographed in black and white and gives us the birth of Aranofsky's trademark Hip-Hop Montage' as so eloquently viewed in Requiem for a Dream'. The color, coupled with the film's inorganic look between the fuzziness of texture within the frame to the white outs that end each of Cohen's disturbing headache sequences  demonstrate that this is no ordinary film. This film is of pure artistic merit and deserves a second viewing simply for the direction coupled with the editing of the film.<br/><br/>     As for the film itself, some may not truly understand it and the ending may leave some viewers befuddled. But what its known is that Aranofsky has given this film a timeless feel even though it occurs in present day. In an odd analogy, it reminded me of Tim Burton's look in Batman where he uses the 1950's look with the cars coupled with present day gadgetry and a gothic setting, seemingly placing our characters within different time periods. Furthermore, as heard in Aranofsky's Audio Commentary on the DVD track, he himself states that he was inspired from Terry Gilliam's Brazil' in establishing a timeless feel. For example, the introduction of Cohen's apartment shows us a dot matrix printer and a rotary phone. Aranofsky takes old technology and reinvents it for the present while maintaining an antique feel to the film.                        This film is by no means neither a conventional nor commercial film. It is quite simply the art of a Director who chooses to dwell within the psyche of troubled man so flawlessly and that gives us a profound cinematic experience. To end this, I chose a line spoken by Max in the film that can easily be applied to the appreciation of this film, If you don't understand it, it's not for you.'"

Imagine my surprise when what I saw was some of the best filmmaking I had seen in quite a while.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about this film was its complete innovation.  A film looking into the dark and deep depths of insanity is usually done through the outside world...through outside eyes looking in.  This movie, however, was the complete reverse of that look.  We look at insanity through the eyes of the insane looking outward.  What we saw was disturbing, heart-wrenching, and brilliant.<br/><br/>Acting was tremendous in this film; there were very few speaking roles, but they were all done excellently.  The music was a perfect addition to the film.  It supported what we were seeing to a tee.  The black and white just added crudeness, honesty, and mystery to what we were seeing.  It almost made me think that Maximillian Cohen saw the world in black and white...with a lot of gray in between.  A great way to show us his world, in other words. Cinematography was brilliant, and the screenplay was very well written. All come together to make quite a memorable film.<br/><br/>Mark Margolis gave one of the best supporting performances I have seen.  I question Sol's motive in this film.  Was he the voice of sanity?  Reason? Was he himself insane?  Whatever the case, he brought at least what seemed like a little more sanity to Maximillian's life.<br/><br/>Another memorable performance (or scene, if one can look at it that way) is that of Stephen Pearlman.  Playing Rabbi Cohen (Notice that this is the same last name as Maximillian.), the scene can be remembered for its sheer acting talent and for the message it brought.  Is religion in itself insanity? What was the religion's main goal here?  To know the name of God no matter what?  How far would they go?  Would they care that something happens to whoever was in the way?  This scene basically shows what Maximillian was seeing...the world was after him, after his knowledge.<br/><br/>Contrast that to his personality:  He saw society as constantly ""chasing him"" and unacceptable.  So what were we seeing throughout the film?  The world coming after him?  Or what appeared to be the world coming after him?<br/><br/>This brings the bigger question...what did we see which was sane?  Insane? That is the real beauty of this film.  It makes you think on a basic level about insanity.  Can we really draw a line between it?  What causes his insanity?  His quest for more knowledge?  Or is that his mode of medication?<br/><br/>A lot of questions are presented in this film, but that was the intent.

"bhenoo","9","0","1","15 July 2001"," One amazing work of art
","There is so much I can reveal but i shall limit myself to three important points I would like to share with the curious movie lover's mind.<br/><br/>Looking at it through an analyzing eye, I have to point out the importance of contrasts in this work of art. Not only they define the function of the absence of color but they also emphasize the techniques of this medium. In one sequence , the mixture of sound that pierces the actor's ears and yours is brusquely interrupted by complete silence which is intended. The spectator consequently enters the actor's state of mind. This metamorphosis is due to the fact that we , like the actor, live an exhausting trauma.I can also add that the silence is there to indicate the end of the actor's crisis. <br/><br/>The second point would have to be surrealism. This art form, which is seen in many movies and paintings (Dali), is revealed through the presence of what seems to be a human brain .We realize only when the actor touches it that it belongs to him. We then understand the sufferance inflicted on his brain is caused by his need to know more, to eliminate his seizures.<br/><br/>The last and third point is the message which is slowly and intelligibly conveyed. Nourished by mathematical , religious and philosophical words and images, we enter our world and its problems and redefine its essence."

","This is probably the most original film of the decade. Watching it reminds me of the Davids Cronenberg and Lynch. Aronofsky is definately one to watch out for. It is an ingenius blend of God and Mathematics. Brilliant camera work adds to the feeling of paranoia. This just shows that you don't need massive budgets and flashy special effects to make a good film. Fantastic soundtrack just adds to the pluses. An immortal Cult Classic."

","This is one of the most incredible movies I've seen in the last ten years. Perhaps it's remarkable enough that this is Arnofsky's first major film and that it's so artistically mature and entertainingly enthralling, but that's not what really amazes me.  What really amazes me is that this is the only movie I can think of that has been made in the last 20 years that I can't compare to any significant extent to any other film.  While almost all movies (even the good ones) anymore are to some degree rehashed from previous stories, Pi is really unlike anything I have ever seen or heard of before. It's a true original.  And the visuals, the utter intensity, and the incredible polish of the storytelling are absolutely mind-blowing by any measure, but especially considering how incredibly low-budget it was. Anybody who thought The Blair Witch Project was impressive on its budget should see this movie.  My only complaint is that it wasn't longer and didn't go even deeper into the concepts it examines,  but I guess we can't have everything and in reality there actually isn't any more story to be told than it already tells.  Short as it is, it's still deep enough to leave your head spinning."

","This movie Pi, it has a boring script, interesting story though and theory but you can't make a 100minute movie with this story. The miracle happen with the excellent, moody photography, the insane direction and the quick and clear(?) edit which filled the time. Ofcourse the also moody music made the result so succefull, but surelly not even COPPOLA or WELLS couldn't made it. Maybe..."
"henkensrob","8","0","1","28 June 2001"," Stuff David Lynch could have made
","The main reason I went seeing Pi was the soundtrack... When I left the theater,the only thing that wasn't on my mind anymore was whatever music that was in it.I was so stunned by the movie that I couldn't bring out any words for the first 10 minutes I left my seat: never did I see such a disturbing movie,with such a huge impact. Aronofsky's visual style reminded me immediately of Eraserhead combined with the nowadays popular music-video style,which ended up pretty nice. But what struck me most,was the emotional impact the movie had. Never before were mathematics so exciting.The plot is pretty original and at some times it was pretty ""scary"":some things really made sense...What if there were patterns ...?At the end of the movie I thought like Max,I saw what Max saw (the hallucinations which were magnificently pictured) and I felt what he felt. The story wasn't full of twists,nor did Aronofsky spend much time on the characters.This movie is all about the madness and genius of Max,and how he can't live with it anymore.One of the things a lot of people wish,is here depicted as a curse:high intelligence. The whole plot is so bizarre that David Lynch could have made the movie himself,with the only difference that Lynch's visual style isn't this powerful. Sean Gullette is great as Max.This is the only movie I saw him in and I'm still wondering why this is. At my second viewing of the movie,I concentrated more on the soundtrack and it's a pity that it's all contemporary music,otherwise the movie would have been a possible timeless classic.The music is cool,but will it be in 10 years or so? The only downside to this movie is that sometimes Aronofsky KNOWS he is a great director and writer and this results in an undefinable form of arrogance in the movie:at times it seems like Aronofsky is trying to hard to make an intelligent and ""difficult"" movie,just to show off with his talent. We'll definitely hear more about Aronofksy (Requiem for a dream is said to be a great movie and I'm wondering what he's going to make out of his Batman adventure...) I just hope he sticks with what he's good at (bizarre visuals in strange movies) and doesn't become one of the real ""Hollywood-people"",who are more interested in box office than quality..."

","An award winning low-budget, black and white cyberpunk assault on the senses, about an insane math genius and part time numerologist, Max Cohen who is desperately trying to crack the code behind the Stock Market. After accidentally discovering the hidden numbers in connection to Pi that will make him rich, a group of Orthodox Jews realize that these same random numbers also reveal the true name of God. After being chased and stalked by the Kaballah sect, and wall street thugs all searching for the complete 216-digit code, a disorienting wave of horror, hallucination and paranoia overwhelm Max. The only hard copy print out of the number is quickly memorized and destroyed. Director Darren Aronofsky (winner at the prestigious 1998 Sundance Film Festival appears on the commentary track, along with star Sean Gullette) has created an excellent pulse-pounding thriller. Who would have thought that a film about numbers would be so exciting."

"wombat-18","4","0","1","14 August 2000"," VERY Pretentious
","Sorry I'm not a native speaker so forgive some language errors; anyway what I wish to say is : there are no real characters, no dialogue - just a rather interesting use of black and white film and lighting and a very exausting score (nice drums though). I was probably expecting too much and was ""drowned by numbers"". If the message of this film is ""don't look for some hidden truth, truth is simply nature and simplicity"", then there are much much better stories/films and this film is just an illustration of ""why make simple when you can make complicated"" with just way too much show-off accessories. If that's US Indie tendancy, I regret Cassavetes among a few others"

","this could have been a very fine thriller, but the editing was way off. Scenes of Gullette's character descending into insanity took away the story's power.

","I rate this movie only a 5.  The idea is excellent and appears to build up to some wonderful discovery, but it doesn't seem to amount to anything conclusive.  I was left at the end of the movie wondering, ""what was that microchip all about and why didn't they elaborate more on that?  Why was the religious group interested in the number 216 and why didn't they elaborate on that?  Who was that black woman and why didn't they elaborate more on that?""  The end of the movie left me confused and disappointed that such an excellent theory was so poorly put together."

","Between the film techniques, the imagery, the soundtrack, the references to so many different theories and beliefs it would be difficult to try to either diagram the story, or squeeze it into a haiku.  Pi is a difficult film to nail down so do not try.  Do not try to analyze, do not try to pick apart, and do not question it.  Just relax and let it flow over you.  It is art simply film art for art's sake.  Recognize it as such."
"hugh_shanahan","4","0","1","15 March 2000"," The mathematician as paranoid obsessive migraine sufferer.
","This is a pretty disappointing affair, which is a pity given the interesting premise. Max, a mathematician who lives in a tiny apartment in New York which houses a large computer he seems to have built literally out of spit and bale wire is attempting to understand how the stock market works, not to make obscene amounts of money but simply because he finds it a beautiful problem. His life is a pretty dismal affair, as he suffers terribly from migraines, and has no friends apart from his retired supervisor whom he plays Go with. As he gets closer to the answer, all sorts of strange things start happening to his computer and various parties, i.e. a shadowy brokerage company and a very far out sect of Conservative Jews start paying an inordinate amount of interest in his work.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, apart from a reasonable understanding of high school mathematics, a thundering jungle soundtrack and lots of grainy black and white cinematography ""Pi"" desperately wants to be another Frankenstein movie : a rather condescending attitude that the attempt to understand the world is inherently dangerous and we'd all be much happier if we didn't fill our heads with nasty hard thoughts, to keep the audience interested there should be lots of gratuitous violence, blood and gore (given the budget of this movie, much of this is just plain ridiculous and doesn't in any way move the plot forward). In the second half of the movie, the script-writer really loses faith that the audience can keep up with the hard math and instead of Max's enlightenment becoming more complex and deep, it is irritatingly simplistic. I would consider the ending is a complete cop-out, which any Hollywood script writer would be proud of.<br/><br/>A wasted effort, alas."

Some say its for people into dark movies.  I didnt take that literally but I should have.  This is for people on drugs.  If you like the camera bouncing around and zooming from left to right to provide some kind of ""effect"" then this is for you.  He intentionally flys the camera all over the place and makes it look like  your on dope or something.  I think its safe to say anyone who doesent enjoy drugs wont enjoy the frustration of the schizofrenic camera work in this movie.<br/><br/>If you enjoy math you'll enjoy this movie? NOT.  There is not enough math for you to even disagree with whats going on.  I mean you dont get the chance to say ""no way"" because nothing is clear enough in this movie for you to formulate any coherent thoughts.<br/><br/>Inside the head of a mathematical genious?  I didnt get that impressions. More like an ex math professior who got dumped by his girl and is now on drugs and cant think straight and gets headaches because of it.<br/><br/>Numerous elements of a real movie are within this movie.  However, nothing is gelled and nothing leads into anything else.  its like a good book after your dog got ahold of it and ripped out several of the ""key"" pages only, like the ending.<br/><br/>Well enough from me.  I dont think anyone will really like this movie too much.  I have to say that the actors did seem good and I was actually into the movie.  So no cheezy acting, but plenty of cheezy situations.<br/><br/>

","It is too shallow. As much as it spoils everything. The subject is wonderful, rich, with enormous possibilities and amazing consequences, but the producer decided to make it easy.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't reveal something new, doesn't try to answer questions, it even doesn't pose new questions - it just repeats the old (yet unsolved) problems, literally, reiterating.
