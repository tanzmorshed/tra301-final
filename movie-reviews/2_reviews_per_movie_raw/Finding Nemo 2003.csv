","I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"" to DreamWorks films like ""Shrek."" But ""Finding Nemo"" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the ""Toy Story"" movies and in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.<br/><br/>Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in ""Finding Nemo,"" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of ""Far Side"" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.<br/><br/>Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.<br/><br/>The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.<br/><br/>Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, ""Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat."" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it."

","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.<br/><br/>
I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. <br/><br/>Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart."

","Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.<br/><br/>As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.<br/><br/>The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.<br/><br/>The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes  from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.<br/><br/>Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents."

","Pixar Studios have done it again. I have to say that these guys are totally good in computer animation, as well as in storytelling. Rarely do those qualities come together but here they are, delivering unto the audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder. Such is the marvel of Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>The story is about Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a young clownfish who is fed up with his dad Marlin's (Albert Brooks) excessive paranoia over him. He swims to a place where his dad forbids him and ends up being captured by a scuba diver. He is then placed in a fish tank in a dental clinic somewhere along the harbors of Sydney. Thus the quest of Marlin, along with Dory (a hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) to find Nemo before it's too late.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one but where the film more than makes up is on the overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colors and textures as if we aren't really watching an animated film at all. Scenes such as Marlin bringing Nemo to school while swimming through corals and anemones, to the aquarium where Nemo was taken to, are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtedbly one of the most outstanding animation ever to hit the screen.<br/><br/>The world of ""Finding Nemo"" is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under the ocean, darting across the screen in playful manners. The viewer almost literally dives into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely captivated.<br/><br/>
The music and screenplay also blend very well with the visual feast that it produces such a high quality movie. From its basic storyline, to the father-and-son relationship theme, to the wonderful underwater world throughout, this is really an adventure through an ocean of stunning visuals and storytelling.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Remember back when you were little.you know, back when tall to you was about as high as a mailbox? In those days, Disney animated films (e.g. `Lion King' and `Beauty and the Beast') were some of the coolest things out there and were movies to watch over and over (much to your parents' chagrin). Now, animated movies aren't exactly the `coolest' things to see, but an exception can be made for the uber-hip Pixar movies, the most recent of which being `Finding Nemo'.<br/><br/>After losing all but one of his brood, Marlin (Albert Brooks) an over-protective clown fish that strangely lacks a sense of humor, has resolved to protect his one (slightly disabled) `child' remaining, Nemo (Alexander Gould). But disaster strikes as Nemo is taken by a Sydney dentist and plopped into a fish tank where he is comforted by a host of other captive fish (William Dafoe, Vicki Lewis, Allison Janney, et al). But back in the big ocean Down Under, Marlin has resolved to search out his one remaining progeny.<br/><br/>Along the way on his quest, Marlin acquires a tag-along `friend', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)-a fish with, well, the memory capacity of a fish. The two must surmount hurdles like a group of sharks (Eric Bana, Barry Humphries and Bruce Spence) that have (mostly) sworn off eating other fish, a nasty swarm of jellyfish, a bird-brained flock of seagulls, and others.<br/><br/>This is the bridge! Well, in a way. Back when I was younger, one of my favorite films was `The Incredible Mr. Limpet', which, for the uninitiated, combined live-action with under-the-sea fish animation. What Pixar has done here was bring back that film to my mind and start me thinking, because they have created a wondrous undersea environment (with `normal-looking' fish instead of 1960s animated fish).<br/><br/>My favorite feature in this movie chock-full of sweet treats must be the sharks. I have always been partial to the shark family, but what has been done in creating three humorous sharks (what a movie concept), just sent paroxysms of laughter through me. Another thing that (mostly) works is Ellen DeGeneres' fish (character?) that provides a fairly constant source of laughter with her antics (although a couple gags do wear on the viewer with time). On the whole though, there is not a single bit of shoddy voice-acting or animation in it.<br/><br/>Compared to `Monsters Inc.', `Finding Nemo' is something of a revival for Pixar. I like how they have stepped up their efforts to make an altogether pleasing film without any big flaws. The thing that I did not like with `Monsters' was the inclusion of a single key (but EXTREMELY annoying) character. Director Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job at making the film work and be (basically) non-annoying to most of the general public (and this critic).<br/><br/>I suppose life has come full circle-now that I am (relatively) old as a high school graduate, animation is cool again, thanks to high-powered computers, at any rate. `Finding Nemo' is one heckuva movie and a good one to take anyone you know to, trust me on this-nine out of ten."

","Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than `Finding Nemo'?  We doubt it.  With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before.  The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.<br/><br/>Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, `Aladdin,' `Shrek' or `Toy Story 2,' it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing.  I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged `kiddie' fare in recent years.  This is a film on e can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so.  Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).<br/><br/>Like many tales designed for the junior set (`Dumbo,' `Bambi' etc.), `Finding Nemo' taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children.  It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film.  In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia.  The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke.  Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.<br/><br/>Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love.  Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.<br/><br/>As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, `Finding Nemo' takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is."

","""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.<br/><br/>The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.<br/><br/>There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.<br/><br/>The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.<br/><br/>Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations. <br/><br/>Mine, mine, mine!<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"MovieAddict2016","8","58","85","28 July 2003"," Pixar Remains the Best Family Film Industry Out There Today...
","Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2 and ""Monsters, Inc."" are some of my favorite family films; ""Finding Nemo"" isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like ""A Bug's Life,"" and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.<br/><br/>As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In ""Toy Story"" they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" they showed us the monster world. In my review on ""A Bug's Life,"" I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because ""Finding Nemo"" is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.<br/><br/>This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.<br/><br/>Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)<br/><br/>Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie ""Platoon"" might have something to do with that.<br/><br/>This is taken from my ""Monsters, Inc."" review: ""Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.<br/><br/>With ""Finding Nemo,"" I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it's almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself."
"acedj","10","3","3","13 December 2019"," Pixar has yet to top this movie.
","Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after."

","Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.<br/><br/>The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.<br/><br/>Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named ""Shark Bait"". He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.<br/><br/>FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react. The animators have done their homework for this picture.<br/><br/>This movie is quite an experience. It is a film the whole family can enjoy for years to come. It is a timeless adventure that people can enjoy. Don't let this film drift out to sea..."
"saska-3","8","51","104","2 June 2003"," Thoroughly enjoyable, but the sum does not equal the parts.
","Fresh off a viewing in a packed theater of kids and parents, my initial impression of ""Finding Nemo"" was that I had a great time throughout, but don't necessarily remember why.  The film is similar to the ""Toy Story"" pacing, in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another.  In brief summary, Marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son, Nemo, who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.<br/><br/>The visual impact of ""Finding Nemo"" is unparalleled in animated film.  At its best, it compares to the experience of seeing the sweeping landscapes of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for the first time - not until we own the DVD and my son has watched it a dozen times will I really have an opportunity to see the details crammed into the lush backgrounds of the coral reefs.  It was noticeable, however, that frequent close-ups in open water were used to reduce the amount of time spent rendering those brilliant backgrounds.  In comparison to Pixar films like ""A Bug's Life"", where every moment of the film includes rich textures and detailed background perspective, this seemed jarring at times.  It should be noted that this is true to what the ocean looks like - if you're not diving in a coral reef, you are probably seeing a lot of floating detritus and gray water - but it's worth mentioning that the fish tank environment of Nemo and his fellow captives is, at times, more interesting than the open ocean.<br/><br/>Pixar took chances (or else saved money) with many of the voice actors used in the film.  It was refreshing not to instantly ""know"" a voice was familiar in the case of many of the characters - all of them did a serviceable job, although the well-known actors also turned in some of the best performances. Ellen DeGeneres had no fear as the voice of Dory, gleefully pulling off vocal pratfalls that would have been hampered by someone else's sense of dignity.  I can think of only one other actress - Julia Louis-Dreyfuss - who I think would have been able to do Dory well.  Kudos to Ellen.  Willem Dafoe is also noticeably brilliant as Gill, and it's a bonus that the animated character he plays is gorgeously realized.  John Ratzenberger does a hysterical turn as the school of fish we all saw in the previews.<br/><br/>I am surprised at the number of characters whose voices are not credited in this film.  I wanted to know, among others, who voiced Mr. Ray the schoolteacher and the trio of parents with whom Marlin banters.<br/><br/>I laughed out loud frequently and heartily throughout the film, but at the end, I looked back and wondered how those moments of amusement added to the story.  Many people have commented that they loved the 12-step program for sharks (""Fish are our friends, not food!"") but in the final analysis, it added very little to the arc and seemed out of character (I realize I'm stating the obvious).  The frequently-dropped comedic digressions were the weak point in this picture, especially compared to ""A Bug's Life"", where the funniest moments of the film are all critical to the progress of the protagonist and impact the end of the story.<br/><br/>My 2 and a half year old son was frequently frightened to the point of crying out and grabbing on to me during the movie, and he followed the primary issues easily.  At a particular moment in the film when things seemed hopeless, I heard dozens of young children beginning to cry.  If your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments in movies, you may want to talk with them about ""pretend"" versus ""real"" and prepare them for the eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into the theater.  His final analysis was that ""the fish movie was good!"" - so take it under advisement if you have kids of similar age.<br/><br/>I give ""Finding Nemo"" an 8 out of 10 on the strength of its visual lushness, its enjoyable voice work, and its moments of perfectly timed humor.  It does not, in my opinion, match the strength as a *film* of earlier Pixar offerings, but even in its innocuous state, it's higher quality than most of the family films I've seen in the past 3 years."

","Never, and I mean, never, in my entire life, has a movie effect me the same way Finding Nemo did. It's the best movie I've EVER seen, and I know I say that about alot movie, but I actually mean it this time. Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would."

","My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail. <br/><br/>I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.<br/><br/>On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.<br/><br/>This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.<br/><br/>If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it cliché, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Scarred by the loss of his wife and eggs, Marlin has over sheltered his only child, Nemo.  However when Nemo's first day at school comes about, that mothering leads Nemo to swim out to the open ocean where he is caught by a scuba diver and be put in a fish tank far away.  Enlisting help from the forgetful Dory, Marlin tracks the boat and his ocean adventure begins.<br/><br/>Now as much as a tradition as national holidays, the latest Pixar animation arrives in the UK on a wave (d'oh!) of hype and marketing.  Officially the biggest summer film in the US and all over buses and Happy Meals (which seems a little perverse when you think about it) it is hard not to want to see it or prevent your kids from demanding they see it.  Happily the well establish benchmark of being kiddie friendly but fun for adults is maintained and the film does exactly what you know it will.  The plot is a little like Toy Story's quest but is fleshed out enough to be interesting and the themes of `letting go' and loss are actually quite well handled and will speak more to adults than kids.<br/><br/>The slight problem with the film is that is does do just what you expect and the `animated film with adult wit and kiddie characters' stuff is hardly cutting edge anymore.  However this is a picky flaw as it is still very good fun.  It may not be the strongest of this genre, indeed some bits flag and the sentimental core, while a break from cruel humour or sarcasm, does then to slow things down a bit at times.<br/><br/>The adult references are all good but not as frequent as I'd have liked  they seem to be separate from the main flow where I wanted them integral with all of it.  Clever homage's to Jaws (Bruce was the pet name of the rubber shark) and The Birds are distracting and make you feel good about yourself, and the banter is mostly witty if lacking a real sharpness at times.<br/><br/>The voice cast are all good are quite an all star bunch.  Brooks does a workmanlike job in the lead  it must be said I didn't think he distinguished himself but then he did have to carry the moral weight of the film.  DeGeneres is much better and her dippy character is a delight at times.  The support cast is not as deep and fun as in other films  Janney and Dafoe are both fun in the tank (as are all the tank characters) it's just that none of them are really consistent.  My favourite characters were the one word seagulls  `mine?'<br/><br/>Overall I have been unfair to this film in my review.  If I saw this in isolation I would be praising it to the roof, however using the others as a benchmark this does have a few weaknesses that show signs of wear and tear in the genre.  Not to cancel everything I have said, these weaknesses are all things that I realised after I had watched it  while I was watching it I was too busy laughing!  Biggest downside for me though  no comedy outtakes, booooooo!"
"TheLittleSongbird","9","6","10","3 May 2009"," What an outstanding movie!
","This movie is just gorgeous to look at, really the animation is just stunning, with the blue backgrounds and colourful characters. My only criticism is that although there are some very funny moments, like Doreen speaking whale(Ellen DeGeneres was born to speak whale, really she was) and Barry Humphries's shark, I don't think it is as laugh-out loud funny as Toy Story. Finding Nemo is definitely the most beautiful visually of the Pixar movies, I would certainly pick it over Cars. The music by Thomas Newman was just beautiful, and I always look out for this in a movie, and it was a delight hearing ""Beyond the Sea"" over the end credits. The characters are genuinely memorable, especially Doreen and Bruce. And who can forget the girl Darla, with the Psycho music?(that is really terrifying)The voice talents are very good indeed, especially Ellen DeGeneres, and I liked Willem Dafoe's Gil. Albert Brooks made a wonderfully paranoid father figure, and I loved the plot about Marlin's son Nemo being taken by divers and Marlin (a clown fish) racing to find him. That is simple, but we meet characters like the turtle, so the film is filled with fun, enough to satisfy the fussiest child. In conclusion, 9/10 for the visuals and the characters. Outstanding!

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Steve Jobs drags us all into higher awareness. He does so by grabbing our attention by conventional means but does his real work subliminally.<br/><br/>In the computer world, what we see is a coherent, accessible approach with appealing style. In the movie world we see the same, except the art of excellent character development and storytelling is substituted for sheer functionality and ease of creativity. In both, we all are pulled by this tractor into a more refined space.<br/><br/>And space is what it is all about, in particular a notion of location in space coupled with a higher degree of freedom within that space.<br/><br/>This has been a concern of intelligent filmmakers all along. Griffith merged the theatrical space with grand vistas of mass movement and did so from a spot no human would normally have. Welles and Kurosawa played with this, the first by working with architecture, the other by flattening in deep focus. But until the eighties we always had to deal with the reality of the ground -- and the horizon.<br/><br/>The real appeal of ""Star Wars"" wasn't the cowboy story or guns, nor the pseudo-religious trappings, though we all thought it was. It was the freedom from that hard bottom, the Earth which we interact with in as consistently as breath and blood. ""Star Wars"" -- and ""2001"" before -- gave a thrill because our visual vocabulary was now expanded spatially rather than ALWAYS being referenced to the floor.<br/><br/>Pixar's work has always been cognizant of this new frontier even when owned by Lucas. Under Jobs, every film has become more and more dimensional until now. We don't honk around with the camera as much as I would like, but we do set a new standard for interacting space. Naturally, all else is well crafted but serves this notion of space ? especially the fishtank business.<br/><br/>Ted?s Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
"soymilk","7","10","22","26 February 2004"," Pixar goes to the fishes
","This is a good film but overrated. There, I said it.<br/><br/>This was just too reminiscent of when 'Shrek' first hit the screens, in 2001  the 3D animation everyone was going gaga over, repeatedly hailing as the greatest animated movie ever, and yet didn't really impress me all that much. Seemingly, I was the only person on the planet to feel that way. I didn't really 'get' 'Shrek', don't especially 'get' it even now, and for some reason I didn't quite manage to 'get' 'Finding Nemo' either, the next 3D film to get the 'greatest animated movie' ever proclamation, in spite of the fact that I was really, really determined to kick off my socks and enjoy this one. Well, it's cute and it's colourful, and the idea of a father clownfish (named Marlin) trekking the ocean to be reunited with his missing son (named, oddly enough, Nemo) is a nice one for sure, but there was just something about it which left me feeling strangely unsatisfied. All in all it's a worthy venture for the Pixar cabinet, visually gorgeous and with a handful of effective moments, but seriously, they have done better.<br/><br/>The main problem comes in the story structure, which is too rambling and disjointed to do it for me. I actually agree with another viewer who commented that it felt more like that of a multi-levelled video game than a movie. All it really involves is Marlin swimming along and avoiding getting chomped by dangerous sea-dwelling predator after sea-dwelling predator. We meet plenty of interesting characters along the way, but the nature of the story means that they're removed from the action within minutes. For example, the trio of sinister but slow-witted sharks struggling to go veggie, who have a lot less screen time than the promotional posters and trailers might imply and are never given the chance to amount to much more than a few time-filling wisecracks. Nigel the pelican, in spite of Geoffrey Rush's spunky voicing, is a mostly bland character whose motives for befriending and assisting the fish are left conveniently unspoken (after all, naturally he's another sea-dwelling predator himself), and I found the surfer turtles just a tad annoying (particularly the young ones  call me heartless, but bleh!).<br/><br/>Another pretty nagging drawback is that neither protagonist, be it Marlin or Nemo, is nearly as sympathetic as past Pixar creations like Woody or Sulley. Marlin is too whiny to be truly likable, and Nemo doesn't really get the great deal of development you'd usually expect in a title character. The script is notably also less sharp than previous Pixar instalments. There was one scene in the dentist's waiting room which had me in stitches, but that was about it. It's mostly just movie in-jokes for most of the time. While in 'Toy Story' the various nods to other movies were little more than subtle extras for the sharp-eyed viewer to enjoy alongside a script brimming with plenty of witty gags of its own, they're pretty much integral to this screenplay. 'Finding Nemo' suffers from the same 'self-indulgent movie spoof' syndrome that you can find in most 3D animation from the Dreamworks stable, with a slew of constant parodies (that most of us have already seen at some point in 'the Simpsons') substituting for real humour. Usually, Pixar are always one step ahead of their rivals in this respect, but this time round even they were unable to resist succumbing to it.<br/><br/>There are certain aspects of 'Finding Nemo' that I liked. For example, Dory, the regal blue tang who trails Marlin insistently on his travels  technically she's as 2D as everyone else in this flick, her whole character consisting of little more than the one-joke comedy gimmick that she suffers from short term memory loss and can never remember quite what she's doing. There's so much potential here to be annoying, but somehow she manages to pull through and, against the odds, prove a surprisingly charming character throughout. Perhaps it comes down to Ellen DeGenere's brilliant voice work. Also, I like it that the standard comic relief sidekick can finally be female, and that Marlin and Dory manage to maintain an entirely platonic relationship throughout (no token love interests here).<br/><br/>But the most interesting character by far is William Dafoe's hard-bitten Moorish idol, Gill  he's given some hints of a personal history, yet it goes curiously understated throughout. Many of the 'Tank Gang' sequences seem pretty out of place (what does the welcome ritual have to add to the story, other than establishing the existence of that bubble volcano?), but nonetheless, some of the dialogue exchanged between Gill and Nemo is quite nice and add a sprinkling of depth to a film which I otherwise found to be just a little toohollow?<br/><br/>Plus, the sight of an angler fish caught up in a pair of diving goggles is unexpectedly alluring - still, the poor, poor creature ;)<br/><br/>'Finding Nemo' isn't a bad film by any means. In fact, it's pretty darn good. But Pixar have made other movies which, ironically, could blow this clean out of the water. In short, it's sweet and pleasant but  there's that word again - overrated.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

They don't know any better, so this becomes their only alternative at the theater, which in turn makes it three hundred million dollars.  Usually these family films pack jokes for the older crowd that only they'd understand to keep them awake, along with the kiddie stuff.  Not here.  No fun of ""Toy Story"", with characters and imaginitive action passages to keep you engrossed.  Here we're saddled with a dull hero (voice of Brooks), a quickly annoying ""dumb funny"" fish (voice of DeGeneres) and a slew of not even recognizable celebrity voices who you'd be hard pressed to guess who it is.

","""Finding Nemo"" is an American animated movie from 12 years ago and certainly one of the most known animated films in history, not only because it is an Oscar winner, but because it solidified Pixar's and Disney's collaborative efforts that went on till this date. I personally see a couple parallels to the classic ""Little Mermaid"" from almost 15 years earlier. Of course, the film takes place almost entirely under the sea, but it is also about a difficult father-child relationship and about one part of that relationship in particular, namely finding the right approach to life and letting go, i.e. find a way that will actually help him bond with his offspring again. A great film for fathers. There is not that much memorable music in here, but also lots of heart, even if a crucial love story is missing. I'm not sure if I would call Marlin/Dory one and if I do, then it's still not the core plot of the film.<br/><br/>Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich are obviously known to everybody with an interest in animated films from the last years. Same probably goes for Bob Peterson, who is a voice actor in here as well. Still, there are also ""real"" actors lending their voices to characters in this one, such as Albert Brooks, Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney or Geoffrey Rush, a personal favorite of mine. He fits nicely in here with the Australian background. Nothing to say about the animation in this 100-minute movie. It's really good. The characters are all interesting and almost all of them fun too. Even the scary sharks bring some comedy when they try to work on their image problem early on. The only really scary creatures in here were the jellyfish. Oh wait, that's not correct. The fishermen were 10 times scarier and also with the final breaking free scene probably the main antagonists.<br/><br/>I personally would say I enjoyed this film, but I also think one watch is enough. The story is fine, but it does not work on an emotional level for me as it aspires. With the exception of the truly sad prologue and Dory's ""I don't wanna forget."" maybe. The comedy is pretty good from start to fi(ni)sh with all its funny scenes and dialogs, especially Dory's. She is a crucial addition and brings great comic relief during the entire movie. Not too long anymore until we get the sequel to this one. Hopefully they'll come up with something good again, but I am positive they will. It is certainly a challenge to build something around Dory's amnesia, but it looks like they took the possibly easy way out with her gone missing this time, so the story will probably focus more on the two clownfish. Until then, ""Finding Nemo"" is worth checking out in case of the unlikely scenario that you really haven't seen it yet."

Like most Pixar movies, Finding Nemo too deals with universal themes  parenting, father-son relationship & friendship. With his crisp, funny & sometimes thought-provoking dialogues, director Andrew Stanton takes you on an adventure ride under the rich and colorful sea full of interesting creatures. This movie is so engrossing that you sometimes forget it is just an animation, especially when you see animated characters display genuine human emotions. Dory is the most unforgettable character I've come across in animated movies. Other characters too remain etched in your memory long after you've seen the movie. This movie certainly deserves a spot among the top movies of this century."

","God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their ""secret"". No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. ""Finding Nemo"" is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best."

","Judging from the reviews I just read of Finding Nemo, it looks like there are two kinds of reviewers: those who want a film that mirrors and idealizes their lives, no questions asked, and those who want a film that raises interesting questions. I'm in the latter category and as such, I have to say that this was perhaps the most boring and vapid film I have ever watched. For me, watching replicas of family, school life, dentists' offices, etc. without some sort of commentary just isn't interesting. And no, beautiful animation is not enough. So maybe we need to revisit the eighteenth century, when people -- Americans included -- were proud to think, question, and use reason in their everyday existence. Maybe that would produce an animated film that would allow Nemo and his dad to move beyond platitudes, tell the audience something new, and actually be funny (jokes in the Eisenhower era were funnier than this film).

There are good Pixar films, like ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"", but I don't think that it deserves to rank the 2nd best Disney film ever behind only The Incredibles. Now, they also leave out ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", and other classics created during Disney's life.

","I have watched this film umpteen times with my 3 year-old granddaughter (I own the DVD), and I'm going to go against the grain and say that, while others may say that Finding Nemo doesn't quite measure up, I say that in many ways this film excels. <br/><br/>I believe that what most people find lacking in Finding Nemo is the adult-oriented humor. And it's true, there is very little of it here. There is nothing approaching the risqué or double entendres here either, those things that are supposed to go over the kids' heads and give the adults a big guffaw. So, as a result, adults looking for that kind of stuff don't find it and are therefore disappointed. <br/><br/>But if my granddaughter is any kind of a yardstick to measure it by, the kids love it.<br/><br/>While this film may not be a masterpiece, it's the next best thing to it. That's because the artwork is superb, unparalleled and unmatched. The coloration, textures, use of light, and shadings are the finest that have ever been done on any animated film ever, before or since. Shrek2 and Shark's Tale, for instance, came out *after* this movie, and, good as they are (and they are very good) they are nowhere near as beautifully rendered as Finding Nemo. Particularly Shark's Tale, which in some ways seemed to be a blatant theft and rip off from Finding Nemo, but in my opinion fails because it's just not as good, either art-wise or story-wise.

","3D Animation Quality:  Beautiful  5/5  (truly spectacular)<br/><br/>Story:  Meh! Lacks creativity 1/5 (Find a better script next time)<br/><br/>My 2-Cents:<br/><br/>Disney and Pixar are an amazing team.  Pixar has put together some really nice films that will go down in history for their impact in the animation industry.  There is no question that this film was an excellent a crowd drawer and everything Disney and the industry needed at this time.<br/><br/>I love Pixar and their contributions to contemporary cinema.  The film however was a great disappointment to me.  One of the things I have grown to enjoy when watching a Pixar Film is their shorts before the actual movie begins.  They showed their classic short, ""Knick Knack"" which was produced in way back in 1989.  I was hoping to see a new short.  I loved ""Geri's Game"" and ""For the Birds"".<br/><br/>My biggest beef was not about that.  It involved the story itself.  Toy Story 1 & 2 was written to appeal to both young and older audiences. Finding Nemo seemed to have it's target directly on the kids.  There's nothing terribly wrong w/ that, it's just the story was too simple.  It seemed like the movie was jammed full of FILLER just to lengthen the movie. We could have done without the sharks, for example.  Their role in the film was simply to extend it by a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>The novelty of 3D animation is gone.  It's not the 1990's anymore.  People are familiar with complex 3D animation.  It's everywhere we look.  Pixar cannot rely on drawing an audience simply because the film is a 3D animation.  Remember how poorly Final Fantasy did?  The film had great animation with incredibly realistic human characters.  Square One did an amazing job on the animation that just blew me away.  But the story was not appealing to the mass audience.  So, where are they now?  The movie BOMBED and the company literally went bankrupt.<br/><br/>Pixar should remember one thing.  Parents have to sit through the film too. Just spend a little more time on the script for your next movie.<br/><br/>You haven't lost a loyal viewer in me, however.  I have a lot of faith in John Lasseter's team. I expect great things from the Pixar and Disney in the near future!"

","I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie ""Lion King"" or the first ""Toy Story"" did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.<br/><br/>6.9/10"

","This movie is surely an achievement in a technical point if view. No need to argue about that. But there is a great problem : it tries to please adults as well as children in an over-speeded plot full of clichés. Do really children need so much complexity and action scenes ? I am not sure about that. Maybe children need more time to understand what is happening on the screen. Too much speed creates a stressed up and confusing atmosphere.<br/><br/>There is too much violence and the characters are shallow and stereotypical (I found the turtles to be extremely boring). The anthropomorphic approach of animal characters is becoming more and more out of date. Disney did it a thousand times and I still don't know if it is really a pertinent way of exlplaining things to children. Paradoxal ? A shallow movie set in the dephts of the ocean...

Yet another sign of some deep, sinister perversity in the Disney organisation. Every time I go to a Disney movie, I do so in a state of innocent anticipation, and every time I'm bitten by their warped morality. The Lion King was another case in point. The fact that these things are aimed at children and vetted approvingly by parents who seem oblivious to the underlying theme forces one really to consider to what extent movies like this are a reflection of the values of modern Western society, - or whether they work to bring about those values. Either way, I would be less frightened of the future if they where more frequently subjected to the accusatory criticism they deserve."

But when both Marlin and Coral needs to hide from their predator, Coral stays so worried with the eggs that runs out of their shelter to save them.

I mean i'm not that into animation films but I found Shrek quite enjoyable and other children's films like the lion king and the Jungle Book were vastly superior.<br/><br/>For a start Nemo himself is incredibly annoying and I was hoping throughout the movie that a shark would come along and snap him up (knowing full well this would never actually happen). Secondly the story line reaches new heights of insanity. All movies aimed at young audiences are silly but this one is so much worse and stupider than any of the other ones. It's boring it's sad and it makes me feel embarrassed than something so horrible and ugly in film could be enjoyed by so many people.<br/><br/>Nemo actually means nobody, suggesting that even the guy who came up with the title is laughing at this movie.

The characters along the way are priceless, with clever dialogue, quirky sensibilities, and, ultimately, love for one another. The creators were able to capitalize on the innate, somewhat stereotypical, qualities of the individual sea denizens by using some of our current comic geniuses (like Ellen DeGeneres) and make them charming.

"RayKarago","9","2","3","15 April 2015"," Do I even need to talk about why this movie rocks ?
","Well, apart from possibly, say, the Toy Story films, Finding Nemo has taken the world by storm as Pixar's biggest hit. And to be honest, it deserves that credit.<br/><br/>First of all, this is up there with ""Basil"" as one of the mist f***ed up openings for a kids film. I mean, you open up with a mother all but one of her offspring being eaten by a vicious predator. I like kids films that can do that, not always trying to be family friendly. Apart from that, the film is really awesome.<br/><br/>The strength from the film comes from its characters, there are too many to count and normally that would hurt a film but here, there are all so different and memorable. Albert Brooks is great as Merlin, who, in my opinion, is one of the great film dads. You really end up feeling for this guy and yeah he can be annoying in how introverted and protected he is but its all coming from a place of legitimate pain that the audience is introduced to early on, thus you are put on his journey. Dory is freaking hilarious. You'd think the memory loss story line would get old but it is cleverly worked in so that it is fresh in every situation. The other characters are all so fun and none of them were annoying, you enjoyed watching all of them. The additional voice talents of Willem Dafoe, Geoffry Rush, Eric Bana and many others help the cause as well. My favorite characters where the turtles, that is just how I have always envisioned turtles speaking.<br/><br/>The film is set in modern day Australia, again using modern day settings (and a unique one at that) and there is no feeling of manipulations. You never feel that the film is trying to be ""cool"" no need for catch phrases or pop cultural references, just a new setting that allows for some nice shots. The film still has a timeless feel.<br/><br/>If I had one issue with the film, its that the climax feels a little forced. Without giving away too much, there is an incident that happens at the end where a character tries to prove themselves and it just didn't feel needed.<br/><br/>Overall, Finding Nemo is one of my favorite animated films ever and is fit for kids, teens, adults, hell its just fit for the whole family."
"Victor Field","Null","2","3","25 October 2003"," You know what they say about not fixing something that ain't broke...
","A number of folks have complained about ""Finding Nemo"" not being up to the standards of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" - and it's true that it's not perfect; when you think about it, the Andrew Stanton/Bob Peterson/David Reynolds script has a slightly similar plot to the adventures of Buzz, Woody et al (for a toy being taken read a little clownfish missing). Plus the movie suffers from a few too many climaxes (probably because unlike most American animated features, this has a three-figure running time), and there's a definite sign of a formula to Pixar movies.<br/><br/>But we'd be so much better off if all movies had it: Pixar movies have proper screenplays, packed with wit and warmth (and restraint - like the pinnacle of the climax of ""A Bug's Life,"" the horrible incident that launches the movie takes place off screen); they have good casts performing the characters, with a particular nod here to Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe (though one wishes Nemo had a bit more dimension to him); they have plenty of effort put into the look of the movie (one of the strongest achievements is that the undersea world of the Pacific is a lot more comforting than the dry land world of Australia, so that you feel alarmed whenever the action cuts to Sydney); and they have the sense to not go overboard with any cultural references.<br/><br/>It has to be said that it's a bit slow going at first, but fears that it'll be Pixar's first real disappointment are soon allayed; with some impressive animation, plenty of fine moments throughout and a wonderful score from Thomas Newman that gives the proceedings a breath of fresh musical air after his cousin Randy's efforts (so when can we expect David Newman to work for Pixar?), this ultimately ends up as another good effort from the bouncing lamp - who else would have a family movie include the music credit ""'The Murder' Written By Bernard Herrmann"" (it serves as the ""theme"" for an Elmyra Duff type who Nemo's in great danger from in the air-breathers' world)? It goes without saying that staying for the closing titles is a must, Robbie Williams's undesired song notwithstanding - no ""outtakes"" this time, but never mind.<br/><br/>""I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine.

"soanim8ed","9","2","3","26 May 2003"," How I Found Finding Nemo
","If you can get past the first 15 minutes of Pixar's latest, you'll get a movie that is on par with their four other feature films.  Finding Nemo turns out to be a big, adventure film with a lot of laughs and a heart that is barely on the good side of manipulation.  Once the adventure starts, the emersion into the film begins and doesn't let you go.<br/><br/>The movie plays up on over-protective parents, kids overcoming their disabilities, friendships conquering obstacles, addicts joining together to be better people (uh, fish), building self-esteem, realizing and accepting strengths and curmudgeons learning to lighten up.  All this in an animated, family-oriented, 'G' movie?  You bet! Pixar are the masters at the making everyone happy film.  They give the parents being dragged into the theater something to enjoy as well.<br/><br/>If only they had done something with that beginning.  The films opens in a fish suburbia complete with happy families, beautiful homes and a peaceful way of life all with no hint of sardonic humor.  Yes, there are people who think that is heaven, but what about those who make fun it?  At least give them something to chuckle about.  It's Utopia for the Family Values set and completely out of character for Pixar.<br/><br/>It's at this point I thought they had finally produced their first sub-standard film.  That is until a barracuda changes the main characters lives forever and Albert Brooks goes into, well, Albert Brooks mode.  Marlin (Albert Brooks) has a son, Nemo, who has an underdeveloped fin and therefore can't swim well.  This combined with the catastrophe at the beginning of the film causes Marlin to smother Nemo.   Nemo, finally fed up, rebels, ends up being caught by a diver and spirited away.  Marlin sets out after Nemo and that's when the film finally picks up with some adventure and some laughs.<br/><br/>And when that laugh level is revved up, it's supplied by the scene-stealing Ellen DeGeneres as a blue tang named Dory.  Dory is basically an idiot savant. She has a severe short-term memory loss problem.  Now fish are believed to have no short-term memory so the jokes on the surface play on this; however, in a scene where Dory is faced with being alone without friends again, you wonder if it's a form of denial.  She says in the scene that she doesn't want to forget anymore and that having Marlin around helps her remember because he is the only one that has stuck by her.  Does she really have this problem or is it that she is so disappointed with no one understanding her that she hides everything? The scene is multi-layered and heart wrenching.  Ellen plays it surprisingly well as if she identifies with what Dory is going through. That's what makes the scene work so well.  Many of us have gone through the same thing and know how she feels.<br/><br/>There are many, many memorable scenes in the film as Marlin attempts to find Nemo who is now in a fish tank in a dentist office.  One of the scenes is supplied in a superb performance by William Dafoe as Gill, an angelfish in the tank with Nemo who is from the ocean (not a pet store) and dreams of escaping and taking his new friends with him. He devises a scheme to get them out that is hair-brained and daring, but with one little plot hole that the film plays up to hilarious effect at the end.  Another great scene is with a trio of sharks that have sworn off fish in the most unlikely AA meeting imaginable.  Their motto:  ""Fish are our friends and not food!""<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is grand and exciting adventure that once it gets beyond it's slow opening turns into exactly what you expect from the masterminds at Pixar.  A film that is imaginative and visually stunning with big adventures for everyone no matter how old they are on the outside."

It was somewhere in the middle for Me, it is a cute family film if You have Young kids, but it is missing something. The beginning is everything, it can make or break a film, now the start to finding Nemo set the tone for the movie and served it's purpose well. The movie had nice points but at times became boring and seemed to drag on, leaving Me wishing that I could skip on to the good parts. Basically this Male clownfish has a wife in the beginning with dozens of newborn eggs who will develop into little fish, a large creature comes attacks the family, knocks Him out, kills His wife, and all of His eggs but one, Nemo His Son who He will become protective off. Then We see how Nemo becomes a energetic but hardheaded child and get's into trouble, even landing Him in a situation were He is taken by Man and dropped in a fish tank. His Dad searches for Him like any parent would, and He runs into a few new friends on the way, including an unintelligent Female fish named Dori. After this, a bunch of foolishness they find the kid and the end...yay? Anyway the movie is short of heartfelt and emotional, just simply to keep Your 5-8 year old kid's attention. It can teach You to keep going in life though, I will give it that. I have seen better, but then again I have also seen worse. It is a pretty simple non-complex storyline that is easy to follow, but doesn't leave You with anything to think about. I have high standers for Kid's film actually, I believe they should be given quality movies and life lessons because they are our youth and the future, not just any mindless old thing. It's okay to have a comedy once in a while that is funny hahaha, but this movie just isn't it and leaves a lot to be desired.

"pinstripe","Null","1","1","30 July 2003"," The least of the Pixars
","Out of all of Disney's co-attempts at modern cartoonism with their Pixar partnership, Finding Nemo was the least appealing, and least captivating. The story describes a father and son clown fish who are separated when the boy is kidnapped from their coral housing, and the father so bluntly [as the title projects] searches for ""finding Nemo,"" and that is your entire movie plot. [Now, spoilers]<br/><br/>The search is endless and takes the fun out of Disney and Pixar.  Whereas Toy Story was also based on the ""eternal search quest"" type of story model, at least the characters were beloved, and captivating.  Yes, Nemo is a cute fish who the audience love due to his strong nature, and messed up fins, but he can hardly carry the film on his own.  Disney even hired Ellen DeGeneres in to voice Marlin's [Nemo's father, Albert Brooks] trip companion, Dory. But it's hard to not look at the fish and think of Ellen.  Personally, I know that when I watch a cartoon, I want to be taken away in the art and not refer back to real life and the pop culture surrounding it. <br/><br/>
The rest of the cast is mostly ho-hum, and the story just drags on until [literally] the fish comes home.  It was certainly a good attempt, but by the nature of the too-cool surfer turtles that Nemo meets along his way, it's clear that these movies' goodness has abruptly started to head down that dreary road where the creators are trying to appeal to everyone, and just starting to scare half the audience into other interests."

","Pixar put together a fairly entertaining film with Finding Nemo, especially in light of the crop of terrible Hollywood offerings this summer (Matrix 2 and The Italian Job come to mind).  Not as engaging or amusing as Monsters, Inc, but still an enjoyable diversion.  I had expected this film to be a lot funnier than it was-- there were far too many times when it seemed the writers sensed they needed more comedy and decided, ""Oh, we'll have the Ellen character forget something.  Again.""  But there was enough about the movie that was amusing to keep my attention.<br/><br/>The major problem I had with the movie is that Disney and Pixar had a wonderful opportunity to make a fairly strong environmental comment with the potential to reach millions of future consumers (and potential polluters), yet they failed enormously.<br/><br/>I didn't buy a ticket to Finding Nemo expecting to see a ""message movie."" I did, however, expect to see the issue of pollution touched on, even in an antiseptic, stock-holder-friendly Disney kind of way.  There were numerous opportunities for this, specifically at the point when Marlin and Dora enter Sidney harbor and are officially in man's domain.  Yet Disney repeatedly dropped the ball.  After having established a lovable cast of characters that the audience was entirely in love with, Disney easily could have presented at least a hint of the idea that mankind is doing serious and possibly irreparable damage to the environment.  And that mankind can do something about it.<br/><br/>But that's alright, because Nemo went on to score the biggest opening weekend of any animated film!  And in the end, that's what it's all about, right?"

But it is cute enough to hold the attention of youngsters also. Although, I would say that very young children would probably not be best suited for this movie. It is very fast paced and deals with a subject that could be scary to a kid. Just image being 3 and seeing a movie in which a kid has no mother and is taken away from his father. Then the father is chased by sharks, and while the sharks were cute and rather humorous, they could still scare little kids. Many of the very young children in the theater were crying and screaming at various parts. Maybe children under 5 or 6 should wait till video to see this so it isn't so loud and overwhelming.<br/><br/>Other than that, I loved it! I am 22 and saw it with my 46 year mom and we thought it was wonderful. You are never too old for these movies!"

","Marvellous, Marvellous. Bravo for our best animation of recent years. Finding Memo was a tough, tough feature film to make in terms of it's character constructions and underwater effects.  I found that one of the unique thing about this film is that each fish(species) has a absolute mono personality, which pushed this animation into a higher level, and of course harder to make too. Thanks to our smart and hard working creaters.  This film pushes animation industry to a position in which it should be by now, although the whole underwater scenery still look CG so to speak, but if we look back at toy story I, the fish are more real and people like. We have to accept that audiences are much more ""comfortable"" to see such a touching, funny, CG Feature Film.  But I have to say that this is not the best a computer can do, this is just a milestone of animation industry, after N years, I'm sure that all the actors and actresses are retired and mousing themselves moving in front of a monitor."

This is a great, entertaining movie for everyone from aged 6 to 106. It may be a little too intense for very young children (under 6). Otherwise, it's a nearly perfect mix of great computer animation (countless eye candies in life-like ocean setting), a refreshing take of an old plot, fun and intense actions, adult humor and homage to old classics like Shinning. At times, it was poignant and inspiring but never preachy. A must see indeed."
"Bladerunner•","10","1","1","6 June 2003"," Excellent film, especially for fathers and sons...
","I have two sons, one six and one nine; we hugged, laughed and cried during this whole film. People that whined that their kids were ""traumatized"" by the action must be smothering their children. Only a very small child (well under two) or a kid in desperate need to loosen the grip from mommy's apron strings could possibly be ""terrorized"" by this film. Movies are about love, loss, fear, laughter, surprise, etc. Asking a film to be some bland thing that every little wimpy baby can see without boo-hooing is absurd. Get a life, and quit raising simps.<br/><br/>The message of the film is very pertinent, especially in today's world, yet it is not bludgeoned over the audience's head. It takes head on the fact that children are increasingly pushing for more freedom at a younger age, and shows that a balance can be reached. It doesn't shy away from the fact that danger exists, and no parent can safeguard against every possible threat. It embraces the fact that each parent must loosen the grip, while maintaining as safe an environment as possible.<br/><br/>Another wonderful aspect concerns little Nemo's ""lucky"" fin. He actually has a damaged, or handicapped right fin, although the movie never portrays Nemo as disabled, in the traditional sense. Instead it is an allegory for a parent's justifiable reluctance to allow their children to pursue their own independence in a dangerous world - and a very subtly powerful one at that.<br/><br/>The voice talents are excellent, with Ellen DeGeneres stealing the show. Even if you don't like her, you'll like her... here. Willem Defoe and Albert Brooks also give performances, which take advantage of their public image, but add delightful twists to deepen the impact.<br/><br/>It is a film that focuses on the father/son relationship throughout, whereas many Disney movies kill off the dad early on. This isn't to say that everything is all roses here either. Caulk a realistic relationship, with the faults and missteps present therein to a Pixar team that increasingly continues to school animation studios on the fact that STORY MATTERS MOST.<br/><br/>This film is a great opportunity for families to feel close to one another without the impression you checked your brain at the door to achieve that. My boys and I hugged for five minutes after this film ended, and then proceeded to crack up during the humorous end credits. Parents who balk at the fear factor, need to put away the pampering powder and concentrate on bringing up kids equipped to deal appropriately with a frightening world, at that age. It's not Alien for crying-out-loud. What it is, is great movie-making and real fun, especially for families with strong, independent kids testing boundaries - as all healthy children do."

Great picture for the whole family, nothing offensive or scary.  Clever inside jokes here and there.. for instance the Shark's name is Bruce, this was the name given the mechanical shark in Jaws by the film crew.<br/><br/>Pixar has delivered another top notch film, imho they are batting 1.000, all 5 movies have been good to great and all of them are still fun to watch again."

"garethvk","Null","1","1","28 May 2003"," A Must sea Movie
","The technical magicians at Pixar are back with the new animated film `Finding Nemo' that tells the story of a loving but overprotective Clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks), as he ventures out into the deep ocean to save his son Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has been taken from his home by divers.<br/><br/>    The loss of Nemo is devastating to Marlin as he lost his wife and all of their eggs save for Nemo and has become very timid in the time since and he fears venturing beyond the safe confines of his home area.<br/><br/>
     Driven by the love for his son, Marlin sets out to follow the boat that has taken his son, even though it takes him deep into the dangerous Ocean and forces him to confront his own fears to save his son. Along the way Marlin encounters Dory (Ellen DeGeneris), a sweet but very absent-minded fish who tags along with Marlin to provide comedy relief for the story.<br/><br/>
     There is also a very good side story involving Nemo and a group of fish in a tank as they bond and try to formulate the grand escape to freedom and return Nemo to his father.  <br/><br/>     What follows is a very funny and charming story as the two fish encounter everything from sharks in a 12 Step program trying to change their image to a migration of surfer dude turtles. Of course there are dangers along the way and parents should be cautioned that some scenes did cause tears from some of the very young viewers in the screener that I attended.<br/><br/>
     While the plot is not the most complex story in the world, it is more than appropriate for the target audience of the film and there are more than enough laughs and smiles in the film to keep even the most jaded adult tuned in. The computer artistry is amazing as it is awash in motion, textures, and colors without being to frantic and providing an array of amazing visuals. I was very impressed at how each creature had detailed facial expressions that carried their emotions without having to rely heavily on the dialogue to convey feelings. In summary, `Finding Nemo' is an absolutely charming film and a true family classic that should not be missed. The film is easily the best work ever from Pixar, and that is saying something with their very impressive resume.<br/><br/>

He meets a very forgetful (sometimes just downright stupid) Dory. They spend the rest of the movie doing stupid things. They find the diver's mask that took Nemo. Dory ,in a memorizing spree, memorizes the address written on it. They eventually find him ,of course, and the movie thankfully ends. I would have written more, but it pains me to write even this. Nemo's voice is very whiny and annoying. Ellen is an okay Dory ; I don't think the greatest actors or actresses in the world could have saved this one.

"CyberJackhammer","1","13","41","12 January 2005"," Really?
","When given a poll between watching Shrek 2 or Finding Nemo, I decided to choose Finding Nemo after being told of its high-quality laughs and worthy entertainment value. I'm not a big fan of Shrek 2 but *sigh* this was a bad choice.<br/><br/>What many people consider to be witty and original is what I see as imports from early Chaplin films and episodes of the Simpsons. Finding Nemo is the story of the eponymous fish, Nemo. Nemo is the only survivor of his batch after his brothers and sisters (along with his Mother) were eaten by sharks in the egg stage. However Nemo survived (albeit deformed) along with a paranoid Father.<br/><br/>The jokes seem tired and lack any moments of stomach-rumbling chuckling but rather a series of humoured snorts. Although the main character of Nemo is likable, the other two major characters are not. Ellen Degeneres' role as Dory is so irritating that you start hoping the diver comes back and batters Dory then at least somebody will get some use out of the poorly-designed character.<br/><br/>Although there are smart ideas it becomes jumbled up in overly-immature jokes that decrease the entertainment value. For example the sharks that are dedicated to soothing their blood lust is worth some giggles but it gets lost in the sea(pardon the pun) of poor remarks. I should have known that the immaturity and basicness of the jokes would never stop coming. I assumed there would be a 15 minute farting sequence later on.<br/><br/>When Nemo goes to school he breaks away from the pack and is captured by divers causing his Father and an oddball fish to venture after him. Now this seems to be an original plot filled with many creative avenues on which to expand but what turns out to potential ends up as excrement."
"erv-7","5","4","9","26 November 2009"," good and bad at same time
","The movie is both good and horrible at same time.<br/><br/>The Good: It has a lot of absolutely hilarious moments and scenes. Many of them of those involve ""Dory"" character, which also has excellent voice acting. There are a lot of places where you will laugh (well, unless you have absolutely no sense of humor). <br/><br/>The Bad: The parts that aren't funny are extremely weak. Plot and characters involve a lot of clichÃ©s, characters have nearly no personality (perhaps with exception of ""Dory"" fish), they don't really develop much. All scenes that are supposed to bring any emotional impact(or to be tragic) simply doesn't work and feel unnatural, often they feel ""out of place"". I had to skip certain moments because they were extremely boring to me and I felt like I saw something similar before.<br/><br/>Summary: There is only one truly memorable and interesting character in this movie: the ""Dory"" fish. ""Dory"" certainly looks better than both ""protagonists"" (father and son), mostly because of excellent voice acting. Besides ""Dory"" it is hard to miss certain little girl (because of music theme and associated funny scene) that appears on screen for a short time. There are many funny moments, but outside of them movie offer very little. Overall it is much weaker than ""Up""/""Wall-E"" (which were released several years later) and may be on par with Ratatoille. Graphically movie isn't bad, but isn't impressive either, and I could swear I saw texture filtration artifacts or poor bump-mapping work in two places, although I'm not completely sure about it. Animation is perfect as always, but it doesn't save you from weak parts in the story.<br/><br/>So if you want few laughs and don't mind mediocre story - this is for you. If you want ""deep"" story, you can skip this movie."

It is uncomplicated by any element not approved by committee, which means you get regurgitated under-sea relationships, with slightly modernized shtick. (Yep, there's a shark chase, but he's in recovery ?!) Take any three familiar mass market plot lines and average them together and you get something as tepid as this. This movie was gone from my mind the second it ended. I don't recall a frame of it.<br/><br/>The only way you could be a fan of this movie is if you think a movie is supposed to spell everything out for you and cause you to emote every twenty minutes.

","I mean, HONESTLY! This is supposed to be a kiddie flick, right? So, in classic Disney fashion...five minutes in, two days short of hatching, Mum is devoured by a barracuda -- along with 499 of our title character's siblings. WHY??? This movie made me squirm (pun only gently intended). I can't remember a time I've been more uncomfortable watching a film so blatantly marketed at children.<br/><br/>I'm a playwright, folks, an award-winning one at that. I GET the concept of conflict as a dramatic device...but must we keep our cutesy-poo lead in constant peril (sharks, nets, aquarium filtration systems, etc.) I'm really disappointed in how gratuitously MANIPULATIVE this feature is, and saddened that the filmmakers think so very little of the audience to foist such drivel on us, disguised as a family film. Sure, it was lovely to look at...but I can't say much more in its favor. I would NEVER recommend this unnecessarily violent, surprisingly distressing, unintentionally maudlin, unbearably sentimental movie for a child -- or an adult.<br/><br/>
WHY this film continues to rake it in at the box office, and why critics predict this as an Oscar favorite is beyond my abliity to understand. I'm no crochety grump, either (well, at least I wasn't BEFORE I watched this dreadful film). This is just another classic example of Disney lackeys putting FORMULA ahead to STORY and SENSE, all in pursuit of the bucks. Walt must be spinning in his cryogenic chamber at the thought of his name being sullied by association with this horrible film.<br/><br/>Parents: do your kids a favor: If they love the little fishies...take them to a real aquarium instead of subjecting them to even one minute of this bizarre and misguided cash cow with mouse ears.<br/><br/>I want the last two hours of my life back."

Zombie had that guy too, but you always knew that Zombie wanted you to see him as psycho. In this Disney movie, the guy who wants to eat you isn't psycho. He's just a silly silly guy.<br/><br/>The final scene shows a half-dozen fish trapped and slowly dying of suffocation. That's a good alternate to the standard wiggling on spikes.<br/><br/>Like all actors in horror movies, the fish don't even know that they are going to die.<br/><br/>If they do more movies like this, the phrase ""don't go in the plastic bag"" could become as common as ""don't take a shower"" or ""don't go in the basement."" I give it three stars for the body count. But this is supposed to be a comedy. It doesn't have Leatherface's sight gags, Chuckie's one-liners, or even Pinhead's biting sarcasm.

I can understand why Marlin is so over protective over his son because he lost his wife and other kids. But for one Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) was annoying. A lot of people say that Dory is funny but I disagree I thought she was irritating. I just wanted to strangle her. She kept on forgetting everything. At around the end of the movie she says to Marlin (Nemo's dad) that she ""Remembers stuff whenever she's around her"" Um I have to call BS on that because the only thing she could remember was Sydney and she couldn't remember anything else. And the sharks. The sharks are hypocrites. They say that ""Fish are friends! Not food!"" but you clearly see a shark with fish bones in its mouth. That's really hypocritical! Sometimes Marlin got annoying with how overprotective he was. I mean god I thought Simba was over protective in Lion King 2 but Marlin tops him! The music in the movie is nothing special. You might think that I hate this movie because of the negative things I have said about it no I don't hate it. I liked the turtles, the birds that repeatedly said ""Mine!"", the main character that was a bird that helped Marlin and Dory. The plot was good enough to keep me interested but as I have said, it's overrated. Doesn't top Toy Story 1-3. So I give Finding Nemo a 6 out of 10."

"dolneshom","6","3","6","16 April 2005"," Cruelest beginning for a kids' movie . . .
","Okay, if you don't want to know anything about the beginning of the movie, stop reading. *** Our movie begins with idyllic life on the reef. We find two clownfish, Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) enjoying their new home (a sea anemone). He's concerned it's not big enough, she says it will be just fine, and they check on their 500 children, which are quivering fish fetuses in translucent fish eggs. Ah, how nice, how cute! Suddenly though, out of nowhere, a barracuda shows up and attacks the home. Marlin does the best he can, telling Coral to hide inside the anemone; however, Coral's concerned about the ""kids"" and goes to save them. The barracuda then swats Marlin unconscious into the protective tendrils of his home, and everything fades to black. When Marlin comes to, Coral has disappeared (we assume she's become dinner) and every single one of the eggs has been either destroyed or eaten except for one -- Nemo.<br/><br/>Of course, as if killing Marlin's wife and kids off wasn't cruel enough, Nemo suffers from a birth defect, which results in him having a ""gimp fin."" Dad refers to it as Nemo's lucky fin, but at this point, I'm just thinking that there's nothing lucky about this family of fish.<br/><br/>From here on, the movie takes on a decidedly lighter tone, but it's not long before Nemo's snapped up by some skin divers and taken away to a new home in a dentist's aquarium. This is where the real plot of the film begins.<br/><br/>The film is a journey film, and as such, it merely acts as a pretense for a wide variety of loosely related sketches. At times, the sequences seem like they could function on their own as stand-alone shorts. If you don't like a sequence, skip it on the DVD player -- you won't have missed much -- you can just assume that Marlin and Dory (his forgetful companion in the movie)have yet escaped another life-threatening and/or humorous random encounter and are now back on track, searching for Nemo.<br/><br/>Also, like many other Pixar films, there's a lot of satirization of the ordinary, work-a-day world around us. Nemo's aquarium home becomes a metaphor for densely-packed urban areas filled with cubical-dwellers. Also, a ""Flock of Seagulls"" serves as an amusing reminder of the idiocy of blind greed and mob mentality.<br/><br/>Still, the movie's a bit overlong with a few too many cliffhangers at the end. Just when it seemed the movie should have been wrapping up, there was ONE MORE crazy, death-defying action sequence tacked on to tie up a loose end that I didn't really care about. The Incredibles had a similar false-ending/new crisis ending, but that movie's ""new crisis"" was entertaining rather than mundane. By the near end of Nemo, I was simply thinking, ""Let's get back to the reef!"" <br/><br/>The animation was wonderful, but overall, the story seemed labored, disconnected, and imperfect. Dory provided some great laughs but also got on my nerves. There were parts I loved (seagulls, Sharks Anonymous, the Aquarium, turtles, Dory) but there were parts that either bored or annoyed me (the whale, the jellyfish, the net, the deep sea creature, and Dory). A mixed bag to be sure."

","""Finding Nemo"" is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful films you are ever likely to see. Next time you watch it, try this for an idea. Press your mute button and watch it without sound for a while, particularly the scene where Mr.Ray (Bob Peterson) takes all the little fish, including Nemo (Alexander Gould), through the coral reef towards the infamous drop off. It's still as enjoyable!<br/><br/>The film starts off quite darkly, which is odd considering the nature of the rest of the film - quite light-hearted. It is, however, an essential part of the story, explaining how the fear of Marlin (Albert Brooks) towards the ocean came about, and also as a result the over-protectiveness he has over his son, Nemo.<br/><br/>The storyline itself is pretty simple: Nemo gets captured by a scuba-diving dentist, Marlin swims off to rescue him. What helps the story is the many different and fantastic characters that he meets along the way to ""P Sherman, 42 Wallabe Way, Sydney"". This is of course where he meets the fantastic Dory (played here brilliantly by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory is quite possibly one of the funniest characters in a Pixar movie EVER. Her short-term memory loss is an inspired comedic characteristic that results in some great lines. For example:<br/><br/>""It (the memory problem) runs in my family. At least I think it does. Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you?""<br/><br/>There are other good characters in this story, though. there are the three friendly sharks, whose motto is ""Fish are friends, not food"". This proves to be their undoing, particularly Bruce's (Barry Humphries - you know, Dame Edna Everage?), resulting in a good chase sequence through a sunken submarine and mine field. We have the school of fish who enjoy making exciting 3d moving pictures (voiced singularly by John Ratzenberger, Pixar's lucky mascot). And of course you cannot forget the ""Righteous! Righteous!"" sea turtles.<br/><br/>Nemo meets interesting characters in the dentist's aquarium as well, including Gill (Willhelm Daefoe), who is constantly trying to get back into the ocean from whence he came. The rest are all pretty much bonkers - a cleanliness obsessed fish, a smelly blowfish, and a schizophrenic fish whose ""sister"", Flo, appears every time she looks through the glass of the aquarium.<br/><br/>Finally we have the non-swimming characters. The dentist is probably responsible for the scene where more people became scared of them then Laurence Olivier's performance in ""Marathon Man"". His removal of the tooth of the ""Prime Minister"" is a great line that doesn't register first time around. This is probably because Nigel (Geforry Rush) has just crashed into the window. Very funny, and also a rather interestingly detailed knowledge of dentistry. Finally there is the movie's token ""villain"" of sorts - Darla, the dentist's niece, and now famous for been associated with the ""Psycho"" theme for young people.<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable every time you watch it. Throughout it we see the change in attitude towards the ocean in Marlin's behaviour and dialog, and Dory is always there beside him to provide yet another witty comment. (My girlfriend particularly likes the one about men asking for directions). It is also interesting to note that the final opponent to the success of this magnificent quest is humans themselves - in this case, fishermen. Just as in ""Bambi"" with the hunter and his mother - sniff - we are portrayed as heartless predators who are tampering with the beauty of nature. The fact that there is no dialogue or anything at all characteristic about the two fishermen makes the anonymity of them even more sinister. <br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant movie. Watch it. Watch it again. It rocks! And remember, ""just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming...""<br/><br/>9/10"

","After a good year has passed (well, it wasn't really a good year in my life, nor was it a good year in the cinema, but it was undoubtedly a long year, allow us all to the calm down. Finding Nemo is a children's movie. It is not an achingly poetic masterwork of biblical proportions. For all its polished aesthetic splendor, it is one of many recent Pixar cuddle-tear smorgasboards that have smack of the Pixar ""formula."" This is, of course, more multifaceted than you might hope. First, and foremost there is the element of the micro society where one least expects it: the anthropomorphic personification in various aspects of the animal kingdom or underwater or inanimate objects like toys, insects pretty much anything that looks cute. Pixar, which has modeled itself on Disney (for starters...in that, it is trying and succeeding to be the 2nd successful animation studio in the history of the cinema) is taking a page from Herr Walt, but not just simply by making animals...talk. There is the now mandatory wacky assortment of characters in whatever new environment our cutesy little poopy poof protagonist enters: usually an inexplicably dumb character, a hardened, raspy-voiced pessimist who has the seen the outside and yearns for a taste of liberation, a simple character driven mad by the plasticized existence of the microcosm they are confined to, the optimist, completely spiritually and intellectually fulfilled with appeasing the idiotic requests of the master, or overlord or Orwellian gumbent-a-clef, easing into a life of quiet desperation, finding simple pleasures in the banal daily regimen and the emigrant, caught in the middle. Perhaps these scenarios which Pixar seems to be ejaculating in majestic, new colors every few years are truly subversive and anti-American with their One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestesque allegories...or maybe they're just smoking PCP. Still, they're a whole lot better than the CGA DreamWorks is churning out. Don't believe me? Compare the Incredibles (which is going to rock ass even if it sucks because look at Sam Jackson's character, man is HE black!) to Shrek 2. Shrek 2 sucked. For more on Shrek 2, see Shrek 2. Eddie Murphy needs to quit. C"

","FINDING NEMO is a typical Pixar product: A stunning visual enterprise.  Its avant-garde computer imaging technology wiped out the century old, cel animation process.  It's done, curiously enough, by a studio headed by former Walt Disney people who for some reason bolted Disney to form their own shop.  One can only guess why.  Of course, Disney will distribute. After all it's not only entertaining product but fulfills the single ultimatum of Hollywood: Make Money.  Forget Shakespeare's injunction: to celebrate life.<br/><br/>Thus, we find ourselves with an engaging story about a father fish in search of his missing, remaining son after a mean barracuda has gobbled up his spouse and other offspring.  Alas, a skin-diving Australian dentist has lifted the son for the tank in his office, to be held there for Darla, his ever-so-frightening, brainless, little daughter.   <br/><br/>Finding Nemo is always interesting to watch.  It's a, very clever, sometimes hilarious, six-minute, shtick-filled cartoon stretched into 100 minutes. One can forgive its story flaws in all the fun.  However, the use of a talented, well-known actor like Albert Brooks in the lead role is puzzling. Disney himself avoided the use of major names in order to evade the audience confusion of hearing an easily imaged voice coming out of a drawn character. The most distinct instance of this is in SNOW WHITE where he chose the completely unknown voice of Adriana Caselotti over the reigning voice of the day, Deanna Durbin.  Shamus Culhane, for whose biography I helped him find a publisher and who worked on that classic film, assured me that the decision to use Caselotti (who passed at 80 in 1997) was intentional and not forced by the then prevailing funding shortage.  This was Disney's first feature length cartoon and he wanted the best for it.  Indeed, it lives today, still, over half a century later, as meaningful as the day it was released.<br/><br/>
Finally, the most unfortunate aspect of NEMO, an otherwise fine product, is its lack of meaning.  It lacks my hallmark for greatness, a soul at its center.  As such, NEMO, like all of the other Pixar products thus far, will be long forgotten when films like SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO are still being heralded as classics.  Why Pixar does this when it has a $94 million budget to lavish on a product begs the question: A shallow fish story in deep water."

"maithy_bui","8","2","4","27 November 2011"," Humanistic Approach to the Film
","I love to watch animated movies. I find them so entertaining, even though most people would say that those types of movies were meant for little kids I don't think that I will ever out grow them. Finding Nemo (2003) directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich is in my opinion one of the best movies. Little kids love to watch these animated pictures, they teach kids and help them form an understanding of the world. Most of Pixar films, if not all of Pixar's films have a message in them, something the creator wants us to get out of the film besides watching it for merely our entertainment. Compared to a Disney movie, Pixar pictures have no magic; problems in the movie can't be solved by a wave of a wand or by a fairy godmother. Furthermore, humans are rarely the main characters and most of the films the protagonist is a non human character. In Finding Nemo there are humans in the story however, they play a small role in the film. We also see that in this picture the villain or the antagonist is human for example, Darla, they don't play a big role in the film but they sometimes support the antagonist. In Finding Nemo we see a clown fish, Marlin who is very protective of his only son, Nemo. And with this, already a lot of people can relate. Many parents are overprotective for their child and do not want them to venture out on their own because of the possibility of them getting hurt. Parents are so scared of letting go and letting them explore the world on their own. While watching the film we also see Marlin overcome his fear of the ocean as he travels with Dorothy to find his son. This is probably the most relatable message in the movie with both kids and adults. We all have fears and overcoming them can be really hard but sooner or later we realize that there was nothing to be afraid of. When we see Nemo is stuck in a fish tank at a dentist office Nemo and his new found fish friends try to help him escape. However, it all goes wrong and everyone gave up on the idea because it was dangerous and could've hurt Nemo. But Nemo does not give up he goes and tries again this time succeeding in stopping the water filter. The film attempts to change our lives for the better. For parents its saying that there's a time where you have to let go of your kids being overprotective can be a bad thing and it can lead to your kids getting annoyed/frustrated and refusing to listen to you. For kids, it's to tell them that your parents care and they want to protect you. Also to never give up in anything they do. These messages are universal they apply to everyone around the world. The theme in this film I think is relevant to any parent watching it. Scared of letting go of their kids, being very overprotective, the fear of losing their kids almost every parent can relate to this."

","Finding Nemo is a remarkable Pixar film. A clown fish named Marlin, whose voice is Albert Brooks, family gets destroyed by a barracuda, but one egg survived. Marlin names the egg Nemo, whose voice is Alexander Gould. Marlin devotes his life to make sure Nemo stays protected and safe. Marlin pushes Nemo's limits, and Nemo adventures off in the mysterious ocean. Nemo is than captured by a diver and Marlin starts a search through the frightening ocean to save his son. Marlin runs into a fish name Dory, whose voice is Ellen DeGeneres, which joins him for the search.<br/><br/>The movie defines how love and trust can beat all odds. The movie floats back and forth from Nemo and Marlin, as they are determined to reunite. Marlin's obstacles through the dangerous life of the ocean like the deadly encounter with Bruce the shark, angler fish, jellyfishes and a whale, do not stand a chance with that determination of love for his son. Nemo, lost and confused, hears about Marlin's treacherous adventures, influences him to escape.<br/><br/>Toy Story and Finding Nemo have much in common. Being produced by the same company, show the animations of animals and toys love for another, is a determination to make it home. The two have many dangerous situations that never stop them from what they seek. The two films are both kid and adult friendly.<br/><br/>The film has a colorful picture and everything look so perfect. The computer-animated imagines make you feel as if you are watching through the eyes of a fish. The film has every detail right from the voices matching the personality of the fish, the three dimensional of the animation, the exact flow of water, the reflection of light to the exact swim of the fish. Not only, does the film seem so real, the humor is out of control. Even during the dodgy scenes, the laughs are still there. The wow factor is there all the way through the film.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, love reunites the two clown fish and the adventure still does not end. Nemo and Marlin take the lessons they learned to make it home. Marlin trusts Nemo to do things and Nemo learns to respect his father more. Marlin even lives up to the name clown fish. The movie is fantastic for all ages and has moments that will have you saying, keep on swimming, and keep on swimming."
"flyingamon","9","2","4","15 April 2011"," This is just a winner in every way.
","I have to think really hard to find anything bad to say about this movie. I guess the only thing I didn't like was the beginning where the mother of Nemo died (which we thankfully don't get to see but it's very obvious it happens). The story is a typical one where a parent is overprotective (in this case Nemo's dad) of its kid causing the kid to get rebellious and of course gets in trouble. The difference here is that it doesn't consider humans but fish. Although it's hard to find sympathy for Marlin (Nemo's dad) as he is sooooo serious and always talking, you get to admire him as the movie goes on for being so brave. Very good there is Dory, the girl who seems to forget things so easily that it actually becomes cute and funny. Every serious character needs such a backup and their chemistry proves to be working well. There is a lot of action and funny scenes in this one and has a strong story as well. This is among my favorite animated movies."

His overprotective father, who seems to have Nemo alone as remaining family, naturally, goes to look for him.<br/><br/>From there, we're introduced to supporting characters who I found weren't much more than cheap laughs. Vegetarian sharks, ooh, that's original! All in all, the plot seems pretty much inconsequential to beautiful sweeping shots of the ocean and the coral reefs the fish call home.

Nemo with its great animation is worth seeing!  but only seeing.  the fact than many people are calling this a classic  makes me wonder what movie they saw.  What makes a classic animated movie  is  a good story  and strong characters.  I believe Nemo fails on both counts.  The story line is a basic one.  We follow the path of two fish, nemo and his father marlin  as they get seperated and their attempt to reunite.   The scenes depicted are nicely done  but you feel like you are being swept from one scene to another, the segways are missing. The story line is not deep enough so you can walk away feeling that you missed something in the storyline,  which in fact you haven't, there just isn't anything else there.   The film is also missing out on strong characters. The main characters would all be considered good supporting charcters,  but unfortunately  are asked to carry the  movie. But in their defense how much character can a fish have?  The point being is that finding nemo is a  beautifully animated film about fish  delivering a bunch of comedic lines  telling a simple story  that makes you want more than it delivers.

Apart from that very small nitpick, there is nothing I don't like about this incredible film.<br/><br/>Pixar always make powerful, moving, emotional films, which are extremely child-friendly but also very appealing to adults. The film is about a father who has lost his son and the lengths he is willing to go to in order to save him. It's extremely beautiful and, although I don't have children yet, I know I will feel what Marlin does one day and that makes it surprisingly relatable.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant, with some extremely funny moments, and I really liked that they set up little pieces which didn't seem to matter earlier on in the film and then they came in to play later on. The writers and director put so much care into crafting this film, and that doesn't go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Like I said, the bond and the relationship between Marlin and his son make for some of the most powerful moments in any Pixar film, but there is also a really nice moment towards the end of the film with Dory when she confesses that she needs Marlin and it was extremely touching.<br/><br/>Overall, Finding Nemo is a wonderful film and I haven't even touched on some of the impressive visuals or the beautiful musical score.

","After losing his wife and most of their unborn offspring to a predator's tooth, an overprotective father fish goes out to sea in search of his only child, stolen away on his first day of school.<br/><br/>Tons of heart and emotion in this, Pixar's first underwater fetch mission.

The ocean is a marvelous setting for such versatility, not to mention an unusually fresh one, and this team knows when/where to shine the spotlight. It's bright and vibrant like a kids' movie; lush and expansive as an unexplored frontier; sufficiently dangerous to transform any down beat into an opportunity for suspense. There's more than just superficial drama, too, with a deep human experience at its heart: the inner struggle between protecting one's children and allowing them to learn for themselves.<br/><br/>Great voice acting all around, from Albert Brooks (the scarred, neurotic dad) to Ellen DeGeneres (comic relief with a side of simple compassion). Fantastic, playful screenwriting that's capable of exploring timeless, meaningful themes without losing the youngsters along the way.

","Finding Nemo is truly a brilliant film. And it is so for many reasons.<br/><br/>The story of Finding Nemo is Pixar's simplest by this point. A fish, Nemo, goes missing and his father, Marlin, has to cross the ocean looking for him. It isn't this concept that makes Finding Nemo great, it is how they tell the story. Fish are honestly not something I have ever sympathised with. This film made me feel genuine disappointment and upset for Marlin, which was a surprising feeling.<br/><br/>The characters we meet on this journey are really fun. They have fully realised, complex personalities. They are not just a set of one-note character traits. Humour in children's movies was usually traditional with slapstick and very blunt gimmicks. And Finding Nemo has moments of this. However, large sections of comedic portions in this movie is funny due to actual situational jokes the characters make. Comedic timing is as close to perfection as I've ever seen in an animated movie. And Finding Nemo should be applauded for that.<br/><br/>The ending of Finding Nemo actually made me kind of emotional.

","""Finding Nemo"" (2003) is a fine animation classic for the whole family.

At the surface, it serves a captivating story that has the power to spellbind its younger audience. A few scenes might be unsettling, those include the opening, Nemo's attempts in the aquarium, and in the introduction of the character Darla.<br/><br/>This movie isn't just for youngsters, however. Older viewers are in for a delight as well, as there are a lot of references and great underlying themes as Pixar usually provides.

It is a perfect example of combining humor and drama, while also enjoying the voice acting, especially from Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres, and the movie's animation is spectacular!<br/><br/>Kids can relate to Nemo, with adults having the ability to relate to Marlin. I love the soundtrack, the side characters, and hilarity from Dory and the sea turtles. However, I despise Darla for trying to hurt Nemo, and the barracuda for ruining Marlin's life as a happy father! Aside from that, the whale talk scene is funny, and it's amazing how much money it got in theaters. The humor overall is also hilarious, and I like the idea of a movie set underwater in Australia. The morals prove that even family movies don't have to just have morals for kids, who get invested to the interesting plot. I love how lifelike the water looks, and the fish impressions are always humorous, and it plays like a big adventure.

","This review contains spoilers<br/><br/>'Finding Nemo' is a computer-animated movie that premiered in 2003. The movie is produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The movie is directed by Andrew Stanton. The story is also written by Andrew Stanton. The screenplay is by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds. The movie stars the voices of Albert Books, Ellen DeGeneres, and Alexander Gould. The movie is about a clownfish father that searches for his son Nemo.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is a great animated movie for all audiences. This movie successfully blends humor for adults and children across its entire running time. There are so many great jokes and moments that will appeal to adults and children alike. This movie seamlessly transitions the plot and the writing to appeal to both of the audiences. This is still a rated G movie, but I am impressed with how much the movie could have moments that engage adults.<br/><br/>The three stars in this movie do a fantastic job. Albert Books as the overprotective clownfish father and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful Dory make for a great duo as they set out to look for Nemo. Alexander Gould as Nemo has great moments especially once he reaches the dentist tank. The cast do a great job and it shows on the screen. Even if they are animated on the screen, their voices have great emotion.<br/><br/>This movie does not have any villains. Any antagonist in this movie simply misunderstands the situation that the fish are in. This leads into situations where I cannot say that the movie fails to engage despite a lack of a villain. The obstacles that Marvin and Dory find themselves in are caused by the adventure and not a villain seeking to undermine them. It made for a stronger story overall as the characters tried to work together rather than be antagonistic to Marvin, Dory, or Nemo.<br/><br/>The animation in this movie still holds up today in 2019. Even if the visuals are dated, I did not feel this detracted from the experience much. The main appeal is the plot and character. The visuals are more of a nice addition. There are still grand sequences in this movie like the current ride.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Finding Nemo.' This is an excellent animated movie for all audiences.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Another original Pixar classic that will be enjoyed by families. The story's about a widowed Clownfish named Marlin(Albert Brooks) who struggles to let his son Nemo(Alexander Gould) grow up after a tragic accident that costs his wife and the rest of his kids. This causes him to be overprotective. While starting school for the first time a misunderstanding leads to Marlin and Nemo having an argument over something Nemo's accused of doing but doesn't. This leads to Nemo defying his father and getting being kidnapped afterwards. Panicked, the class flees while Marlin tries to chase after the boat his son's in where he literally bumps into another fish named Dory(Ellen Degeneres).<br/><br/>Dory offers her assistance and tags along with him but she proves to be more of a hindrance than a help due to the fact that the Regal Blue Tang suffers from short-term memory loss. Even so she provides most of the comic relief in the movie. On their quest they come across sharks, seat turtles and jellyfish. Meanwhile, Nemo finds himself in an aquarium in a dentist's office in Australia with other fish who also provide comic relief and are plotting to escape back into the wild. Leading the Tank Gang is a hardened Moorish Idol fish named Gill(William Dafoe). Slowly and slowly Nemo learns to appreciate his Dad as well as be more independent while Marlin learns to be more laid back and to ""just keep swimming"".<br/><br/>The animation's amazing. When the characters move it feels so natural and when you see the water it looks like actual water which's impressive. The story's been done before but as usual Pixar adds a twist to it. In this case it's told through the eyes of fish. The characters are interesting and likable. Marlin's a worry wart but at the same time you perfectly understand why and he means well. Dory could've been annoying but instead they develop her to be this ditsy yet complex character. For all her faults she really does try to help Marlin out. Nemo's nice to watch as well. He acts like a normal kid in that while he can be rebellious for the most part he just wants to do good and prove to his Dad that he can handle himself sometimes. He's not annoying he's just a kid. The music's enjoyable to listen to as well. It sounds epic which fits with the theme of exploration because that's what the characters do: Explore. I really like how they play Robbie Williams' cover of Bobby Darin's ""Beyond the Sea"" during the credits while the characters mess around. There's even a cameo of Mike from Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is an enjoyable family film that never gets old both in the animation and story. It's visually amazing, has great storytelling and characters and when the movie ends you'll be saying ""Just keep swimming"". I highly recommend you check this movie out."

","How are you suppose to find someone you care about, when there are so many fish in the sea? This question can be answered in the kids film, Finding Nemo by Disney Pixar. This adventurous film takes place in the ocean where the main characters are fish. The film really shows family issues and how it affects children of adolescence in a funny kids animation about a real serious issue. The fathers and sons relationship starts out edgy because of the issues in the family, but the father and the sons relationship starts to grow throughout the film. In the end there's almost always a solution to this, but nothing you would quite see in the film, Finding Nemo. When the film is done and over, you will see how this can affect a child and how there can be misunderstandings to every action. But in the end there's only one truth.<br/><br/>The story starts out with the character Marlin and his wife, they are both clownfish. Marlin's wife dies by a tragic attack by a shark out in the open. His wife also laid a lot of eggs but after the shark attacked Marlin's wife, he took the eggs. There was only one left and this made the character Nemo, Marlin starts to get over protective with him because of what happened to his wife and the rest of his kids. But when Nemo starts to go to school he gets taken by divers. So Marlin sets out to find his son Nemo, he crosses by a fish named dory who suffers from short term memory loss. He goes with Dora and fights against many obstacles like sharks, jellyfish, and even seagulls. While nemo is trying to get out of a fish tank in a dentist's office.<br/><br/>Now this isn't the best film in the world, it has its bad sides. For instance this isn't really that accurate of a film. The start of the story line starts out with the mom dying and the dad still living with his son and now the father has nobody and he's lonely. But the truth if the same situation happened in real life, the father would have turned female and the son would have mated with the now turned female. Then nemo would have turned female and would have to find a male mate. But instead this isn't accurate, they use a human interactive way. This is only one of the major things that aren't accurate if this situation happened in real life. But of course this film is a adventure/action, fiction story.<br/><br/>I just want to say that this film is very interesting and has very many positive features in this film despite it not being very accurate to real life. There's so many lessons that kids can learn and also find it very entertaining at the same time. This film definitely shows family issues and how adolescents are affected by it. One way this is shown is by the father and sons relationship. In the film it shows right away at the beginning that the father doesn't want him to go to school while the son is insisting he goes on the first day, Nemo finally convinces his father to let him go. But the dad has to walk him there. This shows that the dad is very over protective over his son because he barely even allows him to go to his school. At some point in that scene he wouldn't even let nemo hangout with some people there. It really points out that there's family issues between the son and the father. Because nemo wants to go out and adventure while the father would just rather him stay safe and not go out. He wants this because he's afraid that he will lose his son if he isn't in his grasp. But all of that really connects with families with real issues like that because it can make them see all views and what's best to do about each situation. So it's a good learning experience in a great kids animation film.<br/><br/>Characters really are the main part of the film. If it wasn't for the characters, the film wouldn't be a film. But it's not just characters that are important in how the characters are, it's what their identity is. If a film had a bad characters then the film wouldn't be that good and it would be a bad film. For instance, in Finding Nemo there's a scene where when Nemo is trapped in the fish tank and a bird comes in the dentist's office window and talks to the fish in the fish tank. About a rumor going around that Marlin is trying to find his lost son. Nemo hears about it and gets excited because he believes he's gonna be saved. Because of the characters in this certain scene it makes people understand better, it makes the film the way it is. Because of the bird spreading around the rumor because he does that a lot, the bird loves gossip. Nemo was able to find out that his dad was going to save him which means the characters were a big role in the film. This showed Marlins and Nemos relationship clearly and how he felt about his dad. Because of the characters and even side characters it gave you a real feel to the film and really showed how this was effecting Nemo.<br/><br/>There's so much in this film, so many lessons hidden in the film through kids animation and child like characters. One of the main lessons was how a child of adolescents is affected by family issues. The way this is shown is by the characters and their development, and how it shows the father and sons relationship. The characters in the film are more child like and don't have anything that's inappropriate and even the animation is innocent. This and the father and son's relationship and what they say to each other shows how Nemo is affected and why he is the way he is. But in the end of the film it shows Marlin successfully getting his son back after almost failing and showing that he should never give up, and even saving Dora which he met on the way to find Nemo. There's a lesson on why you should never quit because if you don't you might even get what you want no matter how impossible it seems. But also it shows the father and sons relationship repaired and better than before. Because the family issues were resolved Nemo felt better and had a better life then with those family issues. This film was really great, it gave lessons for everyone on how you shouldn't quit and how a kid could be affected by family issues, and even how characters can be very important in a innocent animation."

But then Nemo gets taken by Man, that great monster from the above world. And so Marlin has to go and find him. And we have our movie.<br/><br/>I remember seeing this film when it came out and thinking that Pixar had really upped their game. Monsters, Inc. looked nothing compared to this and it's only a couple years older. All the locations underwater are breathtakingly beautiful, even today. Bursting with colour and life, hiding all sorts little details, nooks and crannies. And the fishes look great as well. There's a subtle scale detail on Marlin and Nemo that you only see in close-ups, but it's that extra layer of detail that completely sells it.<br/><br/>True, the human characters are still a bit wonky, but even they have improved a lot from Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what keeps this film from being one of Pixar's all time greats, is the fact that the characters are not as good as they have been up to this point. Marlin especially is an aggravating character with his constant whining and scaredy cat antics. Yes, it's understandable and sympathetic to a point, and he does learn, but it's played up just a bit too much.<br/><br/>Nemo is also a bit underdeveloped, but luckily the film has good characters as well. Chief amongst them being Dory, who's a bit of a one-joke character, but somehow the design, the jokes themselves and the voice acting by Ellen DeGeneres make it work beautifully.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is quality entertainment, don't get me wrong. It only pales in comparison to other Pixar films, and even amongst them it's up there. Definitely worth a watch for kids and adults alike."

","I used to find this movie boring as a kid - but as I said in my review of Toy Story, that's because as a kid I had an unusually low bar for boredom.<br/><br/>Nemo is a young clownfish who lost his mother at a young age - and as a result his father, Marlin, is overprotective. Nemo feels rebellious, and tries to disobey and defy his father. The result: he's caught by a Sydney dentist! Marlin - who's afraid of the ocean - must try to find and save his son. On the way, he meets a forgetful blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who helps him and becomes a major character (and got her own sequel).<br/><br/>Good story, great animation, and good voice cast. A winner."

","Finding Nemo is yet another creative idea filled with memorable characters in a touching story about trust, family, teamwork and all the good stuff. <br/><br/>No character without memorability or a reason for doing what they do. Nwemo's father, Marlin, is overprotective, but since Nemo is his only son after a tragic loss at the time of his infancy you can't blame him for it. <br/><br/>It is much more a story aimed towards parents, and that's great, because that is a strong argument against the misconception that animation is just for children. <br/><br/>And Ellen DeGeneres makes us all crack open in laughter and still maintains a sense of importance to Marlin learning a lesson. <br/><br/>All characters are memorable, the story is beautiful, the animation was groundbreaking for its time and still looks great.

People who are able to bring stories with little appeal to great stories that are stored in the permanent mind of thousands of people.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that visual beauty is not far behind. In fact, that is what makes the film even more attractive, and to this day, it still looks impressive, even with all the great technological advances that exist in the animation and technology film industry.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Finding Nemo, will go to the cult cinema in the very near future as did Toy Story."

Marlin and Dory travel through dark oceans and colorful reefs all the way to Sydney where Nemo is. To make a long story short: a beautiful film about a strong relationship between father and son. <br/><br/>And then lastly, Thomas Newman did an excellent job on the music score.

"EthanBJones_03","7","0","0","2 August 2017"," A flipper picture for all ages
","'FINDING NEMO' was directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and stars Martin Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres and Alexander Gould. ​Due the tragic death of his wife, Marlin(Albert Brooks) tries to protect his son, Nemo(Alexander Gould) with his life. But after an argument, Nemo gets taken by divers and Marlin must venture through the ocean to get his boy back.<br/><br/>The late 90s to Early 00s was a golden age for Pixar. A string of hits from Toy Story 1 & 2, A Bug's Life and Monster's Inc - and then we got this movie. This movie continued Pixar's tradition of milking money out of us but did it in a distinctly unique way. A simple adventure movie at first glance that really shouldn't have held the test of time but it remains one of the most popular and beloved animated features of the 21st century. And after seeing it, I can see why.<br/><br/>As stated prior, it is PART a simple, fun adventure flick. This part is done exceptionally well and is enjoyable whenever they cut to it. The other half of this movie is were it shines, for me. We see Nemo meet a new group of people in a fish tank and attempt to escape from it. Unfortunately, we don't spend much time here at all. Focus is instead put on Marlin and Dory's 'buddy adventure'. Again, I like their adventure a lot and can 100% understand why focus was shifted to them, I just wish we got more focus on Nemo and co. Obviously, this is just personal preference and I can't mark the movie down for that.<br/><br/>I actively dislike the climax of this movie and it was clearly rushed. It is very lazy and I wish more effort was put into it. Time is not an excuse; they should have organised themselves better or pushed release dates back.<br/><br/>Obviously, Ellen DeGeneres's performance in this movie is amazing. I can't say much more about it that hasn't been said so I will just say she's awesome in this movie. Albert Brooks is often overshadowed in this movie by DeGeneres and doesn't get the respect he deserves. DeGeneres is definitely the standout of the film and I wont take that title away from her but I 100% think that Brooks is overlooked with his performance which is unfortunate because he is genuinely great in the film. <br/><br/>One thing I am delighted with about this movie is the fact the directors and writers don't force a romance between Dory and Marlin. You can argue that it may be a bit weird, considering the voice actors of the respective characters but when has that stopped Hollywood before?<br/><br/>Alexander Gould was competent as Nemo but I honestly think Nemo is such a dull and bland character which is very strange considering his name takes up 50% of the title. <br/><br/>Side characters are a huge strength of this movie. From the Fish Tank Gang to Brucie to Crush - all the side characters in this movie are strong, funny and memorable. They are all interesting in their special ways and all keep this movie from slipping into mediocrity. <br/><br/>Finding Nemo was a revolution for CGI animated movies animation wise. Does it hold up? Yeah - it does. The water effects are surprisingly good and the design of the fish is good. Pixar's human creation facilities are also much better in this movie(in anticipation to 2004's 'The Incredibles') which makes them look less my plastic dolls, and more like living, breathing human beings.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing is also pretty good.<br/><br/>Pixar is a master at making movies funny for both younger and mature audiences. I'll say 40% of jokes in the movie made me elicit a chuckle, which is pretty dang good to be fair. Toilet humour is present and I will NEVER condone subjecting children to it. Thankfully, it is in short supply so it isn't TOO bad.<br/><br/>There is SOME emotion in the film and there is KIND OF an arc but it feels so artificial and computer generated. It doesn't feel genuine at all. <br/><br/>'Finding Nemo' is an enjoyable movie from beginning to end and I can 100% recommend you see it. It is from the golden age of Pixar, so I'll rate this film 7 'Awesome Handshakes' out of 10!"

","Disney movies have provided a fair share of lachrymose moments ever since Snow White's funeral, but in seven decades, two movies reached the trauma-inducing level: ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"" (no need to remind why). But while it took half a century to provide the second shocker, it was only one year shy away from a decade that the third one came, through the unsettling (yet powerful) opening of ""Finding Nemo"".<br/><br/>The film starts with a clown-fish couple, Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Coral, they lovingly contemplate their new nest of love in the Great Barrier Reef where hundreds of little eggs are peacefully 'sleeping'. The heart-warming sight distracts us from the ominous arrival of a barracuda. And once Marlin realizes that the Reef is suddenly empty, you know whatever is coming will not be ""Fish Police"" material, not even ""The Little Mermaid"". Thankfully (so to speak) the scene is shot in 'subjective camera', Marlin is knocked out and after a brief blackout, the previously colorful and magnificent-looking Ocean from the opening credits turns into a devastatingly silent mortuary.<br/><br/>Marlin lost his eggs but one, a little reddish bowl still beating from inside, a minuscule yet so priceless light of hope. Marlin calls the fish Nemo as the instant homage to his deceased wife who happened to like the name.<br/><br/>You see, the mark of great movies is that you can tell from the first five minutes that you're onto something special. ""Finding Nemo"" left me no doubt that I was going to watch a something very special. I compared the opening to the deaths in ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"" but these were middle-plot points, establishing a necessary evolution in the main characters. In ""Finding Nemo"", the tragedy is the set-up, it cements the unconditional love between Marlin and his son, which is what the film is primarily about. Indeed, for all the dazzling visuals and the infinite waves of blue the movie bless our sights with, it's all in the father-and-son relationship.<br/><br/>We might dislike over-protective parents, they act ridiculously and embarrass their children when they try to impress their schoolmates, but how can anyone blame Marlin after that first scene, especially since Nemo (because of his egg's fall) has a diminutive fin. Still, the merit of the script is to make us understand Nemo's actions as well, when he sneaks away during a school field trip to get close to a boat, we know it's not to prove something to his friends but just a sign of exasperation addressed to his father. When he's suddenly captured by a scuba diver, he immediately calls Marlin for his help and we can only witness Marlin's desperation and determination to find his little one.<br/><br/>The adventure takes off, and takes us from one visual delight to a thrilling encounter. I never felt as hypnotically entranced by the sight of the undersea world on a screen since the days I played ""Donkey Kong Country"" (don't laugh, if you were a fan of the game, you'd understand). This is computer-generated imagery at its finest, using lights and colors in a way that floats between reality and imagery, when a school of moon-fish form a sad-faced Marlin, you know the animators don't let themselves enslaved by realism and when a tiny fishy reveals to be a giant whale, it's a creative twist on the ""are you short or far away?"" gag. No visual trick is spared for the sake of a great moment, and it goes as far as allowing us to explore the human world, from the fish' perspective.<br/><br/>Poor Nemo finds himself in a dentist fish tank whose occupants, lead by Gill, a Moorish idol voiced by Willem Defoe, try to pull a 'Great Escape'. Oddly enough, it was the tank, not the ocean that inspired Andrew Stanton the idea of Nemo. As a kid, he saw the same ones at the dentist and assumed they tried to escape. When he discovered the clown-fish species, and their reluctance to live an anemone, he found the perfect material for a thrilling and emotional adventure.<br/><br/>Still, given the emotional resonance of the plot, he made it a perfect vehicle for comedy; the dentist gags and the goofiness of the seagulls never fails to inspire a few chuckles, the groovy turtles, the vegetarian sharks whose leader is conveniently named Bruce steal the show, but the greatest thing about ""Finding Nemo"", as far as laughs go, is the creation of Dory. With Marlin and Nemo, she's the third guy on the podium, an adorable regal blue tang fish suffering from short-term memory loss. The writers always find a way to make her condition funny, critical and sad when seriousness is required, and her tandem with killjoy Marlin saved the film from being a ""Bambi"" in the water.<br/><br/>And the fourth star is obviously the ocean, rendered with a majesty that outdates ""The Little Mermaid"" and 8 years after ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"" showed how far Disney magic can go, it's like water has always been part of Disney's milestones ever since Mickey's ""Steamboat Willie"". And the story has such a richness of its own, that it needed two climactic sequences, one involving the fish tank and incarnating the human stupidity at its finest through the character of a fish-torturing girl named Darla and a more dramatic one set in fishing grounds where the mass school of grouper try to get off a net. At the end of this powerful journey, both Marlin and Nemo learned a few lessons about their relationship.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is the stuff great animated movies are made of: magnificent visuals, a powerful story and comedy with the jolly Dory. The film was the most recent inclusion in AFI's Top 10 animated movies and once you see it, it's hard to argue. ""Dreamworks"" tried with ""A Shark Tale"", but it couldn't play in the same league than one film that swims 20 000 leagues above."

","Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons. The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs. There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun. I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this. The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate. Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I am not the biggest fan of computer-animated movies. In fact, I think most of them are overrated. My favorite is probably the Incredibles. That is good. This, however, is overrated. I really like Albert Brook's work, but this is probably One of his more overrated movies. He did a terrific performance as a clown fish, though. I just do not think that this is his best movie that he had starred in. The plot is simple, but some things in this movie are cheesy and lame.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. A clown fish only has one child after another fish ate his wife and his egg children. Then, the last fish named Nemo is captured by a boat and taken to a tank in a dentist office. If he does not get out soon he will get killed by the psycho child. She even has her own Psycho music. The dad and a fish with short term memory loss have to try to get Nemo back. They go through difficulties. For one thing, they are eaten by a whale shark, they get attacked by jellyfish, and they are attacked an angler-fish. They eventually do get Nemo back from a pipe.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that young children will enjoy, but I do not think this film is the best computer-animated or Pixar film. This is an average one to say the least. The acting is good, though. Plus, the computer-animation is spectacular and pleasing to the eye, which is good for me since I have seen so many scratchy and grainy silent films. The effects are not all good, though. Some of the colors are so vivid you will temporarily go blind. Anyway, this is an average and overrated Pixar film, but it is enjoyable to watch at least once in your life nonetheless.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>Recommended Films: Cars, Toy Story, and the Incredibles."

","""Finding Nemo"" is a superb motion picture created at Pixar Animation Studios. Make no mistake about it; this movie boasts quite an exciting adventure story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's how wonderful it is! (If you have not yet seen this movie, please do not read the next few paragraphs.) <br/><br/>The story is about a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is snatched away by scuba divers. Marlin meets a friendly, energetic, completely absent-minded blue tang fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), and together they go on a frantic yet thrilling search for Nemo, all the while meeting a host of friendly & unfriendly characters and risking their lives time and again. Over the course of the movie, Nemo learns to believe in himself and his own strength, and Marlin learns, after going on such a long journey all across the vast ocean, to not be so overprotective of his son. In the end, Marlin tells Nemo to ""go have an adventure."" <br/><br/>The following are my favorite highlights from ""Finding Nemo."" Marlin and Dory create a game out of dodging an overwhelming crowd of jellyfish. When the French cleaner shrimp Jacques (voiced by Joe Ranft) spins Nemo around in the fish tank, the accompanying accordion music, typifying the Parisian atmospheres, makes this scene that much funnier. There is much commotion in the dentist's office when the helpful pelican Nigel (voiced by Geoffrey Rush) bursts in and distracts both the dentist (voiced by Bill Hunter) and his freakish niece Darla (voiced by LuLu Ebeling) in order to save Nemo from an early demise. The end credits involve practically all of the main marine characters engaging in some funny antics, and the catchy tune ""Beyond the Sea"" was an excellent choice of musical accompaniment. No sooner do Marlin and Nemo reunite at the end when a huge net swoops onto a massive school of fish, including Dory, and father & son take on a suspenseful moment by coaxing all the fish to swim downward together. There is a wonderful chase sequence, which is actually more hilarious than dangerous, involving Marlin and Dory against a gigantic Austrailian shark named Bruce (voiced by Barry Humphries), who is initially tame until his uproariously funny moment of smelling blood oozing from Dory's snout; equally hilarious are Bruce's two cronies' attempts to console Marlin and Dory through the torpedo chamber. Nemo almost gets himself killed in the tank when he tries to prove his courage, thanks to Gill (voiced by Willem Dafoe), by stopping the motor in the tank filter. And finally, Mr. Ray (voiced by co-writer Bob Peterson), who is one of my favorite characters in the movie, is quite amusing as a schoolteacher who is overly enthusiastic about his subject matter, especially when he's singing while taking his students on a field trip.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is a surefire winner that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's quite obvious that the entire team at Pixar put a tremendous amount of effort into making this picture. Executive producer John Lasseter admitted that he knew ""Finding Nemo"" was going to be a smash hit even during its darkest days of production, and he was absolutely right!"

Nemo is no different. And the characters are so funny. There's this one character named Bubbles, he lives in a fish tank and every time this little treasure chest opens it let's out little bubbles. And every time they come out he races over to it screaming ""Bubbles! Bubbles! My bubbles!"" He's just so funny. And the sea turtles are awesome!

"crezyheelsfan2005","Null","0","0","25 April 2004"," how cinematic and dramatic elements bring out its literary elements
","There are a number of ways that the cinematic and literary elements bring out the literary elements in ""Finding Nemo."" The scenery helps the viewer to identify that it is set in an ocean by using reefs and various types of fish and sharks along with the water. The lighting also helps this by the way that it shines through the water. It was kind of milky looking. Sound effects also helped the setting because there were sounds of fishes swimming through the water and engines from boats. Music helped to set the tone at various points throughout the movie by playing happy music when a great event has occured, sad music when something bad occured, and ominous sounding music when the viewer is supposed to not be sure about the outcome of a specific event. Dialogue was a huge factor in this film. Without it, there would be little symbolism, the plot would be unclear, and the character's traits would be a bit murky. In the dialogue, the characters uttered common sayings such as ""I'm glad I got that off my chest,"" which means a problem had been solved, and they also talked about the glass being half full or half empty dilemma which was to symbolize who was the optimist and the pessimist. This was brought up when Dorrie and Marlon were trapped in the whale and the water was going down in the whale's mouth. Dorrie said that the mouth was half full, and Marlon said that it was half empty. Another type of symbolism also occured in the whale when Marlon asked ""How do I taste, Moby?"" That was in reference to Moby Dick, a play in which one of the main characters was a whale. Dialogue also played a huge part in helping the viewer characterize the characters. Marlon was always saying stuff to Nemo like ""You're not going to be able to get out of there yourself,"" and he said to Dorrie that she could not speak whale. This led the viewer to characterize Marlon as an overprotective, negative father. Dorrie and Nemo, on the other hand, were always saying comments like ""Yes, I can,"" and ""Just let me do this!"" This would help to characterize them as the exact opposite of Marlon- they were positive and not overbearing. Dialogue also helped the plot to advance in the movie. In the beginning, Nemo and his dad were on the way to school and they were talking about meeting sharks and sea turtles and wondering how old sea turtles were. Marlon said that he would ask the sea turtle for his age after he met the shark, and he ended up meeting both later in the film while he was looking for Nemo.  Dialogue also helped the theme because it was a positive theme, and Dorrie and Nemo  and other fish were always positive."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","0","2 December 2003"," A movie about . . . fish?
","`How in the world could a movie about fish be interesting?'  That was my reaction to this film's announcement and advertising.  But fortunately it is a Pixar film, and I love Pixar's films from Toy Story to Monsters Inc. so when a friend called looking for someone to see Nemo with, I agreed still expecting to be bored out of my mind.  The people at Pixar truly surprised me and put my expectations in their place.<br/><br/>Where I pictured gloomy underwater shots through and through, Pixar envisioned a remarkably colorful world seen through a slightly distorted dreamy lens.  Very seldom has the canvass of the silver screen been utilized so ingeniously with its composition.  Where I saw emotionless/expressionless creatures swimming back and forth, Pixar created the full spectrum of emotion and a plethora of fun personalities, then sent them on family-fun roller coaster ride along the ocean's bottom, and packed the rest of the film with the gags and jokes found in abundance in Toy Story and Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>An entire underwater world opens up to the viewer in ways the Little Mermaid could only dream . . . in ways far beyond the grasp of live action films.  A visually fantastic world, with plenty of surprises up its sleeve.  I couldn't help but smile as Pixar would tease and hint at the next landmark the film would take me to, then chuckle when it arrived in its fun and heartwarming way.  <br/><br/>With other studios laying their own claim to the realm of feature length computer animation films (and fairing extraordinarily well with the likes of Shrek and Ice Age), it's a pleasure to see that Pixar has not gotten lazy. They still possess their own edge, and if Finding Nemo is any evidence, there's going to be a damn good fight over the title of `best computer animated film.'  That's wonderful news to the viewers . . . I for one don't have any problem seeing more from the makers of Toy Story, Shrek, and Ice Age.         <br/><br/>Though next up for Pixar or Dreamworks or Fox, I wouldn't mind seeing a renewal of the animated musicals reminiscent of late 80s, early 90s, and classic Disney features.  Anyway, I'm getting off topic.  I went into Finding Nemo expecting to be bored, and I came out of the theatre very happy with the time investment.<br/><br/>I will also add, it's refreshing to find animated films can still hold up even after the viewer has grown up.  Ten years ago, in middle school, The Lion King caught me in a way that few films ever did; for me, films like Finding Nemo and Shrek affirm that animation holds that magic regardless of what the viewer's age."

This was definitely the best animation I have ever seen, Disney classics aside. (You know, the 'real' animation.) Forget 'Monsters Inc'. That was good. Even the Toy Story movies aren't as good as this one, in my opinion. There isn't a dull moment in this highly intelligent film, which, on the fish face of it, sounded pretty boring. This is the real 'Ocean's 11'...getting to Nemo at the eleventh hour. When I watch a film like this, I wonder how other script-writers sleep at night. This has got more class than a hundred non-animated films I could mention put together. There is simply nothing bad to say about this movie. My only negative thought is that I was hoping the shipwreck was going to be the 'Titanic'! (but we were in the wrong ocean for that.) I liked the 'other movie jokes' such as 'Terminator' and felt that a mickey-take of 'Titanic' could have been appropriate, especially as some idiots have just voted it the worst film ever made. Well, it gets in my top five, actually -'titanic' that is, because I can't really 'do' cartoon lists. If I did, 'Peter Pan' would be my number one, with 'Finding Nemo' in that top five somewhere.

","Pixar has done an outstanding job on this one. For the last few years I have found out that every time I go to see an animated movie, it seems more realistic. The computer graphics are extremely fine tuned to match the character's personality and voice. The movie is inspiring on various levels. Firstly, the strong bonding between a father and son is depicted with exceptional clarity. The first school-going experience is so close to human experience that kids can immediately relate to it. It makes one wish , every kid had a affectionate and daring father like Marlin. For those kids (or adults) who have'nt known a father's love, the father-son scenes could be quite emotional. Secondly, the general underlying message of preserving marine life in its pristine form is well conveyed. The current commercial fishing practice of trawling the ocean floor clean with utter disregard to any life is shocking to say the least. I hope people and governments take notice and do something to prevent the destruction of the last frontier on this planet. Overall the movie is thoroughly enjoyable whether you are kid or an adult."

The silliness of Dory was lost on her, but then she may be a bit too young to understand fully the memory lost / forgetfulness of adults.<br/><br/>She wasn't scared of the shark nor of the whale, but was afraid of the sudden darkness in the depths of the sea, and had to hold my hand.

The variations the writers ring in on it are marvelous (I won't throw any spoilers around), the voices are wonderful--Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres above all, but everybody makes a contribution. The visual aspect of the film is remarkable--stunning is not too strong a word to use. The people of Pixar are to be congratulated. And there are even some nuggets of scientific fact scattered here and there--clownfishes DO live in sea anemones because they're immune to the poison, for instance. I will add one warning: if you have very small children, say, under four, think twice about bringing them; a few of the nastier fish would frighten the little ones badly, I think.

","I remember when I saw the first few trailers for this, I thought that Pixar may have made a movie that wasn't up to par with the others.

I sure was wrong in thinking that this was going to be bad!<br/><br/>The movie starts out on a rather dramatic note, but soon, the humor kicks in, especially with the introduction of Dory.  She provides much of the humor, but it isn't just her that makes this movie great. Marlin is Nemo's overprotective dad, and he provides a bit of humor as well.  The voice acting is spot on, and Ellen Degeneres (Dory) and Albert Brooks (Marlin), do excellent jobs with these characters. What is even better is that the jokes are not just for children; they are pretty enjoyable for adults as well...(I'm a teenager, and the audience I saw this with was mainly made up of adults...without kids.)This just goes to show how great Pixar is.<br/><br/>The computer animation is also quite stunning, from the backdrops of Sydney, Australia, to the murky look of the ocean water in some scenes.

The minor characters are great as well.  The fish in the aquarium also provide for plenty of laughs.  The character of Darla, with her introduction including the 'Pyscho' shower music, was pretty interesting as well...She kind of reminded me of Sid from Toy Story.<br/><br/>Anyway, Finding Nemo is an excellent, well-made flick, and it is probably the best movie so far from Pixar.

"Theoron","Null","0","0","5 July 2003"," Fish ARE food...not friends...
","I've just finished a nice snack of eel sushi, and a dinner featuring a very nice ahi tuna steak, so I'm now well prepared to begin my review of Pixar's latest creation: `Finding Nemo.'  I highly recommend a nice seafood dinner before, or perhaps even after watching this film.<br/><br/>Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a clown fish, and the only survivor of a brood of hundreds.  While still an embryo, a mean old fish eating barracuda (are there any other kind?) decides that a nice clown fish caviar is the order of the day, and snorks down all of Nemo's brothers & sisters, not to mention his mother Coral.  Nemo's only surviving relative is his father Marlin (Albert Brooks), who, needless to say, is a bit distraught after having lost most of his family in a couple of bites.<br/><br/>Naturally, Marlin becomes a bit overprotective of his last remaining child, and poor Nemo feels a bit put-upon.  In a moment of childish rebellion, Nemo swims out to the open ocean to where a boat is anchored.  Sadly, the occupants of the boat, who just happened to be scuba diving, decide Nemo would make a great addition to their saltwater aquarium (in a dentist's office, no less).  So Nemo is snatched away, and forced to live a life behind glass in Sydney, Australia.<br/><br/>Marlin, with the help of Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the short-term memory-challenged blue tang, seeks to track down little Nemo, and hopefully bring him back to his rightful home amongst the sea anemone.<br/><br/>This is Pixar's fifth feature creation, and one of their most visually interesting.  Sadly, one can't say the same for the story line, for it's about as original and captivating as a dinner at McDonald's.  Marlin, father of the lost Nemo, is a bit paranoid.  It's funny for the first few milliseconds, then becomes just annoying as the paranoia continues unabated until nearly the very end.  And Dory's early onset of Alzheimer's isn't funny at all, no matter what.  I think the Pixar people meant this stuff to be funny, but I've seen funnier bits in any given 10 minutes of `Sponge Bob Square Pants' than in this entire film.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is Nemo's adventures in his new saltwater aquarium home in the dentist's office.  The cast of fish characters he encounters there, and their fascination with dentistry, is one of the truly enjoyable parts of the show.<br/><br/>Yet what little sparks of joy one encounters is leveraged with some rather negative and strange characterizations that make you wonder if there was some sort of secret agenda at work amongst the animators.  As usual with modern-day children's films based in the animal kingdom, carnivores are shown to be mean, cruel, heartless villains.  And if one encounters a `nice' carnivore, it's only because they've sworn off eating flesh.  There is a cute scene where we encounter three sharks that are members of `Fish Eaters Anonymous,' but we quickly discover that the sharks are having as hard a time being vegetarians as we do thinking that such a thing is even likely.<br/><br/>
As for the highly praised CGI visuals, well, the Pixar folks have really outdone themselves.  However, as CGI starts looking more and more `real' -one can no longer compare it to animation, but to actual photography. They have succeeded in entering a strange new paradox where CGI must now be compared to acutal underwater films, and in that regard, the visuals in `Finding Nemo' are not that impressive, as compared to a standard-issue Greet Barrier Reef documentary on the Discovery Channel.  It's really good animation, but not nearly so good as the real McCoy.<br/><br/>In all the other Pixar films, where there are humans, they are usually shown in a positive light, like Andy from `Toy Story' and Boo from `Monster's Inc.'  If there's a human villain, he's usually countered by a human who is kind, like the Andy/Sid dualism of `Toy Story.'  But in `Finding Nemo,' we mainly see humans as either captors of poor, harmless fish or as catchers of poor, harmless fish. Casting aquarium hobbyists as villains is troubling, especially for a person like myself who has always enjoyed public and private aquariums, and has learned a great deal about our aquatic friends from such displays.  It does not help showing fisherman as depriving fish of their civil rights, as though tuna and cod really are sentient beings.  Is the catching, eating and displaying of fish truly a dark, sinister activity that we should avoid? It seems as if that is one of the messages of this particular film, one this reviewer does like at all.<br/><br/>However, I do agree that humans are certainly the greatest enemy to the oceans and to sea life, but it isn't aquarium hobbyists and fisherman who are the greatest threat, but corporate fishing fleets and industrial polluters.  But the film has nothing to say or show concerning these two very real problems.  Instead, humans in general are shown to be a vegetarian fish's greatest antagonist.<br/><br/>Aside from the `fish are friends, not food' message of the film, there is another, more important and more forthright theme, and that is a father's unconditional love for his son, even though the son deliberately rebelled against his father's overbearing protection.  There is also a neat message about overcoming one's fears by plowing right into that which you fear, which sometimes is the best way to handle certain neuroses.  But overall, the main messages of the film were diluted by the negative characterizations of humans and carnivores.  Any film that causes you to feel guilt and shame for having enjoyed aquariums and seafood does deserve high marks.<br/><br/>Well, at least there was a sushi restaurant in ""Monster's Inc.,"" so perhaps there's some hope for the Pixar folks after all.  As for this film, wonderful CGI visuals, mediocre story.  Yes, it has heart, but not nearly enough.<br/><br/>My Rating: 4/10"

That is, make them seem like something more than just an accompaniment for French fries.<br/><br/>Pixar, (in co-operation with Disney) the clever animators behind Toy Story and  Monsters Inc, are back with a story about a young clownfish named Nemo (Alexander Gould) who gets separated from Marlin (Albert Brooks), his over protected father. With the help of Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a blue fish with short term memory loss, Marlin desperately searches for his son. In the process he learns about himself and love while risking life and fin to find his son. <br/><br/>The story is typical Disney claptrap, a tale that hits the same emotional buttons that have marked kid's films since Bambi was a fawn. But it's not the story that recommends Finding Nemo and makes it the achievement that it is. <br/><br/>The script is tight and quite funny (although in a more subtle way than previous Pixar creations) but it is the visuals that overwhelm. The computer geeks at Pixar have imbued their undersea world with such feeling and splendour that it is hard to believe it isn't real, that it is, in fact, nothing more than cleverly arranged binary code. The colours and textures of the sea literally come alive on the screen and show a real eye for detail. Particularly eye-popping is the jelly-fish sequence, a beautifully realized scene in which Marlin and Dory must navigate their way through a school of opaque stinging sea creatures.<br/><br/>Albert Brooks heads the cast as Marlin. He's neurotic, not unlike many of the characters Brooks has played before, but is charmingly so. This may be his best role since Broadcast News. When he deadpans that, despite the name, clownfish aren't really all that funny, you know the part was written for him. Ellen DeGeneres brings considerable charm to the scatterbrained Dory, while Willem Dafoe and Geoffrey Rush also contribute voices.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is more than just a technical marvel; it is a computer animated film that transcends the animation to become a film which will engage the heart as well as the mind."

","Talk about an instant classic! Pixar and Disney have done it again!Thank God! I put this up there with the Toy Story  and A Bug's Life as instant animation classics. I loved this movie. IT was very funny and quite well done. The voices for the sea characters were perfect to a tee. Albert Brooks was superb and  Ellen DeGeneras was, in a word GREAT! Dorey has to be one of the more memorable cartoon characters in Disney history. She and Willem Dafoe almost stole ths how. There is a plethora of enjoyable characters ranging form the title character and his father to Dorey, the sea turtles, the sharks and their twelve step program to the even the human characters. One of the funniest and probably underappreciated aspects was how the seagulls were portrayed. Anytime they saw food or potential food they said ""Mine"" Having dealt with real seagulls up close that fit those annoying birds personas very well. This movie is great fun for the whole family. I would pay $7.50 to see it again. I can hardly wait to buy it on video. All I can say is go see it and GO FISH!!!"

","(give aways... if not seen movie, do not read b/c i say stuff from movie)<br/><br/>hey! I think this is an amazing movie. It is sooo adorable. I love the way they did animation with the water and everything. These actors put so much into this work, as you can see, they made it work. It just shows in the production. I cried.. lol go figure. It just got me so touchy at the beginning... how after there were all those eggs, that stupid shark ate them all, and coral.. ohhh my poooor coral. i felt soo bad for marlin. Nemo was the last one who survived so obviously you'd guess that marlin would be cautious for his only baby. Then when nemo got caught by those divers... grrr i'm seriously never going fishing again i felt so bad after all those times i go fishing and awwww poor nemo gets stuck in a DENTIST'S OFFICE! poor poor nemo. My favorite character was probably crush, the turtle. and I thought that was soo cute with the whole ""how old did a turtle get"" with nemo and his dad. I also liked dory... I really had a feeling that dory and marlin were gonna hook up or something, but i guess marlin just wasn't ""attracted"" to this short-termed memory fish. And i thought that was sooo funny how she remembered everything after nemo said something to her towards the end and then they found marlin, then dory needed help.. geeze these characters got into a lot of mischief! My favorite scene was probably with the whole ""talking whale."" after all that with dory, and then marlin trying to talk whale ""gee i wish i could talk whale"" lol. Well to wrap this up, i'd like to ask a question.. after Gill and all them escaped from the denists office.. how the hell did they get out of the bags? i saw this with my boyfriend and when gill proposed his idea thats the first thing i said ""how are they gonna get out of the bags?"" It's like, impossible for them to. They'd die! awww poor gill... his dream... well thats all i'm gonna say. I just have to say that i loved this movie. It made me laugh, and it made me cry. well.. ok then.. bye"

","Pixar is my favorite animation company, I think its superior to what Disney is now, but when Walt was in charge, Disney was better. I think the smartest move Disney's made in recent history was teaming up with Pixar because without Toy Story and the others, who knows where Disney would be.<br/><br/>I can't wait for Pixar's next movie- ""The Incredibles"" to come out, because the trailer that is shown at the begining of Finding Nemo is absolutely hilarious. Finding Nemo is brilliant. Everything about it is interesting, Marlin is wonderfully voiced by Albert Brooks and Dory provides funny, but in some times annoying commentary from Ellen Degeneres. I love the look of Finding Nemo, there are some scenes that its hard to believe they aren't real. The Shark's 12 step program is great.  Another great highlight of Finding Nemo is the scenes in the fishtank in the Dentist's office.  I loved all the unique and funny personalities of all the fish: the fish afraid of germs, the one that had mulitiple personalities, the one that loves bubbles, the dirty one, the crab that loves cleaning, the starfish who's the lookout, etc. I also loved how the fish are really interested in the dentist's work and give commentary about what procedure's he's doing. The fish were great, in fact those animated fish in that little tank have more characterization and personality than the entire mean cast of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".<br/><br/>Well, I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.

","If you or any children you know have enjoyed a Pixar movie in the slightest, you owe it to yourself and them to go see this amazing movie. It is literally laugh out loud funny. I thought that Ellen DeGeneres was a hoot and her character alone is worth seeing the movie for. Kudos to Pixar on getting such a wonderfully talented actress to play this role, as well as all of the others involved. Each character that is introduced throughout leaves you smiling. There wasn't one scene in this movie where I was bored with what was happening. It is surprisingly intense in some scenes, the shark scene coming to mind as I write this. The beginning of the movie is pretty dark as well but I won't reveal what happens except to say that it is a pretty grim way to start what is widely seen to be a kid's flick. In terms of technical achievements, the sound was awesome with directional effects coming at you from every which direction. The picture is unbelievable and even the most jaded viewer won't be able to help marvelling at how lifelike all of the characters are. The whole time I was watching the movie, I kept thinking to myself, ""DVD? Hell yeah!"" The story is just as good, if not better than any previous Pixar movie. What amazed me the most about this movie was the wealth of ideas that they had going on in it! I remember watching the trailer and thinking to myself, ""How much stuff can they actually do underwater that we haven't already seen in other movies?"" Trust me when I say you will be surprised at the overall creative brilliance of this fine film. It's very obvious that some serious brainstorming was going on during the planning stages. Pixar has one hell of a streak going on right now with Finding Nemo only strengthening their already impressive body of films and I cannot recommend this one enough. (Final note: my favorite scene was Gill (Willem Dafoe) describing his escape plan to the other fish in the aquarium. It had me in tears from laughing so hard!) Rating: ***** out of *****."

","Being a fan of Pixar, I saw Finding Nemo on opening day, surrounded by a host of individuals whose years are mere fractions of my age.  Regardless, I was memorized by the film visually, I thought the emotional depth was well beyond what many past animation films have gone for, and I thought that it was one of the most entertaining films of any kind produced in recent years. My only problem?  The music.  It is not the score was particularly bad.  In fact, it was quite engrossing, but what I have come to expect from animation films is a type of sing-along, the modern American musical, and I thought that that was sorely missed.  Many will scoff at my request for this type of music in Nemo, believing that it would demeaning for such a good film.  But music does not lower the artistic level of such a film, indeed, for a film with this specific audience, songs can be the best way to bring individuals into the story and raise audience involvement.  I believe that a more traditonal animation soundtrack would have greatly increased the effectiveness and longevity of Finding Nemo."

","Pixar has a perfect track record, with such brilliant films as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. in its catalog.

The movie follows the journey of Marlin, a frightened clownfish who is trying to find and save his lost son Nemo. Along the way he befriends Dory, who is voiced confidently and perfectly by Ellen DeGeneres. The 2 make their way through the dangerous ocean, braving sharks, whales, and jellyfish.

","For once I find myself in a minority.  For once, I was expecting<br/><br/>more.  For once, I am undecided about getting the DVD of a Pixar<br/><br/>film.<br/><br/>Description of characters and plot points are plentiful in other<br/><br/>reviews, so I'll cut to the chase:<br/><br/>The general idea was good, execution was decent, but too much<br/><br/>went wrong.  Dory and her lack of short-term memory (how does<br/><br/>she remember she has that problem?) were more annoying than<br/><br/>endearing.  Jar-Jar Binks provided more comic relief.  I had more<br/><br/>fun with the tank residents speaking dentistry-ese with the pelican.<br/><br/>I never quite ""got"" Nemo's disability (if indeed there was<br/><br/>something to ""get"").  The only purpose I saw in it was to give Marlin<br/><br/>an extra excuse for being overprotective - what, having your wife<br/><br/>and all your other children killed isn't enough? - and to give Nemo<br/><br/>a kinship with Gill.  I am not acquainted with Albert Brooks enough<br/><br/>to compare his fish character with humans he played. But to be the<br/><br/>character that Marlin is, given that they are very small fish and there<br/><br/>are very big things out there with very pointy teeth I can't blame him<br/><br/>too much.  (Then again, overprotective parents have been around<br/><br/>forever as movie devices.)  Willem Dafoe did an excellent job as<br/><br/>Gill.<br/><br/>I expected to see more of the sharks, especially given the line a<br/><br/>shark says in the trailer that he doesn't in the movie.  I wanted to<br/><br/>see more of the sharks, lots more.  But I did like that whole chase<br/><br/>sequence sparked by the whiff of blood.<br/><br/>And after all those scenes with the turtles, sounding like they were<br/><br/>straight out of the late '80s/early '90s, I was extremely disappointed<br/><br/>to not hear a ""Cowabunga!"" or even a slight ""Teenage Mutant Ninja<br/><br/>Turtles"" reference.  (Four young turtles could've had eyes in the<br/><br/>four TMNT colors, for example.)  Pixar never seems to miss a shot<br/><br/>at a movie reference, this one fell in their lap, and the pun was<br/><br/>ignored.  The other movie references that were included,<br/><br/>especially ""Psycho"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" were<br/><br/>great, and I did get a kick out of the shark being named ""Bruce"" (cf.<br/><br/>""Jaws"").<br/><br/>Finally, the seagulls were absolutely hilarious. I wish there had<br/><br/>been a way to give them more screen time, because those scenes<br/><br/>were of the Pixar we know and love.<br/><br/>The animation and supporting characters carry this movie more<br/><br/>than the plot, and I'm disappointed that Pixar spent so much time<br/><br/>on the former while seeming to have problems with the latter.<br/><br/>6/10: It's not necessarily ""Swim away! Swim away!"" but not ""I've got<br/><br/>to find Nemo!"" either.<br/><br/>PS: I recently read a newspaper article that was half-devoted to<br/><br/>pointing out that ""Nemo"" was the name of the captain in ""20,000<br/><br/>Leagues Under the Sea.""

"ilovedolby","8","0","0","22 June 2003"," `Finding Nemo' is a treat for anyone seeking a fresh look at the computer-animated genre of family entertainment.
","Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios have brought us some great computer animated tales over the past years. Beginning with `Toy Story' in 1995, followed by `Toy Story 2,' `A Bug's Life,' `Monsters, Inc. ' and now `Finding Nemo.' `Finding Nemo' is not as original or as creative as `Monsters, Inc.,' however, the film is extremely enjoyable as it is filled with lovable characters that will charm and amuse everyone. Speaking from a computer animated standpoint, it's the greatest achievement visually that the two companies have brought us. 	`Finding Nemo' tells the story of Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish that has left his coral reef home in search for his lost son, Nemo (Alexander Gould). Along his trek through the ocean, Marlin meets several humorous characters-one in particular, a fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Dory isn't like other fish. She suffers from short-term memory loss. As such, her flaw brings about some of the film's most comical parts as she consistently forgets her name, who she's with and where she is going.<br/><br/>On the other side of the ocean, Nemo has been captured and is living in a fish tank with several other oceanic fish in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. While there, he meets a fish named Gill (Willem Dafoe) who is the leader of the tank and has a plan of escaping and returning to the ocean. But there's a problem. The dentist's niece has her eye on Nemo. At the same time, word has spread by way of Nigel (Geoffrey Rush), a crane that lives on the sea and visits the fish from time to time, that Nemo's father has been traveling the ocean in search for his son. It's now up to Marlin with the help of Dory, sharks, whales and sea turtles to find Nemo in time before he is taken home with the dentist's niece. One of `Finding Nemo's' strongest points beyond its animation is its humor. Adults will find the film just as entertaining, if not more so than children. Some of the film's funniest points occur when Marlin and Dory happen upon three sharks that have vowed to stop eating fish, under a motto of `fish are friends, not food!' However, when the scent of blood from other fish is in the water, the shark's eyes turn black and they can't fight back the urge to eat fish. It leads to the sharks chasing Marlin and Dory through a sunken battle ship where depth charges are still very much active. When a torpedo is released, it touches a depth charge and a huge underwater explosion takes place. While on the surface, however, two gulls are wading when bubbles hit the surface. One of the gulls looks at the other with disgust and says, `nice.' Another strong point of `Finding Nemo' is how visually striking the image is. The film is filled with every color in the spectrum. What's more, the detail that went into the design of characters and the anemone where Marlin and Nemo live is exquisite. Never before has computer animation been so full of life and dimension as that of `Finding Nemo.' `Finding Nemo' is more than pure fun for the whole family-it's an achievement for Disney and Pixar in their pursuit to entertain at a higher level than usual brand of family entertainment. Incidentally, a great deal of which comes from Disney. It's necessary to point out the score of the film by Thomas Newman, who has composed scores for such films as `The Shawshank Redemption' and last year's wonderful `Road to Perdition.'  The music is elegant, filled with emotion and amusement that reaches beyond the usual campy scores of Randy Newman, whose done most of Disney's computer animated films. In the end, `Finding Nemo' is a treat for anyone seeking a fresh look at the computer-animated genre of family entertainment. ***"

","From the previews alone I could tell Finding Nemo would be below par. After watching the movie, I'm sure of it. This movie is long, dull, and overly sentimental. The voices are horribly annoying, mainly Ellen DeGeneres. She's just plain horrible as an actress and a voice actress. Albert Brooks is okay, not great but not bad. I'd say the only really good voices in the movie are Crush played by Andrew Stanton, and Bruce played by Barry Humphries. And they're just extras with only a handful of lines.<br/><br/>The story will bore you to death and you'll feel like Nemo trying to just get away from it to have some fun with the movie. Folks marvel at the graphics, but come on... you really think this is impressive? It's nothing compared to Pixar's past. Let's see... the incredible detail of Monsters Inc, or the ocean where you're lucky to see 20 feet in front of you and a few small fish.<br/><br/>All in all, I say skip this movie.

","Marlin is an overprotective clown fish, worried about his young son Nemo who has an underdeveloped fin.  In an effort for Nemo to prove himself to his father he decides to venture out into the ocean against his dad's wishes away from school.  In the end, he is caught by a deep sea diver, and Marlin is determined to resuce and find his son against all impossible odds.<br/><br/>Nemo ends up in a fish tank in a dentists office, where he is made an honorary member, meanwhile the rest of the film plays itself as Marlin travels through the great worlds of the ocean, and meets many characters and unique places in his search for his son.<br/><br/>It seems like somewhat of a similar story that we see in children's animation, even a sidekick is provided.  However, the sidekick is a short term 'female' memory fish named Dory (voiced hillariously by Ellen DeGeneres), and the world that Marlin inhabits is filled with numerous funny characters in a giant ocean (in-therapy sharks, surfing California sea turtles, crazy pelicans, a giant whale [which provides the most hillarious dialogue in the film], a school bus driving manta ray, to all the aquarium creatures in the dentist office).  Also the film centers on a father son relationship and the overbearing protectivness of the father is explained very quickly and simply in the first 5 minutes of the film.  In fact Nemo's dissapearance is a transformation not just for Nemo as he has to learn how to survive and do things on his own, but also for his father who realises he has to venture out of his shell and get out and see the world without being afraid.<br/><br/>But hands down the seagulls in the film, are the most ingenious bit in the entire film, those guys when on screen steal the show and are a riot fest!<br/><br/>It seems Pixar has a formula that just can't be beat and gets better everytime.  The animation is superb, the screen is filled with things to look at it in the ocean, and the fish move through it so realisticaly through worlds of colourful coral, wrecked ships and rust, to the cuteness of the aquarium.  You could just sit back and watch the screen like a giant fish tank for hours.  The characters are also very charming, and the story does not get bogged down in sentimentality.<br/><br/>Great film, and nearly perfect.

These are all movies you can see several times and always enjoy and find new things in.<br/><br/>Even moreso than other Pixar films, Nemo is a real visual treat, with the underwater world being beautifully rendered by the animators. But what really sets the Pixar movies apart from many other animated films is the strength of the writing. The visuals of an animated feature can be terrific in any film, but the story and the characters are what will make or break it.

","First of all, I loved this movie. Thought everything was well designed and freakin' hilarious. It did lead me to an observation that I find intriguing. Why is it that probably 90% of Disney movies center on characters who are either orphans or have lost one or the other of their parents? Think about it. Name 5 disney movies, and I mean originals (non of those crappy sequels), that have characters with both of their parents. It's tough isn't it? Why does Disney do this? Does it help audiences sympathize with the characters more? I don't know. If I was a parent I might be concerned for my kids. Watching these movies might lead them to believe that their parents are going to die and leave them in the uncapable hands of evil step mothers or something like that. I understand that many families today consist of single parent homes, but many of these movies have scenes or alude to the death of one or both parents. I don't know if anyone has some insight into why this is, but I find it interesting."

"zolezbrch","8","0","0","15 June 2003"," Once again, Pixar has outdone itself.
","*May include spoilers but it depends on your outtake of the movie*<br/><br/>8/10.  A wonderful tale about a father fish trying to find his son by traveling all the way across the ocean.  Nemo, the son, wants to go to school, but his dad, Marlin, is afraid of Nemo being out of his sight. Marlin had a bad experience when a shark came several years earlier, ate his wife, and 399 of his eggs.  Though 1 remained, and he promised that he would never let anything happen to Nemo.  Back to the present, Nemo gets on a ""bus"" (stingray) and they go to the drop off point where the open water is. Marlin tracks them, and Nemo gets mad.  Then Nemo disobeys his dad by going to this fishing boat, and touching it.  Nemo starts back, but he is caught by a diver.  Marlin swims after the diver, and then the boat, and then meets this forgetful fish named Dory.  Dory is Marlin's companion all the way to Australia, where mishaps occur.<br/><br/>When I first watched the preview of this, I was thinking that this was going to me a horrible, and stupid movie, but was I wrong.  The characters were altogether funny, and the actors that played them.  Albert Brooks played Marlin, the father of Nemo.  He was pretty funny, and was very overprotective of his son.  Though the 2 biggest voices that I heard were Ellen who played Dory, and Brad Garrett who played Bloat.  First Ellen. She seemed to fit the fish very well because she was altogether funny.  It was the script that helped her along, but nevertheless.  I think any other voice would have been bad.  Now Bloat.  I've watched Everybody Loves Raymond only a couple of times, but I recognized Brad Garrett's voice right on the button.  He was pretty funny, and especially at the end when the fish from the tank are trying to esacape, and he says, ""Now what?""<br/><br/>In the 4 movies that I've watched from Pixar, I've never been disappointed. They have a similar theme, friendship, but it works very well for them. Though their next 2 movies, The Incredibles (2004) and Cars (2005) seem like they will veer off from that current theme.  I tried to keep my eyes open for hidden gags and I found one.  If you look closely in the Dentist office, on the ground, you'll spot a Buzz Lightyear toy.<br/><br/>I think all ages of people will find this movie enjoying.  Once again, Pixar has outdone itself in producing a great movie"

","This might be my most anticipated new film in ages.  After being mightily impressed by Monsters Inc both as a technical exercise and as a piece of outstanding storytelling, I realized that Pixar is on a major roll, and has yet to produce a dud.<br/><br/>In fact, ALL of Pixar's films have raised the bar both in computer animation AND in family movies.<br/><br/>While FINDING NEMO doesn't quite reach the heights that MONSTERS INC. did, it's still a very impressive and entertaining film in its own right, and certainly meets the calibre of Pixar's other movies.<br/><br/>Let's get the one weakness out of the way; after creating a story with a very convincing central relationship in Monsters Inc between Sully and ""Boo"", the characters in FN aren't quite as well-drawn.  Not that they're bad, and not that there aren't some great moments, but I don't think we get to care about these guys quite as much as the denizens of Monstropolis.<br/><br/>As for the strengths, they're here in abundance.  The first is the dazzling animation.  Set almost entirely in the ocean, FN displays incredibly real creatures, backdrops, and aquatic textures.  It's lovely, and very easy to ""immerse"" one's self in (pardon the pun).  There are also the typical fantastic Pixar characters like Bruce the shark and Gil.<br/><br/>Everything Pixar has done has been an ""instant classic"", to march out that hoary old cliche.  The reason they've been able to achieve this so consistantly is because they've never lost sight of how important STORY is; the technology has always existed in Pixar films to support the story, and never the other way around.  FINDING NEMO is no exception."

","Finding Nemo is wonderful.  Gorgeous to look at with animation that wouldn't be possible even five years ago and written with deft, fun, and heart. The film may suffer from being directed solely at kids and there requisite guardians (me and my brother were likely the only 15 to 25 year-olds in the whole cineplex) which makes the plot structure of the titular youngen Nemo swimming off on his own to do some much needed growing up while simultaneously forcing his father Marlin to challenge himself and grow no small amount himself so delightfully subversive.  Defoe, Brooks and Rush's voicework is quite brilliant but believe me when I say this, DeGeneres improbably steals the show.  After the first word her character Dory said I shuddered and thought I'd be in for a long two hours.  But with significant screen time she never once got tiresome or annoying.  I caught myself laughing at her jokes and thought to myself, 'this is Ellen DeGeneres, right?'  Y'all may not have my inborn mistrust of DeGeneres, but those who do, don't miss out on a truly surprising road film without a road."

"chan_minako","10","0","0","10 June 2003"," Right up there with Toy Story and Toy Story 2; well-animated with a good plot.
","Finding Nemo was an excellent film, in my humble opinion, from start to finish. I walked into the theater without particularly high expectations. Since the trailers had told us absolutely nothing about the movie, I actually assumed that Dory and Marlin were man and wife (or something); I questioned how a movie of any length could be carried entirely by a fish's search for his son. I must confess that my expectations were completely exceeded. I was blown away.<br/><br/>I'm not going to sit here and summarize the movie for you; just go watch for yourself. (133/135 favorables at RottenTomatoes.com, for the record.) But I will say this: this is not just a kid's film. I'm a 19 year old girl, and I think it's safe for me to say that theoretically I shouldn't empathize overmuch with either father or son (being a far cry from a kid aching to go to school, or a fretting mother). It was funny and exciting, following in the tradition of Pixar films, with jokes for all ages. You know you should expect the happy ending, but certain moments still make you jump and fret a little or sit at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Of course, the animation was brilliant. Kudos to the CGI team and RenderMan for a job well done. The water program is very nice, the coral reef brilliant and teeming with life. The scenes from above the water were photorealistic at times. And beyond the computer animation, I'd like to offer a few thanks to the team that made the water gravity work (things fall in water, even fish; they just fall differently) and the fish move. I've hardly seen anything about it, but the movements are very realistic and follow the real patterns of fish movement (Dory swims in short spurts; ""Built for speed"" as she puts it; Marlin rows with his tail and uses his fins in an alternating pattern). Nemo's movement is different, as well; he swims with more of his body to make up for his bad fin. It's seamless, and thus hardly noticable.<br/><br/>The music is whimsical and has a bit of a dreamlike quality. When Marlin loses the boat the music makes me think of a bad dream. I really love the score; I bought it today, and now I like it even better. :)<br/><br/>Themes, themes, themes. Every movie has to have one, and the most frequent complaint seems to be that Finding Nemo's theme is shallow. I don't know much about making a good theme, but I will tell you that what theme there was acted as wonderful character development. There's bravery, friendship, and parenthood stuff going on in there. It stikes a chord partially because those on the developing team know so much about letting children grow up, since many of them have kids, too. I think the feeling the producers put into the film comes through in the film itself, anyway.<br/><br/>On the subject of character development: If Dory was the comic relief, then Marlin was the one that carried the movie. There are those that find Marlin annoying, and those that feel Albert Brooks is undistinguished in this role (apparently Marlin is the quissential Brooks character), but while Dory made me laugh, I always wanted to know what was going to happen next with Marlin. His constant fretting just made sense to me; this is his son we're talking about after all, and Marlin is keenly aware of how much personal danger he is in when he leaves the reef. (He and Dory almost get eaten six times, if you consider that the jellyfish are indeed 'trying' to eat them.) Also, it's understated, but the fact that Marlin leaves the reef is a huge deal for him, being something of a coward; and outside their anemones, clownfish are completely defenseless. Besides, Dory really helps balance out Marlin's pessimism.<br/><br/>Dory/Marlin interaction is funny, actually; Marlin is always the parent with these two. He has to be. And he does indeed equivocate Dory with Nemo in his mind, on some level, as demonstrated in the belly (or mouth) of the whale. But Dory teaches Marlin some things, and Marlin teaches Dory a little, and the audience is thoroughly entertained by their banter in the meantime.<br/><br/>I thought all of the voice acting was brilliant, actually. Degeneres cracks me up. Whale scene; enough said. It apparently took her two days of speaking whale to produce all that. Albert Brooks may have been built for the role, but he's all the better for it. His voice almost breaks in all the right places. Honorable mentions go to Alexander Gould, who really managed to project himself into Nemo. One tends to forget this is a kid's voice-acting. Geoffery Rush, the pelican, is a brilliant character. I only wish there was more of him. Willem Dafoe; do I really have to say anything? Brilliant as always. Crush is voiced by Mr. Stanton himself, and all I have to say is 'Duuuude'. My friends and I have been saying ""You were like, 'Woah!', and we were like, 'Woah!!', and you were like, 'wooooah',"" for days now. Very, very nice.<br/><br/>To quickly compare it to other Pixar films, I'd say this was more ambitious than any of the other films in terms of scope, and more ambitious than every film except A Bug's Life in terms of choice of protagonist. (A movie about fish. Come on!) Depending on your taste, you might like any of the other Pixar movies better, but I'll say now that if Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are my favorites, Nemo is right up there next to them.<br/><br/>My rating: 5 out of 5. Brilliant, witty, goofy, adventurous, and even a bit suspenseful. Well done, Pixar. Well done."

","In the age-old battle between what's important in film, plot or character? I'm convinced character is king.  Nothing makes this idea truer than a film like Pixar's FINDING NEMO.  A delightful new animated comedy from those guys that brought you Toy Story.<br/><br/>Sure there's a plot; it's about a father fish searching for his son fish. Many films operate on this premise.  In fact even PIXAR's TOY STORY 2, borrows this premise. (For those who don't know TOY STORY 2's main plot is about a toy being stolen by evil toy man, and how his friends try to save him.)  But like the above film FINDING NEMO is really about the colorful characters our hero encounters.<br/><br/>Albert Brooks (The Muse) voices and is Marlin.  His performance could be compared to Woody Allen, who voiced himself in the film ANTZ.  Like Allen this film plays with his film persona, his neurotic tendencies. The minute you see him you buy it.  If Albert Brooks were a Clown Fish this is exactly how he'd look and act.<br/><br/>Ellen Degeneres (Mr. Wrong) voices Dory, and for once she's funny. (Yes, Ellen when you drop the gay jokes and just act funny, you actually have a shot at being entertaining.)  She has some really great sequences in this film; my favorite was her talking to a blue whale.  Dory also has some short-term memory loss.  I kept thinking to myself, so if Memento was comedy about fish, this is probably what it would look like. <br/><br/>
My favorite performance is William Dafoe (Auto-Focus) as Gill.  I liked how the animators used Dafoe's face as the model for Gill's deformity. The details are astounding.  His performance is electric.  He plays the leader of the fish tank with such power, I wished he was my leader.  But Alas, I am not a computer-animated fish.  Oh well.<br/><br/>The film looks amazing.  Directors Andrew Stanton (A Bug's Life) and Lee Unkrich (Monster's Inc) do an amazing job of creating a world under the sea. If you allow yourself the time to immerse yourself in it, you'll be transformed.  It's some of the best digitally rendered computer animation I've ever seen.  It exists in realm somewhere between what's real and what's pure fantasy.  That's the kind of place all computer-animated worlds should lay.<br/><br/>So here it is a great film.  A film that fills a paper-thin plot with characters you laugh with, cry with, and want to be with.  There are vegetarian sharks, lobsters with New England accents, and California surfer turtles, if any of this sounds interesting this is the kind of film for you.<br/><br/>So Swim, don't walk to see.FINDING NEMO."

","Pixar are my favourite studio and they do not disappoint with ""Finding Nemo"". However, it was, for me, not quite as entertaining as their previous four feature masterpieces. Maybe the formula is starting to show through (there were some blatent reuse of comedic style from previous movies in the dialogue) or maybe it was because it was aimed more directly at a young child audience more than the others, but the entertainment didn't feel as rich, the humour not quite so funny. <br/><br/>That said, what was lacking slightly in the originality of story and script, is more than made up for in the quality of the animation. The animation is rich and fluid and, well, just wonderful. I can't wait to scrutinize it more in November when the DVD is released. <br/><br/>I don't know how many of you know Dame Edna, but it shows that Pixar know their comedians when they chose her alter-ego Barry Humphries to voice the Shark. I'm not, however a fan of Ellen and this spoilt my enjoyment of the sidekick fish a little - but I also think her character in the film bordered on annoying more than funny in some scenes. <br/><br/>I'm being brutally critical here. The film's definitely worth watching and confirms my opinion that Pixar are at the top of their craft and are showing up in-house Disney productions of late."

The plot of Finding Nemo is simple.  In a comparatively tough opening scene (for a children's movie) clownfish Marlin loses his wife and all but one of their thousand-odd eggs. The surviving egg hatches to become the titular Nemo, a feisty little fry suffering under the watchful eye of his overprotective father. One day Nemo feels particularly put upon and swims off into dangerous water.  Naturally he is captured by divers and soon finds himself captive in a fish tank. Thus begins Marlin's quest to find and save his son.  At first glance, this looks like standard kiddy movie fodder. Dangers are faced.  Fears are overcome and (big L) Lessons are Learned. The sort of pabulum parents dread sitting through and kids quickly tire of.  For the most part though Pixar successfully navigates the shoals of the mundane. They fill Finding Nemo with enough fascinating details and humorous asides that you forget you've seen essentially the same movie a hundred times on Nickelodeon.  From the dental groupie denizens of Nemo's fish tank to the single-minded seagulls the movie will snag even the most adult viewer's attention throughout. <br/><br/>The first thing that hits you in Finding Nemo is how gorgeous the movie is. The undersea environment simply ripples with color, texture and detail, especially in opening scenes set in a crowded coral reef. Traditional cell animation cannot begin to compete with computer animation in this area. <br/><br/>
Pixar has always been extraordinarily clever in casting the voices of their features and Finding Nemo is no exception. Albert Brooks, an actor known for his neurotic roles, is perfect as the driven father fish Marlin. Willem Dafoe as Gill, Nemo's fish tank mentor, is every old con that ever led an escape attempt. Barry Humphries, usually heard and seen as Dame Edna Everage, sounds exactly like what you'd expect a talking shark to sound like. The featured voices include Eric Bana, Bruce Spence, Elizabeth Perkins, Austin Pendleton, John Ratzenberger and Geoffrey Rush among other - all perfectly cast and all fitting their animated counterparts perfectly. The standout performance, however, is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory the bluefish. She steals the show as Marlin's enthusiastically helpful companion with an unfortunate memory problem.  <br/><br/>Finding Nemo does have its faults. Some sequences are played at such a frenetic pace it becomes hard to sort out what is happening. In particular Marlin and Dory's encounter with a trio of over-friendly sharks suffers from a too frenzied approach.  If I hadn't read that they had stumbled into a Meat-a-holic Anonymous meeting I would probably have missed the joke. This, however, is a relatively minor blip in an otherwise consistently delightful film. With its wealth of humor, vibrant color and stunning attention to detail Finding Nemo is well worth a viewing on the big screen."

","I was prepared to love this movie like Monsters Inc, but all things considered, FN really let me down.  The story and pixar graphics make this a great rental, but barely worth the price of admission.  Some of the characters were likable, the angelfish, Dory, who suffered from short term memory loss was easily the best character, and Nemo was ok but the broken fin thing was retarted.  The word 'retarted' also speaks for just about all of the jokes.  ""Lookie, it's a turtle speedway, but turtles are slow""...ha ha ha-no, not funny.  If you want a decent kids movie, check it out, cuz it's a movie you won't fall asleep over,m and your kids will enjoy it. 6/10"

I would say this is the best animated feature since Shrek.  It's got everything you could want - excitement, adventure, and of course, lots of humor.  The characters are all fun, my personal favorites being Dory, and the turtles, Crush and Squirt.<br/><br/>And as an added bonus of seeing it in the theater, before the show there's a Pixar short that's really good.

","I have always been a Big fan of animated films, ex. Alladin, Beauty and The Beast, Toy Story, etc.  Yet, I have felt of late the animated pictures have been lacking the depth in story and the beauty in animation that they once held.  Finding Nemo has truly, in my opinion, found those elements again. I was greatly entertained with the films intriguing characters and profound plot.  True it is just a cartoon but it was better than your average cartoon:  It relayed the message of letting go. Many people know from experience what it is like to loose a loved one and how that loss effects how a person lives his or her life.  Finding Nemo relayed this concept in a very gentle and truthful way.  A+ Well done Pixar and Disney.  Thanks for going back to the good Days."

"jwisdom","9","0","0","9 June 2003"," Further raising the bar...
","It seems that while watching this movie, it was even harder to suspend the belief that this was a fully computer generated movie.  Harder, compared to any previous Pixar work.  The fish portrayed seemed so amazingly fluid, so lifelike, so believable (well, other than the talking, but of course, they were talking amongst themselves).<br/><br/>I thoroughly was surprised by this movie.  It was much better than I had initially expected.  The previews that I had been seeing for perhaps the last six months or so seemed so empty, like you had no idea what the movie was going to be about.  Advertising consisted of little clips of the fish that were completely taken out of context.  You knew that there'd be something different, based on new levels of animation that were evident... but you didn't have any idea what the movie would be even about.  Even to the ads most recently, you'd have no idea.  I have no idea why they'd approach it this way.  I think that this film is clearly being driven by word of mouth, more than anything.  Now that I've seen it, I'm glad it is doing well in the cinema, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.<br/><br/>Adding the little feature clip at the beginning (the 1989 short ""Knick Knack"") was delightful to see.  Most people haven't seen this one, and I think it's a good example of where Pixar was, and how they still have the creative knack (no pun intended) after all these years.<br/><br/>Overall, a great way to spend about 100 minutes.  Don't forget to stay until the very very end, the credits and accompanying animation are rather interesting."

","The best so far to come out of Pixar-Disney. True to form, the computer-digital effects are fantastic.<br/><br/>
Ellen Degeneres is the most talented of the voices we hear in this delightful underwater tale.  Her performance allows for her blue tane character, Dory, to come alive in so many beautiful and hilariously entertaining ways.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" features numerous sea mines, possessively-hungry seagulls (""Mine, Mine, Mine!"") and aquatic acquaintances that reinforce the importance of friendship.<br/><br/>The plot is a rehash of other more familiar Disney films.  You won't have trouble listing them.  And you won't have to bring the kids with you to watch it.  Most of the audience I saw this film with were well over 18yrs of age.  Slightly irritating is the fact that the narrative continuously bounces back and forth between the two separated clown fish (Marlin and his son Nemo), and the film appears to run 15 minutes too long for my otherwise liberal attention span."

","going along with all the other reviews, all I can say is WOW!!! Pixar/Disney has a MASTERPIECE here. We do not go to the movies very often because of the prices nowadays (looking at around 30-35 bucks for a family of 3- refreshments included). So when we go, We are very picky about the movies we see. my wife and son wanted to see Nemo. I was wanting to see something else. I gave in and wasn't expecting much. cmon it's a kids movie. Boy, was I WRONG!!! This is by far the best movie we've watched in years. I was completely  impressed. The visuals are outstanding and the characters different personalities are great. The movie kept my son (4) attentive throughout (something that hasn't happened much). Usually it's the ""dad i need a drink, dad i gotta go to the bathroom, dad I want my toys"". Not this one. And I think it relates to kids and adults alike. Very funny and has subtle messages. 1.Nemo taking his disability in stride. 2.Parents have to let their kids grow up and explore. This movie hit home several times. Even though I hate to admit it, I actually got a little choked up when Marlin and Nemo finally got back together. That's how involved in the film you'll get. Do Not Let the chance to see Finding Nemo pass you by. Trust me, you'll love it. Money very well spent. We're going back to watch it again this weekend. and will DEFINITELY add this one to the DVD collection when its released. ABSOLUTELY Five stars!!!!!!!!      5/5"

","It was a very enjoyable experience.   Lots of layers for all ages. Visually stunning.<br/><br/>Pixar has made many break throughs with each movie, with each having a quantum leap in something. The realistic water in Nemo is not quite as noticable as the leap of the fluffy/whispy fur in Monsters, but a big leap non the less.<br/><br/>I loved all the nice inside jokes and homages.  I kept expecting a ""Great Escape"" homage with Gill, perhaps having his gimpy fin look like a ball glove or such, but I suppose some would have pointed out that Chicken Run already did it.  I did think that Gill's scar looked a lot like the facial scar in Platoon (problem being it was Tom Berenger's character that had the scar not Defoe's), but then again I might have been looking for way too inside jokes (how about a West Wing hint with the Star fish).<br/><br/>

","This was a great movie with beautiful scenery, incredible animation, and Pixar's unique brand of humor. I understand two of the writers of this movie were once writers for Conan O'Brien.  The comedic exploitation of the characteristics of different fish species was brilliant. I'm a saltwater aquarium hobbyist myself, and found all the different fish traits in the movie quite funny. I especially liked the bit about the flounder not being able find the kids hiding from him on his other side (as flatfish have eyes on one side only). Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres fit their characters PERFECTLY. I can not picture anyone other than Brooks doing Marlon. The funniest thing in this movie has to be the seagulls. All they ever say is ""MINE!"".<br/><br/>The computer-generated scenery in Finding Nemo is breathtaking. Every shot is milked for all the visual splendor it is worth. The jellyfish scene was awesome. My only complaint is that Pixar, being on the leading edge of CGI animation, should try to make PEOPLE more realistic. It doesn't matter so much with cartoon fish, but if a small independent firm in New Zealand is capable of creating Gollum, then Pixar should be able to make some seriously photo-realistic people.<br/><br/>This is not exclusively a movie for kids only. It caters to all audiences, which I think every movie should do. There are even some references to other movies that only film buffs will pick up. My favorite was the ""Psycho"" reference whenever the Dentist's HORRIFYING niece showed up. And then there's Bruce the Shark (a Jaws reference) smashing through a wall yelling ""Here's Brucey"" with the splintered wood framing him exactly as it did Jack Nicholson in The Shining.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is the best animation I've seen in a long time. You HAVE to see this on a DLP projector, it's worth going a few minutes out of your way to see it at a theater that has one. The colors are strikingly brilliant and the picture is crystal-clear. Finding Nemo was created digitally, and should thus be seen in it's native digital format.<br/><br/>I give Finding Nemo a 9 out of 10."

The animation was poignant and extremely accurate. It shows that these guys did their marine life homework before making this film. The story is (as most are) an old one of growing up and letting go but I am particularly grateful to the writers for not putting too many fight/nagging scenes as most movies/TV programs do when they use this type of plot.

","There is nothing I can add to anyone's opinion about Nemo that hasn't already been said. What I find sad is the fact that a near perfect marriage between Pixar and Disney will soon come to an end due to Micheal Eisner's seemingly eternal greed. Pixar's contract with Disney will end with their next film,and I'm certain that they will not renew,especially with companies like Dreamworks out there.To make a long story short,Eisner claims that sequels don't count with the original agreement between Pixar and Disney. This seems to have been a huge surprise to Pixar after the release of Toy Story 2. It's the reason that we will never see a Toy Story 3,or a sequel to A Bug's Life,etc. I'm sure that legally,Lord Farrquaad has taken steps to assure that Pixar will never be able to use these characters without involving the Disney Co.,but it will be interesting to see what Pixar will create post Disney while Eisner basks in the glory of such classic film releases of Country Bears,or Brother Bear....you get the idea.

It's the kind of technique that either looks brilliant or hideous, and Pixar just keeps on getting more amazing.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing Finding Nemo ever since I saw the trailer last year, and my high expectations paid off! It's a little bit darker than Pixar's previous movies, but the humor totally makes up for it. One of Pixar's best talents is being able to entertain on so many levels. ANYONE can love a Pixar movie, and Finding Nemo is no exception. Everyone in the theater got a kick out of it (try saying that about a third-rate Disney sequel). <br/><br/>The animation is the best Pixar has ever done, but it's always the story that takes the cake in their movies. It's the SCRIPT that keeps me watching them over and over, not just eye candy. Finding Nemo's story dragged just a little at times, but it wasn't enough to make me annoyed.

I probably wouldn't have gone, except that the last two Disney movies I had seen (Monsters Inc. and Lilo & Stitch) had actually been pretty good. Those I had seen on DVD, so this time I decided to see it in theatres.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, I am SOOOOO glad I went! The animation was AWESOME- I have never seen water portrayed so realistically in an animated film before. The storyline was great too, not so many sad moments that it killed the film but not so many funny parts that half the movie was completely pointless to the plot. Plus, you've got your suspenseful OMG-a-shark-is-chasing-me scene, gotta love that. The characters were fun to watch but not too cutesy, as I had expected a Disney/Pixar movie about fish to be.<br/><br/>All I have to add is, Finding Nemo has officially beat Monsters, Inc. as my favorite Disney movie. I am soooo going to get it on DVD Go see it soon!"
"jeben","8","0","0","2 June 2003"," Is Dad a Hero or a Clown?
","As usual, the animation was leading-edge. I loved the colors and perfect blend of underwater softness with up-close crispness. Sadly, the people are always the hardest to make CG realistic and again the humans in FN are rather unconvincing.<br/><br/>What troubled me the most was Marlin. This dad was protective of his only remaining son... but was he over-protective? I'm a dad and trust me, fun becomes danger in the blink of an eye. I found that most of Marlin's perceived fears were completely justified! Marlin was not imagining monsters around every corner but only in places where there was a legitimate possibility. The fact that Marlin had experienced a horrifying tragedy and that perhaps this memory and painful loss was the cause of his protectiveness was never put on the witness stand. No supporting character ever pitied him and used this as a starting place for their advice- they all started in on him like he was the big bad guy, treating him like he needed therapy. The school teacher promised that little Nemo would be carefully supervised, but it took only 2 seconds and that kid was gone and in another 10 seconds and he was ""shark-bait"".<br/><br/>Likewise, Nemo was always portrayed as a normal kid with normal interests and curiosity. This kid was normal all right- normally undiscerning, normally foolish, normally empty-headed and normally disrespectful. Sure, all kids have feelings and are sensitive and need understanding, but the story never developed this line realistically.<br/><br/>It was so unfortunate that Nemo was continually being taught the street-wisdom he desperately lacked by someone other than his Dad-- a theme that made Dad even look worse than over-protective, perhaps even abusive in a passive sense for his negligence in properly educating Nemo.<br/><br/>The ""gang"" style initiation and misfit/outcast bonding that takes place among the tank prisoners almost seems to favor psudo-family relationships above true-blood family ties.<br/><br/>I loved the heroic adventure and human, male/female foibles and weaknesses highlighted in each danger situation.<br/><br/>Dory's need/love/longings explosion against Marlin in the final give-up scene didn't play well since her dependence on Marlin wasn't even a sub-plot at any earlier point in the movie. This outburst didn't even get another frame later to help tie it up better.<br/><br/>I liked Dory's character and the way here marble-challenged personality was used in the humor, but the ""life is smoother for the low of IQ"" theme was stretched too thin. Brains are standard equipment on all models.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, tho... I didn't miss the point. I just wanted to weigh-in on the Dad side. The final family resolution does finally paint the family as it should have been all along without the crisis. My only beef is that Dad was more justified for his paranoia than he was ever given credit for and the child had more attitude, ignorance and disobedience than was portrayed."

","Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes Nemo. Maybe responding to the gauntlets thrown down by DreamWorks (Shrek) and Fox (Ice Age), Disney/Pixar have come out with their most visually stunning and most emotionally moving film yet.  The humor, small details, background action, and minor characters (the gulls really cracked me up!) provide the richness that make this a definite see-again.  But maybe the best compliment is how thoroughly I forgot the CG wizardry and was drawn into the world of the characters. You don't need to know it's computer animation, it's just *animation*, and it keeps getting better all the time.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see what those folks will come up with next...."

I spent some time in the lobby with my youngest(almost 3), although the other two were fine (5 and 7).<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it was brilliant...the story probably could have been a little deeper, but the scenery was some serious eye candy and Ellen DeGeneres stole the show.

"cmartin1365","Null","0","0","1 June 2003"," Better than Monsters, Inc. ?
","I was truly astounded by what I saw. The effects of the water and little background objects was amazing. On some levels it made Monsters, Inc. look ancient. The story was a typical ""Have to find somebody"" plot but it had a fresh take on it as the single parent made it more real. The thing that sets this movie apart from others is the secondary characters. Pixar really pays attention to getting these right. Sometimes they even overshadow the main characters they get to be so good. As always, lessons are learned and fun was had by all. After Jungle Book 2 and countless other run of the mill sequels Disney is pumping out, Pixar again shows that Disney needs lead or get out of the way. I generally rate a movie on the consumption of food. A lot of food eaten, it was bad. Hardly any food eaten, too good. So let's put it this way: My 6 year old sat transfixed and my 3 year old sat with his face on the seat in front of him watching. All the food consumed? 5 pieces of licorice. That's it. They were just far too busy watching to eat."

","In  `Toy Story: we were treated to a hip, fresh view of life from the toy's point of view.  Ditto for `A Bug's Life'. `Monsters Inc' rounded out Pixar's penchant for getting inside the head of the imaginary and creating an intriguing world that.sucked us in and took as for a great ride.<br/><br/>Enter :'Finding Nemo'.  It is here Pixar has dropped the ball.  Do we get a fresh, unique perspective of life from the Fish point of view? Nope. Fish swim, they are afraid of predators, and well, that's about it.  The ocean is a dangerous place, a theme repeated with boring redundancy throughout the film.  The plot slogs along from one anxiety invoking mishap to the next, with little humor intervening. What little humor there is comes across as weak. The scene with sharks in an AA type meeting swearing off fish as meals simply doesn't work.   I guarantee you will check your watch in the first 30 mins, then regularly thereafter.<br/><br/>I understand kids movies are to be simple and funny, with the occasional sad parts and near misses.  This is more near misses and sad parts, and I just expected much more from Pixar in terms of story and imagination.  The animation is absolutely breathtaking, and the acting is excellent.  Too bad the underlying skeleton is so weak.<br/><br/>I see the next Pixar film, slated for November, is `The Incredibles.'  It has a different writer, so hopefully we'll have shot at getting things up to snuff."
"everybodyz_a_suspect","Null","0","0","31 May 2003"," Finding Nemo is fun, but a bit over kids' heads
","My sister and I took my three year old twin boys to see the movie and while she and I thoroughly enjoyed the film, my little ones didn't quite grasp the humor of it. I know three is a young age, but Pixar tends to aim the jokes toward the adults in hopes that we don't get bored and a) fall asleep or b) drag our kids out of the theater before the movie ends. The adults in the theater loved the humor, but the kids were all asking, ""Mama, what's funny?"" or ""Daddy, why are you laughing?"" The kids enjoyed the scenes, but most cried or begged to sit in their parents' laps when the three sharks, a barracuda, and an evil looking fish with a light on it's head and long, sharp teeth came on the screen. While the sharks proved comical, the other two scenes scared the little ones to death. My own boys would not leave our laps even after the scenes were over. If you have real little ones and are thinking of seeing this movie, skip the snacks for yourself because most likely, the kids will be occupying your lap through most of the movie. I thought the movie was great, but the humor and dramatic scenes are a bit too much for the kids. I also think that Dads should take their kids to see this, it is a really sweet movie about how far a father will go to find and bring his only son back home. Ellen DeGeneres voices the part of Dory, a goofy, if somewhat annoying, blue fish with a very short term memory, but she adds even more color to the movie. Hope you enjoy it!"

However, the humor that infused the entire movie kept this from happening.  Finding Nemo is the best kind of comedy. Totally unlike so many comedies today, where you have a few really funny scenes connected by long periods of not funny.  My husband commented that this was the most continuously funny movie that he had seen in a long time.  I personally did not expect to like this movie.  I don't care for Albert Brooks, or Ellen DeGeneres, but the movie itself distracted me from who was doing the voices.<br/><br/>My two girls, 7 & 9, loved it.

","This is not Monsters Inc. and, of course, not Shrek (by DreamWorks). Animation is excellent and leaves nothing to complain about, but the story is not that good. It feels very disjointed and fragmentary, you don't really feel the flow (despite it being set in the ocean). Often it is too predictable (I know, it's not a thriller, but still you can make it somewhat original and surprising sometimes) and during some moments even boring. There is not really much for adults in this film (like there was in Shrek), except for quite funny Memento-like Dora with her short-term memory loss, a couple forced semi-funny jokes, like ""what's with men asking for direction"" and supposedly funny ""totally cool"" turtle ""dude"".<br/><br/>I recommend renting it on DVD or cassette just to see the eye-candy (even a cam version would be enough) and that's all.

"Aaron D","10","0","0","30 May 2003"," The best Pixar film yet!
","Yes, it was THAT good!<br/><br/>First off, the animation was superb. We are talking total immersion in this oceanic adventure. No pun intended. Okay, it was. But still.... The amount of detail to each individual fish, shark, whale, seagull, anemone and turtle is astounding. If not for the human-like facial expressions/exaggeration and characteristics you would almost think you were watching a National Geographic special. Only better! And the water! Of course you have to make it believable that you are watching a movie about being underwater...and they sell it. Very realistic and imaginative depiction of ocean life down to how the sunlight streams through the water.<br/><br/>Okay, the eye-candy out of the way (wow, animation never looked so good!) the voice-acting is fantastic! Albert Brooks as Marlin (Nemo's Dad), Ellen DeGeneres stealing the show as Dory (she was extremely funny), and of course other big names like Geoffrey Rush, and Willem Dafoe and even Eric Bana of soon-to-be HULK fame lent their voice talents to this grand story.<br/><br/>If you don't know the story by now, it's basically this: Nemo is a clown-fish that accidentally ends up being taken from his home. Marlin, his over-protective father sets off to search for him in the big blue, and along the way picks up help from very interesting characters along the way, not the least of which is Dory.<br/><br/>During the first 15 minutes of the film you are introduced of course to the characters and then a tragedy occurs leading us to the events of having to find Nemo. Even though this film like all Disney fare, is intended for kids enjoyment, it has some grown-up themes and plenty of things for adults to enjoy. Pixar has demonstrated their ability to make a film on kids and adults level alike with their other efforts.<br/><br/>I was surprised but how successful and seamless a story this was, considering that it was director Andrew Stanton's first time at the helm of a Pixar studio's film... but he has carried the tradition of perfection with flying colors. Most movies, animated and non-animated alike, usually never get it so right.<br/><br/>The music is a superb mixture of orchestral music and appropriate tropical instrumental music to set the mood and tone of the story and it's various moments. Instead of Pixar favorite Randy Newman doing the score for yet another Pixar flick, the reins were handed to Thomas Newman, who is none other than Randy's cousin as well as the son of Alfred Newman, who is famous in his own right for his film scores before his death in 1970 resulting from emphysema. His (Alfred) most recognized work, and perhaps most insignificant, is the theme you hear during the FOX 20th Century studio trailers before one of their movies. At any rate, Thomas Newman has composed a fantastic score that sets the mood wonderfully, and yet never really stands out above the events of the movie. And why should it? The rendered animation is a sight to behold and carries the story well enough on it's own along with the stellar voice cast.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 stars!"

","Having no difficulty whatsoever getting in touch with my inner child, I took a deep breath and dove underwater for Pixar's latest film.  ""Finding Nemo"" is no mere cartoon.  I don't think I could like any animated character better than I do those ""Toy Story"" costars, Woody and Buzz, (actually I like Woody and Buzz more than most ""real"" actors) but Marlin (the ever-neurotic Albert Brooks) and Dory (a hilarious Ellen DeGeneres) are a close second to those screen buddies.  Pixar has outdone itself, creating a water world of such splendor that you forget it's drawn with a pen (or a computer). Halfway through the film, when Nemo is captured in the dentist's aquarium, and Marlin and Dorie are two small fish in the vast blue sea, I gasped at the impossibility of them ever seeing each other again.  How in the world will they find Nemo?  It's a marvel that director Andrew Stanton makes us care enough to help plot escape strategies.  The menacing and misunderstood Bruce (named after Speilberg's mechanical fish?), played by Dame Edna, is just too funny, and Stanton himself also does a mean surfer dude as the voice of Crush the seaturtle.  Willem Dafoe is sadly perfect as Gil and that underwater sea creature, the one that lives in the very deepest depths of the ocean looks like it's right out of the ""Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.  Pixar certainly put to rest the argument ""do fish feel?""  Of course they do.  And they have a pretty good sense of humor too.  Don your water wings and fly to see this one."

","Finding Nemo is absolutely amazing. First thing to be said is that the animation is the best to date, as should be expected from the wonderful Pixar team. The plot of this film is wonderful. It has many ups and downs, and it handles the back and forth look between the adventures of the father and the son. The script is excellent. There are many wonderful lines in the film, and never once did I feel this movie was attempting to make children's jokes. The script is very mature. The acting (animation) is wonderful. Lots of emotion visually was conveyed through the characters. The acting (voicing) is great too. All voices matched characters well and I really enjoyed the variety of stereotype voices. Voicing scene-stealer: William DeFoe's, ""That never stopped me,"" as he displays his mutilated side. The cinematography was outstanding. Great camera angles, shots using color were beautiful, while shots that incorporated the suspense of the difficult-to-see-through water were -- well, suspenseful. Finding Nemo is funny, scary, suspenseful, thrilling, moving, and definitely entertaining. This is one of those films that people will have on their DVD rack. See it. Enjoy.<br/><br/>Patrick"

The celebrity voices are great; Allison Janney from West Wing is a wonderful starfish, Willem DeFoe, always a seductive voice, is a scar worn Tang, even the movie's creator, Andrew Stanton was greatness as the sea turtle Crush. This is one G rated film that is definitely for everyone, any age, any circumstances - see this alone, on a date, with your family - just go...I was swept away with not knowing what was going to happen next, the colors and visuals and the realisation of the sea - the humour, the storyline (a Dad prevails!) all add up to an A+, #1, Best Picture of the Year achievement.

"Nezz","Null","0","0","3 June 2003"," Pixar are the masters.
","If you can get past the first 15 minutes of Pixar's latest, you'll get a movie that is on par with their four other feature films. Finding Nemo turns out to be a big, adventure film with a lot of laughs and a heart that is barely on the good side of manipulation. Once the adventure starts, the emersion into the film begins and doesn't let you go.<br/><br/>The movie plays up on over-protective parents, kids overcoming their disabilities, friendships conquering obstacles, addicts joining together to be better people (uh, fish), building self-esteem, realizing and accepting strengths and curmudgeons learning to lighten up. All this in an animated, family-oriented, 'G' movie? You bet! Pixar are the masters at the making everyone happy film. They give the parents being dragged into the theater something to enjoy as well.<br/><br/>If only they had done something with that beginning. The films opens in a fish suburbia complete with happy families, beautiful homes and a peaceful way of life all with no hint of sardonic humor. Yes, there are people who think that is heaven, but what about those who make fun it? At least give them something to chuckle about. It's Utopia for the Family Values set and completely out of character for Pixar.<br/><br/>It's at this point I thought they had finally produced their first sub-standard film. That is until a barracuda changes the main characters lives forever and Albert Brooks goes into, well, Albert Brooks mode. Marlin has a son, Nemo, who has an underdeveloped fin and therefore can't swim well. This combined with the catastrophe at the beginning of the film causes Marlin to smother Nemo. Nemo, finally fed up, rebels, ends up being caught by a diver and spirited away. Marlin sets out after Nemo and that's when the film finally picks up with some adventure and some laughs.<br/><br/>And when that laugh level is revved up, it's supplied by the scene-stealing Ellen DeGeneres as a blue tang named Dory. Dory is basically an idiot savant. She has a severe short-term memory loss problem. Now fish are believed to have no short-term memory so the jokes on the surface play on this; however, in a scene where Dory is faced with being alone without friends again, you wonder if it's a form of denial. She says in the scene that she doesn't want to forget anymore and that having Marlin around helps her remember because he is the only one that has stuck by her. Does she really have this problem or is it that she is so disappointed with no one understanding her that she hides everything? The scene is multi-layered and heart wrenching. Ellen plays it surprisingly well as if she identifies with what Dory is going through. That's what makes the scene work so well. Many of us have gone through the same thing and know how she feels.<br/><br/>There are many, many memorable scenes in the film as Marlin attempts to find Nemo who is now in a fish tank in a dentist office. One of the scenes is supplied in a superb performance by William Dafoe as Gill, an angelfish in the tank with Nemo who is from the ocean (not a pet store) and dreams of escaping and taking his new friends with him. He devises a scheme to get them out that is hair-brained and daring, but with one little plot hole that the film plays up to hilarious effect at the end. Another great scene is with a trio of sharks that have sworn off fish in the most unlikely AA meeting imaginable. Their motto: ""Fish are our friends and not food!""<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is grand and exciting adventure that once it gets beyond it's slow opening turns into exactly what you expect from the masterminds at Pixar. A film that is imaginative and visually stunning with big adventures for everyone no matter how old they are on the outside."

","Finding Nemo is a great film.  It is packed with a lot of humor!  It also has some parts that can sadden children, but overall it is something that the family can enjoy.<br/><br/>I guess some irony can make the movie interesting, like a shark on a 12-step program to become friends with fish or a pelican telling a fish to hop in it's mouth to save it's life.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with some sad scenes, like Nemo's mother (with the eggs) getting eaten by a barracuda.  Nemo is the only child of Marlin, who is now overprotective of his son.<br/><br/>Well, I won't spoil the movie for you, but I have heard from others that, even though it's rated G, some of the younger children did actually cry during the movie.<br/><br/>Well, overall, it was a great movie with amazing graphics.  It's no wonder they spent a long time working on this project, but it did pay off.<br/><br/>I rate this film a 9 out of 10."

","My daughter and I took my grandsons (2years old and his big brother 13 years old) to see this and it was super.  It was a little scary for the 2year old but not unbearable.  The story is family oriented and does flashes from where Nemo is to where his father is, which small children will not understand but I don't think they care.  The animation was fantastic as Pixar and Disney would be expected to produce and the humor was side splitting in spots.  The 12 step shark meetings were funny without insulting real 12 steppers and when Dorie speaks whale everyone laughs.  I was a little uncomfortable with the Dentist office at first (who needs to scare kids of dental tools, but that was the only iffy spot I remember.  I have to take a little friend to see this now and I can't wait it was that good a film."
"WilliamSG","Null","0","0","1 June 2003"," Losing Pixar?
","Yes, perhaps you read into the one line summary a little too much, but...Pixar really need to pick it up a little. It's not that 'Finding Nemo' is a BAD movie. Not by any means... - it's just that story-wise it's not as good as 'Monster's Inc' which in turn, wasn't as good as 'A Bug's Life'...<br/><br/>
Visually, 'Finding Nemo' is a masterpiece of graphic design. The water looks fabulously real, and when you see the above-water scenes, you have to gape at how lush it all looks. <br/><br/>Ellen DeGeneres gives the best performance as the enigmatic fish suffering from short term memory loss. This gives way to some rather amusing quips and dialoguing between her and Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks, who's trying to find his son Nemo). <br/><br/>Other than DeGeneres, there's absolutely no memorable voices in the movie. Albert Brooks actually grated on my nerves considerably, and at times I wished he's get eaten by a shark or stung to death by jelly-fish. Sure, that wouldn't be typical cutesy Pixar, but heck...there was a small (but unnecessary) 'bloody' scene in this film that wasn't typical Pixar.<br/><br/>
Another issue with this latest Pixar blockbuster is the lack of flow in the storyline. It kept cutting from Marlin's part of the movie to Nemo's part of the movie. Yes, the storyline makes that necessary, but it just didn't flow as well, which is a shame. The storyline itself is also incredibly basic. 'A Bug's Life,' for instance, was FAR more interesting, and at times during 'Nemo' I found myself a little bored.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this movie a 7/10. It certainly wasn't bad, but Pixar really need to up the ante to keep this up. The box-office takings might disagree with me, but there needs to be a little more substance in future Pixar offerings."
"CoolDan","10","0","0","1 June 2003"," One of the most touching, heartwarming films I've ever seen. An absolute must-see.
","To start this review, let me just say that there is a difference between a feel-good movie and a feel-warm movie. Toy Story 2 was built to be a feel-good movie, and it succeeded in spades. Finding Nemo was built to be a feel-warm movie, and wow, wow, wow, does it ever succeed in spades. If I wasn't so freakishly mature, I would have been sobbing like a baby during this movie, but rest assured I was choked up good. When the movie ended, the audience applauded (including me) and I left the theater with an involuntary dazzling smile on my face and a heart filled up like a water balloon. I'm going to say this right off the batÂ…this is Pixar's second best movie and so far one of the best movies of the year. It falls short of Toy Story 2 but only by a hair. This is one of the bravest movies Pixar has done. You see, Pixar has mastered the classic CGI comedy-adventure movie with a hint of drama. That's what made the Toy Story flicks and A Bug's Life so good. And Pixar could have easily used this winning formula for Finding Nemo, but it didn't. It instead tried to achieve a classic CGI drama-adventure with a hint of comedy. It was a daring risk that could have failed, but instead it succeeded beyond what I could have ever imagined. It was only touching, never mushy. Even though this is a wild under-sea adventure complete with a fish with bad memory and a surfer-dude turtle, it's a movie many people can relate to. You see, this movie is about Marlin, a fish who loses his son, the only one left from a shark attack that kills the rest of his children and his wife. And Marlin dedicates the rest of his life to raising and protecting his son, whom he names Nemo. But when Nemo is kidnapped by a diver, the only thing that meant anything to Marlin, the only big thing in his life he had left, is gone. Everyone knows what it's like to have something very, very important to them, be it a trinket or a son, and when it gets lost, many people will weep and not do anything. But it's a rare breed of people who try to search for that thing at any cost. And Marlin is part of that breed. He never gives up trying to find his son the entire movie, and that is the most heartwarming aspect of this movie. But that's not the only good thing about this movie. The score, the voicework, the animation, and the comedy also deserve major kudos. And while the movie is a little less satisfying than Toy Story 2 (emphasis on little), this is still Pixar's runner-up best movie and one of the best movies of the year. Highly recommended. Bring yourself, bring the kids, and bring the Kleenex.<br/><br/>I give this movie a perfect, well-deserved 10/10."
"KatieBug19","8","0","0","31 May 2003"," How Sweet Is This Film?
","""Finding Nemo"" is beyond charming and incredibly sweet.  So sweet, in fact, that the worst I can say about it is that parts left me with a toothache.<br/><br/>The film begins in melodramatic, ""Bambi"" style with the tragic deaths of Coral and 399 of her eggs, leaving only her husband, Marlin, and their sole surviving son, Nemo (FYI: Nemo is Latin for 'no one').  As a result, Marlin is very over-protective of Nemo; driving him (Nemo) to disobey his father, swimming out into open water, where he is captured by divers (""Do they think they own the ocean?""  ""They must be American!"").  From there, the story diverges, following Nemo's life in a dentist office tank and Marlin's frantic search for his son.  The ensuing adventures are tender, funny, entertaining, and occasionally frightening.  Although predictable, the story's resolution is the cherry on top of this delightful sundae.<br/><br/>Worth special mention is the film's amazing animation.  No other animated film has yet captured water's beauty in the way this film does.  The colors are so realistic; but also worth stressing, is the wonderful ways in which all of the characters physically display personalities.  Who knew that fish could be so expressive?<br/><br/>As I mentioned at the beginning, the sweetness is the film's main weakness. Parts actually elicited an audibly ""ahhhh"" from the audience, which may be a bit over the top.  These same parts almost seemed to beg that response, which I think is the problem: not that the film is sweet, but that it wants to you think that its sweet.<br/><br/>Another pet peeve of mine is the almost exclusively supporting role female characters play.  Women in Pixar films, with the possible exception of Boo in ""Monsters, Inc."", are always sidekicks, never the focus of the narrative. Ellen DeGeneres (`Dory') is certainly fantastic, but her role really only exists to cause change in Marlin (Albert Brooks).<br/><br/>That being said, I really, really, enjoy this movie: 8/10 (which is high for me)."

","Pixar continues its winning ways. The graphics are so good, the Ocean comes alive with creatures, undulating debris, bubbles, color and enough wonders to fill three films.  And yet again, Pixar's staff remembers what Disney forgets:  STORY, STORY, STORY.  Cutesy animation is OK but can't make up for inane screenplays (Treasure Planet and Atlantis, the lost empire, for example).  Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and all the other voices do their jobs so well.  What an adventure! By the way, this old man (60)who shared the theater with children of all ages.  Surprisingly, once Finding Nemo started, no one chattered away and no cell phones rang; the only sounds emanating from the viewers were those of great satisfaction.

Plus, the film is much, much better than the knock-off film, SHARK TALE.<br/><br/>The film has one of the simplest plots I have ever seen in a kids movie. Nemo loves his dad and vice-versa. When Nemo is captured for a home aquarium, the timid dad springs to the rescue with rather predictable results. There are no major surprises BUT the journey along the way is pleasant and cute. The kids will no doubt love it but some parents may find it a bit ""sticky"" and shallow like I did. But considering how much fun my daughter had watching it, this can all be forgiven."

","Okay, I admit, this wasn't really a god-awful film - on the contrary - it's passable and somewhat good entertainment - for _young_ children that is. To a person who really loves animation, such as me, this was a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>I can't understand what happened at Pixar. Films like ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life"" were truly original and delightful movies to enjoy. But Finding Nemo?! Let's see. ""How about we make a adventurous comedy about sea-creatures - I bet nobody has done that previously!"" Yeah, riiight. And the so called ""comedy"".. It suffocated to death like a fish on dry land (ehhheheheheheh) when they desperately tried to force laughs out of the audience with idiotic and worn-out jokes we've heard countless of times before. I think that I managed to smile during the film - or the 100 minutes ordeal - not even once. I guess they saved all their fireworks for ""The Incredibles"" which really WAS an incredible movie (I apologize for my poor pun).<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is not the worst animation movie at all, but for a Pixar movie, it's an embarrassment. But it is, if nothing else, joy for the eyes, although not to be recommended to anyone over the age of six."
"whothennow24","4","2","5","19 September 2006"," Why I think this movie is horrible in terms of creativity
","Notice I didn't say, ""Why this movie sucks."" I am merely stating my opinion, people. And for those of you who say the Finding Nemo message boards are for people who LIKE the movie--you are wrong. The message boards are supposed to be ABOUT the movie, and that's all. The following message DOES belong in this message board, even though it is a negative message.<br/><br/>Why I don't like this movie (and many other CGI's): <br/><br/>1) Pixar: ""Well we've done a movie about this, we've done a movie about that, now all we need is a movie about fish! But it won't be hard, we'll just take the themes from our other movies and put it underwater."" <br/><br/>2) Pixar movies all have the same unoriginal puns in them, and those puns are the only reason the movies are considered funny. A fish in a Pixar movie would say, ""Give me high fin!"" instead of ""high five."" It's really unoriginal and as un-clever as ""un-clever"" can be. A place in a Pixar movie will say, ""Give me high wing!"" A Bug's Life had another awfully uncreative pun: ""Shoo, fly, don't bother me."" And the funny part? He said it to a fly! HAHAHAHAHAHA, get it?! Jeez, Pixar is ridiculous. Toy story and Ice Age are really the only clever ones out there that don't rely on puns for humor. Superhero Pixar movie: ""Eat your vegetables so you get stronger."" HAHAHAHAHAHA! He's ALREADY strong! HAHA! <br/><br/>3) Dory: more annoying than Chris Rock's voice, more annoying than Chris Tucker screaming at Ice Cube. More annoying than the fact that almost all of the children's movies out there today are CGI. <br/><br/>4) Even in the movies where the characters are HUMANS, they STILL are trying to replace regular animation. CGI art is easier than pencil; computers automate a lot of the movements of things. The artist sets a track for the fish fins to follow, for the tail to follow, for the body to follow, hits okay, and boom, you got a fish swimming.<br/><br/>5) And again, for emphasis: same jokes as every other Pixar movie out there."

The characters are well defined and are very recognizable. The 'family' concepts of upbringing, love and devotion are definitely the strong points of this movie. Though my daughter (she's only 2!) does not understand a word, she loves each and every scene in this movie!! The only thing my daughter did not like about this movie was perhaps the fact that Nemo did not have a mother. We made her think Dori and Marlyn are Nemo's father and mother! My wife, though she hates animation was speechless when she saw this!! Amazing movie...I'd say this is the best animated movie ever made!!!"
"CHIPSTOFFEE","10","2","5","7 September 2005"," best film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Without a doubt the best thing Pixar have done yet - The Incredibles was excellent but not quite funny enough and Toy Story I found unwatchable simply because it stars Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The animation is just incredible, from the charming characters to the light constantly shifting through the water everything is just perfect. Also the scripting that makes us really care about a bunch of fish is great too.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is the voice casting. Willem Dafoe as Gill and the excellent Alison Janney as Peach shine in the tank scenes along with Geoffrey Rush as Nigel (a credit to the film with such talent taking small roles) and Barry Humphries as Bruce and director Andrew Stanton as crush provide great comedy in their role. One fault is Albert Brookes as lead fish Marlin, while sympathetic he is not quite endearing enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>Ellen Degeneres as Dory (alone she is worth the price of the DVD) just has to be the funniest character ever, showing a rare pizazz and no shame for the forgetful but lovable blue fish. Too many moments to mention but highlights include:- forgetting she is showing Marlin which way the boat went, I'm a natural blue, 'no eating here tonight! You on a diet' and of course the whale speak scenes, 'I didn't know you could speak whale' being the funniest line for years. She is also very moving towards the end a feat not achieved by Robin Williams as the genie in Aladdin or Eddie Murphy as the dragon in whatever that film about a Chinese girl was called.<br/><br/>To sum up I urge everyone to see this film - hilarious, beautiful to look at and surprisingly touching without being overly sentimental like most Disney films. Unmissable"
"ray-280","10","2","5","1 August 2005"," A cut above....way above
","I saw Monsters, Inc. and thought it was a good film, but the animation and plot were a predictable technological evolution to the old Saturday morning cartoons. I couldn't bear Toy Story or A Bug's Life, so I'm definitely not a fan of the Pixar style, but this film transcends its genre and is one of the all-time classics, animated or not. All that is required for an incredible viewing experience is the suspension of a few minor disbeliefs: fish can't talk, and their eyes are on the sides of their heads (not their foreheads). That said, we have a nearly perfect film in that it couldn't have easily been improved upon.<br/><br/>Before I continue, let me give credit to what makes this film perfect rather than merely great: ELLEN DEGENERIS. She should have gotten the Oscar for Best Actress with her portrayal of Dory, a character that could easily have been butchered by a weaker talent. Without her performance, this film is just Monsters, Inc. with better animation and a slightly better plot. Of the other actors, Albert Brooks is predictably competent as Marlin, while Willem DaFoe's jaded Gill is a treat for all ages. The remaining cast was decent, but interchangeable.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's simple: Marlin and Coral are proud parents of 400 eggs, all but one of whom (along with Coral) are killed in the opening sequence by a shark, which sets the tone of the movie in that we are repeatedly reminded that the Ocean is an underwater jungle. This is also a main strength of the movie in that the other fish in the ocean are portrayed as more than plot devices, and have lives (and goals) of their own, many of which involve putting Marlin (and Dory) in harm's way.<br/><br/>The surviving egg, Nemo, is captured by a scuba diver and winds up in a fishtank in a dentist's office with a group of ""POW"" fish who are always trying (and failing) to escape. The ""secret world of fish"" angle does seem appropriated from Dr. Doolittle 2, but this can be forgiven as necessary for the plot. The story is a coming-of-age one not for Nemo, but for Marlin, whose quest for his lost son distracts him from his normal phobia of the ocean, sending him on an adventure which is inspirational as well as educational. I learned more about the ocean from watching this film than in all of my school years put together! Children under 12 should not watch this movie without an adult, as some of the scenes are downright scary, but this only adds to the realism of the film."

","The very first computer animated film made, and by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar was Toy Story, and since then we've had A Big's Life, Dinosaur, Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc. This was one of the most successful Disney films at the cinema to date. It is the underwater story of a young clown fish named Nemo (Alexander Gould) taken by divers and put into a tank. The idea is obviously his Dad, Marlin (Albert Brooks), and new friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss, are ""finding"" him. Meanwhile, Nemo along with new friends including fishes Gill (Willem Dafoe), Bloat (Brad Garrett), Peach (Allison Janney), Gurgle (Austin Pendleton), Bubbles (Stephen Root), Deb/Flo (Vicki Lewis), Jacques (Joe Ranft) and pelican Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) are trying to escape. Along the journey Marland and Dory encounter three sharks, including Bruce (Barry Humphries, aka Dame Edna Everage) (named after the rubber Shark in the Jaws series), stinging jellyfish, turtles in a current tunnel, including ""dude"" Crush (Andrew Stanton) and much more, but he finds him eventually, and everything's fine. Also starring Big's Elizabeth Perkins as Coral, Nicholas Bird as Squirt, Bob Peterson as Mr. Ray, Eric Bana as Anchor and Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as Fish School. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated for Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound Editing and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

The ""whale talking"" got old real fast. But, the anti-American jab (which got the biggest laugh) was outrageous.

But finding Nemo is a flop- a fish swimming around looking for another fish, with a stupid sidekick ya that's an excellent story line. *Rolls Eyes* They could have written a much better story and script."

","This review contains spoilers!<br/><br/>For everything that is visually brilliant and realistic in ""Finding Nemo"", there is so much wrong with this Pixar effort. So, where do I start? Okay, I'll start where the movie starts: with the violent death of ""Coral"" and 399 baby fish (no joke--a very scary-looking barracuda attacks the family less than four minutes into the film!). I'm not sure if the title should have been ""Did Coral Really Die?"", because I spent the whole movie waiting for the happy reunion. Sadly, there was none. Poignant and original, but way too intense for kids.<br/><br/>(The anemone they chose to raise their expected family of 400 was too small, anyway!)<br/><br/>This movie starts off cute (after the opening pathos, of course), with lovable characters (the young sea creatures at the reef), and the tone-deaf stingray teacher is somewhat original and funny. After this, however, the whole thing goes off into one nonsense scene after another. Granted: Fish don't talk, but better movies than this have talking fish.<br/><br/>To start, this movie has its own version of ""Jar-Jar Binks"" (an annoying character from Lucasfilm's ""Star Wars"" who is credited with utterly destroying the verisimilitude of that franchise), and her name is ""Dory"". Annoying, because her one, well-overextended joke is that she has ""short-term memory loss"". This can be taken as either cute or disturbing, depending on how you choose to enjoy the film. I chose disturbing, because I kept anticipating that she would just snap, forget everything, and abandon poor ""Marlin"" forever. Every time her memory lapses, its as if she's met Marlin for the first time. That distracts from the thread of the story and makes her a very tenuous ally at best. (Not to mention, this borders on making fun of serious memory-loss diseases in the name of entertainment. That in itself is an uncomfortable distraction.)<br/><br/>Next, for those who dislike Pauly Shore-speak, there's ""Crush"" (voiced by the movie's director), a sea turtle, who couldn't be a more stereotypical ripoff of Sean Penn's ""Spicoli"" character in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"". His hybrid, Muscle Beach-meets-Valley Girl on Valium lingo is so passé as to make him look like more of a dork than the ""cool dude"" that the filmmakers seem to be trying to pull off. He'd be a little more likable if they hadn't tried so hard to make him ""hip"". He's friendly, but over-the-top.<br/><br/>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, there's a dubious, wildly inappropriate scene built around the very unfunny topic of alcoholics anonymous in this ""family"" effort, and it involves vegetarian(!) sharks, who sputter support-group catch phrases such as ""Remember the steps!"", ""Intervention!"", that kids just won't understand (or care about). If this was meant to be humor for the adults in the audience, it fails miserably, because the subject is based on an issue of human suffering and misery! This is Rush Limbaugh humor, and is out of place in a Disney picture. The premise is unbelievable as well as unnecessary for the flow of the story (which gets more and more inane throughout). All of this leads up to the most desperate, if not clichéd, ""oldest trick in the book"": A fart gag involving anti-ship mines!!!<br/><br/>Midway through, there is a bunch of confusing jibber-jabber that only people who work in dentist's offices will appreciate. This makes for some chuckles.<br/><br/>A major flaw is the inclusion of the bizarre, out-of-place nighttime initiation ceremony for ""Nemo"" in the fish tank. It seems to be another attempt at a more mature level of humor, but there's no suspense at all, and I found myself joining the lot of whispers of ""this is stupid"" when Nemo swims through the ""Ring of Fire"", (which is nothing more than a Fountain of Bubbles). Moreover, if this was the initiation for all of the other tank-mates, how did ""Peach"", the sea star, make it into the club? (I digress). This scene looks like something out of a ""deleted Scenes"" menu on a DVD.<br/><br/>Finally, ""Darla"". Every movie has to have a ""countdown"" to some anticipated confrontation with an adversary. This one is an apparently disturbed 7-year-old who looks all too deliberately twisted and grotesque. Okay, we get it. She might kill Nemo! (You see, because the owner of the fish tank puts a picture of the little girl HOLDING A DEAD FISH in plain, direct view of the tank-mates.)<br/><br/>Despite looking spectacular, this movie does not have the sense of adventure of other Disney/Pixar films. Much of what is supposed to be funny isn't; much of what is supposed to be climactic isn't as well. Some content might be questionable. Still, it's a work of art, into which much effort was put. It's not the greatest film, but there are, after all, other fish in the sea."

","There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks). As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.<br/><br/>Visually, ""Finding Nemo"" is stunning. Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.<br/><br/>In terms of humor, ""Nemo"" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling. It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.<br/><br/>The main plot line--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors. Though nothing may ever quite top ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"" belongs on that ""1-B"" slot right along with ""WALL-E"" and ""Up""."
"Aly200","10","1","2","13 February 2017"," One of Pixar's greatest animated features
","Pixar has been on a consistent roll of success since their first animated feature ""Toy Story"". With their beloved oceanic tale of a clown-fish father looking for his kidnapped son, Pixar struck gold with their audiences all over the globe. <br/><br/>The animation juggernaut is well known for creating relatable characters and the fishy residents of Sydney, Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef are no different. Many parents can relate to the worrisome nature of clown-fish Marlin, a father who has grown far too overprotective of his son (the titular Nemo) after a tragedy takes away his family except for his lone son, and children can relate to Nemo wanting to rebel and care for himself, but is stifled by Marlin's constant hovering, as well as Nemo's fear when he first arrives in the tank at the dentist's office. And then there can those of us who are forgetful can see ourselves in the lovably space-case Dory, but Dory also is loyal, cheerful and kindhearted despite her lapses in memory.<br/><br/>The voice casting in the film is pitch perfect. Forming the film's familial bond are comedic-dramatic actor Albert Brooks as the high-strung Marlin, hilariously overzealous while maintaining a serious tone in appropriate scenes, and young actor Alexander Gould brings a wonderful naivety yet youthful boldness to Nemo, maturing well through the film as he goes from an impulsive child to a smarter and brave kid who will pull his weight. <br/><br/>The film's first set of comedic relief is the hilariously diverse tank gang who reside in an Austrailian dentist's fish tank where Nemo ends up and needs to escape from. With memorable characters like the bubble-obsessed yellow tang Bubbles (voiced by 'NewRadio' alumni Stephen Root), French cleaner shrimp Jacques (voiced with a spot-on faux accent by the late Joe Ranft), the motherly and tank gang watchdog starfish Peach (voice of Allison Janney of 'Juno' and the sitcom 'Mom' fame), kindhearted and prone to random bloating flair-ups blow-fish Bloat (voiced by Brad Garrett), neurotic royal gamma Gurgle (voiced to perfection by Austin Pendleton) and the ditzy but sweet Deb (voived by another 'NewsRadio' alumni Vicki Lewis) who thinks her reflection in the tank's glass is her twin sister. Leading the ragtag group that Nemo finds himself surrounded by is the grizzled and father figure-like butterfly fish Gill (voiced perfectly by Willem Dafoe, whose iconic low vocal tones are utilized to perfection), the tank leader who is more than determined to escape the confines of the office and glass prison. <br/><br/>However the film's scene-stealing, or should it be said movie-stealing, character is the lovably forgetful Dory voiced to comedic brilliance by talk show host and comedienne Ellen DeGeneres. Dory is initially a massive pain in the neck for Marlin as her memory lapses test the clown-fish's patience, but her devoted and helpful nature soon grow on the stingy Marlin. The film's comic relief from the drama of the situation that Marlin finds himself in, Dory is always an optimist who sees the bright side of a problem. Her funniest moment would arguably be Dory's whale-talking after she and Marlin have disembarked the sea turtle driven EAC (East Australian Current). DeGeneres goes hilariously over the top as she makes various oddball sounds that sometimes sound like whale intonations but other times are just random guttural or bizarre shouts that will split sides and force tears of laughter.<br/><br/>Lush animations based on actual sketches of the Great Barrier Reef and its oceanic specimens as well the surrounding Sydney neighborhood are breathtaking and put us right in the environments the characters live in. <br/><br/>A wonderful family film that will make you laugh, cry and hug your relatives even tighter."
"The-Sarkologist","9","1","2","30 January 2017"," There is much, much more to this film than meets the eye.
","Well, after reading a summary of this film that actually makes it sound really messed up, a part of me really wanted to see it. Mind you, I'm not actually surprised that somebody has come up with such a summary for Finding Nemo because it is a Disney production, and Disney is known for turning some rather dubious films, and stories, into movies that are actually quite suitable for kids – take Cinderella for example, or Hercules (he's certainly not one of those people that a respectable woman would bring home to meet her parents). However, unless you actually read this interpretation of the film you probably wouldn't realise how messed up it sounds.<br/><br/>Anyway, Finding Nemo is about how a man's wife and family are murdered by a serial killer, and then whose only son, who happens to be disabled, is kidnapped. So the man, with the help of a friend who happens to suffer from an intellectual disability, must track down the kidnappers and free his son. Oh, I probably should also mention that the last words that were said to him were words of hate due to the man's over protective nature.<br/><br/>Okay, while it might not be obvious at first, as I have mentioned, that explanation of the film does actually make sense, and in a way it is quite good because it doesn't paint the world as being a nice and happy place full of nice and healthy people. In fact, with two of the main characters having serious disabilities, and overcoming those disabilities, does have a lot to teach children. In a way, one shouldn't let their disabilities get them down, but rather see them as a defining characteristic. However, this film also has a message for parents, and that is that sooner or later we are going to have to let our children go.<br/><br/>To a parent (and I don't speak on experience here since I have never had children, nor have I ever been married), losing one's children can be heart wrenching. In fact even losing a single child is heart wrenching, to the point that marriages have been destroyed over the death of a child. In a way a child is our progeny, that which we leave for the world, that which becomes our legacy. As such I can understand why parents would get over protective, but the problem is that when we are over protective of our children, our children don't actually know how to survive in the real world. In a way I am even wondering whether the 'softness' of our society has come about through over protectiveness, where parent-teacher nights go from being a dread for the kid to being dreadful for the teacher. In a way society has moved from a point where a child's failure has not come about due to the child failing to study, but rather through the teacher's failure to give the student good grades.<br/><br/>There were a couple of other things I loved about this film, in particular the seagulls. I have to admit that they really portrayed seagulls very, very well – being incredibly possessive and incredibly single minded. Where as pretty much all of the other animals we encounter come across as intelligent (particularly the sharks who are attempting to become vegetarian) the seagulls can only say one thing 'mine'. In a way they are the most animalistic of the animals, existing only to eat, and fighting amongst themselves for every scrap of food. Living so close to the ocean I have a lot of experience with seagulls, and there is a reason that they are called flying rats – because they are.<br/><br/>While I have to admit that I have grown out of children's movies somewhat, some of them are actually quite fun, and Finding Nemo was definitely one of them. Mind you, I still can't get it out of my mind that I have actually seen this film before, namely because there is so much about it that is familiar."
"mfadayi","10","1","2","8 May 2016"," Finding Nemo
","""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish named Marlin losing his son Nemo. This movie is about friendship and how friends can help you accomplish the hardest things in life. <br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is story written and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2003. Finding Nemo is about a clown fish named Marlin looking for his captured son Nemo. In this journey, Marlin meets a blue tang fish named Dory. Dory is a fish that is suffering from memory loss, but she helps Marlin find Nemo. Both Marlin and Dory face great danger, and hard situations in this journey. Meanwhile, Nemo is trying really hard to find a way to get out of the dentist's fish tank and find his way to the open sea in search of his father. But it's not that easy when you have Darla the fish killer (the little girl with the braces). <br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is a great Animated Movie. The movie uses amazing shades and colors, great sound effects, and amazing camera angles. In the scene where the diver pops up in front of the screen is amazingly realistic, it makes the audience feel like they are the ones in the movie. It also makes the audience feel like they are the clown fish when a huge human face pops up in front of the camera; the audience would feel small and also panic like Nemo. The director of the movie (Andrew Stanton) did an amazingly great job at animating the movie and adding scenes that will make the audience feel what the characters are feeling.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie is there throughout the whole movie, but the audience realizes it near the end of the movie. The theme of the movie is friendship, and Marlin was able to accomplish his goal when Dory helped him through all the danger they faced. Another place friendship was used was when Nemo was captured in the fish tank in the doctor's office, where Nemo's friends saved his life from getting flushed down the toilet.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is one of the BEST animated movies Pixar Animation Studios made. I strongly recommend for everyone to watch this movie. This movie would make you feel like you are in the movie and not watching the movie.<br/><br/>10/10"
"austinyoung-56965","10","1","2","23 April 2016"," Diving into Finding Nemo
","Pixar has done it again! That is a phrase we have become accustomed to hearing these past few years. Pixar Animation Studios has taken the children's movie industry by storm. Andrew Stanton takes us head first into the beautiful, strangely bewildering, world of the big blue ocean with Finding Nemo. We expected children to be captivated by this new installment of children's animation, but parents are also catching the wave as well. This isn't just some fish tale! Okay, well maybe it is. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a paranoid, highly overprotective clown fish. His son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is a young child full of energy, enthusiasm, with a dash a rebellion thrown in there. Nemo was left crippled at birth after an attack that took his mother and all of his siblings. This leaves NEmo with a deep desire to be independent. This is shown while on a school field trip. Nemo, trying to show off to some friends swims out into open waters. A pair of divers come from the darkness and kidnap Nemo. <br/><br/>Marlin, with the help a newly found and hilariously forgetful friend Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) start the adventure to save the only thing that he has left in this world. Little did they know Marlin and Dory will run into all sorts of roadblocks along the way. They encounter sharks that have sworn off eating fish, a horrifying Angler Fish, a bale of sea turtles, and a forest of jellyfish. All of this just to track down his son. That's what I call being a good dad! Finding Nemo is the perfect mixture of a great story, witty comedy, and enticing animation. The bright colors of the underwater world are extravagant. The dialogue keeps viewers entertained and laughing. While the depth of the story of a father losing his son hooks them in for good. This tale is fit for all, young and old. When a child sits down to watch this movie, they can relate to Nemo. A young child looking to do his own thing and go on some adventures. Nemo grows along the course of the film. He goes from being a rebellious little punk, to someone who understands the importance of family and how much his father loves him. As Nemo grows, any child who watches him grows as well. This is one of many reasons why this is a fantastic movie for children. As Pixar will continue to reel in fantastic stories every year, Finding Nemo will go down as one of their greatest hits. Children and parents are flocking to this new spectacle. This thrilling tale will warm the hearts of fathers everywhere who care for their children. Although Marlin could be a little extreme at times, it was very clear that he would do anything for his Son. I believe I echo the words of everyone saying that we want more from Pixar."
"MattBirk","10","1","2","17 March 2016"," One of the Best Animated Movies of All Time
","Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters. <br/><br/>Along the way, we are given the treat of having some amazing comedy bits as characters cultures clash amongst one another. But even as we travel across the ocean and back, the core of the story never leaves us, it's a love story about a father and son and it is an emotional roller-coaster. They brilliantly take the most notorious fish movie, Jaws (which made the ocean seem terrifying), and turns it upside down, making the water now seem like a wonderful land full of amazing creatures. Finding Nemo is the epitome of Pixar's imagination and creative abilities, they have made an eternal classic here.<br/><br/>Let's hope the sequel lives up to the first film!"

It is truly a way to tell all of us there is hope when searching for a loved one. To finding someone in weird and humorous ways is the best way to keep an audience's attention. I loved how it shows me never to give up and it is best to get help when going on a search mission.<br/><br/>The story is well created and it can be emotional when you see someone taken from you. I see this movie from the fish's perspective on how we just take what we want while we break families.<br/><br/>This is truly one of Pixar's very creative plots and very entertaining as the journey is hard but it is worth it when wanting to get back what is yours."
"C22Man","8","1","2","26 January 2016"," Yet another Pixar classic
","Upon its release Finding Nemo solidified Pixar's position as the masters of animation. Just like they did with Toy Story, they'd crafted another fine film that was packed with everything for children and adults alike. On a technical level it is a masterclass, but it also provided a flowing story and a wide variety of characters that it was easy to get invested in. The story concerns overprotective clown fish Marlin whose son Nemo is taken by divers and he then purses them across the ocean. Along the way he meets a fish with short-term memory loss named Dory, sharks who have quit eating fish and a party of sea turtles. The film is effectively Marlin's journey and the colourful characters he meets who help him on his way, whilst Nemo tries to escape from the dentist fish-tank that he's ended up in. The story is straight-forward, but it is packed with so much emotion and excitement that it works to its advantage.<br/><br/>The plot works like a road trip movie, we continually come across some colourful characters and we move on, except that there is a goal to achieve at the end of it all. What really makes the story work is that it addresses the connection between a father and son as well as knowing when it's time to let your son have his own adventures. This helps give the film a strong emotional centre not just for the turmoil that Marlin and Nemo have been put through, but also for Dory who simply wants someone to stand by her. Working with the plot is the animation which is truly superb, some of Pixar's most impressive. The ocean can look both overwhelmingly beautiful and incredibly dangerous, while they really capture the vastness of the deep seas pretty perfectly. The colour scheme is also wonderful, everything from the bright character designs to the coral reef simply leaps off the screen in a wash of beauty. <br/><br/>With that said, it's the characters that truly make the film shine. Marlin is a typically anxious and neurotic father, but he's never a stick in the mud. He always appears to be very genuine and the journey he's willing to undertake for his son makes him so likable. Dory (a brilliant Ellen DeGeneres) makes a fantastic companion. You'd think her memory loss would get annoying but it's kept fresh thanks to her bright sense of humour and her almost childlike wonder at the world which is surprisingly endearing. Nemo is a pleasant innocent and his enthusiasm is charming, whilst the tank gang are all very enjoyable especially the mysterious Gill. I also enjoyed the tanks pelican friend Nigel and the three sharks that come together like an AA meeting to discuss giving up fish. Virtually all of these characters are different and memorable, having interesting designs and distinctive personalities.<br/><br/>Another big positive is the score by Thomas Newman. It is simply lovely. It manages to convey the wide-eyed wonder of the underwater world beautifully thanks to the gorgeous melodies and soothing compositions. There's a real sense of adventure to it that brings you into the ocean world even more and it manages to heighten the excitement at times perfectly. The film also has many memorable lines and inspired comedic pieces. Many of these were so successful that they are now widely known in pop culture, whether it the seagulls constantly repeating ''Mine!'' or the tanks outrageous escape plan. To be fair to it, the film has very few weaknesses. The lack of an over-arching villain isn't an issue because of the type of film it is and both stories are given the perfect amount of screen time.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Finding Nemo is up there with Pixar's best films. It excels in pretty much every area that matters because it does what Pixar does best, which is craft a gripping adventure that is packed with plenty of comedy and emotion. This is a story that is very easy to be engaged in and the massive amount of characters all manage to get enough development. So when the two key areas are as strong as they are here then the film is already on the right road. Adding to that, the animation is some of Pixar's most expressive, the score is wonderful and the film is simply very memorable. There is just something so gripping and rather timeless about the films approach that makes it such a success."

","Finding Nemo is a fantastic movie about a little fish named Nemo. Nemo was trying to rebel against his dad when he got taken from his father!

Along the way Marlin picks up a newfound friend named Dory, and she follows Marlin on his misadventures to try and find Nemo. <br/><br/>Overall, Finding Nemo was a fantastic movie, with a detailed plot. It teaches kids about companionship and teamwork, shown by Marlin and Dory restlessly trying to get Nemo back from the people that took him. The way the story unfolded would keep anyone enthralled in the story of Nemo and how Marlin tried to find him. Finding Nemo will become a classic for all kids around the world and hopefully will become a favorite everywhere. In the movie, the voice acting is one of the best from Disney to date.

"sean-travers","8","1","2","4 October 2015"," Visually stunning with an emotionally resonant story
","Twelve years after its release, Finding Nemo still holds up beautifully in terms of animation. The water effects and the way its variety of colourful marine creatures navigate its bright blue depths is beautiful to behold. Finding Nemo isn't just about style though. As expected with a Pixar entry, there's depth here too (and not just in terms of the ocean). Nemo teaches children about being resourceful and the strength of parental love; while surely holding resonance for parents or anyone in a close mentor role to someone young.<br/><br/>The voice cast is fantastic. Brooks and Gould give powerful, emotional performances while DeGeneres became a fan favourite with her humorous performance as forgetful blue tang Dory (expect a sequel focusing on Dory in 2016). As expected, there's some good jokes and fun performances in Nemo although it's not quite as sophisticated as other Pixar offerings like the Toy Story trilogy (1995, 1999, 2010), Monster's Inc. (2002) or The Incredibles (2004). Respectively, the story is fairly formulaic and the humour gears more towards a younger crowd. Nevertheless, Nemo makes up for its shortcomings with its emotionally resonant storytelling, stunning visuals and dedicated vocal performances."
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","1","2","23 August 2015"," Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple.
","When I grew up, I always thought the concept of Pixar movies was ""what would life be like as a ____"" Toys were fun, Monsters in the cupboard were fun, bugs were fun, and now we landed on fish. And I loved it because it was colourful and funny and touching.<br/><br/>Now, watching Finding Nemo with all I know about film, I am able to understand how brilliant early Pixar was. Every one of these early films has two ""whats life like as"" - one for kids (toys, bugs, monsters) and one for adults. In Finding Nemo, its ""what life is like as an overprotective parent."" Finding Nemo is one of the most beautiful stories that can appeal to families that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The film opens with one of the most downright upsetting moments I ever watched as a child. Albert Brooks' perfect voice casting really captures the grief and desperation that Marlin feels, and it so perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the film. Every one of Marlin's overprotective scenes is not completely justified, but so believable to come from him. We also enjoy Ellen DeGeneres' delightful sidekick Dory, who is absolutely hilarious and charming and I could not love her presence more. As Marlin and Dory set out on the titular quest, Pixar does what Pixar does best - gives us a funny and wondrous understanding of their universe. A gang of sharks are recovering addicts from fish flesh. Seagulls are sadistic and brainless. A group of sea turtles are perpetually high. Throughout each of the encounters, not only does Marlin learn more about the ocean he has been afraid of for so long, but he learns about how his overprotective parenting isn't going to help Nemo forever, and he's better off learning to take care of himself wherever he can.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nemo is confined in a dentist's tank with a gaggle of kooky fish characters, each of whom has their own little ticks because of their confinement (a beautiful little addition to the story). Emmy king and queen Brad Garrett and Allison Janney are hilarious and even funnier is the addition of Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush, who pops in as a Pelican taking an interest in dental hygiene. <br/><br/>The film's story is so perfectly constructed that I can't fault it. The catalyst moments are spread out by moments of character development and sprinkled with perfect doses of humour. Even the final challenge doesn't come across as ""just one more obstacle"" but provides closure on Marlin's overparenting and provides his first real test. Thomas Newman's serene score keeps things moving along at a beautiful pace, and the animation is as superb as anything we've come to expect from Pixar.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple. Its a lesson to kids and parents alike, but its also so colourful and funny that its a fun watch just when you're feeling flat. Perfect for all occasions."

","This move is very good! It is definitely a great film for the family to watch together before the kids go to bed! You will all get a good laugh out of this film! And if you guys are worried it is absolutely 100% child approved! I also like this film a lot because the personalities of the characters in this film are a lot like the personalities that people we know have! It is a pretty good movie just to sit back laugh, and enjoy what's happening on the screen without having to stay on high-alert for something scary that the children won't like! Again I completely recommend this film for something that a family could watch together!"

","When I saw this film for the first time I was a little boy exploring Disney and Pixar films. I loved ""Finding Nemo"" because there are no angry, jealous, greedy, or murderous villains as in most traditional Disney animated films. It was just an animation film that used to make me feel a little bit excited. The story is useful for children who thinks that they can do whatever they want without taking consequences. I think we should compare this kind of children with Nemo. And the parents of these children should be compared with Nemo's father because of all the protection that normal families have with their kids. ""Finding Nemo"" can be a motivation film too. Nemo has a physical disability and he tries to prove that it is not a problem for himself. I think ""Finding Nemo"" could be a motivation for children who has physical disabilities too."

"sandnair87","10","1","2","31 March 2015"," An Underwater Treasure!
","Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>Andrew Stanton plays the viewer like a fiddle, and it's a privilege to be played. Its animation is truly stunning, awash (pun intended) in a dazzling array of colors and creating the impression of a living, breathing sea. Every moment is magnificently orchestrated to tease a response from us - anything from awe to aw-shucks. Yes, it's a visual feast, but more importantly it's an epic journey filled with adventure and discovery that encompasses the grandest sweep of the ocean's vastness and the tiniest longing of the heart. While preserving the characters' intrinsic ""fishy-ness"", the silver- tongued voice cast offers great supplementary texture to a marvelous sensory experience. While Brooks is amusing as the ever fretful Marlin, it is DeGeneres who gives a bravura comic performance as the guileless but whacked-out Dory. Ceaselessly forgetful, her endearing Dory makes a difficult traveling companion but a scintillating friend – Dory is a complete hoot.<br/><br/>Instead of rising to a challenge, Finding Nemo plunges into it and comes up a winner. All in all, a buoyant adventure that manages to evoke the quicksilver trait of the ocean without necessarily feeling 'wet'!"

"OllieSuave-007","9","1","2","12 February 2015"," Fabulous Fish Tale!
","This is a fun-filled Disney/Pixar movie that is pretty much on par with the Toy Story trilogy. It's a story about a clown fish named Marlin, who swims through the vast ocean in search of his son, Nemo, who was taken by a diver for a pet. Along the way, he meets a blue tang fish with short term memory loss named Dory, who joins him in the search. What follows is an incredible adventure full of dodging sharks, riding with turtles, swimming past jellyfish and trying to go through other obstacles to search for Nemo, while he himself tries to deal with life being somebody's pet.<br/><br/>Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich did a great job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a dramatic intro, followed by one adventurous scene after the other, making the plot very fast-paced and exciting. The story quickly identifies the issue of Nemo being pretty rebellious and the issue of worrying about his father's fear of the vast open sea. The tide turns within the story as Nemo is fished out of water and Marlin ends up taking the sea on to find him. All these plot elements and unpredictable moments make this an edge-of-the-ride film from start to finish.<br/><br/>The entire voice cast did a great job in their respective roles, making the characters very lovable. Ellen DeGeneres did a hilarious and upbeat job in voicing Dory (you could see Ellen's humorous personality in the fish) and Willem Dafoe did a mysterious yet caring portrayal in voicing Gill, who tries to keep a lookout for Nemo. I especially enjoyed seeing the every day human traits and dialog being acted out in these sea creatures, making the movie that much funnier. In addition, the music score from Thomas Newman is quite spirited and the animation team did a spectacular job in capturing the splendor of the sea.<br/><br/>I thought, though, the story goes too fast at times, leaving little room for the audience to generate sympathy during the more tense and solemn moments, and I thought some of the characters acted a little too excited. But overall, it's a very fun and heartwarming Disney tale that is great for the entire family! <br/><br/>Grade A-"
"evandewangga97","9","1","2","6 February 2015"," The Pixar Quality
","Animation, maybe one of the hardest movie to be made. It's filled with the digital image, that isn't easy to be changed. Once the scene is done, the editors sometimes don't want to remade or retake it. The ""cooking"" phase is in the writing section, must be ripe enough to be served by the editorial-department. Especially, when it comes to the blockbuster of cinema, just like ""Finding Nemo"". It's not worth when the screenplay is not as good as the editing, the emptiness of amazing animated feature. But, Pixar never miss the point of great movies,e from the technology in film editing, until the deep message for the young generation. For ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar gave so much visual pleasure with the classic problem of human life. And, still holds the reality of the fish in front of human. Yes, I mean it's from the fish perspective, and it's maybe happened in animal's life, but human haven't notice it yet, even fish is not as smart as in this movie. The colorful settings bring joy to every child who watch this. Moreover, the funny scenario, just added other delicious seasoning in this Pixar first mass blockbuster.<br/><br/>Next, to the core of the story. It's simply entertaining and cinematic. I mean this story can be told only by movie, not story or music, etc. Two points of view, with exact transition. The beginning, is honestly like a template-idea. But, just the intro, not the entire. The classic problem of family is given with humble way of cinema. A dad-son relationship, which every child probably feel it, so does the father. More than that, Pixar still gives the smart and funny comedy. Children is pleasant with the animation, story, and the comedy. What's more for them to enjoy. The film actually doesn't only takes one or two settings. It is an adventure, and has many powerful scene. Every scene with new supernumerary, but with educating characterization. Yes, why not added some sciences for children. Catchy fish in every scene, and though-provoking plot. They can't leave the cinema before the end of the movie.<br/><br/>And, I may add some critics on this new-standard of animation. Again, maybe some blockbuster not as good as the non-visual-effects- movie. I mean it is good, not excellent. For the warm-up of studio, it is great, but let's not talk about the dimension of time. I really know the perfection of animation, but why not add some more twisting and deep plot. You know ""Toy Story"", is just what Pixar done in genius way. Focus on some deeper characterization of that extra-character and it could be really delightful. My opinion is just for another Pixar's movie. It has already got the mass-editing- experience. And it's ready to launch another classic to the upcoming generation. With that superb quality, and the developing technology, I think Pixar will be made some other ""Finding Nemo""s. And I expect with the mass-effects and wonderfully-written story.<br/><br/>A must watch of every 2000's generation, a beginning of new era of American animation."

","Finding Nemo is about a fish named Nemo who gets separated from his dad Marlin. Nemo has one small fin, and it's hard for him to swim as fast as the other fish so his dad is overprotective of him in the ocean. Dying to fit in, Nemo disobeys his father and swims far out, and gets abducted by humans. Marlin gets help along the way from a fish named Dory who is dead set on finding Nemo.<br/><br/>The film focuses on plot, action and adventure. Marlin played by Albert Brooks; attempts to relocate his son Nemo Alexander Gould; in a huge ocean surrounded by trouble. Along the way he encounters jelly fish, getting lost, his sidekick Dory, voice by Ellen DeGeneres getting captured by fisherman, and almost getting eaten by pelicans to name a few. One of the techniques in the film is motif. The motif would be the idea to never give up that is repeated throughout the movie. Some examples of this are when Nemo tries to swim out with the rest of his class and it's harder for him, when Nemo tries to put the pebble in the fish tank filter, when Dory tries her hardest to remember the address on the goggles, and when Marlin tells all the fish caught in the fishermen's net to swim down. The idea was to keep trying until you succeed. The biggest and most evident example is Marlin going to find his son (the entire plot of the movie), regardless of what he encountered he didn't give up. Being that this film is animated the ""lighting"" and angles used aren't those from an actual cinematographer. The movie still used angles in animation to draw the audience's attention to scenes to make a point. As in most movies, sound in this film played a huge role. In one of the scenes where a nice pelican tries to save Marlin and Dory from hungry pelicans; all three characters end up getting chased and the music for that scene was fitting. It was a fast paced beat; even if you closed your eyes you knew what type of scene was taking place just by the music. In the beginning of the movie, when Nemo was going off to school, the music is very upbeat which signified happiness. This movie in relation to others such as Toy Story represents the same motif, bonding, relationships, and determination. Both films grab the viewers' attention by using bright colors, and sound as texture to bring the film to life."
"CMTiago","10","1","2","4 October 2014"," A cherished childhood favorite
","Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.<br/><br/>The plot follows a clown fish named Marlin, that after his son is taken by a human, sets out on a dangerous and treacherous journey to get him back. Along the way he will meet Dory, a blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Together they will stop at nothing to get to Nemo, Marlin's son, who along with a group of ragtag aquarium fish will also plan to escape to the ocean in order to avoid a bratty, but, deadly child and get back to his dad.<br/><br/>So like I said, there 3 reasons why I love this movie. The first one is the comedy, provided mostly by the goofy sidekick Dory, as well as other characters. The combination of the smart script, plus the voice talent involved makes for the great comedic side of Finding Nemo. The other great quality of the script, is the emotional turmoil that ensues in the movie, and personally I believe that some parents might resonate with it most, even though I myself do not know this reality. Finally Pixar proves why they are the top of the animation game, by assembling the proper research and creating a great oceanic world, as well as the Sydney landscape.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo will forever be a cinematic mark in my cinematic history. It is a funny, energetic and entertaining picture, and that is all I can ask from a movie like this. Rating: 10/10"

Very well written Superbly acted. I have seen this several times and notice new stuff every time. Ellen DeGeneres is fabulous. Far superior to the likes of Shark Tale. Ten lines is a lot to expect in a review about a film, you don't think that ten lines is an awful lot until you start to write a review for a film and then you actually realise that ten lines is actually a lot of lines to write and repeat yourself. I have tried not to repeat myself but not really very hard. Perhaps if I was to try harder not to repeat myself then the task of not repeating would be easier but as the situation stands at the moment, I fear that I might be repeating myself, perhaps I could go swimming in the sea or in a swimming pool or a lake or loch or a big puddle."

","Marine life in cinema is very hard to capture in order to make a beautiful film with gorgeous beauty. Animation is the perfect way to show a delightful story and capture the beauty of the Pacific Ocean and the great barrier reef. ""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful story about a clown fish named Nemo who on his first day of school disobeys his father Marlin and is captured by scuba divers to be put in a fish tank. Marlin now goes on a morally obligated quest to find his son with the help of an odd Blue Tang named Dori. The two go through some difficult adventures including escaping from huge sharks, poisonous jellyfish, a whale, sea gulls, rude fish and an angler fish. The two also enjoy themselves between their near death experiences by hanging with some chill sea turtles. As Nemo is separated from his father, he realizes how much he is saddened by being separated by his dad physically and emotionally. Marlin and Dori also use teamwork in many situations which can be used as a teaching skill to children. Teamwork is shown by the fish Nemo encounters when he is placed in a fish tank in a dental office in Australia and how they all work together to escape. Marlin and Dori of course work together to survive the dangers of the ocean and finding Nemo. Children should also pay attention to what disobeying your parents can result in. You should also respect your parents is what Pixar is trying to teach kids and by using a terrifying capture sequence by a menacing diver, kids will definitely get it. Adults can relate to how much our kids mean to us and the measurements and lengths we go at to protect our kids. ""Finding Nemo"" is an inspiring animation film, but it is still extremely fun. Mild rude humor by all the creative sea creatures we see hear played by voices of actors such as Albert Brooks (Marlin) and Ellen DeGeneres (Dori) allow laughter to be present as well as some edge of your seat type scenes when danger strikes. The visual beauty of this masterful animation is glorious. The opening shot of Nemo of the vast open water is what made me love film for the first time as a child and will inspire other kids as well. The animation allows you to be put in the position of the natural world in Australia and should provide a perfect appeal of a wonderful film."

","There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.<br/><br/>The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.<br/><br/>Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations."

","Marking the biggest leap for Pixar Animation Studios since their groundbreaking debut with Toy Story in 1995, Finding Nemo brings a whole new level of maturity in Pixar's method of storytelling, a new surge in its humour, creativity & imagination, and another elevation in its already unparalleled animation to succeed not only as one of the best films of its genre but is also exceptional enough to be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo tells the story of Marlin; a clownfish residing in the Great Barrier Reef who's very overprotective of his son, Nemo. When Nemo is captured by scuba divers & taken to Sydney, Marlin sets out on a journey throughout the ocean to find his son, is joined by Dory; an optimistic blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss, encounters many more dangers & adventures and in the process, learns to appreciate life a lot more than ever before.<br/><br/>Directed by Andrew Stanton, Finding Nemo is drop-dead gorgeous from the first frame to the last, is crafted with immense care, passion & love, has a surprising level of depth in its story, is filled with characters that are rich, charismatic & colourful, captures ocean life unlike ever before in cinema history, brims with clever use of humour, expertly balances its storytelling aspects with jaw-dropping animation and has something in store for viewers of all ages.<br/><br/>It's pretty evident from its presentation that Pixar's production design team did a massive amount of research before animating it on the film canvas, the camera-work is jubilantly carried out & fills the screen with vivid colours. Editing makes sure every single scene plays a relevant role in pushing its story forward & steadily paces its 100 minutes of runtime while Thomas Newman's score makes the whole experience all the more touching, mesmerising & emotionally resonant.<br/><br/>The level of precision, sharpness & detailing in its animation is no short of an achievement, every single character is skilfully drawn & rendered whether it's the shark, whale, turtles or jellyfish, and is perfectly voiced by its terrific voice cast. And while everyone shines in their given roles, it's Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who turns out to be the show-stealer for she is without a doubt one of the most optimistic characters to surface on the silver screen.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Finding Nemo is love at first sight. It's a stunning, bewitching, magical, emotionally rich & truly unforgettable cinema that has a lot to say about parenting, friendship, trust & determination and sets a higher benchmark for its genre. One of Pixar's biggest home-runs on critical, commercial & emotional scale, Finding Nemo is a spellbinding underwater adventure that you'll want to experience again n again. 'Sea' it to believe it."

","When his only child Nemo (Alexander Gould) is captured by divers in the Great Barrier Reef, his extremely shy and anxiety-ridden father (Marlin) sets out on a journey to rescue him. Along the way, he meets many friends and foes, including Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with a short-term memory.<br/><br/>After 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' is probably the Pixar movie everyone likes to talk about. It took me ten years to watch it, but it was well worth the wait. 'Finding Nemo' is a very good film. What makes the movie so good is what has made so many other Pixar movies so good – the emotion. Yes, visually, it's brilliant (and we'll get on to that), but that Pixar crowd has this amazing ability to tell great stories.<br/><br/>In what has become a staple of the company, this film centres on the bond between two characters – in this case, father and son. The opening sequence is heartbreaking, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The strength of that first scene is such that we invest in the relationship Marlin and Nemo have. We believe in Marlin's fear and Nemo's rebellion. I'd argue that Pixar were able to capture that emotion with much more depth in 'Up', but this was perfectly fine for a first attempt.<br/><br/>More than the two leads, the show is stolen by the character of Dory. I've never seen Ellen DeGeneres act but she's extremely good with the voice. The role was supposedly written for her, and she makes the most of that opportunity. Laugh-out-loud funny at times, Dory is a delight to watch, and it's no surprise that she's the focal point of the upcoming sequel.<br/><br/>As with all Disney/Pixar animations, there has to be humour, and there is a lot of humour. My only problem was that, for the sake of humour, the story does get sidetracked somewhat. Marlin's desperate search for Nemo gets put on the backburner as he's shooting the breeze with turtles, or taking part in vegetarian shark meetings. Okay, so it's for kids, so maybe I shouldn't look too deeply into it, but it did irk me.<br/><br/>Of the Pixar movies I've seen, this isn't at the top. All three 'Toy Story' films probably trump it, and 'Up' is possibly just that bit more funnier; but, with such a strong filmography, 'Finding Nemo' coming up fifth (maybe sixth behind 'Wall-E') is not a disservice at all. Great for kids and adults, it's highly recommended."

","Finding Nemo is not only a great animation, but also a great lesson for parents. With a humorous cast including Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, Albert Brooks as Marlin, Alexander Gould as Nemo, and Willem Dafoe as Gill; Finding Nemo sends viewers on a heart wrenching, suspenseful, humorous journey for a fishes only son. This movie had me in tears within the first five minutes of the movie, when a drastic loss happens. The journey shows the battles and heartache that parents face when losing a young one. Marlin, the single parent, has a hard time ""letting go"" to his only son Nemo for his first day of school. When he finally does, Nemo gets lost. The movie explores the ocean while Marlin searches for his son. Marlin faces many of his fears in search of his son. As the movie takes you on this journey, a journey similar to Toy Story, where a lost toy brings unity among all toys; Nemo, as the lost fish, brings unity to fish and birds in search of him. The similarities in plot and underlying story messages are similar however Lee Unkrich, Andrew Stanton, the directors of Finding Nemo, do a great deal to engage the viewers right away. Throughout the movie the open sea and other ocean creatures fill the audience with great invisible sound. The movie gives viewers the ocean like feel with the invisible sound of the ocean animals and ocean water, and also the lighting in the scenes gives the realistic ocean depth. Both of these techniques are used greatly throughout the film while Marlin and Dory face adventures in the open sea. While Marlin and Dory lead viewers through the ocean they face many obstacles. The overall story of the film would be to have trust in one another. A good quote from the film, which is reiterated at the end of the film, ""You think you can do these things, Nemo, but you just can't!"" This quote ties the over-all theme together. Marlin had very little trust in his son's abilities, yet had he given him the benefit of the doubt at the beginning of the movie, it may have prevented Nemo from getting lost in the first place. This movie uses very good techniques that allow the viewer to sink into the ocean, and help Marlin to find his son. Dory plays the humorous girly-fish who adds humor to the bad situation, and who also helps Marlin to lighten up. I think all parents can learn a thing or two from this movie, and could use the humorous outlook on life, like Dory's!"

","Pixar's Finding Nemo is an animation film. It is set mostly in the ocean at Australia's Great Barrier Reef and in Sidney Australia. The main characters are Marlin (voice by Albert Brooks), Nemo (voice by Alexander Gould) and Dory (voice by Ellen DeGenneres). The story is of a father and son and the love they have for each other. In this story father and son are clown fish that live at the Reef. The father is overprotective and son is ready to take on the world even though one of his fins is small. In the film Nemo and his father get separated. The journey begins by Marlin to find his son. Along the journey Marlin faces many obstacles. Marlin also meets news friends that help along the way. This film compares with Toy Story when it comes to friends that are willing to help. One friend that makes the journey with Marlin is Dory a pretty blue fish that has short term memory loss. Sometimes along the journey Marlin is not the most cooperative. He comes to realize you cannot be protected from everything. The background music makes the mood for the coming event. At one point in the ocean Marlin and Dory come upon a shark named Bruce. Bruce takes them through a mine field. The music played is eerie. It keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Moving among the mines is delicate so as not to set any of them off. The music sets the suspense for the scene. Another scene that using music effectively is after Nemo is added to the fish tank there is a ceremony done by the fish that already reside in the tank. The ceremony starts the music and chanting gradually escalates louder and louder building suspense for Nemo to be an accepted member. The editing in the film has kept the pace of the film moving. The action continues from one obstacle to another for Marlin, Dory and Nemo. There are some conflict scenes and the editing starts the conflict cuts away and re-enters after the conflict with any violence being left out. In the beginning of the movie there is an attack by a barracuda. Marlin tries to protect his family. The barracuda swats him away with his tail. The next scene is Marlin waking up and realizing what has happened. This gives all of the details for the viewer to create what happened in their own minds. At the same time there are no graphic parts for children to endure. I enjoyed the film. The action continues to the end. The overall quality of the film is well done. The color of the many fish in the ocean and the reef itself are worth seeing this film. If you have children Finding Nemo is a must see. As adults the film is still entertaining and worth the time to view. This film can teach a valuable lesson of trust between parents and children."

The variety of ocean life that they use is great for young children because it teaches them what animals live in the ocean. It's one of those movies that's perfect for family movie night or just simply at a sleepover. When I was in high school, my government teacher gave us a movie day and this was the movie of choice.

","This is possibly the best animated movie I have ever seen and enjoyed. Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect family movie that everyone will love watching. While it is entertaining to both adults and children, parents can appreciate that the animated film is teaching their kids important life lessons. <br/><br/>Clown fish, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is an overprotective father who has lost in one and only son Nemo (Alexander Gould), in the vast ocean. Throughout his journey to find his son, Marlin meets various ocean species that help him along his quest to find Nemo before it's too late. Though the story-line is simple, the characters Marlin encounters on his journey such as the unforgettable Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), teach not only Marlin to loosen up a bit but children and adults watching the movie many beneficial life lessons. <br/><br/>I have to say that Pixar has defeated DreamWorks for this time period of animated films; the purpose and realist of ""Finding Nemo"" characters outdoes the ""Shrek"" and ""Shark Tale"" characters by far. The marine environment depicted in ""Finding Nemo"" is remarkably lifelike as well as the actions of the oceanic creatures featured; the accurateness of the species allows children to learn about them as well as entertained by their human behaviors. The richness of colors throughout the movie makes you feel as if you are actually in the ocean with the characters and lets those watching know what marine life actually looks like. <br/><br/>Finding Nemo has a perfect combination of humor and life lessons for all ages to understand. Other animated kid movies include humor that only kids would enjoy or don't understand at all however, Finding Nemo contains a balance that both parents and kids would approve of. Many of the witty jokes made in the movie are funny for kids and parents due to the human behaviors the character portray such as the sharks ""fish are friends not food"" group, similar to a human's alcoholic group. The actors do a marvelous job in representing each characters part and bring something special to their voice. Dory, a Blue Tang fish played by Ellen DeGeneres plays an important part in the movie by assisting Marlin find Nemo, but the Dory's character would not be the same without the always optimistic voice of Ellen. Within ""Finding Nemo,"" there is a character that everyone, adults included can relate to. Whether that be a pestering parental such as Marlin or a quirky character such as Dory, the whole family can always adore watching this movie. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys being entertained by a kids movie every once in a while. It definitely is captivating in all aspects and makes you realize that the smallest things in life are amusing. Whether you are five or ninety five, you will be extremely pleased with the quality and entertainment of this incredible movie!"

","Finding Nemo, the 2003 film that captured hearts and won the Best Animated Feature Oscar in 2004, has gotten a studio makeover and has been filling movie theaters in its 3-D version. This is a perfect film for you to share with your youngest grandchildren although you should be aware that there are some frightening scenes that 2 and 3-year-olds may find disconcerting. Here is what our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics had to share about the film: ""I thought the 3-D was cool,"" says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Anthony Aranda, age 10, who goes on to say there wasn't enough of it: "" but they needed to add more 3-D parts to the movie."" Fellow youth film critic Cheyenne Nguyen, age 8, was captivated by the cinematography and visual effects, sharing, ""The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures."" Morgan Bertsch, age 7, thought that the 3-D makes all the characters really come to life. ""It was amazing. It made you feel like you were really in the ocean. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming."" The father's long journey from the safety of his coral reef home through the vastness of the ocean to where Nemo had been taken in Australia is fraught with danger and even earns him fame among the other creatures of the sea. He gains a sidekick early on his quest whose short-term memory loss balances the mood with heavy doses of humor. Finding Nemo 3D Reviewed by Cheyenne Nguyen and Morgan Bertsch See their full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=XRhQ87qMeh0 Watching Finding Nemo 3D by Disney-Pixar is like you are snorkeling and looking through your goggles and enjoying the colorful fish and sea life. This story is about Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), an overprotective father of Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a clown fish with a defective fin. It all starts with Coral and Marlin, Nemo's mom and dad looking at all 400 eggs and trying to determine names for each of the eggs. Suddenly, a barracuda comes to the coral and knocks Marlin unconscious. When Marlin wakes up, the reef is empty; with no fish around, the only egg left under the coral is Nemo. Marlin becomes a very protective dad and will not let Nemo out of his sight. However, Nemo is the opposite of his dad. He always wants to swim into the unknown. On the first day of school, Nemo wanders off outside the reef and is captured by a dentist. This starts Marlin's journey to find his son. He swims as fast as he can and asks for help finding Nemo. The only fish that stops to help Marlin is Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory has a big heart and always positive. The only problem is she has short- term memory loss. The story line is the father and son love, unpredictable and very funny. There are so many punch lines in this movie that will keep you laughing throughout the movie. The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures. I can see the layers of rainbow coral reef, several rows of teeth in the mouth of Bruce the shark, the pelican's beak, and jellyfish seem so soft and real. The best 3-D part is with the whale and the krill swimming toward the audience. I love how production and design make Dory velvety, Marlin and Nemo soft and gummy. The rest of the fish are metallic, typical scaly fish. This makes Dory, Marlin and Nemo more lovable. The sound effects of water sloshing and crashing are very realistic. The only part I did not like is what happens to Nemo's mom. Will Disney come back with Nemo reunited with his mom? The lessons in this movie are Marlin deals with his fear and swims all the way to Australia to find his son, Nemo, and he learns to have faith. My favorite character is Dory with her big heart and Crush the laid-back father turtle and his children. The message of this movie is listens to your parents — they only try to protect you and give you good advice. Parents are alive longer so they know a lot more than their children. I rank this movie five out of five stars. I give this film an age range of 3 and up."

It also teaches us never to back down or give up. Once again what surprises us is the very reason this movie received the Best Academy Award (Animation) in 2003 - here daddy the hero, daddy knows best, daddy is sure nothing is impossible for his son Nemo. For Nemo, he cannot see any fish stronger than his daddy.<br/><br/>There are enough elements in the movie for people watching it for the first time and also for those who are watching it after almost 9 years.

","I'm a fairly big animation fan, so it's a bit surprising that I never caught up with this when it played theatrically; I'm also a big fan of Albert Brooks, who does the lead voice for Marlin, and that's probably why I did get around to this now.<br/><br/>First off, the animation is just gorgeous. I think this might be the best-looking Pixar film I'd seen before ""Wall-E"" -- something about the process just seems to work so well on an underwater adventure, and I liked the cartoonish, lumpy look to the humans as well. Everything is colorful and flowing and moving and exciting to look at -- the filmmakers undoubtedly spent significant time around coral reefs or watching films of them, because the film really does convey the sense of constant motion and teeming life very well, and the animation process was up to it.<br/><br/>The storyline, however, just didn't cut it for me. Marlin's a single (clownfish) parent who early on loses his only surviving son, Nemo (Alexander Gould) and goes on a harrowing quest through hundreds of miles of treacherous open seas to find him and eventually rescue him from the dentist's office aquarium he's ended up in, along the way meeting up with ditzy, forgetful helper Dory (Ellen Degeneres). Like nearly every Disney or big-budget animated film these days, the film is filled with cameos from big stars, which doesn't really do anything for me beyond the ""oh cool that's Dafoe"" factor; it increases the budget I'm sure, but does it really help tell the story any better, and does it guarantee more box office? It's often a distraction; here it neither helped nor hindered my enjoyment, which was overall medium -- I just couldn't get involved in the story or the characters. Brooks was a big part of the problem, or his characterization; I hesitate to blame him, he was cast as essentially the straight man for much of the film, and his brand of humor is anything but juvenile and thus just doesn't jibe with a kid's film. DeGeneres fare better and was the most interesting actor/character, but on the whole this was for me a fairly charmless, too-long roller coaster towards the inevitable happy ending. I suppose I'm sounding the grouch, but I have liked all of the other Pixar films I've seen; this one just didn't hit a chord for me. Still worth seeing for the phenomenal look, so I'm calling it ""ehhh""; rented on DVD."

Monsters, Inc. also was a much better project...imaginative and great little subtle humor jabs...Monsters, Inc. in fact might be Pixar's best yet...the ticklish fun of Monsters, Inc. is enhanced by wonderful performances by the voice actors.

Looking back, I find some strong and weak points in Nemo, but I'll start with the dominant good points.<br/><br/>1)Humor. This is undoubtedly the funniest movie Disney has created ( with the exception of maybe Toy Story). Dory's character is ingenious and draws viewers in with her innocent humor, never coming off as cheesy,awkward or inappropriate. Even characters who are not meant to provide comic relief have their own uproarious moments.<br/><br/>2) Animation. While I'm slightly bitter over Disney's switch to computer animation, this movie defied my mind. The under sea landscaping was gorgeous. The characters had beautifully done figures that still retained a cartoony quality.<br/><br/>3)Characters. All characters have nice forms, and are relevant to the plot.

"GSmith9072","6","1","2","20 June 2007"," Everyone Loves Nemo!
","Being a film that titillated female viewers, children, and even some men alike, ""Finding Nemo""'s awe-inspiring animation and wonderful voice work may have caste the illusion that this well-made little film is something of a masterpiece. In reality, Nemo floats well, but there's not much beneath the surface, making it an enjoyable but over-hyped cgi flick.<br/><br/>The film borrows heavily the pacing formula of the brilliant ""Toy Story"", and that's not really a bad thing. What gives the film it's mass appeal is undoubtedly, aside from the stunning graphics, the characters. Although I couldn't really connect with them, I can see why so many enjoy watching them. Dorry is the conventional half-wit (Sid from Ice Age, Donkey from Shrek) who for no real reason other then for conventional cinematic interest, finds herself accompanying Marlin on his journey to locate his missing son out of the vast ocean. Just a small twist, she has short term memory loss. I comment frequently on the use of the suspension of disbelief. I don't usually have a problem with it, depending on the context and how often it's used. Here, the unreality of the film leaps out at me with it's teeth barred. Not everyone who boats lives by the shore, and even though Marlin was lucky enough to have his son's captor live so close to the ocean, just how was he planning on getting up there without the help of a winged sympathetic fish-a-vore? Still, the film has enough whimsy for that not to get too problematic, but it allows the writer a lot of area in creating the story, and I wasn't as impressed with the results as others, aside from the films sporadic strong points.<br/><br/>Dorry is bubbly and fun for many to watch. Just like with the tepid ""Ice Age"", it takes more then a character who's easy on the eyes and ears to become a character worthy of layering. She doesn't really improve or change much over the course of the film, she just occasionally in a very Disney-like fashion unintentionally helps Marlin escape some near fatal situations. Marlin has the task of forming a friendship with her, because she can grow a tad bit annoying. There's Nemo, who's blow up at his father seems rather unwarranted. I'd assume Nemo knows his siblings were killed by the hundreds, and I'd think he'd at least sympathize with his father for being so overprotective. He can still get upset, but to use the word ""hate""? And of course there's the tank gang, another hoot to watch (each having a cartoon personality), and the serious Gil.<br/><br/>Back to the story, it's basically our heroes almost getting eaten, and nemo's attempts at an orthodontist's office to escape his aquatic prison. Some of the sequences succeed better the others. The film also revels in not demeaning animals who happen to be carnivorous, another plus. The film also quite well provides more then shallow entertainment for everyone, and I mean everyone. As long as you're not to young to watch a movie, ""Finding Nemo"" is accessible. That's the film's strongest quality, but aside from that, it really isn't anything much more. Some of the emotion seems trite and ill-proportioned, moving back and forth from believable to not so much. Being a kid's flick, it certainly is better then many other films out there. It just doesn't tackle that much in order to be considered over so many other films, which is usually the case. The story is very linear and it doesn't amaze that well outside of itself. The animation not only delivers, it delivers a natural biome that in itself is one of the most amazing places on earth. The animation on the fish is glorious, capturing the realistic way in which real fish move and partnering it with comedic human movement. The animated reef with it's human makeover, however, is even more brighter and colorful then most actual reefs. The film is like an inviting turquoise pool with a temperature of 85 degrees. And with a riveting score and perspective camera angles, the film launches itself away from other shtick to become noticed, but in my opinion, not really all the praise is worth it."

On the way, a crazy blue fish called Dory joins him and turns this into something of a buddy movie (although Dory is female)......<br/><br/>There are lots of jokes peppered throughout the movie with Dory supplying a large chunk of them. Writer-director Stanton plays a 'dude' 150 year old sea turtle straight from the 60's and adds to the fun. The visuals are superb, storyline is great and it all makes for a great adventure. I rate this 9/10 because I'm a little sick and tired of seeing it on the DVD every weekend for over a year now!!"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","1","2","18 July 2006"," An animated film with both Pixar and Disney qualities
","Finding Nemo can be seen as the bridge between Pixar Studios and Walt Disney Studios. It is the result of filmmakers and crew meeting halfway on this bridge and including aspects from both production companies and making it work. Finding Nemo brings some of the adult humour of Pixar (as seen in Ice Age, Monsters inc, etc) and combines it with the morals and lessons that Disney wants to teach (as seen inuh.. every Disney film).<br/><br/>While it would be more than OK with me to simply omit the latter in animated features to leave room for comedy and nice visuals, I see at least some faint need for moral statements as films like this primarily cater to children. These kinds of morals and values lessons are thankfully kept to a minimum in Finding Nemo - but they are present and they do drag the film down on occasion.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo tells the story of a widowed clownfish named Marlin who frequently goes overboard trying to protect his only living son, Nemo, from the dangers and non-dangers of the ocean world. One day, Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and Marlin, devastated, is left to face his own fears to go and find Nemo.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is an ocean ride with superb animations of sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans. The film parodies human behavior by creating an ocean world that greatly reflects our own (crayfish mowing their lawns, sting-rays as teachers). At the same time it brings some of nature in. I loved the sea gulls more than anything because they are seen in such great contrast to Marlin who is so human; he is complex, thinking and refined. The gulls are simply ""rat with wings"" in this film and are portrayed as such. Totally brainless creatures but providers of the greatest comedy in Finding Nemo. So it is not only Disney and Pixar meeting halfway, but nature and human behavior meeting halfway too.<br/><br/>This is probably the closest (aside from maybe The Emperor's New Groove) Disney has come to making an adult-humoured animated film - and they needed Pixar to do it. 7/10"

","I have to admit that I have been positively surprised and congratulations to all the stuff that helped to making alive the fishes and birds. My three old year son says ""again, again"".

But the most I liked was the real special effects and the very clear animation that makes very believable that these fishes are real.

","The underwater visuals here are as gorgeous as anything Disney ever did in PINOCCHIO, and the colors are dazzling enough to keep anyone hypnotized by the lushness of it all.<br/><br/>The slender story about an outgoing clown fish, Nemo straying far from his over-protective father (voiced by Albert Brooks) and getting scooped up by a scuba diver (to be deposited in a fish tank), is played for laughs all the way through. Despite all the humor, there are plenty of tense situations that might frighten the very young. The writers have made sure that the plot is a virtual obstacle course full of forces that have to be overcome before the boy becomes a hero who saves the day.<br/><br/>Along the way, Nemo's closest pal is the daffy, amnesiac Dory, a bluefish with a terrible memory, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres in what has to be the film's best voice-over. Her lines are all guaranteed to remind you of the comedienne herself and she comes close to stealing the film with her antics.<br/><br/>The movie is slanted at the youth market, of course, and kids and their parents will probably both be enchanted and satisfied with the quips that come fast and furious. I had to use the caption feature on my remote to catch all of the one-liners.<br/><br/>On an artistic level, the underwater seascape is fascinating to observe and the jaunty background score keeps the pace flowing nicely.<br/><br/>My favorites: the seagulls all shouting in unison ""Mine!"" whenever prey was cited and a whole army of them getting their beaks caught in the mast of a ship."

","Finding Nemo: 6/10: As a kid's movie Finding Nemo is great. If somehow your munchkins don't already own a copy, have the toys or God forbid seen the ice show (there is something about fish on ice that's a bit creepy. Funny but creepy.) Feel free to buy a copy. You'll get your moneys worth, as the little animatrons will undoubtedly view it endlessly.<br/><br/>But as an adult with no little minds of my own to feed the movie left me wanting. For one thing I've seen it before... about a hundred times before. Parent loses kid, kid loses dog, dog loses family, family loses toy, and so forth. Then the endless journey filled with danger, setbacks and endless comic relief characters begins. Finding Nemo, at least narratively, doesn't bring anything new to the party. <br/><br/>The fact that Pixar themselves are guilty of using this exact same plot in all their movies doesn't help matters. (Pixar's next feature The Incredibles would actually break this trend somewhat and is the most adult friendly toon of theirs to date) The simple fact is after being spoiled by Shrek (or even Ice Age) I like my kids films to be more accommodating to adults. <br/><br/>Not that some things don't work very well indeed (Bruce the 12 step shark and the ""mine, mine, mine,"" seagulls are particularly effective). It's just that the whole film had a cloying sentimentality I usually associate with NBC Olympic coverage or a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie about a Depression Christmas.<br/><br/>That said kids will love it. The animation is spectacular. And as these things go it certainly is very well done. Just not my cup of tea I guess. I prefer my fish with a little more bite and lemon and butter."

","Pixar has made some of the enjoyable films in the past years: The Toy Story films, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life to name a few. What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in ""Finding Nemo"" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.<br/><br/>There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlin's parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.<br/><br/>Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whale's mouth.<br/><br/>As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time."

There's no telling how long it took to put together.<br/><br/>With that set aside, I didn't think the story was that great.  It was OK, but definitely overhyped.  And I was expecting a lot of laughs based on other reviews, but I laughed once.  The story wasn't very original either. Rather than a friend searching for a friend, it's the dad going on an adventure to find his son.  Along the way, he gets help from an oddball. And since it's Disney, you know how it ends with lessons learned. <br/><br/>

","Being a big fan of Pixar, I was slightly disappointed by the quality of Finding Nemo.  It doesn't come near to the knowing humour of the Toy Story movies, opting rather for the more 'seen it all before' Shining jokes and others.  Those sea turtles seemed so funny in the trailer, yet in the film, they get very annoying very easily.<br/><br/>Thats not to say there isn't anything good in this film.  The man-ray teacher was definitely my favourite character, there was just something funny about the way he sang.  The Ocean's 11 style escape plan was great, as were the seagulls, who reminded me a lot of the dodo's in Ice Age.<br/><br/>The problem Finding Nemo suffers from is that it's just too Disneyfied, a trap A Bug's Life fell into.

"WheezyJoe","9","1","2","13 January 2004"," An Absolute Whale Of A Tale
","Wow, the digital realm is easily forgotten when you first lock eyes on the visual wonder created for yet another charming tale from Disney/Pixar Animation. `Finding Nemo' is Pixar's fifth outing and after a moderately spotless track record they keep this one swimming in a wealth off colour and three-dimensional form. Their visual language has proven to be a clear and successful method of storytelling. It captures the imagination and accommodates some fairly decent stories to-boot. And what setting could be more exciting than Australia's exotic eastern coastline.<br/><br/>
But it's a mix of Pixar's wonderful craft and a well written story that keeps audiences enthralled, and this time director/writer Andrew Stanton serves up just that, on a silver platter. What remains is the winning formula of comedy and gravity within the screenplay. Stanton has been involved with all of the other Pixar features in the past, and it shows. Even deep under the ocean, far removed from the human subtleties that are woven into usual animations, is a rich tapestry of lifelike environments and genuine character's that are easy to connect and relate to. And in the usual Pixar tradition you get a film that bridges the age boundary and becomes wholly enjoyed by all, young and old.<br/><br/>I enjoyed myself for the entire duration of `Finding Nemo' (that included the final credits). I recommend it to all, no matter what your cinematic preference may be. Besides the lavish visual elements that have made Pixar much admired this has been a labor of love for Andrew Stanton that started way back in 1992, prior to Toy Story. It's a new development in the path the entire production house is heading. Thomas Newman's involvement in writing music for this project shows us exactly that as his score gives the film a new emotional style. It's also a `new high water mark' for CGI (computer generated image) animation in general. Pixar is now an established force in animation but politely recognizes others in the industry as well. For example you have the address (amongst other things) Wallaby Way that will be instantly recognizable to ""Wallace and Gromit"" fans and a way-cool Sea Turtle (Crush, voiced by Stanton himself) with a very close resemblance to those four ninja friends of his. There are also plenty of fun references to Jaws, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Monty Python and nearly every previous (and upcoming) Pixar feature. You also have Pixar's own Joe Ranft, who made famous the character of Heimlich the caterpillar from `A Bug's Life', making another special appearance as the voice of Jacques the cleaner shrimp. Kids won't get these in-jokes but for the adults it's a warm welcome. But, when it comes down to it `Finding Nemo' is aimed at just about anyone, as long as you enjoy a well-told and inventive story. From the vibrantly lush to the murky dark this is an absolute lure for the eyes and a treat for the funnybone. <br/><br/>Score - 4 out of 5"

","Quite why I haven't commented on this before is beyond me, but still, here I am<br/><br/>Put simply, Finding Nemo is a brilliant film with funny and endearing characters that are a joy to watch. Pixar have again pushed the boundaries of computer animation to bring us a realistic yet still cartoonish film that will appeal to anyone from 3 to 103. I'm sure most people's favourite bit was the whale speak by Dory, which had me in stitches. However other little incidents in the film really made me laugh so much. When the little baby fish falls off the sponge bed is so typical of how children react when they hurt themselves. The animators and writers at Pixar really know how to capture the way people react to situations. All the little facial expressions throughout the film are beautifully animated.<br/><br/>The water effects must have been tremendously difficult to achieve, but they are fantastic. The lighting changes that were required really help set the mood of a scene, even when Marlin and Dory were inside the whale. The story although basic was successfully pulled off with no dip in any of the action. The story kept going when it shifted between Marlin's desperate attempt to locate his son, and Nemo's dispair of being alone with no one to look after him except the new collection of strange friends in the dentist fish tank.<br/><br/>
Overall I give it 10/10 because it was great. I can't wait for The Incredibles next year, I'm sure it will be just as good."

You almost feel like you're underwater and it's hard to imagine that this is animation is not real. The voice work just adds to the animation and makes the movie that much better. Hands down, Ellen DeGeneres is the best in this movie; her voice work as Dory is just hilarious. Every scene that Dory is in I couldn't help but laugh, and with help from the script, the film has some of the funniest scenes in a children's movie.

Also, we would have understood that man is evil (or unnatural; dumb, regarding to nature) without giving the human characters such an awkward wooden appearance. All this important details were so unnecessary that they appeared arbitrary, far too far-fetched, not well reconsidered and therefore disturbing.<br/><br/>Probably not intended but nevertheless fitting to the educational mission Walt Disney productions often suffer of: the sledgehammer moral. This time: ""Trust the abilities of your kid, otherwise you will be in trouble"". Is okay but in this movie again, administered with the club.<br/><br/>I don't need to mention the animations: but for the colors and the wooden humans brilliant! Excellent, excellent realistic animal movement, absolutely stunning. This made the movie worth watching for me. The plot and the characters, alas, remained underdeveloped.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"

Pieces of the film were amusing, the animation was very good, but, in the end, there was nothing to really like.<br/><br/>DeGeneres's character (Blue?), was a staple sidekick character whose only noticeable character trait was a poor short (and occasionally long term, as the plot required) memory, which did absolutely nothing for the story and was about as uninteresting as Nemo's stunted ""lucky fin"".<br/><br/>Not an awful film and I am sure that young children will be amused by it as they will be by almost anything animated) but anyone over the age of about 7 or 8 should leave it alone."

","My wife and I both got tired of this after about half an hour. By now, this kind of story has become formulaic and cliched. The adult in-jokes; the anthropomorphic sentimentality; the perils and chases--much too cutesy and much too contrived, even for a Disney film. This is totally lacking in the inventiveness, humor, and appeal--or creative animation--of Monsters Inc., Shrek, or A Bug's Life, all of which I loved. It's probably easy to become overwhelmed by the nice colors on the big screen; in this case, seeing it on DVD is to see the film more clearly and to realize it doesn't live up to the hype."

It is like a cross-section of California stereotypes were given plastic surgery and dropped in water. The formula has been been tortured to death by Hollywood in general and Disney in particular.<br/><br/>Thus, Finding Nemo makes good watching for young children and people who don't see many films, but movie-lovers will find it boring and stale.<br/><br/>On the whole not a bad movie, but hardly an original piece of work: 3/5.."

When Shrek first came out, i thought - wow! Disney has taken a big leap here. It was clever, satirical, and hugely funny.<br/><br/>Then, when Monster's Ink, Toy Story 2 and then Finding Nemo came out, it made me remember every single handdrawn Disney since the forties - there's always two people, usually males, a big person and a little person, at first they don't get along, and at the end they realise the most important thing - their friendship. Shrek and Donkey, Buzz and Woody, Sulley and Mike, Flik and the circus bugs, Simba and Nala, Timon and Pumba, Fox and Hound, Beauty and Beast, Lilo and Stitch, Mermaid and Flounder, Lady and Tramp, Mannie and Sid (Ice Age), Dumbo and Timothy Q Mouse, Pinnochio and Jiminy Cricket, Alladin and Abu, the list goes on.

","I'm sorry but this film was disappointing! It was of course a great looking film full of eye candy, but plot wise it was little different from the past Pixar films... yet again the main character has to go and search for or find someone!!!<br/><br/>Toy story - Search/Find our way back to Andy's home Toy story 2 - Search/Find Buzz! Bugs Life - Search/Find bugs that can help Finding Nemo - Search/Find a fish with a tiny flipper<br/><br/>I don't know who to blame for this lack of originality... Disney or Pixar?! I have loved every film they have done so far... don't get me wrong I enjoyed Nemo for the first 10 minutes. But it just hit me how similar these films are! I kind of hate myself for realising that too, because I so wanted to enjoy this film. Instead I found my self rolling my eyes at most of the events that occurred. I'm sure this film will entertain the under 16's which is the target audience. I just wish as with the other Pixar films there would be something there to entertain the more mature crowd. I'll try and end by saying if I had to rate this film out of 10 I would give it a 6.<br/><br/>As a little side criticism I thought Disney/Pixar missed a good opportunity to raise awareness of water pollution with this film. It made the ocean seem like a sparkling clean place, with no environment concerns. A little bit of awareness within the film would have been a nice touch.<br/><br/>PS. After saying all this, I have to admit the gulls were some of the funniest characters I've seen in a Disney/Pixar Production."
"qball_82","9","1","2","30 August 2003"," A gem.
","Hands down - this is the best movie I have seen all year. These days it's rare to come across a flick that has you walking out of the theater feeling like you really did get your money's worth, Finding Nemo is one of these.<br/><br/>Being a late session, the entire audience consisted of teen/adult viewers and I feel confident enough to say, judging from the incredible amount of laughter, everyone enjoyed it. I certainly did.<br/><br/>The three major selling points. The gorgeous rendered visuals, Pixar continues to out do themselves with every film they produce. You can't help but be amazed, and if it weren't for the colorful cartoony fish darting around on screen, you would swear this was filmed live.<br/><br/>Secondly, the amazing voice acting, I dare say this film wouldn't have done half as well without it. You'll recognize a number of familiar voices in this film and they all do a wonderful job, but I have to say it, Ellen Degeneres completely steals the show. Her characterization of Dory had myself and the audience in stitches many a time.<br/><br/>Bucket loads of humor and action mixed with some drama and quiet, poignant moments all tied up with a wonderful story, the most important aspect of all. With so many animation studios releasing these days, Pixar is the *only* one that is able to get it right, creating stories with heart that are able to connect with people of all ages, on every level. The tale of Finding Nemo is an enjoyable journey from start to finish and not once did I lose interest.<br/><br/>I know this review is incredibly gushy and all, but I honestly cannot fault this film. I cannot wait to own it on DVD to see it again. With so much rubbish being released into cinemas, both animated and live-action, Finding Nemo is a gem. Adult, teenager, kid, whatever - do yourself a favor and go see it now.<br/><br/>Long live Pixar."

","I'm one of Pixar's greatest fans, but this film was a serious disappointment (I was even looking forward to the flight!).<br/><br/>The animation was, as you'd expected from Pixar flawless. As a scuba diver pretty well everything looked right and felt right - even the transition from reef to sandy bottom was right on the button!<br/><br/>*However* what happened to the story/script and character development? In this respect it wasn't a patch on Pixar's other films. It fell into classic (note with a small 'c') Disney territory - simple story, great for little kids but what about us big ones?"
"VitalyBe","7","1","2","23 August 2003"," Cute but not as funny or thrilling as Toy Story
","This is an enjoyable film but it simply doesn't make it up to ""Toy Story"", ""Monsters Inc"" or ""Shrek"". It isn't as funny or dramatic, while it is still fun to watch, I wouldn't like to watch it again. For me it was merely another animated flick like ""Bug Story""."
"michaelgs","7","1","2","9 August 2003"," Good movie, great laughs, but formulatic.
","There is no doubt in my mind that Pixar is a great movie-making company. There is no doubt that it's newest installment is technically brilliant. There is no doubt that Dory represents one of the funniest characters in Pixar's very assorted collection. But there is some worry, on my part, that Pixar has been hammering home the same basic plot into us for the past eight years. In Toy Story, it's about Buzz being lost and meeting new friends. In the seccond Toy Story, It's about Woody being lost and meeting new friends. In A Bug's life, it's about Flick being lost and meeting new friends. In Monsters, Inc...well, you get the picture. All of them, all of them are good films. Very funny, and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>This film is no exception. Go whether you have kids or not. Rent the DVD whether you have kids or not. If you have kids, buy the DVD as a Christmas present. It will be a real treat. But I hope I am not the only person who will be relieved when there is a change of pace. Perhaps the Incredibles will be what I am looking for, and will convince me that Pixar's success is not merely due to the same basic plot.<br/><br/>7/10"
"movieguy1021","6","1","2","1 August 2003"," Finding Nemo: 6/10
","The line between fantasy and reality is becoming rapidly blurred. It seems that all computer-animated movies are doing extremely well, while the hand-drawn ones seem to be either direct-to-video sequels nobody wanted, box office bombs, or have horrendous ideas. Finding Nemo may soon be the highest grossing animated movie ever, simply because it's easy to look at. It's not as good as Pixar's other movies because it lacks the one key ingredient that made Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. work so well. Most kids never feared of being taken away by a man and being put into a fish tank in a dentist's office. However, I don't think there's a child alive who never thought that their toys moved when they weren't there or that there were monsters in the closet. Because of this, Finding Nemo couldn't connect as well, because, simply, it wasn't something that anyone thought of in real life.<br/><br/>The plot has Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clownfish who can never tell good jokes, with his wife Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) (where DO they get these names?), who just moved into a new home. A shark, however, eats Coral and all but one of her eggs. A few years later, Marlin raises Nemo (Alexander Gould) in an overprotective environment. To prove his dad wrong, Nemo swims out into the open ocean and is scooped up by a diver. Marlin goes on a search to find Nemo, and, along the way, meets over-the-top Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo has lavish landscapes. It really looks like the ocean, and, although none of the fish or creatures in the ocean looked real, they were well done. The best animation that Pixar does is with real things (like in the opening short, Knick Knack). Although they have some work to do with humans to make them look realistic, a few scenes, set in a doctor's office, looked incredibly real. Maybe if Pixar and PDI (who did Shrek) exchange secrets than Pixar could have better looking humans and PDI could have more realistic surroundings.<br/><br/>The only character that made me constantly laugh in this comedy was Dory. Although most of the target audience would not understand most of it, her short-term memory loss was a genius addition to the script. She was so uninhibited, it was really hilarious. However, Brooks, as Marlin, didn't really do much for me. If his ability to not be able to tell a joke had been played out more, it would've worked more. His paranoid behavior also ebbed and flowed, while if he had another quirk that he could do throughout the movie, would've worked more, also. The fun part about animated movies is all of the voices. I couldn't tell most of them, but I did recognize Willem Dafoe. Others include Allison Janney, Brad Garrett, Erik Per Sullivan, Stephen Root, Vicki Lewis, and Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>There's not a real moral to Finding Nemo. What is there to learn? All I've learned is from the opening credits that snowmen desperately want to leave their snowglobes. Basically, Finding Nemo won't go into the same category as Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.. Instead, it'll probably go into the `forgotten' category like A Bug's Life.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated G."

","Pixar can never do wrong, it will never do wrong, and it will make money from any movie it makes. Without a stellar voice cast or an obnoxious ad campaign, this movie proved that Pixar doesn't need to hype its own films anymore. I really thought this film would be a sinker, but the first week grosses proved otherwise. What I do admire about this film were the underwater sequences, which proved to be rather vibrant and more cutting edge than the previous Pixar films. While being a cynical 20-something, I can't say the film was particularly brilliant beyond visual appeal and animation, but for the younger kids, this is definitely quality entertainment a parent can take their child to."

The rest of that case also does an excellent job, I felt as if Disney made a quality effort to make this just as enjoyable for adults as for children, except for the poor little boy that sat behind me in the theater, ""It's too scary Mommy, I wanna go home!""

","The undersea adventure that Pixar presents is undoubtedly more fleshed out than Disney's ""Little Mermaid"". The characters are 'human', not just the bland sidekicks found in Disney movies, and the society of ""Fish Predators Anonymous"" was hilarious. Willem Dafoe is brilliant as the morose Gill.<br/><br/>I appreciate the factual detail in the movie. It is set in the Great Barrier Reef - *it* is the largest structure in the world built by living creatures, not New York -  the East Australian Current does lead to New South Wales, clown fish are abundant near the Reef, and there are toxic jellyfish off the Northern coast of Australia. It was nice to listen to the marine life speaking with aussie accents.<br/><br/>But for the fifth time running, a Pixar movie is about a journey of rescue. The formula seems to be wearing out. There are obvious comparisons to be made with Miyazaki, who manages to come up with highly original themes each time a movie is made, making each of them a success. Why do Disney and Pixar not follow the lead? [And, how is a fart joke, good humour?]"

"sikobabel","9","1","2","3 June 2003"," Pixar rebounds and scores.
","As a movie studio, Pixar has a nearly perfect track record.  In my opinion, they slipped a little with Monsters Inc.  While the movie was certainly fun and technically the graphics were brilliant, the story was weakly assembled and felt rushed.  It almost felt like a movie put together by a studio that took its excellent reputation for granted.  I was nervous about seeing Finding Nemo, only because I feared that this studio had run out of real magic, and would continue to coast along on brilliant graphics alone.<br/><br/>I have to believe that Dreamworks' recent success with Shrek was a wake-up call to Pixar.  Shrek widened the market of animated films, proving that a well-mixed dose of tongue-in-cheek adult humor was long overdue.  Pixar's routine was getting stale, and Monsters Inc. was the result. <br/><br/>
Finding Nemo brings back the magic.  It succeeds in every way that Monsters Inc. failed, and surpasses all their previous efforts in technical brilliance.  Taken as a whole, it surpasses every Pixar movie except for Toy Story 2, which remains the most emotionally charged of all their movies. <br/><br/>
True to form, Pixar gives us a simple story with complex emotions running throughout.  No time is wasted on the setup here - we have a father (Marlin) who loses everything but one son (Nemo).  Marlin becomes understandably overprotective, but the excesses of this lead to frustration in Nemo.  Nemo rebels in a scene that plays out so well that you completely forget you are watching fish.  The tension is unbelievably real.  <br/><br/>From there we are taken on a journey that introduces us to a wide variety of characters and fantastic adventures.  To go into detail would spoil the wonder of it all.<br/><br/>Possibly the most amazing feat of this movie is that I actually enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres in a major role.  I didn't think that was possible, as I normally find her brand of humor annoying.  Perhaps this comedian has finally found her niche in voice acting, or just her perfect role.  Either way, her part demanded a surprising amount of range for a comic relief sidekick, and she delivers.<br/><br/>Congratulations Pixar, you've still got it.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

The story is great as well, containing both laughs and heartfelt moments.  Albert Brooks is perfectly cast as the voice of Marlin, the neurotic clown fish father to Nemo.  Ellen DeGeneres also puts in a funny performance as Dory, a blue tang with a short-term memory. Other memorable characters include Bruce, Anchor and Chum, the trio of sharks, and Crush the sea turtle.

The underwater sequences are beautiful, full of color and life.  In every single case the voices match the animals perfectly.  The jokes are great--they can appeal to both children and adults (my favorites were the shark being called Bruce--a reference to ""Jaws"" and DeGeneres trying to ""speak"" whale).  There are some scenes that might frighten very small children involving some vicious-looking animals with big, sharp teeth--but the movie is not violent or bloody at all (it IS G rated).<br/><br/>Basically a really fun great film.

Our heros fight sharks in a twelve step program, pelicans, a flat out hysterical flock of seagulls, an old submarine, a vicious four-year-old with braces, fish obsessed with dental procedures and a hazardous group of jellyfish.

His cowardly father embarks to find him with the help of Dory, a fish with ""short term memory loss"". In the tank, Nemo encounters a small band of captives who all dream of freedom. <br/><br/>I saw finding Nemo with five children aged 3 to 10, and they all were delighted, scared and thrilled. At the same time, my wife and I had belly laughs at the humour which was sufficiently adult without being inappropriate for the kids. <br/><br/>The true delight of Finding Nemo is in the animation. With every feature, Pixar refines its art and is able to add more to it's films. The colours and visuals are rich and delightful. Note the way the reds, pinks and purples give way to dark blue and grey when the characters are in peril. The small role characters, like the seagulls, crabs, turtles are created with care and depth.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie enough.

","You can always count on a Pixar film to create loads of family fun as parents and children alike take some time off their busy schedules to enjoy another one of their features. They sure have a great record for it. They began with the surprise hit Toy Story, which started the long-standing trend of computer animated films. They followed with A Bug's Life in 1998, Toy Story 2 in 1999 and Monsters Inc. in 2001. Pixar outperforms each of their previous efforts which is very rare in the modern Hollywood scene. Now, after taking a year off, they take audiences to the ocean in Finding Nemo. But how well will the film do? This is the first time a Pixar film has been placed during the summer time (all previous efforts had been released in November) but this allows for more success with children finishing school. Another problem for the film is lack of voice talent. Monsters Inc. had the advantage of John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the leading roles but the voices for this film are less known. This doesn't matter to children but it can be for some adults.  The question is whether Finding Nemo can continue Pixar's trend of success or will be the film be sunk by the competition?<br/><br/>The story goes that Marlin, an orange and white striped clownfish, lives with his son Nemo, who has a ""lucky"" fin that is smaller then his other fin, in the ocean near Australia. Marlin is very cautious after the death of his wife and fears for the safety of his son. He fears so much that follows his son on a field-trip on his first day of school. Nemo, who seems embarrassed by his father's over-protective behavior, swims to a boat as dare to prove that he is not like his father. But this courage gets him in trouble as he is captured by a scuba-diver and taken away to a dentist's office in Australia. Marlin goes on a rapid search for his only son and along the way he meets a variety of colorful characters. Among those are Dory, a blue fish with short-term memory loss, Bruce, a shark who forms a club for vegetarian sharks, and Crush, a surfer talking turtle. Marlin will go to any length to find his son and bring him home even if it means facing his own fears head on. Like all previous films, Finding Nemo's story is far superior to most animated films though, it can be said, it is not totally perfect. Much like A Bug's Life, which was also directed by Andre Stanton, the story tends to drag a bit in parts making it less consistent then Toy Story or Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>As previously stated, the voice cast for Finding Nemo is less well-known then most Pixar films, which gives it another similarity toward A Bug's Life. Albert Brooks gives a perfect timid voice to the character Marlin. Brooks, who is also appearing in the In-Laws currently, deserves more attention for his role in this film then he is currently getting. He presents sarcastic humor at the right time with this characters as well as emotion which makes you feel for him as he struggles to find his son. Ellen DeGeneres is absolutely delightful as the forgetful Dory. The funniest moments in the film come from her characters especially the hilarious scene where she tries to speak whale. Some of the most thought provoking moments come from her character as well, which is ironic coming from a fish with short-term memory loss. William Dafoe is wonderfully cast as Gill, who tries to help Nemo escape from the dentist's office fish-tank. Geoffrey Rush, who stars in Pirates of the Caribbean later this summer, is humorous as the pelican but most of his most funny scenes had been seen in the trailers. And Pixar regular, John Ratzenburg, is great as the school of fish that poke fun at Marlin and teach him to lighten up.<br/><br/>Overall, Finding Nemo is another great film from the folks at Pixar but not their best work. The visuals are the best that have ever been seen in an animated film, that is for sure, but the story is not as hilarious as Monsters Inc. was. The story also tends to drag a bit in parts which makes it quite inconsistent. Finding Nemo also seemed to have a lot more intense scenes then most films aimed toward children, which is better for the older crowd but is sure to frighten some children. But the spectacular visuals, the delightful characters and those Pixar tributes to famous films make this a must-see anyway. The best family film to date and looks to be for quite some time.<br/><br/>My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5 (Grade: A-)"

While I was awake to fully comprehend the Spanish and the English words very well, the movie itself seemed mostly boring and not-up-to-it to me. I've finished watching this in English when my family was in a limo in Florida. I was glad when the movie was finally over!

","The average viewing public must be extraordinarily callous these days not to at least be a little shocked by the movie's content. This film has the emotional elements of a holocaust film with overtones of horror film. They should have named it ""instant nightmare in a film can"". This is, by far, the most emotionally brutal cartoon I have ever seen and the fact that it was marketed as a kids movie is unbelievable! The movie begins when an entire family of fish (with the exception of the father and one of his sons) is slaughtered by what looks like a barracuda. When the son (Nemo) goes on a school field trip, he almost does something stupid because of peer pressure. His father then threatens to take him out of school, to which Nemo replies by doing the something markedly stupider out of spite, resulting in his being captured by a diver and taken away in a boat. The father spends the rest of the movie following the direction the boat went when it disappeared. During his journey the father finds another fish with which he can have emotional issues and repeatedly encounters creatures that are introduced in a horrific enough fashion so that it probably kept hundreds of children's beds wet for weeks after the film's premier. The combination of the odious, depressing characters and the slasher-film style directing/music that most of the film seems to possess culminates in producing wastebasket fodder even more potently un-watchable than The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)."

","When I first saw this film with my then 5 year old son, I thought it was pretty good. Subsequent viewings have revealed major flaws. Perhaps this is a little heavy considering it's a children's movie but I have seen many children films and there a lots that I can watch over and over again. Alice in Wonderland, the Jungle Book, etc. The biggest flaw,someone else mentioned it earlier,is the non-stop intense action sequences. The film begins with Nemo's mother being eaten by a barracuda, for any kid who understands the context this must be terrifying, it's followed by another excruciating scene when Nemo is scooped up by divers. Anyone with separation anxiety will have trouble with this scene. Accompanying this are an assortment of loud banging noises, intense thuds, and Psycho inspired music. Then there are the characters Nemo's okay, but his Dad is a whining, irritating jerk, Dory is funny for a while but then her stupidity becomes annoying. And the surfer dude turtle Ozzie accent- all wrong. Overall if you are a parent deciding to rent this for the kids reach for the Aristocats instead."

I, myself, will have to say (other than Pixar) I agree. But what Pixar has done to animated movies is just genius. To start off, Finding Nemo presents a lot of hidden adult themes that adults would only understand. It also contains heart, which no animated movie has ever done. It makes you actually feel for an animated creature and that is just almost magic. Pixar explores childhood in a way nothing else can, and I just adore these movies. I also have to admit, Finding Nemo put a tear in my eye (and for an animation) that is just complete brilliance. I respect Pixar for doing these such things. The film also has amazing voice acting and you can actually see the emotion the actors put out to make this movie, something only Pixar could do. This movie is an absolute heartwarming, hilarious adventure that digs into your heart and toys with your emotions.

","'Finding Nemo' is definitely one of Disney's best films and according to our dear IMDb it's one of the best films that has ever been made (currently #172). It also won an Oscar for the 'Best Animated Film of the Year' in 2003. So clearly, this is a film worth watching. But if you're still not convinced then perhaps some of these comments will help.<br/><br/>The story is engaging. A fish-father Marlin has only one precious son called Nemo, who happens to be the son of his now deceased fish-wife. But Nemo is taken away from Marlin. Because of Marlin's vow years ago to never let anything bad happen to his son, Marlin goes in search of Nemo. It's a journey which takes Marlin through much of the ocean. Along the way, Marlin encounters plenty of action, characters, terrible situations and is increasingly discouraged that he might never see Nemo again. But along the way he learns a few important lessons about parenting and the value of true friendship. Also, his determination in seeking to find his son is well worth viewers learning from. Family is something that cannot be replaced and should be protected and nurtured even if it costs you everything you have, including your life.<br/><br/>The script and characters are both brilliant. Some of the ideas are wacky, but it's the kind of thing that both adults and children have found really funny. Dory is generally the first character who everybody remembers. She is really good company and she is a classic character in Disney film-making history. Imagine it: Marlin needs help finding his son and of all the fish in the ocean he gets stuck with one who has short term memory loss! The main character Marlin is enjoyable to watch and it's interesting to see his slow, but certain progress as a father who loves his son. Bruce the great-white shark, though he is not a main character, is also very unique and entertaining. Just about every character in this film is memorable: Gill, Nigel, Nemo, and the rest. They are all great and the script-writers have made them interact beautifully and creatively!<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible. You really feel like you are watching a story taking place in the big-wide world called the ocean. It's breath-taking. I remember going to see it in the cinema in 2004 and it blew us all away. It was another step forward for its time.<br/><br/>For some reason, I always love to re-visit this film and it's never disappointing. It's a real feel-good film. It's funny, it's extremely entertaining and it will also make you cry if you're a right sissy like me. Brilliant film and worth buying to enjoy again and again.<br/><br/>10/10"

It is a heartwarming, as well as frequently funny film, it had me shedding tears on several occasions, the dedication of Marlin to find his lost son is powerful, making it hard to believe it is just a cartoon. My only issue was the lack of development for Nemo's friends at the dentist, we learn little about Gill and his crew, and their story does not conclude properly, which disappointed me. The voice actors are outstanding, perfectly delivering the personality traits and emotion of these characters as they struggle with this insane adventure, Albert Brooks conveys Marlin's sadness for his lost child, Ellen DeGeneres showcases Dory's amnesia perfectly and Willem Dafoe emphasizes Gill's desire for freedom effectively, as well as many other great performances, such as Geoffrey Rush as a helpful pelican.

Along the way, they encounter sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish, and tank fish. The story then explains a true loving message of father and son. Okay, I think Nemo is another personal favorite film from Pixar. The story felt true to life, the characters were all hilarious, including Dory, the best Pixar character ever, for most of the laughs, and the heart of this tale kept beating like it was going to teach a big lesson where to respect your loved ones, and taught the true meaning of father and son. And they use this true fact with talking fish! How cool is that? ""Finding Nemo"" was quite a story to die for, and the story was so loving and sometimes heartbreaking that everybody wants to see a movie like this! Looks like Pixar has a soft side of drama, and has a big heart for family. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again, and I'll never be tired of it.

This has been all of my friends little sisters and brothers favourite film, its still some of theirs too! Well its defiantly been my favourite film and is still on my very good movie list. <br/><br/>The beginning of the film is very good where the father names the young fish Nemo because his wife wanted that name. She was killed by a shark when they move from a small pond to the ocean. When they are outside enjoying the view talking about what they wanted to name all of the child ( there's about 989) the father wants more than half to be called after him but the wife only wants one to be called Nemo. When suddenly everything goes dark and everyone disappears they wonder why until he see's the shark he tries to get the wife inside the house but she's scared that the shark will see the eggs and makes a dash for them but thats when the shark sees her. The shark eats her and all of the babies apart from one which the dad calls Nemo, He raises Nemo up very well up until the point where Nemo runs away.<br/><br/>The dad is very very sad and angry at himself and tries to look for him everywhere but he is nowhere to be found. On the journey Nemo meets a new friend, who turns out to be his best friend.<br/><br/>I laughed so hard i started crying, i was frightened for Nemo and upset that his dad felt very worried. In the end, i do love a happy ending! <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to everyone of all ages, I will never get bored of it and if its movie night with the girls well we'll be watching this!

Dad searches all over for him. Sounds like an everyday story that you might hear from the radio or read in the papers. Tough story to understand and realize. But, let's put this into perspective for our children to understand.<br/><br/>This story is about little Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) and how he not only overcomes what life gave him (short stubby fin) but taking on challenges and adventures by himself and some friends along the way.<br/><br/>But the true story is about a fathers' love for his son and everything that he would do to protect him. Marlin (father voiced by Albert Brooks) meets with a talkative and short term memory loss fish named Dori (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) and they end up taking a long journey in search of Nemo. This quest will lead Marlin and Dori through old shipwrecks, giant sharks, jellyfish, and the demons of the deep ocean, not to mention mankind also.<br/><br/>Marlin is afraid of his own shadow, but with a little luck and many friends that he meets across the ocean he opens up and becomes the type of person we all dream of.<br/><br/>The colors in this film make the ocean seem so realistic that you will enjoy watching this film without your kids in the same room.

The comedy is fantastic, and is vastly superior to Pixar's previous and most recent productions. Some of the gags remain today, as moments of the movie continuously pop-up in daily conversations. The colors used are just spectacular. The opening shots of the coral reefs, to the forest of jellies, not one scene is bland.<br/><br/>The story is cute, funny, and very enthralling. There's moments of pure terror that might be too much for a younger viewer, such as the Barracuda, the Angler Fish, and when everyone is scooped up in the fishing net. However terrifying that situation is, the dramatic tension and suspense is what keeps it grounded, and sends fear into the most hardened adult.<br/><br/>Thomas Newman's score is very well done, and probably one of the best of 2003 -- right under The Return of the King.<br/><br/>Overall, there is not one flaw in this film that I could point out that would alter my judgment.

It has great graphics which make the whole scenario look so real and so natural. The story is clever and the movie has lots of dangerous adventures lived by a clownfish and a funny regal tang with memory problems. However, although the graphics are in general good thanks to its quality sceneries and well-designed various fish species, the human characters are awfully designed, especially that horrible little girl who looks like the annoying Sid from ""Toy Story"".<br/><br/>Aside the movie's faults, generally speaking the movie is okay, entertaining enough and offers fun for everyone who's watching it. The movie has some quite funny gags, such as whenever a character says something like «He's a clownfish, but he's not funny at all». Another good joke is when Marlin is trying to tell a joke to the sharks and, while he's making a fool out of himself, he suddenly yells «Nemo!!!». Bruce (the shark) is a funny and interesting character. Bruce is a very humorous shark and he's got a funny way to invite the fishes for a dinner with his other two friends sharks. After all, «fishes are their friends». <br/><br/>Oh, by the way, I think it's very good that for once a movie includes a blue whale, which is a very forgotten animal in animated films. It is the biggest animal on Earth and it sure is a fantastic creature.<br/><br/>Overall, one of Pixar's best films (although not a tremendous film for me) and better than the overvalued and overrated ""Toy Story""."

","I love this movie. Although it has a sad beginning, it's a wonderfully funny & touching movie. Albert Brooks' character, Marlin, is very funny as the overly cautious (with reason to be) father. And Nemo is a sweet kid, who manages not to seem bratty at all even when he's being defiant. All the main characters are super funny (& endearing) whether in the sea or in the aquarium. Examples: Bruce & friends are sharks that don't want to eat fish (though it's hard to fight their natural urges); and Jacques is a neat freak, so naturally very bothered when they decide to let the tank get filthy in order to force the owner to clean it, allowing them the chance to possibly escape. However, Ellen DeGeneres' character, Dory, tops them all though. She suffers from short-term memory loss (at times, very short-term), which makes for many laughs. And she thinks she can speak whale, which makes even just stating that very funny. One of my favorite parts is when she tells Marlin that they're not the only two ones in here (the ocean, that is). Basically, it's one of my favorite movies."

","""Nemo"" had a great advertising just like other films (Shrek, The Incredibles, Chicken Little), and their grand success can be partially explained that way. ""Nemo"" was promoted like another rebirth of Disney and the greatest picture Pixar has never made. The graphics were outstanding, although I was never keen of seeing more than one time 3D animated movies. The original concept, although not very original, was good for standing away from the silly-piggish-not-that-funny-dull-stupid script that 3D animated computer features had taken (aka Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar, Shrek II and III, and just because they enjoy to milk the cow, maybe IV, V, VI...). ""Nemo"" stands aside from this. But are some negative aspects. While watching this movie on cinema, some little kids fell asleep during the second part and most of them claimed that the film was just too long and the adults complained about the slow story pace. I can say the same. The thing with Nemo's mother death was so unoriginal, that they even called this ""Bambi and The Lion King deep in the sea"" The parts with Nemo trapped in the dentist office were boring and with its develop, even Marlin and Dory plot with their ""platonic love"" was going the same way. A good soundtrack could easily distract the audience but there was no good soundtrack and not even bad. There was none. Some Disney films needed some time but this should be cut at half."

","I'll confess straight away to having a fish-tank indoors and admit to loving my fish. I've always coveted the tropical fish tank with their beautiful colouring but never been encouraged to take them on as they're notoriously short-lived. This lovely animated feature showed me what I 've been missing as well as royally entertaining me too. The twin stories are skilfully inter-cut in a proper cinematic way, combining Marlin & Dory's ocean-wide search for Nemo is well inter-cut with Nemo's attempts to escape captivity from the evil fish-tank (now I feel guilty about owning one!). The dialogue is smart, occasionally funny, rarely sentimental and well delivered by the not-so-starry cast (and all the better for it - people like Hanks and Murphy hardly need the income after all), even if Albert Brooks as Marlin keeps reminding me of a young Mel Brooks!. The real stars of course are the animators, bringing to life, well, sort of, all manner of aquatic effects, from a shoal of fish on the move, to turtles riding the current and even the depiction of whales in motion. There's a light ecological message too as you'd expect, pushed just far enough to register but not repel, particularly with the children in the primary target-audience and of course the expected stuff about father - son relationships, growing pains, generation gap - can't believe I'm writing this about a movie about cartoon fish. Anyway, lasting a just-right 90 minutes, Finding Nemo is a pleasant warm-hearted family entertainment and I'll certainly think twice next time my fish-tank filter breaks down!"

Every scene is crammed with breathtaking beauty, and so much eye candy that I see something new every time I watch the film.<br/><br/>But all of this is (spectacular) window dressing for the spectacular story. Not only is the film consistently hilarious, but all the gags merely support a story that is, at its core, deeply moving and heartfelt. And that is what ultimately makes the film such a satisfying experience.<br/><br/>My initial temptation is to state that this film has, indeed, supplanted The Lion King as the greatest animated film of all time. But I think I prefer to think of them, in a sense, as companion pieces. Both films deal, in different ways, with the special bonds between father and son. The Lion King--forever holding a special place in the annals of animation--is still lord of traditional, hand-drawn animation. And Finding Nemo sets a gold standard for computer animation that I can't ever see being beaten any time in the near future."

","OK, before i go onto my, Finding Nemo is the best movie ever rant, i will begin by stating some things wrong with many of the ""hated it"" comments. First of all, Disney DID NOT WRITE IT. Andrew Stanton and Bob Paterson did, they work for Pixar. second of all, everyone says, this is the typical, loss of parents movie. Well yes partly, but not necessarily. The movie is called finding memo, not memo is lost, or memo's lost adventures. Which means the movie is NOT about memo, it is about marlin. So did marlin loose his parents, not that we know of. Also, the point of the movie is not memo triumphs, it is a father son movie, that was trying to relate to actual experiences of people. The movie shows the growing of these two fish to understand each other. Marlin and memo grow in understanding that yes, memo needs boundaries, but he needs freedom as well. Now for the ranting. First, Nemo has the most stunning images of all the Pixar movies. Obviously fish don't talk, and obviously it is animation. But you feel almost as if you were underwater for real, with animated fish. Now the plot is a little run of the mill, but Pixar does so much with it. Bringing in such characters like the tank, or dory (of course), the turtles etc. Also, the comedy is golden. The obvious comedy comes from Dory easily, but Marlin (Albert Brooks) brings so much more in the end. Pixar really tries to relate its plots to actual experiences. Like most children think that their toys talked and came alive, most children think that there are monsters under the bed or in the closet. A huge fear in children is the fear of separation. Overall, Pixar is the greatest animation company right now, i think. They put so much effort into all of their movies, and the end result is spectacular."

","I believe this an amazing movie. Not only did this movie have a long process, it was worth it.

The quality of the graphics is so admirable that it was being produced for six years! When you are watching this movie, you don't even notice that the graphics are marvelous because your mind is set on the wonderful plot.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie with a great plot and tremendous graphics, then this is the family movie you are looking for.

","What a delightful film. It's difficult to crack a top ten list, which hasn't changed in seven years (since Dances with Wolves), but this movie gets in my top ten. Ellen Degeneres' Dory creates her own chemistry with the sea and all the characters with whom she interacts. Yes, there is a special spark between Dory and Nemo's protective father fish, voice by Albert Brooks. Degeneres character would test the most stodgy and stoic of audiences. Who could mot crack a smile under Dory's amazing repertoire of forgetfulness and forget-me-nots? <br/><br/>Who knew Nigel (Pelican from down under) was voiced by Geoffrey Rush? I think we are all still throwing in our own ""mine, mine..."", whenever we find the opportunity. All the way to the end and beyond (don't forget to watch the credits!)it's a story of adventure, heroism and love. Even if you think you a have an aversion to animated features, I double dog dare you to watch this movie, and try NOT to crack a smile. Nemo will wear you out with laughter, and make your heart grow fonder. Even if you thought you didn't have one (a heart that is)."

Well, she's played by the funny Ellen DeGeneres. She's the one who makes everyone laugh during the whole film. This film is funny for both kids and adults. It's really entertaining with peril here and there. This film is also sad, including the beginning that is hard to see, even for me.<br/><br/>The animation, overall, is great. Obviously, Pixar's animation is always great and it'll never become bad. It's wonderful to see the ocean. Everywhere is colorful on the screen. This is a masterpiece. It'll soon become a classic. This film is not overrated. It's fine where it is right now. This is the best animated film of 2004, in my opinion. The moral of the story is good for all of the parents to hear: Do not become over protective to your kids. Sooner or later you'll have to let them go with their own life. Ellen is the perfect character for Dorry. She's just adorable that it makes you put a smile in your face.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining and funny piece of work.

","I loved Finding Nemo from the very beginning. The young voices are cute, especially Nemo and Squirt. ""Finding Nemo"" is a fun-loving, wonderfully animated movie that won the Best Animated Film of 2003. **Spoilers ahead** Nemo is a young clown fish, who's father, Marlin is overprotective of him. He has a good reason, to be overprotective, though. Not long before Nemo was born, his wife, Coral and most of their children, still in their eggs, were swiped by a mean-looking barracuda. Later, Nemo meets Gill, Peach, and the rest the of the ""Tank Gang."" Marlin eventually finds Nemo, but never would have if not for the help of Dory, who suffers from short-term memory loss. She helps him, and she refers to Nemo by several names: Harpo, (Marx) Elmo, (Sesame Street character) and others. ""Finding Nemo"" is #2 on my all-time favorite movie list, second only to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" Watch ""Finding Nemo"" and you won't regret it!"
"richard-wheeler","10","1","3","15 January 2006"," ""Fish are friends, not food!""
","I had heard of this movie over a number of times, but I never got to see it. And finally, last year I did. The film had spectacular graphics of the under water world and the water looked very inviting (in the Austalian Reef). And it had laughs from beginning to end!There were some interesting things I learned from the film: Clown Fishs' instincts and how many eggs they can lay. And of course, what goes on in a fish's mind.<br/><br/>Anyways, the film was about two Clown fish named Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) and Marlin (Albert Brooks). And one day, Coral was attacked by a barracuda and Marlin found one of his eggs a little wounded. And when the egg turned into a fish, it had a pectoral fin that was bigger than the other. Marlin named him Nemo (Alexander Gould).<br/><br/>One day, Nemo was abducted on a field trip by a dentist (Bull Hunter). The dentist thought Nemo needed a safe place to stay. Man! That abduction scene's suspense KILLED me! Marlin went around looking for help in order to find Nemo and he bumped into a fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Fortunately, Dory suffered from a short term memory loss and she and Marlin went around in circles.<br/><br/>Later, they bumped into an intimidating Great White shark named Bruce (Barry Humphries), a Hammerhead named Anchor (Eric Bana) and a Raggedtooth or a blue shark named Chum (Bruce Spence. They always had meetings about fish are friends, not food. CUTE! They have a little sensitivity. HA!HA!HA! And when Dory and Marlin tried to escape, Bruce and his companions went after them and Bruce got a bomb stuck in his mouth , spat it out, and he and his companions ran! That explosion scene was great. And it was funny when two pelican's were sitting on the water and a bubble came up from behind one of them and the other said ""nice"" and flew away.<br/><br/>Nemo woke up in a tank in the Dentist's room in Sydney. And he made friends with the following in the tank: Peach, a starfish (Allison Janney), Gill, a triangular fish (Willem Dafoe), Bubbles, another triangular fish (Stephen Root), Deb, another triangular fish (Vicki Lewis), Gurgle, a colorful fish (Austin Pendleton)and a Jacques, a shrimp (Joe Ranft).<br/><br/>Back in the ocean, Dory and Marlin bumped into a beautiful light that belonged to a VICIOUS Angler fish! WHOA! And back in the tank, Nemo was known as ""Shark Bate"". Everyone in the tank were planning to escape and Nemo too. And back in the ocean, it was amazing how those Sardines indicated to Marlin and Dory to where Nemo was taken. And amazing to see Dory and Marlin swim through that school of Jelly fish.<br/><br/>When Nemo was told to bust the generator of the tank. My heart pumped when Nemo nearly went into the fan! And again, back in the sea; there was an awesome scene with Dory and Marlin surfing with a turtle who was 150 years old named Crush (Andrew Stanton) with all the other turtles through the Austalian Current. And it was So magnificent to see the baby turtle Squirt (Nicholas Bird) surf! A pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) told Nemo that his father had been looking for him. And back in the water, Dory and Marlin were trapped in a whales body. Awesome GRAPHICS! And they were spat out from the whale's spout.<br/><br/>And finally, Dory and Marlin got the surface and they were carted off by Nigel off to the Dentist's room. It was hysterically funny when those seagulls went after Nigel saying: ""Mine!Mine!Mine!"" And their beaks went through a sail of a yacht and they were still saying it! Now I knew where my Big Brother Chris Isherwood picked that phrase up from.<br/><br/>And back in the Dentist's room, the Dentsit's child Darla (LuLu Ebiling)(also known as ""The Fish Killer"". You should've seen how terrible Darla was to Nemo when he was playing dead. And finally, Nemo escaped through the sewage pipe and back into the ocean. And when Dory bumped into Nemo and he introduced himself to her. Dory forgot everything and said: ""Oh! That's a nice name"". And SUDDENLY, Dory got caught up in a net, Nemo told all the other fish who were stranded in it to keep swimming and so did Marlin say it. And everyone broke out and were FREE to go.<br/><br/>In the end, everything went back to normal... and the fish from the Dentist's room escaped. Another fishtastic film with fishtastic surprises!!!"
"noralee","10","1","3","22 December 2005"," A Funny Joy!
","""Finding Nemo"" is a complete joy! <br/><br/>It shows the value of using character actors for voices, rather than bimbos and himbos whose faces you can't see anyway. Not only wonderful are Albert Brooks as a worry wart dad (that's not a fish species) and Ellen DeGeneres (whose character is clearly inspired by Ani Di Franco's song ""Little Plastic Castle"": ""They say goldfish have no memory/I guess their lives are much like mine/and the little plastic castle/is a surprise every time/and it's hard to say if they're happy/but they don't seem much to mind.""), but we get to hear real Australian accents via Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana. Phil Procter (of Firesign Theater) was listed as one of the many ancillary voices -- my husband commented that he could have done all the voices.<br/><br/>The side characters are more than charming -- surfer dude tortoises, 12-stepping sharks and dynamic interactions in a prison, er, aquarium. The references to old movies are very funny, including ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho"" (with credited use of that screechy music).<br/><br/>As a dentist's daughter, though, I do protest the stereotypes about pain and tooth-pulling. <br/><br/>And why do all Disney movies have to have a dead parent? <br/><br/>But at least we didn't have to suffer through the usual schmaltzy ballads as surprisingly this isn't a musical. <br/><br/>It's worth staying for all the credits as the amusing animation continues to the very end. <br/><br/>Though the jokes should appeal to all ages, the toddler running loose in our theater was probably too young, until a character on screen shouted out ""You there, stop!"" and she did, mesmerized wide-mouthed that the movie was talking to her, giving her mother time to catch her and take her outside.<br/><br/>(originally written 6/15/2003)"

","This is the movie of your dreams. If you can dream with a movie, it will sure be Finding Nemo. Or maybe that close to it. Director Andrew Stanton wanted a really deep father and son movie, and he get such deepness that even the sea became such a little pond compared to it. Nemo's odyssey in the tank is a great contrast and irony (the poor kid wants the exterior) compared to the odyssey of the father, who is scared of the outside, and fights his fears and demons to save not only his son but himself, and find the real sense of life between those jellyfish that create a beautiful and deadly pink forest. From the De-intoxication center sharks to the creepy angler fish, this movie has a rhythm compared only to a roller coaster, it never stops, and when I say never stops I mean that it always keep your attention. You wont yawn, you wont get bored, not only because that terrific screenplay, but because the production design is almost perfect, maybe even perfect. Every bubble, every little fish, has a meaning in every frame. Every scene is like the final result of thousand of previous decisions and discussions. This is Pixar's gold to it's pure status, shinny, beautiful and very heavy (in terms of multi-layered messages) and makes a big mark in the animation world and history. Now next to the black ears mouse, we can see a small orange and white clown fish. Welcome to the history, Little Nemo."

It includes lots of different lines, comments and music from a range of different movies and the humour in it is very humorous for 4 year old kids through to 4000 yr old people.Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job in directing this hit. Another thing i absolutely love about it is the casters didn't choose the popular celebrities but used people who i never knew before this. They gave the chance of being famous and well known to people who are usually just stuck behind the scenes of movies. They used a range of different fish that fit into different stereotypes in our communities and our own lives in the modern times.

The father sets out on a journey to find Nemo, the lost little clownfish, and he meets several new friends along the way, including a blue fish with memory problems named Dori and a group of Australian turtles.<br/><br/>The story is a cute one with a wide range of characters that will appeal to children and events that are frightening and challenging that the father must go through in order to find his son. It's a typical children's cartoon, really, using the ideas of other stories before it.<br/><br/>The animation is done well - particularly under the water, which is difficult to animate. However, the pacing of the film gets a little bit slow in some places. While the father is searching for Nemo, the events seem to go on and on. Also, I found Dori to be very trying and annoying. The jokes about her and memory loss went on far too long, and I just found this to be too annoying. Children may like that, but it made the film less enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I would rate this as an average film - particularly over other children's films.

","An intelligent, humorous, and visually gorgeous film. Some may criticize it's soft center, but I find it refreshingly warm in all respects. Some kids movies are syrup flavored saccharine drops, that can make a more mature viewer choke. But here in Nemo is a gently, loving and observant film that can speak both to a child and an adult. This film gives me a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I think of it. In my opinion it's better than the Incredibles. The characters are better developed and more likable, and the storyline is more cohesive and accessible to children, while not boring adults. There is also a lack of bitter sarcasm and meanness that sometimes rear their ugly heads even in children's films. What makes this movie so great to me is the fact that i believe it to really be not a children's film, but a film for adults that happens to be wonderfully appropriate for children. It doesn't try to talk down to kids and teach them some silly lesson about sharing and caring etc... but simply exists as loving entertainment."

I heard a TV critic say that Ellen DeGeneris deserved a prize, and if you knew how these complex characters are created by voice and then drawn, you would have to agree. Through emotions of both sadness and joy we felt love for the family. The humor was agreeable to my age (over 50) and it must have been agreeable to children too, considering the high box office. The young kindergarten characters were so joyfully portrayed that I can still see them in my mind.

The exploration into ocean life is perfectly animated, however most amazing is the realism with which Sydney is portrayed. The visual style is not alone what makes this great however, it is as the film's delightful characters and sense of humour that make it enjoyable. All the characters are funny, each in their own way; the film reaches hilarity many times; and the whole production buzzes along well to the brilliant choral music of Thomas Newman.

","""What many people consider to be witty and original is what I see as imports from early Chaplin films and episodes of the Simpsons. Finding Nemo is the story of the eponymous fish, Nemo. Nemo is the only survivor of his batch after his brothers and sisters (along with his Mother) were eaten by sharks in the egg stage. However Nemo survived (albeit deformed) along with a paranoid Father.<br/><br/>The jokes seem tired and lack any moments of stomach-rumbling chuckling but rather a series of humoured snorts. Although the main character of Nemo is likable, the other two major characters are not. Ellen Degeneres' role as Dory is so irritating that you start hoping the diver comes back and batters Dory then at least somebody will get some use out of the poorly-designed character.<br/><br/>Although there are smart ideas it becomes jumbled up in overly-immature jokes that decrease the entertainment value. For example the sharks that are dedicated to soothing their blood lust is worth some giggles but it gets lost in the sea(pardon the pun) of poor remarks. I should have known that the immaturity and basicness of the jokes would never stop coming. I assumed there would be a 15 minute farting sequence later on."""

I imagine that Disney requires most of their animated features to involve everyone looking for a single character, or a character finding him/herself, but there really wasn't much going on in this film that would have been lost had it been condensed into an hour, or even 45 minutes. I may have been drawn in at some point, but had to sit there too long to stay involved.<br/><br/>I think that children will find the characters fun and cute enough to thoroughly enjoy the film, however, although at this point I'm probably the only person who hadn't seen this picture.

","While Nemo certainly entertains it is in no way a classic. In fact, disregarding 'A Bugs Life' I think it is the worst collaboration between Pixar and Disney. While watching the film, I felt that the emotional depth of the events could have been explored a lot more and I also felt that the film was not as funny as other animated films I've seen. To be honest, I felt that there wasn't that much magic around this time. I found Dory to be the most annoying fish ever (I can safely say that she wasn't funny 5 % of the time and annoying 95%) and frankly I felt that the other characters weren't too good either. I mean I liked Nemo and Gill and I thought everything with Crush in it was pretty cool, but in the end I felt that the majority of the characters just were NOT likable and cute enough. Also the film seemed to suffer from the lack of a true villain. All in all, this is an entertaining film, your kids will truly enjoy, but as far as adults are concerned, this one might have fared better if there would have been more magic, better characters and maybe even a shorter running time. Not the MUST-SEE it is made out to be and certainly not one of Disney's best.

Marlin and Dory while on their trek encounter sharks, poisonous jelly fish, sea turtles, and get swallowed by a whale but manage to escape through the blow hole. They get to the harbor by Sidney and with the help from a pelican they get to the office and see Nemo!<br/><br/>This film is co-directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich and Stanton has become a very important director for Pixar. Three things stand out from this film for me and the first is the story that Stanton wrote himself. The journey that Marlin and Dory take to find Nemo is seemingly impossible but with the creative story it does manage to happen and it's a lot of fun to watch. Secondly, rarely has a voice in animated features stood out but what DeGeneres accomplishes here is nothing short of memorable. Her voice not only possesses humor but it also makes the audience feel sorrow and pity for Dory and she gives this animated character a new dimension. How can anyone not laugh when she talks whale and all it's dialects? Thirdly and not the least is the jaw dropping animation that is created for this film and the intricate details that take place are nothing short of brilliant. From the school of swerving jelly fish to the slow emergence of the whale from the darkness this film gives animation a depth and dimension that I'm not sure we have seen before, at least not like this! This is a rare visual delight that belongs to be mentioned with the other classic animated features."

","The destruction of Disney is complete.  Pixar now knows they have the name, talent, and resources to leave Eisner in the dust.  Why else has Disney's conventional animation studio quit?<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>The allegory here is actually hidden pretty well.  Bruce and his rehab pals are the Disney executives, marketers and accountants who determine when they are financially grounded.  They claim they are abandoning old ways for groundbreaking ones, but when the smell of successful formula comes along...you get the idea.<br/><br/>How does this apply?  Look at the Disney ""classics"".  Disney doesn't rerelease them to the public at intervals because they want a new generation to appreciate them.  They time their rereleases for when their new ideas flop and they need fast cash.  After 'Home on the Range' and 'Alamo', expect to see 'Cinderella' back on shelves.<br/><br/>We the public are the seagulls, flying about and selfishly smacking into things.  Don't believe me?  Visit the local Disney store to see the die-hards at work.<br/><br/>Pretty intelligent conceptions for a kids' movie.  Pixar gets away with it because we aren't expecting parody ala 'Shrek.'

","Good but not great. I have finally seen this film after much hype and I have to confess to being a little disappointed; whilst the animation is truly spectacular, the plot is flimsy and the characters (on the whole) lack genuine depth. Of course there are places where you will laugh aloud but the humour is too visual to be truly funny and the schmaltzy sentimentality that seems to pervade 90% of all children's films now made cannot be escaped from here either. To be honest, Dory is a 'one-joke' fish and the surfer-dude gag is lame horse, overdone in comedy to the point of boredom. That said, Albert Brookes is fantastic as Nemo's father and I loved the cameos from Willem Dafoe and Barry Humphries. I was expecting more - 7/10."

","Pixar Studios is one of the world's most exciting and cool film studios. They deliver every single time for the whole family; fun, dramatic, brilliance, entertainment, moral...everything! Before this instalment Pixar has given us TOY STORY 1/2, A BUG'S LIFE and MONSTERS INC. that's all extremely good films! This, last one, FINDING NEMO is just as jolly good!<br/><br/>
We follow Marlin, a clown-fish that's on a desperat look for his only child, Nemo, that as said before is the only survivor after their family was brutally attacked by a barracuda and almost everybody were eaten. Marlin hooks up with another fish that shows herself to have extremely bad memory and forgets thing almost before she's get to know them! Now, these two goes on the search of Nemo, who's lost in the big blue ocean, where there are sharks, bombs, whales, birds and much more!<br/><br/>The story is this time probably the best detail, off course together with the humour that is also brilliant fun! It is packed with funny scenes and the animation is getting more and more stunning, the dialogs are brilliant, everything works as good as it gets! Dozens of genius characters are packed into this story. It is a very choosy movie and it keeps up it's entertainment in a very fine way, the only thing that's something to put anything on is the end, that's really nothing. But the rest of the movie is pure entertainment and is very, very nice watching! <br/><br/>FINDING NEMO's got entire scenes. Like the one with the three sharks that has decided to form a club where they have to promise that they shall not eat other fishes, cause that's cannibalism. Either it's small characters or big, they're all over the place! You laugh a lot, and if it isn't funny, it's just so entertaining or nice made that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. As the movie goes by you feel a small piece of boring in the middle, but FINDING NEMO fixes it with smacking some more characters and keeping the tempo up and keeping the paralell - story interesting with Nemo actually being caught in a aquarium together with other fishes.<br/><br/>STARS: 5/5"

","A cute movie, but I'm surprised at some of the compliments lavished on it.

Not to mention more honestly fantasical stirring stuff like ""Spirited Away"" for that matter.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" also wasn't particularly funny since it's main joke of making fun of someone with short term memory loss grew tired quickly.<br/><br/>I'll admit I was touched when the cute Nemo got reunited with his Dad (of course!), but some aspect of the movie had an overly (to me) manufactured sense to it.

","Allright - the animation and the bgs are cool. Really great pictures of reefs and the marine life. Well, but this is just all. I do not know what film other people have seen, but it must have been a Finding Nemo with a good story and strong characters. The constant action was to much. The beginning of the movie was just horrible - okay, it was not the first time, that characters in Disney-Movies died, but what was good circumnavigated in ""Tarzan"" when the gorilla baby was killed, in Finding Nemo it was a terrible solution to introduce Coral first with a speaking part and kill her instantly after a talk about the Clown-fish-family, the babies and so on. After this it was not a problem to me that Marlin was overprotective and always wanted the best for his disabled son (why did he need a stunted fin at all?). The biggest probem was Dori - If you ever knew someone who sufferd on Alzheimers disease, you will not find this fish funny - shame on you Pixar, this was not so nice, why couldn´t she just be silly? Bruce and his group was funny, but this did not save it. Most scenes where too tough and nothing for younger Kids - nevertheless it was also boring for adults most of the time. Fish are Friends - not Food - well, but what are the human characters in this movie - Monsters? I did not like this. Overfishing of the seas is one thing, caring for an aquarium another.<br/><br/>After this great trailer I expected more from it, better watch good old 2 D Animation next time - there is enough assortment from Studio Ghibli and a lot of Disney Classics to watch."

","I saw this film at a 9:40pm show about a good month after it's release date. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but lo and behold Pixar completely blew me out of the water. Finding Nemo is a beautiful and gorgeous film about a clown fish desperate to look for his adventurous son, who has been captured from the ocean and put in a destist's office fish tank. The adventures along the way never stop Marlin's quest from being accomplished. It's a wonderful story on love, determination, and tenderness delivered with pure wit and magic. <br/><br/>The film's visuals are Acadamy Award worthy. I went to Hawaii last Christmas and went snorkeling in a reef and I instantly thought of this film. Pixar animators captured the colour and life of a tropical reef wonderfully, alive with magic, and beauty. And not many films can do that. And the voices are top notch. Ellen Degeneres is side-splitting as the not-so-smart Dory. Other voices provided by Geoffrey Rush, William Dafoe, and Eric Bana are also nice touches.<br/><br/>Whether you have children or you're a child at heart, Finding Nemo deserves to be bought and added to your DVD collection."
"frogger612","9","1","4","28 November 2004"," 9/10 [with explanation]
","My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>A simple plot line complicated by setbacks, various and sundry meetings, and other assorted stops that make for a thrilling adventure. Blatant and subtle humor and sarcasm abound, creating many memorable scenes and one-liners. The characters are fun and diverse, with many personalities, accenting one another. The fish and other aquatic life have human personalities and intelligence, making them even more lovable.<br/><br/>Being an ocean-lover, I was immediately captivated by the astounding animation. The fish [excepting those done purposely charicaturish] were wonderfully real and colorful, and the entire ocean environment pulled you under, with swaying anemones and beautiful coral. It makes the entire film seem more believable, if that can be achieved at all in a film with talking fish...<br/><br/>'Fish are friends, NOT FOOD'--a memorable quote from the sharks, but a small running theme that seems to be present in many 'talking animal' movies. Kinda like 'Hey, animals have feelings, too.' A parody of human life is portrayed through the fish, with traffic, bullying, school, and even attitudes common among kids. It brings the movie that much closer to home.<br/><br/>Wonderful film for the whole family to enjoy...so grab shell, dude!<br/><br/>--"

","When it comes to animation,I consider myself a devout traditionalist. I will always prefer hand drawn animation over computer any day of the week.However,there is no escaping the fact that this is a well done, entertaining film from Disney and Pixar.Keeping in mind the fact that fish,or anything else under water,can't talk,it's as if we are looking into an aquarium or watching actual undersea footage for the duration of the film.It is excellent family entertainment from start to finish. Pixar and Disney always seem to come up with a magical combination of near perfect animation right down to gestures and eye movements,and perfect voice casting.Ellen Degeneres is particularly hilarious as Dory. What we have here is a new age classic that even traditional,old fashioned people like myself can enjoy."
"bleadsoefootball","1","3","24","3 August 2003"," Over rated
","First of all, let me tell you that I am not someone who just  hates all animated movies. Infact I love The Lion King, and recently the only good Disney animated movies are the one's Pixar has made, so I have nothing against Pixar. Both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are great movies,(especially the first one), and A Bug's Life and Monsters Inc. are definitly a cut above the modern animated movie, but I have to say with disappointment that Finding Nemo is not anywhere near those good movies. Let me start with my biggest complaint, TOO MUCH ACTION! This movie had way too much action for an animated movie. Animated movies aren't about action, but I guess the filmmakers of this movie didn't know that. While I don't mind some action sequences in an animated movie,( like the antalope stampede in Lion King), the action sequences in this movie get a little redundent. I guess the animators are tring to ""wow"" you with the animation, and maybe that would of worked if this was the first movie of it's kind, but now that a lot of these type of movies have come out it's just boring. So then you may ask, what are animated movies about? Two things, laughter and fun, which this film is lacking in. While the other Pixar movies have fun jokes for kids and intelligent jokes for adults this film has none. Sure there maybe a few smart jokes about aquatic creatures in the beginning, but most of the time there is an oppertunity for a joke, they start an action sequence. In my opion, Finding Nemo is probably the most over rated animated movie of all-time."
"The_Void","8","1","5","6 October 2004"," As good as animation gets
","I'm not a big fan of animation. In fact, up until I saw Finding Nemo, I had never seen an animated film that I love. Now that I have seen it, however, that's all changed. With it's vivacious characters, sublime animation and wonderful voice acting; Finding Nemo is a winner all the way. The story follows a young clown fish who is, believe it or not, called Nemo. A shark killed Nemo's mother and siblings, and this has lead his father to be overprotective of his only son. This over-protectiveness leads to rebellion from Nemo - you know what kids are like - and no sooner has his dad told him not to go near the boat, is he tapping the bottom of it with his fin, getting caught by a diver and then being taken to a fish tank in a Sydney dentist's surgery. Of course, his dad isn't going to take this lying down and so begins an epic journey in which he risks life and fin (sorry) to, you guessed it, find Nemo.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the animation in this film is absolutely wonderful. By far and away the best picture that Pixar have ever created, in terms of looks and finished item. The colour scheme for the movie is extremely vibrant, and is therefore aesthetically pleasing for the duration. The film also does a fantastic job of creating it's own world; the sea is a place that is busy and bursting with life. Throughout the film, our hero's are confronted with many challenges and inventive characters - from the sharks that want to stop eating fish, to the forest of jellyfish, down to the escape artist Gill (voiced to perfection by William Dafoe), Finding Nemo has no shortage of vivacity in it. <br/><br/>The film is as impressive as far as substance goes, as it is on the visual front. The characters in Finding Nemo give the film a lot of it's substance and, aside from the fact that they're mostly talking fish, feel very real and almost have a life of their own. In an animated children's film, you don't expect to see characters the likes of what's on show here, but Finding Nemo delivers on the character front too. Our main hero's are great creations; we have Marlin, the father. He's very neurotic and wouldn't be out of place in a Woody Allen film (aside from the fact that he's a talking fish, obviously). His opposite number is a lovable, if forgetful female blue tang fish called Dory. Dory is a brilliant character, she is funny yet never irritating throughout the movie and it is somewhat because of her that the movie plays out so well. These two have a great chemistry on screen, which is better than a lot of the chemistries in 'serious' films. Nemo himself is your typical child  thinks he knows it all, but doesn't. And the film wins realism points for this too. There is a great menagerie for the support cast, which includes turtles, whales, sharks and much more; and all of them are brilliant examples of the kind of imagination that has gone into this film.<br/><br/>There are also several life lessons on display in this film, and those are what lifts Finding Nemo from merely an animation film, to a film that can be respected by adults, as much as by children. The life lessons on offer are; listen to your parents, shown clearly by the fact that this whole fiasco is born of a result of Nemo disobeying his dad. There's also themes, on the other hand, of how overprotecting your children can lead to them viewing you with contempt; and the movie strikes a balance, like it does on the whole, between both sides of the parental structure. Aside from the family based messages, the film also has things to say that certain people and countries would do well to note; first of all, interfering with nature is not nice, and stemming from that is the message that if you have the power, it doesn't mean you have the right to use it; clearly portrayed by the diver that takes Nemo from his home. The fact that the film has all these themes, and still manages to be deliriously entertaining is testament to it's brilliance. Many films that profess substance don't have as much as this little caper does.<br/><br/>Overall, animation doesn't get any better than this. Finding Nemo is fun for children, but there is MORE than enough for adults to enjoy, and I would have no qualms with recommending this movie to anyone."

","Finding Nemo is hands down one of my favorite films of all time, and it's not just one of my favorite animated films, but it's one of my favorite films period. The first thing I'd like to cover is the perfect casting for the voices of the characters. Ellen DeGeneres is so perfect to play Dory. Her voice fits the forgetful fish so well! And it works well in the comedic scenes because Ellen is an accomplished comedian, so it makes scenes like speaking in whale hilarious. Albert Brooks is a good fit to voice marlin the clownfish, fits the overprotective nervous single father role well. And the script has such great skillful writing that it gives the characters hilarious lines when it's supposed to be funny, and sentimental/touching when the moment calls for it. The screenplay really did deserve an academy award nomination. The dialogue really gets deep with the character development. It's not just silliness, the movie really focuses on not only the father-son relationship between marlin and Nemo, but also on Dory and her being alone in life and finding solace and peace in the newfound friendship with both marlin and nemo. Animated movies that will please both children and adults like this one is sure to. It's got a little something in it for everyone to enjoy. It's hard for me to believe that there's people out there who still to this day have not seen finding nemo, but I'm sure they're out there, and if you're one of them, go fix this problem! See this great animated classic! 10/10!"

","And pixar again make an incredible film. Finding Nemo is a movie release in 2003, directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, that won the Oscar to the best animation movie in 2003 too. Is a great comedy for children and for adults who like this types of films too but it also has some sad parts, well not really sad but all hearts that see it melt. The film is about a little crown fish who wants to explore the sea. He lives in a coral reef with his father because his mother died when he had just borned by a shark attack. One day in school, during the travel with the other children on the manta ray, he decides to go to explore. Since that moment, Nemo started an amazing adventure going over the ocean. His father and best friend Dory went for his search and went ahead a dangerous but interesting travel. I will recommend this movie because I think it teach values that maybe we normally forget or don't give much importance. For example, that the family are who really love you, who really will go to find you and who really makes you feel in home when you are with them."

","Great characters, amusing animation, and laugh-out-loud humor. Also, watch for the little skit shown after the credits. www.sineemo.com It's all great stuff that simply must be seen.<br/><br/>Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year- old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.<br/><br/>The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant."

"datautisticgamer-74853","8","0","1","11 September 2016"," Nemo... or omen?
","Finding Nemo is one of those films that defined animation in the 2000's, showcasing the rendering power of the highly advanced computers that were now capable of making more realistic CGI than ever before. With the help of that, the animation is unmatched by any other CGI-based movie in 2003 and even seems strong by 2016 standards with its color and character designs (despite some anatomical errors, such as giving the whale an uvula). Add that to the acting that gives the characters clear personalities and makes them consistently likable, memorable, and relatable. With the combination of adventure/mystery with ""romance"" (Marlin and Nemo trying to develop their relationship as father and son), we get a story that is very well organized despite its complexity. Its drama and humor are quite hit-and-miss, however, as sometimes those scenes happen too fast or deviate too far from the main story for someone to stay that way when the movie is like ""this scene is over, let's go back to the story now."" Like how Dory is, however, we can easily forget those scenes and stick to what everyone takes away from it. It is somewhat inappropriate for families of very young children because it does get loud and mortifying at times (not to mention darkness, such as the death of Coral and Marlin's 399 unnamed children, and the unconfirmed fate of the Tank Gang), so I wouldn't recommend this to toddlers. For everyone else, though, I recommend a view by almost all means. (For those who are curious about the title, I was poking at how Nemo is the reverse of omen, which could also function as foreshadowing or worries that this wasn't a good movie)"
"Tweekums","9","0","1","1 September 2016"," An early classic from Pixar
","Marlin in a timid clown fish living with his son Nemo in an anemone on the Great Barrier Reef that is until Nemo is captured by a diver. Now Marlin must brave the dangers of the open ocean to find Nemo again. He is accompanied by a regal blue tang named Dory; Dory has a problem with her short term memory so quickly forgets everything. Together they find a mask lost by one of the divers and learn that they came from Sydney; on the way there they encounter sharks, an angler fish, jelly fish and a group of sea turtles. Meanwhile Nemo finds himself in the aquarium of a North Sydney dentist. Here he meets a variety of other fish and learns that the dentist intends to give him to his niece as a pet something that means almost certain death given how she treated the previous fish she was given.<br/><br/>This, Pixar's fifth film, got off to a great start, it was darker than I expected but done in a way that shouldn't be too upsetting for even the youngest of viewers. Marlin's wife is killed by a barracuda and every egg except Nemo is lost but none of the details are shown. Once that is over it quickly moves on to introducing young Nemo then his capture by the diver that sets the story in motion. The parallel stories of Marlin, and his new friend Dory, searching for Nemo and Nemo's interaction with the other fish in the aquarium and their plans for his escape are nicely interwoven. Each has plenty of drama; none of it is too scary though and where there are scary moments they are lightened by some comedy such as the trio of sharks that are trying to stop eating fish. The characters may be fish but they still have plenty of personality; especially the central trio of Marlin, Dory and Nemo. Each of these is distinctive; Marlin is timid and pessimistic, Nemo is full of youthful enthusiasm and Dory is cheery despite her memory problems. The secondary characters are fun too; I particularly liked the 'surfer-dude' sea turtles! As one would expect from Pixar the animation is top notch, the undersea environment looks fantastic and the actors who provide the voices to the characters to an excellent job. Overall this is a fun film that, while aimed at a younger audience, can be enjoyed by all ages."

","Finding Nemo is the best movie and animation I've ever seen. Though the main characters of Finding Nemo are sea creatures like fish, turtles and sharks, this story tells the bond of family.people who watch it can understand the feelings of parents for example worries, angry and also receive the ideas of children. Children want to do new things without thinking deeply. At this animation, Nemo plays do same thing like children. I think it tells not the faults of children but the difficulty of relationship between parents and children. Also, it is a good text for pubescent girl and boy, because Finding Nemo teaches how parents love daughter or son. There are many challenges for Nemo and Nemo's father, so people who see this always are exciting. I recommend Finding Nemo."
"andrewnmiller","10","0","1","17 July 2016"," Everything that a family film should be.
","Back in the summer of 03', my mom took me to see Finding Nemo and I remember being wowed by the animation, but now that I'm watching it again, I find myself loving the story, the humor and the morals so much more.<br/><br/>The film opens with a glorious shot of the open ocean with two clownfish named Marlin and Coral appreciating their new home when a barracuda attacks them, knocking Marin out and eating Coral and almost all their eggs expect one that Marlin names Nemo. As the result of this traumatic event, Marin has become overprotective of his son and while on a school field trip, Nemo is kidnapped by scuba drivers. Marin then sets out to find his son, teaming up with a forgetful yet friendly blue tang named Dory. Along the way they encounter vegetarian sharks, a forest of jelly fish, chilled out sea turtles and hungry seagulls.<br/><br/>The story in Finding Nemo uses the same blueprint Toy Story used, where two characters, one being tense and the other being naïve are hurled into a situation and are compelled to undertake this journey through a realm with animals that know a lot more than the humans in the movie are aware of.<br/><br/>Pixar has always done a great job bringing complexly to each of their characters. They aren't made silly just for the sake of being silly. Their habits are often characteristic of an actual emotional disruption in their character. Marlin isn't portrayed as the nervous, restricting father just because the story demands it, we are shown the reason why he is that way in the opening scene. Dory isn't just the jokey sidekick just for the sake of comedy as we are provided a glance of the isolated, terrified character beneath her scales. The movie does give us a unique character in Dory by giving her short-term memory loss and while giving a cartoon character an actual disorder would seem dicey, the filmmakers encompassed it so well that it adds to the final film strengthening the relationships between our main characters. If Dory is the jokey sidekick than Marlin is the one who carries the film and as the film progressed, I was more curious about Marlin's fate and what he would learn. His continuous worrying makes perfect sense with his wife's passing and with his son missing, Marlin is mindful of the amount of endangerment he is in, but Dory is always there to offset Marlin's gloom.<br/><br/>The animation here is gorgeous with the Pixar team really going out of their way to build an underwater world in this film with a vivid coral reef bursting with life while the sequences above the waves have a very photo-realistic look to them while the way the fish move and swim is incredibly realistic and stick to the actual displays of fish movement from Dory swimming in brief bursts to Marlin swimming with his tail, using his fins in an interchanging shape.<br/><br/>The music is imaginative and has a little bit of a dreamlike feature to it like when Marlin loses sight of the boat or at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>When it comes to themes, Finding Nemo has plenty and while some may see the film's theme as insubstantial, I found it to be quite touching. The themes of courage, friendship and letting your kids grow up all hit a nerve with us all because we all have been there at one point in our lives when we've faced the impossible or we've had to let someone go that we love and the film handles each of these themes brilliantly.<br/><br/>When it comes to the voice acting, Finding Nemo definitely delivers in that area. Albert Brooks was destined to play Marlin, portraying him with the utmost sense of paranoia and sadness and yet is quite capable of showing love and compassion for his son when the scene calls for it. Ellen DeGeneres is a laugh riot as Dory, the idiot genus of the film and provides some of the best laughs, but also shows a lot of emotion throughout the film especially the scene where Marlin is about to leave and Dory pleads for him not to go because being around him helps her remember. The scene is heart-breaking and complex and Ellen plays it so well. Alexander Gould succeeds in bringing a lot of personality to the character of Nemo as the film progresses and he grows and learns about what he is capable of doing. Geoffrey Rush is a great addition to the cast as Nigel the pelican and is incredibly hilarious. Willem Defoe is awesome as Gill; giving Nemo the strength to stand on his own fins. Brad Garret is funny as Bloat, the pufferfish; Allison Jenny has some great lines as Peach the starfish, Austin Pendleton, Vicki Lewis and Joe Ranft all have their moments as Bubbles, Deb and Jacques. Bob Peterson is memorable as Mr. Ray. Director Andrew Stanton is awesome as the sea turtle, Crash with his chilled out mannerisms and relaxed way of speaking; it's difficult not to like him. <br/><br/>When it comes to the humor, Finding Nemo has you covered while some family films have a tendency to have humor that only the kids will laugh at or won't get at all. A lot of the humor and jokes are cleverly done such as the group of sharks that resemble an Alcohol Anonymous group which adds some extra hilarity when Bruce catches a whiff of blood and the other two yell ""Intervention!"", Dory attempting to speak whale or mistaking Marlin for her conscience make for some extremely laugh-out-loud moments.<br/><br/>I really don't have anything more to that hasn't already been said about this movie. It's just perfect on every level. So, if you haven't seen this yet, go see it now. It's a true marvel and it might make you teary-eyed in a few scenes."

","Pixal most often presents us their great animated feature films and 'Finding Nemo' is no exception, rather is one of the best movies by them. Being one of a huge fan of animated movies myself, I certainly have enjoyed watching every second of the movie. The stunning animation, flawless story-line, and amusing humor will hardly make anyone not love the movie.<br/><br/>Nemo (Alexander Gould), the only son that remains out of the 400 eggs laid by Marlin's (Albert Brooks) wife, is very excited about going to school for the very first time. But Marlin is very overprotective of his son and is still not ready to introduce Nemo to little more diverse or as per Marlin's though more dangerous than much safer home. Meanwhile, Nemo is more than ready to go to the school. During school, when Marlin tries to forbid his son to go to the unsafe areas, Nemo, who has been already mad at his father disobeys and go little too far and ends up getting caught by a human. Thus begins the journey of Marlin to find his son Nemo.<br/><br/>No journey is exciting without a friend alongside. So the movie definitely provides one to Marlin, a sweet innocent friend dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss, on the way to catch the boat that took Nemo. They begin the journey together, which is full of adventure and thrill. Along with the risk of the vast ocean, Marlin also encounters the good side of the ocean. Those helping fins of the sea turtles, never separating company of dory, Nemo's tank buddies helping him get out of the aquarium and even the bad sharks trying to be nice with their little club with the slogan ""Fish are friends not food"" are some examples. The modern world of humans actually lacks these qualities and ""Finding Nemo"" definitely remains us about those duties.<br/><br/>Disney always delivers the stories that tell the kids to be nice and helpful. This movie, however tells both kids and adults to be as such. Not forgetting to mention about the profound love between a father and his son, a simple story-line about the venture of a father to find his beloved son teaches us a lot."

","This is one of the best Pixar films ever. Finding Nemo is a story about family and encouragement. We also get a lesson in life from a very special blue tang fish. Just keep swimming. It was very sad at the beginning when that barracuda ate Marlin's wife Coral and all their babies except for Nemo of course and Nemo had a damaged fin which is very small. Ever since then Marlin became very overprotective of Nemo and Nemo became mad with him and swims out into the open ocean to this boat and was taken by these divers and he's taken to this fish tank in a dentist office in Sydney, Australia. There Nemo meets an interesting group of fish including this fish named Gill who tried to get out of the dentist office so many times. We also kind of know the origin how he got that scar on his side and fin. Meanwhile Marlin meets this blue tang fish named Dory who suffers from short term memory loss and they run into sharks named Bruce, Anchor and Chum who were vegetarians until Bruce goes savage after smelling Dory's blood and then Marlin and Dory run into this angler fish and they soon learn the location of where Nemo is after reading the address on the strap of the divers mask and then get directions from a school of fish who do impressions and then go over a trench and bounce through a forest of jellyfish. Then they go through the East Australian Current riding with a group of sea turtles and then go inside a whale and get all the way to Sydney. Meanwhile Gill and Nemo almost make the perfect plan for escape, until the dentists daughter Darla who kills fish out of bad behavior comes and Nemo was about to become her birthday present until Nemo plays dead in order to escape. Then Marlin, Dory and Nigel come in and started a scene in order to rescue Nemo until the dentist chases them out and Darla starts shaking Nemo in the bag until Gill stops her and sends Nemo down the drain which leads to the ocean. Meanwhile Marlin was sad cause he thought Nemo was actually dead and then Dory finds Nemo and brings him to Marlin and then Dory gets caught in a fish net with other fish. Then Nemo comes up with a plan in order to rescue Dory and that was to have all the fish swim down and he lead them down while Marlin was telling them to swim down and it worked. All the fish and Dory were free and then Marlin, Dory and Nemo go back home to their reef and Marlin now knew that Nemo could be responsible.

"quinimdb","9","0","1","17 June 2016"," Finding Nemo
","""Finding Nemo"" is one of the crowning achievements of Pixar. It's exhilarating, genuinely funny (even for mature audiences), sweet, and, most importantly, it's got a great message. Minor Spoilers.<br/><br/>The film starts in one of Pixars most heartbreaking openings where Marlin, a clown fish, comes back to his anemone to find his wife gone (dead, but it doesn't show her dead, obviously) and the only surviving egg of one of the hundreds of eggs that there used to be. He names him Nemo, a name his wife suggested before she died. His ""lucky"" fin is a little messed up, but Marlin is determined not to lose Nemo to the point of being over protective. And, ironically, this over protectiveness is what gets Nemo taken away from Marlin. Marlin is so overprotective that Nemo ends up wanting to be away from him every chance he gets. This means that when Marlin swims all the way to catch up with Nemo's class on his first day of school, Nemo has no problem doing something very dangerous just to spite him. This results in Nemo being captured, and so Marlin's journey begins.<br/><br/>The first thing Marlin learns is that the sea is a friendlier place than he expected. He meets Dory, an optimistic, but pretty annoying fish with short term memory loss. She begins to follow him around and they meet sharks. But the sharks don't want to hurt them. In fact, they bring them to a meeting in which they show that they are trying to stop eating fish. Of course, one of the sharks tries to eat them, but only after he smells blood. Soon enough, Marlin learns that Dory, a fish with memory loss, can read, and she even remembered what she read this time. Soon we learn that help presents itself to him in ways he wouldn't expect, and he must keep an open mind to find his son again. Thank God he has Dory to do this for him, and all of the other kind voices along the way, including a pack of fish doing impressions, a surprisingly friendly pelican, and a sea turtle named Crush, who teaches him that you must let your child figure out the world for themselves to a certain extent, and then they learn not only how to get back to their father, but why they want to. Just like Dory, for a child, their home is where their father is (or in this case, Marlin) and vice versa.<br/><br/>In the climatic moment of the film, the main points are stressed that the characters have learned along the way. First of all, you cannot do everything alone, hence the fish all swimming downward together. Second of all, you cannot give up no matter what, even when it seems hopeless, as it has for both Nemo and Marlin many times throughout the film, hence just keep swimming. Third of all, Marlin learns to trust his son, and others along with him, and this is only reinforced in the final scene of the film in which rather than Nemo waking up Marlin, Marlin wakes up Nemo to school. He also races him to the class, and finally, Nemo swims back to Marlin to tell him he loves him, rather than Marlin swimming to catch up with Nemo's to scold him for something he almost did."

","Okay, this is going to be a hard movie to talk about. This movie is the closest thing to universally loved that you can get and many other better reviewers have already reviewed this. With that out of the way, it's about time I review a Pixar movie. It also happens to be favorite Pixar movie and it just so happens to be getting a sequel that at the time of writing, is coming tomorrow for me. I love pretty much everything about this movie from beginning to end. Well, my one big problem with the movie, which is borderline nitpicking, is the first like 3 minutes. So for the 5 people who haven't seen this movie, it opens with a happy couple who are expecting kids. They act all sweet for a bit and then a barracuda comes out of nowhere and eats the mother and the 400 unborn children. You now for kids! Jokes aside, this scene is way too intense for even me today. Every time I watch the scene, I burst out crying and last time that happened was in a class full of preteens. Yeah, this is a personal problem but it's thankfully a small problem and the scene that follows is absolutely beautiful. Thankfully, the rest of the scene is a little tamer but still very emotionally involving. The story itself is fairly simple but emotionally charged. It's a very relatable situation even if the viewer isn't an adult. The thing that helps, is every character is memorable and relatable, especially my favorite of the bunch, Dory. There's a reason Finding Dory is a thing outside of profit. It's because Dory was the most loved character in the whole movie. She is funny, sweet, fun-loving and of course she forgets things very easily. I always loved that aspect of her character and I relate to her a lot. I also have to give a shout out to the underrated ""tank gang."" Each of them have very unique and fun personalities and each are distinguishable and love-able. I also have to marvel over the animation in this movie. The water looks like real water! Yet, the cartoony characters don't look or feel out of place in the very realistic ocean. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I can only hope that the sequel will be good."

He is overprotective, yes. However, we know that he has suffered the loss of his wife and all his kids (with the exception of Nemo). He only wants to protect his son, but that leads to a flaw. He is so busy thinking about protecting Nemo, he doesn't understand the impact his fear has on Nemo. This isn't protecting Nemo. Now Nemo is taken, and soon, he learns his mistakes, and becomes a perfect dad (at least from the ending we saw. Now Finding Dory will show us how Marlin has progressed). That is the writer's challenge. To create a truthful change in character from opening to ending. <br/><br/>The movie is fun. The movie has its fair share of humor, in balance with drama. In addition to being a comedy-drama, Finding Nemo is an adventure movie. The movie does entertain as an adventure and as a comedy. So, we have entertaining scenes which progress the character's development. Scenes include the encounter with the sharks, the jellyfish escape, and the turtle ride. Each scene helps progress Marlin's character development, while being fun to watch. <br/><br/>This leads us to the whale scene, where Marlin is put to the test. If he doesn't let go of his fear, he will die. If he does let go of his fear, he may die as well, but there is a chance of survival. The actions committed by Marlin and the consequences shape Marlin's growth as a character. <br/><br/>Then we see his growth in the climax, where he must let Nemo go. He is afraid at first, but he learns how to let go, and lets Nemo go, resulting in a happy ending. Nemo shows what he is capable of, and that is a true summary of the events of the film, highlighting the growth of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Nemo has his own parallel story to Marlin's, and that shows us the impact of Marlin's overprotective parenting. Now, the environment he is in encourages him to be braver than he is. This is beneficial as it helps the audience understand the flaw of Marlin's character, and also helps build to the climax. When we see Nemo being brave in the ocean, we know he can do it, as we have seen him do it before. The writer's, however, will make the movie entertaining, and not just show character development. They set up stakes, in the form of Darla. The clock is ticking, and Nemo needs to escape. The stakes are serious, and that is what engages us. What you see here, and throughout Finding Nemo, are layers. There are entertaining surfaces, but peel them off, and you will see rich character development. <br/><br/>Dory is a regal blue tang who suffers from short term memory loss. She is calm, providing a contrast to the fearful Marlin. While providing a lot of laughs, she is a huge part of helping Marlin grow. This is shown best during the whale scene, where the contrast of Dory and Marlin is highlighted. He is scared and cynical about the whale, while Dory is relaxed and optimistic. This allows Marlin to understand his flaws, and see the other side of the coin. He takes a leap of faith, resulting in survival. Dory is a true supporting character. She is a part of the script to help Marlin's grow as a character, while having a distinct voice of her own. She has her flaws. Her optimism lands Marlin and her in trouble, but that helps Marlin. <br/><br/>Truly, it is the well-written screenplay which stands out the most here. The screenplay deservedly won an Oscar nomination. The writers have a flawed protagonist, and develop him through a thoroughly engaging plot. Finding Nemo is my favorite Pixar movie, and truly why I love the movie boils down to the writing. <br/><br/>For a larger view on the writing of Finding Nemo, I suggest you watch this video by Darren Foley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH5jQ2XcNUA, and this video by Darious Britt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM9Ch6Q6Xt0. These two videos are excellent analysis of the Finding Nemo screenplay. I also suggest you watch the movie's director Andrew Stanton's TED Talk about storytelling (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDwieKpawg) for a better understanding about the Finding Nemo screenplay."

","""Finding Nemo"" is a movie about a family of fish that are living their lives in the ocean escaping danger. These fish are mostly safe from everything around them as long as they are cautious, but sometimes that open ocean is an extremely dangerous place from these fish. Especially for Nemo considering the fact that he is a kid and still has a lot to learn about surviving in the ocean. Nemo goes to school and disregards his dad's rules. He is supposed to stick with his class and stay away from the open ocean. Though Nemo with his curiosity doesn't listen to his dad and ends up getting himself into trouble. Nemo finds himself on a fishing ship and ends up in an aquarium with a bunch of other captured fish. His dad goes on a quest to find Nemo while Nemo tries to escape.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a classic movie and is seen by most children. Personally this movie is an interesting movie and shows how close family is. Though it also reflects the moral that children should listen to their parents and listen to the rules that are applied by anyone. This movie is definitely a great movie for all ages and is enjoyed by many around the world. Overall I enjoyed this movie and I'm sure other people who have watched this movie feel the same way."

","The movie I chose to do a film review is Finding Nemo. In the movie it starts off as a couple expecting children. The couple lives in the bottom of the ocean and they are fish. One day everyone in the ocean is fleeing away and before you know it a shark comes by the babies and the woman runs out there to protect them. The shark eats the mom and the babies.<br/><br/>The father is so hurt that the shark has taken his family but he realizes that there is one child left. So he protects that child and names it Nemo. Nemo eventually gets older wants to go to school and his father is so afraid of the ocean he shelters Nemo. Eventually as Nemo gets captured from a diver the father goes through so much to find him with the help of a friend he meets along the way by the name of Dory. This would have never happened loosing Nemo if his father wasn't so hard on him. The morale of the story is to let your child learn don't punish them for you reason. You can protect them but don't over shelter them.<br/><br/>In the movie you get to see many view points from the different angles. It helps you to feel the mood. It helps you to feel like you're there in the movie when the whole movie takes place under water. It also helps when the fish are swimming, they swim fast and the music goes along with the effect to make you feel as if you're there. The different angles were helpful in <br/><br/>Film Review on IMDb The ocean and helped us to see what was coming before the characters did for instance when the shark was coming because everyone was running or when the diver took Nemo.<br/><br/>In the movie the lighting helped you visualize what happened at night and what happened in the morning. It also helps you to understand when it was a sad time the ocean would suddenly get dark. When it would became a happy time in the movie you could see the sun rays shining in the ocean. The lighting helps create the mood. The lighting also helps you to feel what the characters feel."

","I have a lot of memories with this movie. First movie I ever bought a DVD of. Finding Nemo is fantastic.<br/><br/>No matter how many times I watch this movie, I noticed something different that catches my attention and rattles my eyes with glee.<br/><br/>For an example, I like the part where Marlin (Nemo's son) is sent to find Nemo and other aquatic creatures would share Marlin's story of going all the way to Australia to rescue him, with transitions that change with impeccable timing with great music, that fits pretty much every single scene of the movie, quite well. <br/><br/>You can tell a lot of care was put into this movie, even adults will enjoy Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>The one thing I also give this movie credit for was that there is some continuity and an ACTUAL story to it. A lot of children's movies lack this.<br/><br/>For an example, when Marlin is on his way to Australia to rescue Nemo, all the humans and fish creatures Marlin meets SPEAK Australian which they should be. A well thought out plot like this even brings more charm to Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>At 90 or so minutes, the movie clocks in at a perfect time. It's not too short nor, is it too long for kids to get bored of.<br/><br/>A great, great movie. 9/10. Would give it a 10 if it wasn't for the fact that you have like me, seen it at least five or so times. You have had to see this movie multiple times. It comes on Cartoon Network, ABC Family and so on and so forth, quite often."

","This movie is so adorable. I love it so much, it just makes me so happy every time I see it.<br/><br/>Nemo, a young clown fish, goes on the adventure of a lifetime. He lives in a coral reef with his Dad, Marlin. Sadly, Nemo's mother died before he was born. He was eaten by a shark. So Marlin is very over protective. When Marlin finally decided that Nemo could go to school, Nemo goes out of the reef, out into what they call ""The Drop"", which is the dangerous open sea. Nemo wanted to prove to his new friends that he wasn't scared. He goes and touches a boat, which the kids call a butt, very funny by the way, and he gets captured by scuba divers. Nemo then gets sold to a man who owns a dental clinic in Sydney, Australia. Nemo meets some new friends in the tank, and needs their help to get home to his Dad. Meanwhile, Marlin is going on a wild ride with new friend, Dory, who can't remember anything. They travel around the ocean in hopes of finding Nemo. Hence the title of the movie. Eventually, they find each other and it's a sweet and touching moment.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10."
"baxleyp","10","0","1","30 September 2014"," World Class
","Finding Nemo is Pixar's greatest movie to date. Everything in the movie is meticulously chosen to add to the atmosphere and send a great message to the viewer. This movie has been out for over ten years and people still recognize all of the characters from it instantly, showing how memorable the movie really was. This movie was one of the first animated films that really wowed people in terms of scope and execution since the first animated Disney films. The key factors that made finding Nemo an instant classic were the brilliantly chosen voice actors, and the atmosphere that the movie was able to bring to the ocean.<br/><br/>Every character in the movie is written well, but it takes more than a good script to make a good movie. All of the voice actors create their own memorable characters that fit each one perfectly. Brad Garrett as Bloat the puffer fish and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory are the two standouts. Every actor delivers in this movie, but these two fish seem to mesh with the actors even better than the rest. Dory really feels like a lovable idiot and Bloat has a voice that matches his name perfectly. These are two parts that are impossible to imagine a better actor being matched up with them. The combination of great actors with great animation makes each character come alive, even ones that are seen for only a few seconds as the quote points out. Nemo' schoolteacher, Mr. Ray, is an example of this. He is a stingray, and thus able to use his sides to wrap up students and protect them, as well as take them around the ocean to learn. The fish fits the character as well as the actor, Bob Peterson. The fish was picked to fill a specific role in the movie that the creature would be good at, making everything seem more believable. Even though he was only seen at the start and very end of the movie, he is a memorable character because both Mr. Ray and Mr. Peterson fit the role so well. The animation helps not only the actors and characters, but also the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Pixar are well known for their animating chops, but they are legendary for their ability to use the skills effectively to capture the best atmosphere. Finding Nemo pushed the limits of all animated movies and looks better than most movies today. The ocean is vast and filled with thousands of different sea creatures and obscure locations. In Finding Nemo the water can feel like any number of things, intimidating when in the minefield, claustrophobic in the middle of the ""jellies"", and safe when in the sea anemone. The ocean itself is represented perfectly in Finding Nemo because it changes throughout the movie. Everything in the story relates back to the ocean, stressing its importance even further. The movie also uses an animal as the atmosphere. Marlin and Dory are nearly eaten by a whale, and instead of making the whale a character it is made into a part of the scenery. It doesn't talk or even really try to eat Dory and Marlin, they just so happen to be unlucky enough to be amongst the krill that the whale is eating. The inside of the whale is like a hurricane with water and huge bristles that send Dory and Marlin everywhere. The duo has no effect on the whale whatsoever, but the whale has a huge impact on Marlin and Dory, since it nearly kills them. This is a great scene because it is not only well animated but relates back to the story perfectly. The ocean is dangerous and the movie wants to show that, it also wants to show how small and seemingly insignificant two random fish are in the ocean, thus making their long journey seem even more impressive. Other perils in the movie are also based solely on the scenery, the jellies are basically just a bunch of obstacles, the East Australian Current takes Marlin and Dory to Sydney, and the minefield and ship are both major obstacles that don't move on their own. These are all dangerous things that are attributed to the ocean based on how they are presented in the film. This creates a sense that the ocean itself is the interesting place, not just each individual stop along the way.<br/><br/>Yes, the story is good, but all great movies are great at the seemingly small things. Finding Nemo executes the acting and atmosphere so well that the story could have been awful yet it would still have been a very enjoyable movie simply because it had so much polish. This movie is so well animated that it still looks great after ten years, imagine how different movies from twenty years ago looked when Finding Nemo was released. Finding Nemo is a master class in filmmaking from one of the greatest studios in the business."

","If it isn't the vibrant colours of the Great Barrier Reef or the fantastic personification of the fishy characters that give the movie its amazing rating from yours truly, it would be the wonderful story line of the Daddy fish (Marlin) searching for the Baby fish (Nemo) building fabulous friendships along the way and giving the audience a fair education of the aquatic life surrounding Australia... <br/><br/>This movie is one the most heartwarming journeys i have ever witnessed through Pixar animation, Cudos to you ""Disney Pixar""...

"Angels_Review","8","0","1","5 April 2014"," A cute family video
","This is actually a rather nice looking show. The story line is cute and actually rather funny in places. The whole cast of characters are fun and entertaining, starting with Marlin. Marlin is the overprotective father figure that goes out on a search to find his young boy. In a sense, this show is not just about Nemo's self discovery but Marlin's as well. He learns to ease up a bit, and how to have fun with the help of a Pacific Regal Blue Tang, Dory. Dory is one of the most interesting characters they have in the show and her childish way of looking at the world is rather refreshing and somewhat therapeutic in a way. She helps Marlin a lot though she doesn't remember much.<br/><br/>The characters within the fish tank aren't really any better. All of them have problems with being in a fish tank, pretty much, they all went crazy including one that came from the sea as well. There are so many characters in this show that they do get a little overwhelming but not all the characters actually stay for very long.<br/><br/>The animation is really well done. The colors are bright and wonderful just like the reef. You can even sometimes see the details in the scales as well as the colors of all the different types of fish. Most of them look real and then some look a little cartoonier, probably to have them stick out. This show was created for children but the love and attention they put into this makes it feel like it's the real ocean. The only problem I see is that some of the ways the human's are done look very hap hazard. It's not really all that flattering.<br/><br/>The music and voices are pretty perfect. The music fits the mood that is happening and they don't just brake out in song like a lot of other movies I have watched. When they do, it's not that bothersome. It's normally done like if someone just wanted to sing at that point, the really obnoxious type of song."
"paul2001sw-1","6","0","1","18 February 2014"," Vanilla Pixar
","Many of the earliest screen savers were of fish tanks - so perhaps it's fitting than an early computer-animated movie should have told a story of tropical fish. Some of Pixar's movies have had dark, poetic sides to them; but 'Finding Nemo' is a straight up children's adventure, with a whole shoal of colourful characters, a fast pace, and a positive, upbeat message. A few things made me smile but to me this is vanilla Pixar; there's a one dimensional story here, with little underlying depth, and the gorgeous animation is something we have come to take for granted from this studio. Compare, for example, the opening of this film and that of their later movie 'Up'; they cover similar ground, but the later film's treatment is altogether more poignant and adult."
"classicsoncall","8","0","1","19 January 2014"," ""Don't worry, all drains lead to the ocean.""
","When I was a kid my circle of friends included a guy we nicknamed Nemo because his last name (he was Polish) had an abundance of c's and z's in it that made pronunciation impossible. That really doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but until ""Finding Nemo"" came along, I had never given my friend Nemo's nickname a second thought.<br/><br/>I have to say, the picture was pretty clever with it's characters and dialog. When little Nemo wound up in Australia I was asking myself how the writers were going to pull off the long shot of having father Marlin track him down and get him back to the ocean. They actually did it in a way that seemed believable enough even though you have to stretch your sensibilities. You could say the same about some serious dramas that are being made today.<br/><br/>This one is tailor made for kids young and old and it's message of persevering against all odds is a valuable one. There's also some slick inside jokes if you're quick enough to keep up the pace; the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie still has me cracking up."
"Laakbaar","9","0","1","14 January 2014"," Entertaining
","This latter-day Disney movie is a classic after only ten years. The plot is straightforward: father loses son; father goes on quest to find son; father finds son.<br/><br/>The two complementary underlying messages are ""give your kids room to grow"" and ""listen to your father because he loves you"". There are some serious moments in the film.<br/><br/>The real star of this movie is the incredible animation. The artists at Pixar have brought the reef to life, infusing the animations with eye-catching colour, light and movement.<br/><br/>Another hallmark of the animation is the charming anthropomorphism of the underwater creatures. The characters are all denizens of a rich underwater kingdom. Poor Dory almost steals the show, but several other characters also stand out.<br/><br/>The third underlying message (and one that is sorely needed) is that we should love this beautiful world and do what we can to protect it. Sadly, it looks now like we'll lose it all in a few generations.<br/><br/>A clever, funny, entertaining Disney film. Not just for kids. This movie is considered to be the 10th best Disney animated film, but I think it should be rated higher. I think it's worth about 8.5, but I'm willing to round it up for now."
"Stompgal_87","9","0","1","2 October 2013"," A vibrant underwater adventure with a simple yet engaging story
","As a fan of films and TV shows set underwater, this one appealed to me without doubt. I saw this film at the cinema 10 years ago while I was going through a difficult stage and I enjoyed it then but initially found the jellyfish scene frightening (even though I was 16 at the time). Nowadays I find the film more enjoyable than I did on my first viewing.<br/><br/>The underwater scenery is vibrantly coloured as are the majority of sea creature characters that are also realistically designed. A lot of the dialogue is memorable and it has parts that cleverly link to other scenes, have hints of wit and an element of Chinese whispers when the message of Marlin looking for Nemo is passed through several sea creatures and reaches Nigel. I also liked how the story alternated between Marlin's search and Nemo's antics in the fish tank in the dentist. One thing I noticed for the first time today is that Bruce and his shark friends are in a group that is almost like Alcoholics Anonymous and similar groups. The story is straightforward yet captivating with some funny moments such as bubbles rising to the surface upon the explosion of the underwater mines, thus making a pelican thinking another had farted, Dory speaking whale, the seagulls' constant cries of ""Mine! Mine! Mine!"" and Marlin's interrupted attempts at telling others the mollusc and sea cucumber joke until he finally succeeds towards the end. I also spotted a couple of pop culture references such as the scene where Bruce chases Marlin and Dory and says, ""Here's Brucie!"" that pays homage to 'The Little Mermaid' and 'The Shining' while one fish shown during the message about Nemo being passed on looked like Flounder. The background music was better in the first half than the second half but I liked the use of the screeching violin music from 'Psycho' when Darla enters the dentist and the end- credits song 'Beyond the Sea' by Robbie Williams. As for the voice acting, Albert Brooks played a typical father figure as Marlin, Ellen DeGeneres was comical as Dory while Alexander Gould was cute as Nemo, I liked the late Joe Ranft's French accent for Jacques and John Ratzenberger was recognisable as the School of Fish that direct Marlin and Dory to Sydney (I also liked the shapes they made to form fish, an arrow, the EAC and the Sydney Opera House).<br/><br/>Out of all the CGI underwater films I've seen ('Shark Tale,' 'The Reef,' 'A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventure' and this one), 'Finding Nemo' is my favourite and a sheer delight to watch. 9/10."

"groves11","9","0","1","5 May 2013"," Personal Review
","The general plot of the story is about Marlin (Albert Brooks), who is accompanied by a rather odd fish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), scouring the seemingly endless ocean for his lost son Nemo (Alexander Gould) who was unfortunately captured by divers and taken away.<br/><br/>The theme of the movie essentially seems to be overcoming your fears. I feel this is the theme of the film because Marlin, even at the beginning of the movie, seems very nervous and fearful of the oceans dangers. Before Nemo was captured Marlin had always tried to protect him due to the tragic loss of his beloved Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) and the entirety of their eggs (aside from Nemo). I feel this derived a rebellious nature in Nemo which may have led to his capture in the first place. Getting back on track, Marlin overcame his fears of the ocean by battling sharks, avoiding deadly jellyfish, withstanding a barrage of exploding undersea mines, riding the EAC (East Australian Current), and various other acts of bravery and courage.<br/><br/>By the end of the film I found that Marlin and Nemo had formed a stronger bond as father and son because they had realized each other's point of view and mixed it with their own. Nemo realized how unsafe things could be through him initially getting caught and when he tried to block the tank filtration system and kind of ""tightened"" up to safety. Marlin, who overcame his fears of the dangerous sea, sort of loosened up and wasn't so uptight with Nemo after he was back safely.<br/><br/>There are many movies that share the general theme of Finding Nemo. One, ironically, is Little Nemo Adventures in Slumberland. This film is particularly old and the theme is a little more elaborate, but I chose it both for significance of theme and irony. Basically for Little Nemo the theme also refers to overcoming fear. If you don't mind looking past the finding a fish compared to stopping a dark ""Pandora's box"" unleashing at least.<br/><br/>Two techniques that were used that I am particularly fond of are the color and sound. I may be a little bias towards Disney/Pixar and THX but nonetheless I like how they work. The scene that really caught my attention however was Nemo's first day of school. Getting on the teacher's back heading out to ""explore"" in that first person view of the reef really made me admire the beauty of the actual reef. The vivid and assorted vibrant colors captured the reality the film was trying to portray.<br/><br/>The scene that I felt had the greatest sound impact and kind of threw every effect together at once, for the most part, was at the harbor. When Marlin and Dory found their way into the Sydney harbor I was bombarded with spectacular sea/harbor sounds ranging from buoy bells to waves crashing elegantly off the stationed boats to the seagulls cawing (not the ""MINE!?"" seagulls either). This scene was so vivid and real for me that I could almost feel the breeze through my hair and taste the salt in the air.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the film and even though my insight on the theme of overcoming fear may be different than many or most viewers I believed it was a significant point to make."

","Clownfish Marlon is over-protective of son Nemo. Devastated when Nemo is caught by a fisherman, Marlon goes on a journey to rescue him, in the company of forgetful Dory.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is one of those Pixar films which was a revelation in terms of groundbreaking visuals coupled with real heart - Marlon's journey is not just a physical one, and all the characters have personal development arcs to match the very best of those enjoyed by real-life actors in live action movies. The underwater visuals are simply stunning, the script is packed with humour, action, excitement and emotion, and the voice work is great (with Ellen DeGeneres' delightfully loopy Dory stealing the honours). This film is as good now as it was on release.<br/><br/>Sadly, I have to add that, yet again, Pixar's 3D retooling adds very little. I was expecting great things - the possibilities offered by those grand underwater vistas suggested very effective 3D, but much of the time the 3D reworking was barely noticeable.<br/><br/>Still a great film, though."

","I love this movie so much. It's the best ever! It probably is my favorite movie of all time. So adorable, beautiful, and incomparable. I'm happy for Finding Nemo 2 even though The Incredibles is the only Pixar movie needing a part 2. I hope Finding Nemo 2 is as good or even better than Finding Nemo 1, although Pixar needs to make a part 2 for the movies really needing them, and it only appears that The Incredibles needs it because we didn't get to know what happened after the ending of The Incredibles since that movie did not have a perfectly happy ending. However, back to Finding Nemo, it is such a great movie. I always will love it. Best movie ever made!"

","Finding Nemo wasn't one of my favourite Pixar films when I first saw it but with every passing watch my enjoyment of it increases.<br/><br/>First of all visually it's stunning. Should it ever be re-released in 3D it would be quite a treat because the way the ocean is created on screen is magic.<br/><br/>Like all the best Pixar films (and probably any kids film) it appeals to both adults and children with a simple story that is overflowing with warm characters (with a few famous voices thrown in with good measure) and the ability to make you laugh and cry. Pixar really do excel at making quality family films that I have no doubt will be entertaining audiences for many a generation to come.<br/><br/>I have my doubts about the proposed Finding Nemo 2 but it's ultimately a case of 'in Pixar we trust'."
"jose-cruz53","7","0","1","8 January 2013"," Solid storytelling from Pixar
","Pixar has always been masters of their craft: making excellent children's movies. Indeed, this is among their top 5 best, perhaps, as it not only deals with subjects that interest children but also seeks to teach their parents something very important: to not overprotect their children since the kids need to tackle the world in order to grow, even if they are under some risk, the fact is that the parents need to accept the dangers of the world and that it is impossible to protect their children absolutely.<br/><br/>The main character of the movie is an overprotective father who lost 99% of his unborn children (i.e. eggs, since he is a fish) and his wife due to the attack of a very large and powerful predator fish. Traumatized by the experience he overprotects his only remaining offspring but when he loses his child he embarks on an adventure to find him again, hence the name of the movie."

","Since the day I saw this movie it has always stood as my all time best animation and my all time Disney favorite. It is funny, entertaining and captivating as we watch a father clown fish Marlin (Albert Brooks) is thrown into a state of desperation to save his son and he goes through all form of adventures in his dying need to make sure he keeps his promise of letting nothing happen to him, his son Nemo (Alexander Gould). Nemo was captured by underwater divers, and taken to Sydney. So Marlin (Nemo's Father) went on an unwilling adventure to save his son, with him was Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a fish who suffers from short term memory loss.<br/><br/>There is not much to add but this is a classic that all should see, not because of the high ratings and the accolades and records that it holds, but for the gentle breeze of a cool soothing story that can only bring smiles to the face of any viewer.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Andrew Stanton (WALL-E 2008, the Toy Story trilogy), this computer animated master piece was at its time the highest grossing animated film, and the 3rd highest of all time behind Toy Story 3 and Lion King both of which are also Disney movies, it also holds the record as the highest selling DVD of all time, selling over 40 Million copies by 2006. It also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature during its time and the American Film Institute named it the tenth greatest animated film ever made during their Top 10 Animated Films of all time.<br/><br/>The movie idea is based on a series of experiences by the director Andrew Stanton. As a child, he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, believing that the fishes were gotten from the ocean and wanted to go back. Also when he took his son for a walk in the park his overprotective nature made him feel he lost a father-son experience. He also stated (to the National Geographic Magazine) that the idea of using clownfish as his leads, came from when he saw a picture of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone.<br/><br/>Funny thing is that Stanton casted Ellen to play Dory the forgetful fish when he said he saw Ellen DeGeneres in her show Ellen ""change the subject five times before finishing one sentence"" (quoting Stanton from Finding Nemo Commentary)<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is one movie that you just sit and enjoy as the graphics are good, the story is engaging and there seems to be something happening at every point in time; from the strike of the barracuda, till the reunion and eventual happy ending of a father and son tale Finding Nemo is more than just a cartoon is a needed experience, a necessity for all movie watchers of all kind.<br/><br/>Disney plans a sequel to be released in 2016, with Stanton coming back as writer and probably director.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","It's 2012 now and I just saw this movie for the first time. The 3D release caught my attention and reminded me of this little gem I'd heard so much about.<br/><br/>I did NOT see the 3D version, just the usual one. I was expecting it to be relatively poorly animated compared to today's standards but boy was I mistaken! This is the most beautiful animation movie I have seen so far. Each scene is colorful and breathtaking, which completely blew me away. Animation is excellent to the smallest detail and now I very much doubt that having been made today it would be more beautiful. <br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, I can't help but compare it to the last few animation movies seen: Brave, which I truly disliked; and Madagascar 3, which was better and funnier than expected. But Finding Nemo is way better than any of these and I daresay it's my favorite animation film.<br/><br/>I especially admire the ingenious solutions found for different parts of the movie ingenious, since as a viewer you might see some difficulties as impossible to overcome by some little fishies. <br/><br/>I like how the characters have unique personalities and all are essentially good. The 'bad' guys are mostly voiceless (mindless) but this does not stop the movie from keeping you on your toes. <br/><br/>All in all, a beautiful experience, a smart plot and nice individual characters you'll find yourself rooting for. A high quality animation that still looks amazing today. Go (re)watch it."

","Finding Nemo is an animated film that adds on to the list of masterpieces created by Pixar. Although the movie is known for its humorous characters, comedic scenes, and terrific underwater animation, Finding Nemo provides emotional insight to both children and adults of what is most important in life—family.<br/><br/>What separates Finding Nemo from most animated films is the fact that it doesn't connect to just children; it is a movie in which the entire family can enjoy and learn something from. Looking at Marlin (father of Nemo), this movie can relate to adults in that it highlights the cliché quote of ""never give up"" as an extremely important motto to live off by, especially when speaking about something that is very important to you. When looking at Nemo, children are able to realize that during a struggle, it is important to stay positive in order to succeed and receive something good out of a situation. By attracting and connecting to people of all ages, this is why Finding Nemo was not only one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time, but also THE best-selling DVD of all time.<br/><br/>The producers of Finding Nemo also did an excellent job in choosing the voices for the characters. Dory, another main character, plays a quirky fish who adds a vital role in the comedy part of the movie. Choosing Ellen DeGeneres, a well known comedian and talk show host, as the voice for Dory adds to the brilliance of the movie because Ellen is a natural entertainer. Andrew Stanton, the writer and director of Finding Nemo, played the voice of ""Crush,"" a sea turtle Marlin encountered during his journey. With Crush's ""surfer dude"" voice and personality, he adds another source of humor in the movie with his unique qualities.<br/><br/>The ocean is vast and very mysterious. Finding Nemo lets you see what lies below the water with brilliant colors and overwhelming sense of detail. It truly reveals that there is a whole new world that exists in our planet. It not only provides views of underwater landscapes from within the ocean, but also the fish tank setting from a fish's point of view. The vibrant colors and the amount of detail put into this animation is another reason why so many people have been drawn to this movie.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is more than just a movie about a father fish who loses his beloved son and his journey to find him. The audience is truly drawn into the storyline of the movie because of Marlin's persistent determination and Nemo's lovable and impressionable personality. It allows the viewers to connect emotionally to these two main characters because of the strong bond they have with each other. The movie strongly emphasizes the devotion and enduring love a parent has for his child, and the importance of these qualities during times of complications. Because of this, it shows the reason why family is among the most important things to cherish and have in your life because they are the ones who go through great risks for one another.<br/><br/>The meaning behind the story line, humorous scenes, amount of detail, and unique characters make being disappointed at any time during the movie impossible. It is a film that the whole family will enjoy no matter how old you are. Whether it's watching it during class or at home, I will always be just as excited to watch this wonderful film as I was the first time I watched it in theaters nine years ago."

","The movie ""Finding Nemo"" is a adorable, funny movie for kids and adults alike. The actors are great and and the animation looks some what realistic with the shimmering water. The movie. It takes you on an adventure through the ocean, showing a dad's love for his son.<br/><br/>The actors are good and bring more life into the movie. Ellen Degeneres plays Dory, who is a fish that forgets every five minutes and is very friendly.Dory ""Hey there, Mr. Grumpy Gills, when life gets you down do you wanna know what you've gotta do?"".She befriends Marlin, played by Alex Brooks, he is an overprotective dad that's son has been kidnapped by humans. Both of these actors' characters contrast, which makes the movie funny and enjoyable to watch as the change for the better and become friends.<br/><br/>In Addition, the scenery in the movie looks amazing for animation. It captures the realistic look of the ocean even though its animated. In the first scene Marlin shows his wife Cory, who is only there for a short time, their new home over looking the coral reef. The water shimmers showing the beauty of the ocean.<br/><br/>Although, this is a great movie they could show coral a little more instead of taking her out right away. Maybe Marlin could remember her and let her go, because in about the fist couple of minutes it shows them together in there in home and then she gets taken out of the movie altogether. <br/><br/>Furthermore, this movie is good for kids and adults. It's not to scary like some movies are for kids now, and its funny and also serious. Adults can get bored in movies that are made for kids, but this movie doesn't bore you. It can make you laugh, when Dory forgets things. It shows the characters changing throughout the movie. Henceforth, the movies characters are cute and and there are some sad parts but there are also happy and funny parts. The scary parts in this movie are not to scary and don't scare your kids. Thus, this movie is a great movie for you and your kids.<br/><br/>Accordingly, this is over all a great movie to watch. In the future this would be a good movie to remember, because the style of movies is going to change. Would you want your children to watch something that could scare them or give them nightmares or maybe they just don't enjoy it? If you don't want that to happen, ""Finding Nemo"" is a good movie to watch."

","So nine years after first enjoying this at theatres, I decided to watch this again in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend. I was astounded to find out how much I forgot since that first time so I was mostly experiencing this as if I hadn't seen this before which made for a wonderfully touching, thrilling, and, of course, very funny time for both me and my friend. So hearing Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres as Marlin and Dory brought plenty of laughter from me especially from the latter. And seeing their adventures in looking for Marlin's son Nemo was even more pleasurable when we find out who all three main players encounter. Really, all I'll say now is if you like seeing classic movies on the big screen, I highly recommend you once again watch Finding Nemo at your neighborhood movie house right now!"
"kgprophet","7","0","1","21 September 2012"," 3D Version Worth Catching
","This review is specifically for the 3D re-release. There are two things that I observed, one was that the strength of story and surprise is about double the effort compared to recent Pixar releases. ""Brave's"" story felt relatively simplistic, ""Cars 2"" offered no depth. ""Toy Story 3"", while having depth, was still basically a rehash of TS2. ""Finding Nemo"" exceeds expectations every few minutes. Once the story seems set, a new wrinkle is thrown in. I had not watched the movie in a while, and I forgot how fast-paced and action-packed the story is. There are many more moments of genuine humour compared to recent Pixar releases. <br/><br/>Second was the quality of the 3D. Most reviews I heard was that the 3D wasn't all that special. I disagree. There are many moments, albeit brief, where you are tracking along with the fish through an underwaterfall, or animals flying toward the camera, or settings that surround you with 3D depth. The animation is still probably Pixar's best. The vivid recreation of a coral reef is vibrant with colour. The swilling motion of everything from the current, the refraction of the sun through the water, even the aquarium is lovingly depicting with exotic objects. Seeing the film on the big screen also gives you the benefit of feeling the sense of size when a large shark or whale dominates the screen. <br/><br/>Now, not surprisingly, Pixar is making ""Finding Nemo 2"". As much as I applaud this film, Pixar has a better chance to impress with something original instead of churning out sequels. Hopefully they will stuff it full of good story and surprise elements for a change."

","Plot<br/><br/>Two clownfish, Marlin and his wife Coral are admiring their new home in the Great Barrier Reef and their clutch of eggs that are due to hatch in a few days. Suddenly, a barracuda attacks them, leaving Marlin unconscious before eating Coral and all but one of their eggs. Marlin names this egg Nemo, a name that Coral liked. The film then moves on to Nemo's first day of school. Nemo has a tiny right fin, due to a minor injury to his egg from the barracuda attack, which limits his swimming ability. After Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip, Nemo disobeys his father and sneaks away from the reef towards a boat, resulting in him being captured by scuba divers. As the boat sails away, one of the divers accidentally knocks his diving mask into the water. While unsuccessfully attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets Dory, a naïve but good-hearted and optimistic Regal tang with short-term memory loss. While meeting three sharks on a fish-free diet, Bruce, a great white shark; Anchor, a hammerhead shark; and Chum, a mako shark, Marlin discovers the diver's mask that was dropped from the boat and notices an address written on it. However, when he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed, the scent of blood causes Bruce to lose control of himself and attempt to eat Marlin and Dory. The two escape from Bruce but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea. During a hazardous struggle with an anglerfish in the trench, Dory realizes she is able to read the address written on the mask, which leads to Sydney, Australia, and manages to remember it. After receiving directions to Sydney from a large school of moonfish, Marlin and Dory accidentally run into a bloom of jellyfish that nearly sting them to death; Marlin falls exhausted after the risky escape and wakes up to see a surf-cultured sea turtle named Crush, who takes Dory and him on the East Australian Current. In the current, Marlin reluctantly shares the details of his journey with a group of young sea turtles; his story spreads rapidly across the ocean through word of mouth and eventually reaches Nemo in Sydney. Meanwhile, Nemo's captor - P. Sherman, a dentist - places him into a fish tank in his office on Sydney Harbour. There, Nemo meets a group of aquarium fish called the ""Tank Gang"", led by a crafty and ambitious moorish idol named Gill. The ""Tank Gang"" includes Bloat, a puffer fish, Bubbles, a Yellow Tang, Peach, a starfish, Gurgle, a Royal gramma, Jacques, a pacific cleaner shrimp and Deb, a Blacktailed Humbug. The fish are frightened to learn that the dentist plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who is infamous for killing a goldfish given to her previously, by constantly shaking his bag. In order to avoid this, Gill gives Nemo a role in an escape plan, which involves jamming the tank's filter and forcing the dentist to remove the fish from the tank to clean it manually. The fish would be placed in plastic bags, at which point they would roll out the window and into the harbor. After a friendly pelican named Nigel visits with news of Marlin's adventure, Nemo succeeds in jamming the filter, but the plan backfires when the dentist installs a new high-tech filter. Upon leaving the East Australian Current, Marlin and Dory become lost and are engulfed by a whale. Inside the whale's immense mouth, Marlin desperately tries to escape while Dory communicates with it in whale- speak. In response, the whale carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole. They are met by Nigel, who recognizes Marlin from the stories he has heard and rescues him and Dory from a flock of hungry seagulls by scooping them into his beak and taking them to the dentist's office. By this time, Darla has arrived and the dentist is prepared to give Nemo to her. Nemo tries to play dead in hopes of saving himself, and, at the same time, Nigel arrives. Marlin sees Nemo and mistakes this act for the actual death of his son. Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain through a sink after a chaotic struggle. Overcome with despair, Marlin leaves Dory and begins to swim back home. Dory then loses her memory and becomes confused, but meets Nemo, who has reached the ocean through an underwater drainpipe. Dory's memory is restored after she reads the word ""Sydney"" on a nearby drainpipe and, remembering her journey, she guides Nemo to Marlin. After the two joyfully reunite, Dory is caught in a fishing net with a school of grouper. Nemo bravely enters the net and directs the group to swim downward to break the net, reminiscent of a similar scenario that occurred in the fish tank earlier. The fish, including Dory, succeed in breaking the net and escape. After some days, Nemo leaves for school once more and Marlin is no longer overprotective or doubtful of his son's safety, proudly watching Nemo swim away into the distance. Back at the dentist's office, the high-tech filter breaks down and The Tank Gang have escaped into the harbor, but realize they are confined to the bags of water that the dentist put them into when cleaning the tank."

There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.<br/><br/>I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.<br/><br/>The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.<br/><br/>Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations. <br/><br/>Mine, mine, mine!"

","The movie ""Finding Nemo""takes place under the coral reef of the open sea water. A clownfish named Marlin lives with his son Nemo and he tells his son about how dangerous it is in the ocean. Nemo is captured by humans and his father Marvin has to go and rescue him. He is so worried that he doesn't know what is going to happen to his only son.  The genre is an adventure comedy for families.<br/><br/>        Nemo sets off into the ocean sea and explores what is around him. He then is abducted by humans and is netted up and taken away to the dentist office in Sydney. Meanwhile Marlin notices that Nemo has disappeared and is nowhere to be found. Marlin meets a fish named Dory who has a short term memory loss. They both travel a very big distance to search for Nemo and soon meet up with sharks, turtles and other sea creatures. While this is happening Nemo and his friends in the tank try to leave the area to go back to their original home.<br/><br/>          In the movie it shows how each of the characters are acting like. At first the movie starts really great because it shows how Nemo didn't want to go to the first day of school and his other friends were begging for him to come with them and they sounded so excited which make them look really cute. Another part that I liked in the movie was when Marlin felt so scared when he had lost his son. I can feel of how his father felt at that time because it's a father-son relationship. Marlin showed that he really cared for Nemo instead of just saying ""oh i don't care its whatever he'll come back eventually"". There was one part where I disliked of how Dory was asked if she seen a boat gone by. Even though she has short term memory she could have just said she didn't see anything instead of playing and joking around with Marlin. Dory says "" oh I seen a boat it went this way no it went this way"", I felt like she wanted to make Marlin feel more worried instead of telling him that she didn't see anything which is really rude.<br/><br/>          The photography in this movie is a dark background in some parts of the movie but there is also light in the movie too. I think that the photography is really great because it creates a mood where it's a calm and peaceful place. You can always see the sea creatures that are moving around the water, which makes the picture looks so beautiful. At the end of the movie, the picture shows that it's in the city and shows the people nature and the seagulls that are flying everywhere. This kind of photography makes the scene more attractive and would make the audience have a good feeling because it wouldn't be a boring scene.<br/><br/>         <br/><br/>        My overall reaction to this movie is that it is such a great movie! I recommend this movie for everyone to watch because it's an adventurous family movie. The world of Finding Nemo is such a pure and simple movie, with cute creatures that live under the ocean,and having lots of fun playing with each other. The music and theme also blend, very well with the movie. This movie shows a father and son relationship which would make little kids feel they should care about their loved ones and know that they are protected and never harmed. As a final thought, watching this movie with a family will absolutely make everyone smile and end the day with a warm feeling. I truly give this movie a rate 10/10!!!!"

","In the film ""Finding Nemo"", there are many scenes and events that capture the attention of any viewer of any age. The movie begins in the ocean with a clown fish and his wife. There were expecting hundreds of children together, when something tragic happens to the mom and all her baby eggs, all but one egg died. The clown fish promises to keep that baby safe no matter what and he names him Nemo. The father fish takes Nemo to school one day, and while at school Nemo gets captured by divers. The father fish searches the entire ocean looking for his son, and on his quest to find him, he makes interesting friends and learns many things about the ocean. When the father fish finally finds his son, he is being flushed down the sink because he is ""belly up."" Father fish decides that he has nothing else to lose, and slowly makes his way back to his home in the coral. When the movie takes a turn for the unexpected, the audience cannot help but to stay and see what happens.<br/><br/>Directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich try to show the audience many meanings. Some of the meanings would be directed towards adults and some to younger children. One meaning that they portray very well in this movie is the meaning of family value. They show that family is important because the father was willing to go to the ends of the ocean to find his son, and he was willing to do whatever it took to find him. Another meaning which the directors portray is that determination can take us to wherever we want to be, as long as we try. In many scenes in this movie, Nemo or his dad take many risks to achieve something. They both are determined to find each other and to come home safely, and with the determination, they find success and they find out about who they are. <br/><br/>This movie is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. I love that the movie shows a relationship with a father and a son. In most Disney movies, the relationships are between a mother and a daughter. I also enjoyed this movie because the color and images of the ocean were appealing to the eye. The vibrant colors keep a young child's attention and they also match descriptions of what the ocean really looks like. Another reason why I enjoy watching this movie is because the humor that is used can be understood by adults and by young children. I would recommend this movie to anybody who asks, and I would also tell them to be prepared to watch it numerous times."

","Finding Nemo is an animated film created in 2003 about the father –son adventure through the mysterious wonders of the ocean and the new discoveries of the land of humans. The story begins as Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) is the only survivor after a shark attacks his mother and the other eggs. Nemo's father takes Nemo under his fins and they begin their new life together. The story unfolds as Nemo is taken by humans from his home on the coral reef. Nemo's father Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) sets out on his journey to find Nemo and bring him back home. Nemo becomes entrapped in a fish tank, in a dentist's office, where Nemo learns that he is the new present for the Dentist's niece. Nemo befriends the other fish and together they make the escape from the land of humans to the deep waters of the ocean once again. The battles that Marlin and his new found friend Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres) encounter on their journey through the dangerous waters will capture the audience's attention and will keep the kids guessing on what will happen next. The vivid colors and real life sounds create a world of imagination and fun as the audience becomes entranced with the feeling of swimming right alongside of these new found friends. Finding Nemo is a family movie that tells the tale of a father -son bond and how far someone will go to save the one they love. We see the theme of defeating all odds and overcoming all obstacles for those you love while battling hand in hand with strangers that they now call friends. We saw how Marlin and Dory survived the chase of a vicious shark and escaped the jaws of an anglerfish as they stayed determined to find and rescue Nemo from the unknown dangers of the open sea and land. The extraordinary will power of Nemo, a young fish, has overcome all the challenges that life has thrown at him and will leave an impression on many young viewers. <br/><br/>The way that the film transitions from Marlin and Dory's journey to the journey of Nemo allows the audience to see the struggles of both audiences while keeping tabs on what is going on. It also creates the anticipation and the importance of overcoming the dangers they encounter. The fast motion allows for the audience to become involved with the multiple life threatening chases that the characters run into without making them too long for a young audience to keep attention. The elaborate colors and the sounds help the audience to become involved and really feel like they are on the journey with Nemo. The darkening of the ocean gives the impression of the deepness and the dangerous parts of the ocean that Marlin must travel to get to where he needs to go, once again seeing the perseverance of Marlin and what he is willing to do to get to Nemo."

","Whenever a Pixar film is just about to be released in theaters, there's this lively buzz around town. In every way redefining animated pictures, Pixar's films over the years have not only captured the wildest imagination of kids, but adults too. The filmmakers clearly have worked out an incredible formula for producing flop-proof feature-length cartoons year after year. In the tradition of Pixar, Finding Nemo represents the industry leader's most family oriented work to date.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is strong in content (a trait of Pixar films), offering a well-defined story with lovely characters that are incredibly well-personified. It's an animated feature with immense substance and quality that allows most viewers to be willingly absorbed into the colourful underwater world. There's an exciting blend of form and movement on display which might just make any moviegoer go, ""Boy, I wanna be a fish!"" There will be debate whether Finding Nemo is still the best Pixar film to date. For me, it's Monsters Inc. But there's a charming aspect to this sea adventure that's able to connect to viewers more than any other Pixar offerings.<br/><br/>While it may seem at times overly indulgent in terms of animation, and colour, Finding Nemo never loses sight of its focus and wittiness, telling a warm-hearted story that consistently touches our hearts. There will be some who might develop a fetish for clownfishes after watching Nemo, but I wouldn't blame them at all. There will also be some who will be disappointed when they find out that their little pet fish can't mutter a single word.

","I think what separates Pixar from any other animation studio is that all of the action, technical effects, and dialog serves to connect the audience with the characters. It is not just thrown in for the sake of itself. And therefore they make razor tight stories heart touching and effortless. Finding Nemo is the first absolute masterpiece from Pixar. While the other films have been excellent, this one set a new standard for them. The color palette in the ocean murkiness is fabulous and makes us feel a part of the world we are in. The characters are wonderful. Whether they are on for a moment or throughout the entire movie, you care for them. Yes, they kind of hit you over the head with a message here and there, but that in no way distracts from the enchantment and thrill of this movie. I should call it a fable, because it plays out that way. The basic overriding theme is getting father and son back together. And this is one story all ages can relate to. Who hasn't in their lifetime gotten ""lost"" for a brief moment from their parents? The theme resonates deep with us. The fact that it plays out with technical mastery, bedazzling scenes, flat out hilarious humor, and thrilling action is just icing on the cake. Pixar landed a good story and told it 100% right! A must see!<br/><br/>A Note: A couple of scenes are very scary for little little kids. Wait till they are maybe 5 or so before they see it."

","What more can one say about one of the most remarkable studios in Hollywood's history. Despite the profit-munching monolithic beast that is Disney, constantly peering over Pixar's shoulder to ensure profits are aplenty in every new feature, this never seems to distract such a remarkable studio from making pieces of pure art. That is what Finding Nemo is, art. From the glorious animation that brings the South-West Pacific alive on-screen, to the peaceful, pitch-perfect score, combined with the art of creating great characters and story, something that Pixar has always excelled at, creates a beautiful film experience.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is soaked in brilliance. Comedy is something that Pixar has always kept in its films but used fairly sparsely with a merciful aversion to the cheap pop-culture references that the likes of DreamWorks use habitually. That said, Finding Nemo is probably the most prominent example of a Pixar work with so many laugh-out-loud moments. Most of these of course centre around the exquisite Dory, the fish who couldn't remember. Her lapses in short-term memory and confidence in her ability to ""speak whale,"" provide the most glorious moments of comedy I have seen in any film.<br/><br/>But no ""great"" film can survive on comedy alone. Pixar, in every single film have excelled at giving their works heart. Finding Nemo, along with Up (and from what I've heard about Toy Story 3, being in the UK I have yet to have seen it) is Pixar's most heartfelt and moving story. The moment, where Marlon having finally found Nemo, fears he has lost him once more at the bottom of that net, is so incredibly powerful, and for a second you do think ""no, surely not."" Indeed it does have a happy ending (it is Disney) but that is perfect. Such a heart-breaking ending, although brave would simply have been wrong, however the choking feeling I felt when I saw Nemo tangled, limp and lifeless in that net is testament to the power that Finding Nemo possess and the brilliance that is Pixar. However, for me, the most powerful moment of this film is the ending. With Marlon saying goodbye to his son as he swims off into the ocean, away from his dad, who, since the devastating loss of Nemo's mother at the beginning, has struggled to let his son go, be free and grow-up, we see he has finally reached the point where he can let go, with a soft, introverted ""bye son."" The emotional punch this packs as ""THE END"" flashes up as Nemo swims away, is very heavy. The character arc is complete and Marlon himself has come to terms with the pain and suffering of the past, and has moved on.<br/><br/>This of course is a human story, with fish. Pixar has made a film about fish that moves us on every human level from comedy to deep tragedy, and this is proof that Finding Nemo is immortal and magnificent."

","It's not necessarily one of Pixar's most funny films, that title certainly goes to Toy Story 2. Yet I think that Finding Nemo has to be one of their most magical. One thing that Pixar does brilliantly apart from the script and the characters is to create new worlds. Toy Story creates a world in which toys come to life. A Bug's Life creates a world in which bugs run a society similar to that of our own, Finding Nemo creates a world in which sea-life interact similarly to humans- a remarkable feat that they pull off extremely well. It's an adventure story in which a dedicated father sets out to find his only relation. the character development is remarkable for a children's film- Pixar never underestimates their audience. The result is a beautifully created, wonderfully written piece, that maybe goes on a bit longer than it needs to, but it is funny in places and certainly will keep kids and adults interested."

","All children and families will want to watch this beautifully-animated film. It's all colorful 3-d graphics and a joy to watch. There are a few opportunities to learn things about fishes, but it's mostly about the journey to reunite father and son and about the laughs. There are lots of funny lines delivered by comedic geniuses Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres. Some small children will be frightened in two parts: The scenes with the sharks from about 19:15 to 24:30, and the part with the deep-sea angler fish from 33:00 to 35:15. The bit in the beginning with the barracuda would be scary but it's over very quickly.<br/><br/>Like nearly all popular children's movies, this one follows the formula where the child is separated from the parents early in the film. In this one the mother dies and the child (OK, a clown fish, not a child) is separated from his father. Reunion would seem impossible if not for the interventions of a series of colorful characters with remarkable abilities and unimaginable good luck."

","Finding Nemo (Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, 2003) is an episodic entry from Pixar, inexplicably hailed by many as the studio's best. In a moving prologue, we see the wife and unborn spawn of clownfish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) eaten by a predator. He aside, the sole survivor is an offspring with a weak fin: Nemo (Alexander Gould). The attack - and birth - has a profound attack on the formerly carefree Marlin, who becomes absurdly, embarrassingly protective of his son. When the youngster is captured by a diver, his father must embark on a revelatory quest, braving shark attacks and jungles of jellyfish in a bid for reunion.<br/><br/>The film is exciting, moving and stunningly animated, but has too many incidental characters who aren't sufficiently well-drawn, and a habit of hitting you over the head with its message. ""You can't never let anything happen to (Nemo) - then nothing would ever happen to him,"" says periodically annoying comic relief Dorey (Ellen DeGeneres). That would be pithy had we not already got the point. It's still a good film."

","The pix-tar film Finding Nemo was one of the most entertaining movie i have seen in a long time.The film was directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich.Finding Nemo is a cartoon so there are no real people actually in the movie besides the voices of each character. But each of the actors that did each voice did a wonderful job and should be very proud of the job they did in the film. . There are three main characters in this movie, Marlin which is the father fish, Nemo in the little kid fish, and Dory which is Martin's friend that he finds on his journey he takes. The voice of Martin in played by Albert Brooks which I thought did I great job playing the strict worried father role throughout the movie. The voice of Dory is played by Ellen DeGeneres, which is the best role in this movie. She fits the characters scrip so well it seems like she is really the fish in this movie not an actual person. Ellen keeps you laughing almost the whole movie with her voices and little side humor that some people pick up on and some don't. The last main character is Nemo the son of Martin and is played by Alexander Gould which isn't really a huge actor in the Hollywood scene but did a wonderful job in the Pixar film. His character is a little clown fish that gets lost and has to be found by his father before something else happens. The plot of finding Nemo is wrote very well by the directors. There are many parts in the movie that make you laugh your pants offand other parts that might mae a tear or two come out of your eyes. If you are bored or have a date that wants to watches a funny cartoon movie Finding Nemo is one to see.

","When my wife and I saw ""Finding Nemo,"" our children were nearing the age to leave home. That's really what this movie was about: how hard it is for parents to let go of their children and allow them to make their own lives. Pixar, like any great artist, knows how to create an allegory with powerful emotional impact. As a bonus, the movie is also enormously entertaining. (My wife and I saw it 14 times in its initial release!)<br/><br/>The unsettling and very moving opening sequence put us in Marlin's place, experiencing a deep and unexpected loss which sets up his ""helicopter mom"" performance for the rest of the movie. Marlin must grow up as much as Nemo must. All during their journey, Pixar surrounds us with color and beauty rarely seen in films.<br/><br/>The choices of voice-over actors couldn't have been more perfect. Ellen DeGeneres absolutely owns Dory and make the character humorous, sympathetic and believable. Albert Brooks, Alexander Gould are perfect. And the bevy of supporting actors are equally well- cast, especially Willem Dafoe and the mysterious Gill.<br/><br/>Thomas Newman's musical score is also a perfect fit for the movie. It mirrors the regret, tension and excitement throughout the story.<br/><br/>This is a movie I will continue to watch for many years to come."

","The Movie ""Finding Nemo"" is a wholesome, heart-warming, feel-good tale about determination and love. According to National Geographic Magazine, when Andrew Stanton set out to make an animated children's movie set in the ocean and faithful to ""the real rules of nature,"" all he needed was a perfect fish for his main character. Browsing through a coffee table book, his eyes landed on a photo of two fish peeking out of an anemoneand so a star was born. <br/><br/>""Finding Nemo,"" the Pixar movie Stanton wrote and directed, won the 2003 Academy Award for best animated feature and, according to many sources, remains one of the highest grossing G-rated films of all time, taking in over $850 million dollars to date. <br/><br/>And those are just a few of ""Finding Nemo""s achievements. Others include the biggest opening weekend for any animated film upon its US release (30 May 2003), the bestselling DVD of all time in the world (as of January 2005) with 22 million copies sold (according to IMDb.com). ""Finding Nemo"" is ranked number 17 on the list of All-Time USA Box Office Receipts. One thing is clear: America loves this movie! <br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is a heart-warming, feel-good tale about, Nemo, a clown fish who lives in an anemone on a coral reef in the ocean with his overprotective father, Marlin (Nemo's mother is deceased). Nemo gets taken from his boyhood home by scuba divers from Sydney, Australia. An anxious and worried Marlin sets out on a quest through the ocean to find and rescue Nemo. Marlin meets up with Dori, a scatterbrained blue tang fish who suffers from short-term memory loss, who comes along for the ride. Their quest continues as the rest of the movie chronicles their adventures, including both setbacks and successes. <br/><br/>It is hard to argue with the entertaining qualities of ""Finding Nemo."" The movie is pretty much hilarious. It is packed with almost non-stop action from one scene to the next. From the quips of Nemo's friends to the comments of Nigel the Pelican, there is never a dull moment in ""Finding Nemo."" Quotes like ""P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney,"" ""Sharkbait! Hoo ha ha!"" and ""Mine, mine, mine!"" have become links to our favorite movie memories. Also entertaining are both the music and graphics of ""Finding Nemo."" The music is moving while the graphics are stunning. It is as if you are really in an ocean. <br/><br/>In addition to the movie's highly entertaining qualities, it is important to note that ""Finding Nemo"" is entertaining to a very broad audience. Adults and children alike thoroughly enjoy both the plot line and the visuals of the movie. The story is interesting enough for adults while still maintaining accessibility for youths; children get it and they love it. Many children have been influenced by this blockbuster hit. Just go to almost any aquarium and find the clown fish tank display; within minutes you will see and hear children come up to the tank shouting, ""Nemo, Nemo, look there's Nemo!""<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" is also attractive because it is relatable. It tells the poignant story of a father and son and their relationship. As an audience, we are touched by Marlin's protectiveness. We are scared for Nemo when he gets captured. We are glad when Marlin decides to look for Nemo. We are pulling for Marlin to find Nemo. And all of this is because we are relating to the story and its ties to our lives. <br/><br/>The father/child or father/son relationship is such an important relationship to us as humans in our lives. Our fathers play vastly different roles in different people's lives. Some are near and involved, others are farther away and indifferent. Whether or not our fathers are around us or are very interested in our lives, almost all of us want to be able to interact with our fathers in some way, shape, or form. Thus, because of the universality with which we as humans connect with our fathers, we are pulling for Marlin and we want him to find Nemo. We can put ourselves in Nemo's shoes. We can relate because we would want our father to find us if we were Nemo.<br/><br/>In addition to the previously mentioned qualities that make ""Finding Nemo"" stand out, the movie is wholesome. There are many family values that abound in the movie, such as portraying the father as a positive role model, never giving up when you have set your mind on something, and parents starting to let go of their children and send them on their way.<br/><br/>The fact that Pixar shows the traditional family in such a positive light is really amazing. It is a computer-animated film, but anymore nowadays that does not guarantee that it will be good, clean fun. There have been other animated movies that have not been squeaky-clean. However, with ""Finding Nemo"" there is no need to worry because there is virtually nothing questionable in the movie. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Finding Nemo"" is a fun, touching, and wholesome movie packed with family values. It is sure to delight you and your whole family. So take a dive into the ocean and enjoy ""Finding Nemo."""

","Of Pixar's ongoing streak of CGI animated classics, I've always admired 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" the most. For a movie a about talking fish, sharks, pelicans, and turtles, it may be the most humane and endearing film of the last decade.<br/><br/>Like ""Up"", it opens with a tragedy: a shark devours Coral, the wife of Clownfish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), and all but one of their 400 eggs, leaving an overprotective Marlin to raise Nemo (Alexander Gould), who is handicapped by a short fin. When Nemo is captured by humans and placed in a fish tank, Marlin teams up with Dory (Ellen Degeneres), a regal tang, to rescue him.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" does to the ocean what ""Up"" does to the air. The water becomes a vibrantly illustrated, fully developed setting. We see schools of fish, sunken ships, and powerful currents. 'Eye-candy' is an understatement, and the setting makes the adventure all the more thrilling.<br/><br/>In the fish tank scenes, ""Finding Nemo"" presents one of the most hilarious scenarios in recent memory as the captive fish, led by Gill (Willem Dafoe), scheme to escape back to the ocean. These scenes are clever, tense, and surprisingly involving. Meanwhile, Dory, suffering from a ""Memento""-like short-term memory condition, is as lovable as she is funny.<br/><br/>Laughs aside, Marlin's single-minded determination and Nemo's wonderful resilience really pull the audience into the story. ""Shark Tale,"" from the very next year, took place in a similar setting but saturated its story with generic characters and ill-conceived pop-culture references (unlike the brief and clever quips in ""Finding Nemo""). The fish looked like the celebrities voicing them, and the effect was vain and artificial. In ""Finding Nemo,"" the vocal performances by Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, and the other actors fit their roles perfectly, and as a result we forget about the actors and accept the characters. Children raised on ""Hannah Montana"" deserve films as straightforward and good-hearted as ""Finding Nemo."""

","""Finding Nemo"" is a very well done movie for the whole family. Technically, it has the high quality of animation that Disney/Pixar are famous for, but what it also had was another feature Disney is famous for that hasn't always been clear in some of its more recent work - it's real, and at times sad and tragic, and doesn't get lost in the idea that children should somehow be shielded from the reality that sometimes bad things happen. In an opening that reminded me a bit of Bambi's mom being killed, when clownfish Marlin loses his mate Coral and most of his babies in an attack from a predator you knew that this was not going to be just a silly cartoon. In the aftermath of the attack, Marlin is left to raise his only surviving child Nemo by himself. Not surprisingly, he becomes over-protective, Nemo becomes resentful and in the end Nemo is captured by divers and ends up living in a tank in a dentist's office while his dad desperately tries to find him and rescue him. This runs the whole range of emotions - it's happy, it's sad, it's funny (the sharks who belong to the AA-type group - ""fish are friends, not food"" - are hilarious) and in its own way it's very educational for young ones, as the animation really does give them a sense of what some of these creatures look like. Ironically, probably the worst animation (at least in the sense of not looking anywhere close to real) was of the humans who periodically appear in the movie. Clearly, another winner for Disney/Pixar. 8/10"

","Andrew Stanton's rejuvenation of Pixar by deep-sea adventure is a joyous encouragement to expand one's experience and acumen of one's environment and inhabitance. Look at Marlin, Albert Brooks' clownfish protagonist. In the opening scene, his wife is eaten by a barracuda along with all of their eggs, except for one. Marlin finds that egg and promises it he will never leave it, naming it Nemo. His journey is a testament to the catharsis and philanthropic imposition of chaotic situations, ones that happen within the context of the natural pitfalls of one's existential habitat. Parallel to his titular quest for Nemo is Nemo's own quest for the sanctuary of his father, and so in the superconscious of this deep-sea adventure, opposite energies are negotiated. Marlin's principle of orderly civilization, maintained by fear and the haunting wounds of his loss, is converged with the reality of messy nature. Stanton's precept paints the natural world with a wildly natural brush.<br/><br/>The Pixar films are the American vanguard's long-overdue equivalent of Japan's Ghibli Studios anime films by Miyazaki and Takahata. The reason is that they are creating a new standard for American family films, filtering out the complacence and tampered ideology of the contemporary cartoon-animated Disney films and the like. This has, naturally, been ignored in pertinence to this particular film: The film's prominent use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the animal as pets in America, even though the movie portrays the use of fish as pets with strong negativity and saltwater aquariums as elaborately tricky and expensive to maintain. In Vanuatu, clownfish were being caught on a large scale for sale as pets, motivated by the demand.<br/><br/>But I believe a lot of kids know better. A movie like Finding Nemo portrays nature not only as something to fear and not only as something to seek out, but both, enmeshed in a sort of way that applies to what these characters, Merlin, Nemo, a flighty little regal tang called Dory with Ellen DeGeneres' voice, learn about themselves. They are oppressed by the sea's natural peril, but transformed by experiencing the very nature of the sea.<br/><br/>The film has its handful of cornier moments, bits of humor that are meant more for the clean minds of wholesome children and their mothers, but they do not detract any more than they may in one of Steven Spielberg's more fantastical films for younger audiences. It nonetheless assumes you are absorbed in its world rather than popping it into the VCR during a birthday party. It makes sense, it tells a thematically diverse story, it has lessons, and it's moving. But more than anything, it's fun."

My favorite scenes are when the submarine that Bruce and his friends were hanging out in blew up and the two pelicans sitting on top of the surface see the bubbles from the explosion and one of them thinks the other let off gas and says NICE! I also liked it when Nemo, Tad, Pearl, and Sheldon are out looking at the water and Tad pulls Pearl back letting off her ink and she says You guys made me ink! That was hilarious!

The anemone, the barracuda, the anglerfish-all that! The color was amazing, too! They did exaggerate the colors a bit (like how deb and flo are blue and white striped with a blue tail while the species they are suppost to be are black and white striped with a white tail) and they, of course, drastically exaggerated the emotions fish can feel. They also made the fish a lot smarter than they really are. Overall, I think Finding Nemo is suburb and something every soul on earth should see, no matter how inland they live!"

","Finding Nemo is probably one of the best movies ever produced by Pixar and Walt Disney. It was a hit at the theaters, and also a hit on the DVD release. This two-disc set features the same movie as the original theatrical release, plus lots of extra features. There are extra scenes and deleted scenes, but these are mainly sketches and hence are not included as part of the regular movie. The movie itself is worth buying this set; its bright and flashy with cool visuals and special effects that make it attractive for kids. The soundtrack is considerably different from the traditional classical fair found in Disney's motion length pictures. This movie's soundtrack is laid back and different, but paces well with the action. The voice-overs are great, and the comedy is unique and hilarious. Vegetarian sharks! Fish without memory!

She has such an interesting, quirky way of looking at the world and the writers of Finding Nemo captured that perfectly in the Dory's character. The animation is gorgeous. The color of the water and the way it changes as the characters swim through it is beautiful. Director Andrew Stanton is hilarious as Crush. What a talented guy.

At the Drop Off, Nemo and his friends see a boat in the open sea and they're challenging each other to swim nearer to the boat. But Marlin swims in to the rescue and blames Nemo for what he's done and tells him to come back home. Disobeyed by his son, Marlin shouts at Nemo as he swam on and on to the boat. But suddenly, Nemo is captured in a net by a scuba diver and bring him back to the boat. Shocked that he lost his only son, Marlin chases after the boat - swimming as fast as he can. But the boat was too fast for him. Marlin suddenly bumps in to Dory, a jolly blue fish who has short-term memory lose. Dory offered to help Marlin be reunited with his son.

Also, I certainly thought that this epic is a great family film, aimed for all ages, because it's not that sort of movies where it's aimed for only children, teenagers or adults. It's a mixed movie, which visually allows everyone to watch it, no matter what age you are. As an 11-year old, my dad brought this movie on video two years ago, along with ""The Lord Of The Rings"". Despite the fact, my video player is not officially working, I still wish I could watch this movie again, because it sometimes bring back some memories of me as a young boy.<br/><br/>Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould (as Marlin and Nemo) did some spectacular voice animation, in their role, with great concentration and lots of energy to deliver to the audience. Along with Ellen DeGeneres (Dory) who did an amusing performance playing Dory. Overall, the cast did some wonderful voice animations.

"Electrified_Voltage","9","0","1","30 May 2008"," A well-deserved success from Pixar, with so much to like!
","As I'm sure you know, Pixar made their feature-length debut with ""Toy Story"", which turned out to be a huge hit, and without a doubt, they've made a good number of other massively successful movies since then. I went to see a good bunch of films on the silver screen back in 2003, probably more than I ever had in a year before or in any year since, but unfortunately, ""Finding Nemo"" wasn't one of them. However, I first saw the Pixar hit on DVD in early 2004, and was very impressed! I've seen it more than once since then, and it seems to hold up well.<br/><br/>Marlin and his wife, Coral, are two clown fish who are about to become parents. Sadly, however, a predator soon comes, before their young are born, and knocks Marlin unconscious! When he awakens, he soon discovers that he is now a widower, and only one egg has survived the attack! Marlin names his one surviving offspring Nemo. When Nemo gets older, he starts his first day of school, but not long after he starts, he is caught by a scuba diver and taken away to a fish tank in a dentist's office by a harbour in Sydney, Australia! So, Marlin bravely sets out through the oceans to try and find his son, and soon meets a blue tang named Dory, who suffers from short term memory loss. She joins him on his adventure, and together, they face the dangers of the ocean as they try to make their way to Sydney! Meanwhile, Nemo and the other fish in the tank make plans to somehow escape, before the young clown fish is given to a rough little girl as a present the next time she comes for a check-up! <br/><br/>Some of the humour in this Pixar effort may be more for kids than adults, but this isn't usually the case. There's a lot to amuse adults as well. The last time I watched this film, I found some laughs around the beginning, but wanted more, which was eventually what I got, I think starting with the part where Dory, voiced by comedienne Ellen DeGeneres, comes in, as she is a memorably humorous character. There are other characters who add humour as well, including the seagulls, who say ""Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!"" when they see creatures they want to eat, as well as certain fish in the tank with Nemo, and certain creatures Marlon and Dory meet on their adventure, such as the sharks. Speaking of characters, that's another upside to this film, the characters are usually likable, whether they're funny or not. Another merit is definitely the very colourful and 3-D animation! Last but not least, it's a good story, with a fair amount of excitement, as well as slightly touching moments.<br/><br/>While ""Finding Nemo"" may not be a perfect family film, I would say it definitely comes close, so it's no surprise that it turned out to be such a big hit! It seems Pixar really knows how to appeal to kids and adults alike, and this effort of theirs does not hide that! The film wasn't around when I was a kid (I was a teenager when it came out), so I'll never know what it's like to see it during childhood, but since it's not strictly for kids, I wasn't too late. Probably for computer animation fans of all ages, there's lot to like, including the things I've mentioned above, as well as maybe other merits which I've failed to mention, though I'm sure others have pointed them out already."

It starts sadly, when a mate of a clownfish dies, Coral, the mate of Marlin. All of their eggs are also eaten - save one egg. Marlin calls the little fish inside (the name that Coral wanted to give one of their babies) Nemo. A few fish years later, Nemo is ready to go to school, but Marlin is an incredibly protective father and is not so sure. Despite his worries, he lets the eager Nemo go to school, but is still cautious. It turns out he has a right to be - when Nemo is captured by divers!

","Nemo is a young clownfish who gets caught by a scuba-diver and taken to Sydney. His father, Marlon, with the aid of a forgetful Regal Tang called Dory, must conquer his fears and set out on a dangerous quest across the Great Barrier Reef to rescue his son.<br/><br/>Although the storyline may be a little reminiscent of other animated features (Pinnochio, Bambi), this is a charming, visually entrancing fable of piscatorial adventures. It's a little too safe for me - you know Marlon is going to find Nemo and nobody cute is gonna die - but the characters are funny and richly observed and it has enough wacky off-the-wall stuff to keep us chuckling, like the Sharks Anonymous meeting, the fishy notes on dental techniques and the moronic seagulls constantly blabbering, ""Mine !"". Its real strength however is in the imagery; the blues and oranges just leap off the screen as swathes of primary colours and the ocean is simply alive with movement, currents, ripples, bubbles and clouds. Scenes like the jellyfish sequence or the struggle inside the whale are astonishing in their design and visual clarity, and there are some great monster shots, like the barracuda at the start or the anglerfish which nearly eats Marlon. The voice cast of the movie are good, particularly Dafoe as Gill, the slightly-sinister-yet-noble angelfish and Humphries as a crazy shark called Bruce, and the theme of giving children the space to grow is a moving one. Whilst not quite as hip as Shark Tale (made around the same time), this is nevertheless a touching, funny, beautifully animated fable and won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Produced by John Lasseter's Pixar Animation Studios, and dedicated to one of its key animators, Glenn McQueen, who died of cancer in 2002."

His father, who lost his mate and whole brood (minus Nemo) wants to protect him with everything he has in him, yet Nemo just wants to be like everyone else and do what the other kids are doing. In the process of showing everyone what he can do by swimming further out over the drop than the other fish, he gets scooped up by a scuba diver and all of his father's nightmares come true: he's lost his only son.<br/><br/>The story goes on to show what a parent will do for their child. In his quest to find his child, he runs into other sea life who all have their own disabilities, not all visual, but are able to help him in their own way. Each one of these characters have something very special about them, be it something that helps or hinders their life. They are all living ""normal"" lives in the big blue world of the ocean. From one character with short term memory loss, others with obsessive-compulsive disorders, they all have a limitation but don't let it limit their life.<br/><br/>This movie punctuates how we think about physical differences and want to protect the people who have them yet everyone has some sort of difference, most of us who don't have it visible on our person. Each of us are able to accomplish great things, each of us have to overcome shortcomings in our lives and we all have some specialness, visible or not."

"roedyg","8","0","2","23 June 2007"," morality tale
","I am interested mostly of the effect of this movie on young kids, not on the adults dragged along.<br/><br/>Most of animations are terrifying -- being stuck in the mouth of a whale, being surrounded by flocks of seagulls, being caught in a net. Animation's ability to exaggerate makes these events shocking. I remember being five watching Snow White terrified out of my mind hiding under my seat. Perhaps today's kids are more jaded.<br/><br/>The movie sees human activity through fish eyes, and the mindless destructiveness of human activity. Just as Bambi put children off hunting in my generation, Finding Nemo should work against commercial fishing for this one.<br/><br/>Nemo and his father are repeatedly caught in totally hopeless situations, but the both refuse to surrender and by the skin of their teeth prevail. This is great conditioning for kids. Dory's ditzy lack of understanding of the danger takes a little of the edge off the terror, even though logically she is adding to the predicament.<br/><br/>I laughed when it turned out the arch villain of the show was a little girl who liked to buy pet fish then not care for them.<br/><br/>As an adult, the schmaltzy opening between Marlon and Coral was just so anthropomorphic it put me off. I would have preferred a slightly more realistic representation of fish ""thoughts"". The characters were just too crass to be clown fish. It just did not fit.<br/><br/>That's an odd criticism coming from someone who found a Meercat in the Lion King doing the hula was the funniest thing I ever saw.<br/><br/>One final comment.

This one was different though. It kept me entertained, I've seen it at least 15 times now, and I'm still entertained by it. And the little girl, well, a 2 year old's attention span isn't exactly the best, and typically she doesn't pay attention to a whole movie played through. Not Nemo though, she'll stand (literally stand) in front of the TV and stare mesmerized at what she's seeing, from start to finish, over and over again. Hopefully it doesn't have any adverse effects on her development, lol. Enough pretty lights and soothing sounds to keep a newborn entertained, and enough adult humor and plot development to keep an adult awake! Seriously though, great movie for the whole family, no matter how old or how young."

","""Finding Nemo"" How many children love the ocean? The ocean is a fabulous place that holds many of our creatures in the world. Take an adventure with Nemo and his friends through the adventures, and dilemmas of the ocean. You will meet some fish whose home is in the ocean. What sounds like more fun then going on a rip tide ride with a sea turtle? Or meeting a shark who doesn't eat fish anymore? If you find the ocean one of the most fascinating places on earth then ""Finding Nemo"" is just the movie for you.<br/><br/>""Finding Nemo"" came out in 2003, and caught many children's attention. The main characters are Nemo is who the little clown fish who is lost, Marlin who is also a clown fish, looking for his son Nemo, Dory who meets Marlin during his attempt to rescue Nemo. The movie is about a cartoon clown fish fish called Nemo, who wants to prove to his friends that he is not scared and gets taken away by a scuba diver, for a tank in a dentist office. Marlin who is Nemo's father tries to rescue Nemo during the whole movie. Marlin comes across new characters such as Dory, who becomes his partner in searching for Nemo. They go on an underwater adventure to save Nemo and come face to face with sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish, and so much more. It received 81/2 stars out of 10 on the rating scale for movies. It is 100 minutes long and won an Oscar for the making of this outstanding movie. The director of this movie Andrew Stanton and the Co-director is Lee Unkrich. The cartoon characters voices in this movie are done by famous people. Just some examples the voice of Nemo is Alexander Gould, the voice of Marlin is Albert Brooks and the voice of Dory is Ellen Degeneres.<br/><br/>This movie starts out at Nemo's coral reef home. His mother is killed in the beginning which sets the stage for his father taking care of him. Nemo goes to school on the first day. The class is taking a field trip to the drop off, which Marlin, Nemo's father is not happy about. Marlin goes to the drop off to save his son, but when he gets there he witnesses Nemo being taken away by a scuba diver. Nemo was proving to his friends that he can get the closest to a boat, and was kidnapped by a scuba diver for a dentist's fish tank at his office. Marlin decides to go on an adventure and look in the whole ocean to find Nemo. Marlin meets Dory, who is a forgetful, funny fish. She forgets things quickly, and she explains to Marlin she has short term memory. Dory decides to help Marlin find Nemo. They meet a shark called Bruce who is not eating fish anymore, they meet a sea turtle Squirt and go on a rip tide ride with the sea turtles towards where Nemo is, they come across a school of jellyfish, and a lantern fish. Nemo and Marlin come across many hardships during this movie. Now hopefully you are wondering does Marlin ever save Nemo? You will have to watch the movie and find out.<br/><br/>I think Marlin was a determined fish and father. During the whole movie he never once said he was going to give up. Partially I think what kept Marlin going was the fact that he lost his wife and now he doesn't want to loose his son. Marlin comes face to face with a shark Bruce, who brings him back to his other two friends that are sharks. They participate in an AA meeting against eating fish. Dory bumps her nose and starts to create blood this triggers Bruce and he then wants to eat fish. Marlin runs from the shark and never gives up. Even at the end when Marlin is safe he still continues to find Nemo despite what other hardships he will encounter. This shows a child who is watching ""Finding Nemo"" that it is not okay to give up. That when you want to achieve a goal such as Marlin wants to rescue Nemo you should continue you're hardest even when times get tough. This movie is targeted towards children at a young age, and I think it is important to teach them never to give up even when they are not succeeding. This movie, as well as Marlin the character gives a great example that you should never give up.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was an excellent movie for children. It teaches the children about the ocean and certain species that live in the ocean. It explains certain areas in the ocean such as a ""drop off"" or a ""rip tide"". The movie also teaches the children about these topics in a fun way. For example you go on a sea turtle ride down the rip tide. During the ride, the sea turtles are acting like they are surfing and the voices of the sea turtles change too. ""Finding Nemo"" also instills in young children to not give up. That you should continue to try when times get tough. In the beginning it also gives an example of why children should not go off on their own. It demonstrates that Nemo left his class and was taken away by someone that a child can relate to as a stranger. There are many lessons to be learned in the movie and they teach them in a creative way. That's why I think you should go watch ""Finding Nemo"" and take you kids along too. Then you can also find out if Marlin finds Nemo."

","Finding new life in the old fish-story, Finding Nemo is another fine computer animated offering from the people at Pixar, just as family-oriented as their last offerings, and just as adventure and humor-filled as ever. The animation and backgrounds are superb; it's often a remarkable achievement, and the colorful scenes of marine life and reefs makes it a visual treat. Though the film takes a little while to get going, after a truly heart-wrenching tragic beginning (at least for an animated film), once the search for Nemo starts, it's a non-stop quest with one clever thing after another. In fact, much like its previous siblings, the script is full of amusing situations (such as the chaotic climax at the dentist's office), clever dialogue, and humorous finds. It's also packed to the gills (pun intended) with eccentric characters, such as a trio of sharks trying to kick the habit of eating other fish, a pack of surfer-dude sea turtles, and some dim-witted birds. But the funniest bits are, of course, the myriad of dangers the poor fish must face, from a sea of jellyfish, to the threat of predators, to being swallowed up by a whale. The voice actors, from the neurotic Brooks to the spacey DeGeneres, are all terrific, and well chosen."

","I'm always consistently amazed at what Pixar is able to do. With each passing film, they improve their craft again and again, transporting us to worlds where toys talk, insects can make inventions, and where monsters live and work just like we do. With their latest release, ""Finding Nemo,"" I am reminded once again why I love going to the movies.<br/><br/>The environment of the film is painfully detailed and realistic. My favorite example occurs in the salt-water fish tank that Nemo is being held in. In order to escape, the fish have to sabotage the tank. When they do sabotage it, the tank begins to get dirty instantly. If you've ever had a salt-water tank, you know that as soon as the little bubble thing stops working, the grim begins to gather and start forming in the tank almost instantly. It's such a great touch.<br/><br/>Two of my favorite scenes involved the jellyfish forest and the inside of the whale. Marlin and Dory have to race through a jellyfish forest. All around are these pink orbs with tentacles and the animation is sharp and quick. It is a heart racing sequence that I honestly feel had the same excitement level of the car chase scene in ""The Matrix Reloaded."" The whale scene is just beautifully detailed, particularly on the whale's tongue. I honestly thought it was a real tongue.<br/><br/>Speaking of real, Pixar has the incredible ability to cause you to forget that toys, insects, monsters, and now fish aren't actually human. They talk just like humans do (""What is with men and asking for directions?""). A standout scene occurs when Marlin has given up and saving Nemo and is ready to abandon Dory and go back to the reef. Dory gives an impassioned, demonstrative plea to not give up and keep her on as a friend, something that she sees Marlin desperately needs. The scene does not at all feel out place in this tightly paced film.<br/><br/>The reason this film works is because these fish seem human and because the fish display their voice's owners great. Even if you've just seen the previews for ""The In-Laws,"" you can see that Albert Brooks has experience playing the nervous, frantic, neurotic worrywart. Marlin's facial expressions even resemble a few of Brooks'. Dafoe's Gill is edgy, but has a hint of quiet desperation lined with hope of getting back to his home waters and out of that awful tank. But the real scene stealer is DeGeneres as Dory. Scatterbrained, peppy, light-hearted, and caring with an obvious intelligence, Dory is simply the core of the film. DeGeneres deserves an Oscar nomination for such a fine performance."

","Finding Nemo contains a message slightly more complex than usually associated with family films, but as written and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, it's eloquently presented in a context that carries it through with potency. Stanton doesn't shy away from trauma -- the film contains its share, including an opening tragedy that rivals the shooting of Bambi's mother, but also pays respect to the precarious and predatory nature of undersea life. Everything is part of the food chain in the nautical world. It's the best circle of life message since Disney's The Lion King.<br/><br/>The film is awash in humor -- the sharks, for instance, are fearsome in their toothy glory. But these guys are also going through a 12-Step program -- ""Fish are friends, not food "" -- adding a wacky hilarity (when one of them goes for Marlin, the other two rush to block, crying out ""Intervention! ""). One of the movie's funniest bits is also one of its most dazzling, as Marlin and Dory encounter a school of fish who, as a collective, are adept at impersonations. Finding Nemo keeps the excitement quotient on high -- sometimes a little too high, as the action gets to be dizzying in spots. And the narrative transitions between the ocean and the dentist's office are structurally awkward.<br/><br/>The film possesses a luster and beauty never before seen in an animated film, computer or otherwise. The refraction of light, the gentle, cresting wave of sea anemones, the constant flutter of fish, sets up a background environment that is constantly in motion. The computing power alone needed to render this kind of realism is staggering. Finding Nemo lures you into its world, to the point where you feel almost as though you are floating under the sea. It's a remarkable achievement, a perfect pairing of genuine artistry with technology.<br/><br/>Stanton and co-director Lee Unkrich coax stunning vocal performances out of an A-List cast. Albert Brooks, one of my own personal favorites, gives an anything-but-floundering performance as Marlin, the consummate neurotic-yet-loving parent. But it's DeGeneres who steals every frame of film as Dory, who, in an inspired touch, has no short-term memory. And you will not soon forget the brilliantly funny sequence in which Dory attempts to communicate with a whale. DeGeneres transcends the character's surface humor and winds up providing the film's most poignant, heartfelt performance. If there were an Oscar for best portrayal of a tropical fish, our Ellen would win by more than a fin."

","It's been seven years since Pixar unleashed Toy Story 2, the first full-length computer animated feature film, on the world, and what a wild, whimsical ride it was. Working in tandem with Disney (an association perilously close to ending), Pixar has provided several equally wondrous rides -- Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., all of which contained themes and characters perfectly suited to the hyper-realistic computer-generated style of animation. Pixar's films feature carefully crafted narratives, simple but not simplistic, offering an ebb and flow of action-stoked set pieces that, at best, stoke our adrenaline while keeping our funny bones on vibrating overdrive.<br/><br/>For it's 2003 release -- and perhaps greatest -- achievement, Pixar looks into the majestic depths of the ocean. The result -- Finding Nemo -- is a movie of extraordinary visual spectacle, astonishing emotional depth, and brilliant voice acting (Ellen deserved an Oscar nomination). It's every bit as inventive as the Toy Story franchise, every bit as charming as Bug's Life, every bit as colorful and vibrant as Monster's Inc. But it's even more compelling, more emotionally driven than these precursors. Everything, in a sense, has led up to Nemo, the best of all possible computer animated worlds."

","I never thought I would rave about a movie about fish. Actually, this story is about much more than that. It is about family and love and a tender relationship between a father and a son. I am not going to lie. At the end of this movie, I really teared up and almost cried. This movie was very heartfelt and it's definitely, without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen this year.<br/><br/>The casting in this movie was sheer perfection. Brooks and Gould do great as the father and son, but the standout of the movie, is of course, Dory, voiced by the great Ellen DeGeneres. This is the best voice-over work since Robin Williams in Aladdin. A truly stellar voice over job with so many LOL moments. Also great was the 'tank gang,' as I like to call them. Great voice-over works from Garrett, Dafoe, and Janney.<br/><br/>The script for this movie is so fresh and so amazing that it crosses age barriers. It is a simple story that goes very far.<br/><br/>Two 50 year-old, a 19 year-old, and a year-old all laughed equally during this movie. It truly is a movie for all ages. A funny and heart-tugging story for everyone.<br/><br/>Nothing more to say that hasn't already. This is one GREAT movie."

","The latest in a string of tightly written and superbly animated features from Pixar Studios, who have risen to become gods of animation. Finding Nemo begins with one of the darkest openings in Disney cartoon history, telling the story of a father clown-fish named Merlin who loses his wife and all but one of his hundreds of fish eggs in a tragedy destined to make you think twice about ordering fish and chips for dinner. Marlin becomes the over-protective father of Nemo, his sole surviving child who is kidnapped by a scuba diving dentist and placed in a fish tank in his operating room. Thus the search begins, and Marlin must travel through the Great Barrier Reef to rescue his son, conquering his fears and meeting all sorts of strange and interesting creatures on the way (Bruce, a shark battling a ravishing fish addiction, is particularly memorable) The story thrives on simplicity, riding a singular concept all the way to a gloriously satisfying conclusion, and the script is choc-a-block full of gags and one-liners that are genuinely funny for all ages. This, in fact, is the perfect family movie: gorgeous to look at, tightly wound and high-octane, without a trace of pretension or dumb-downed ideals that so frequently condescend the younger market. Finding Nemo is one of the best animated films ever made, a glorious awe-inspiring tale comparable to classics like The Lion King."

","Finding Nemo is undoubtedly one of the best animated movies of all time. It represents Pixar's crowning achievement, which they have been unable to top before or since. Aside from a funny, interesting, and engaging story, it features stunning CGI used in, as always, Pixar's creative and never-boring manner. Written, directed, and voice acted to perfection, it will stand as a monument of amazing film-making for both kids and adults for years to come.<br/><br/>We are introduced at the beginning to a married clown fish couple: Marlin and Coral. They are ready to settle down on the edge of the ocean and start a family; in a little cove in the cliff rest over 400 eggs just about ready to hatch. As we all know, an evil barracuda comes along and eats both Coral and nearly all the 400 eggs, leaving only Marlin and a cracked/bruised egg that eventually grows up to be Nemo. On his first day of school, though, he gets caught by fishermen and taken to a dentist's house in Sydney. Thus, Marlin, worried sick about his son, sets off on a long quest to rescue little Nemo.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning, the relationship between Nemo and Marlin is perfect. As father and son, they are completely believable and we instantly fall in love with both of them. We can feel Marlin's heartbreak over his son who has been stolen from him. The entire cast of voice actors was perfectly chosen, with one particular one worth mentioning: Ellen Degeneres as Dory. If anybody else had voiced the blue and yellow short-term memory loss fish, she would have come off as annoying and pointless. Degeneres plays her just perfectly so that we can't help but like her. Willem Dafoe is also particularly noteworthy. His role as Gill is just creepy/mysterious/fatherly enough that the kind of presence his little fish body exudes is impressive.<br/><br/>The conciseness of the movie was quite well done too. In an age where Pixar movies are getting longer and longer (both Cars and The Incredibles nearly exceeded the two hour mark) this one seems just about perfectly the right length; not too short, not too long. Character development is thus heightened and enhanced because of this; we don't see so much of these fish that we get sick of them, but we see just enough that we kind of hunger for more. The way Marlin's and Dory's friendship grows throughout the movie is also really impressive. All the side characters in the movie, too, (such as Nigel the pelican, Crush the turtle, and Bruce the shark) are so colorful and full of life that never once do they come off as gimmicks or fillers. Everything in Finding Nemo serves a purpose for something else - there is no wasted space.<br/><br/>The score, though nothing extraordinary, is still amazing and superbly fits well into the framework of the movie. Nothing really stands out as ""hey this is Finding Nemo music"", but that's okay. It always takes a backseat to the story - never pushing itself so far forward that it eclipses the characters. Another bonus - there are no songs, besides ""Beyond The Sea"", but that only plays during the credits. Oh yes, and of course Dory's eternal: ""Just keep swimming, just keep swimming..."" If you haven't seen Finding Nemo yet, you are missing out on one of the greatest classics to ever swim in the sea. It is so perfectly put together, and is such a pure and fun movie. If you have seen it, though, go ahead and see it again. It's that good."

","What can I say about this movie? One word - Brilliant. Pixar have had a long track record of having yet to make anything less than a very good film but even though its almost unanimously agreed that all of them have been great, it seems everyone still has their preferences. To give you an idea of my taste I just adore ""A Bug's Life"" which I think is pretty much a pitch perfect movie with great characters and story. I enjoyed ""Toy Story"" but wasn't a huge fan of it, the sequel however is an absolute classic hands down. After 'Bugs' and 'TS2' though came ""Monsters Inc"" which again was a really good movie but I wasn't a huge fan of as the ""Where the Wild Things Are""-cloned concept was fine but like TS1 the film got too juvenile and sentimentally sweet for me with the humor just worth the odd giggle more than anything else and only the awesome 'doors' sequence standing out in my mind.<br/><br/>'Nemo' however has now taken the crown - its at least equal best with TS2 and the more I think about it the more its rising to be stand out Number One. EVERYTHING about this movie is practically flawless - the animation, the characters, the story, the emotional resonance, the humor, etc. is incredible. Its a film you can't help but get swept up in right from the get-go, in fact I can't remember a film where I really ran the gamut of emotions from happy and awed to despair and terror - and this film manages to do all that in just the opening five-minute sequence. Its a 100 minute underwater road movie but never ever gets slow or tired and even some Disney-style father-son sentimentality bits oddly enough generate genuine heart and warmth.<br/><br/>*Ellen DeGeneres deserved an Osar nomination for her flawless performance as Dory."

","As a 16 year old, i think of myself as still a child in many ways! My love of Disney Films being one of them. However, i find Finding Nemo is one of a dying breed... a Disney film which is actually good. OK, no matter what Disney films will always be here to delight children, but there are few Disney films being produced at the moment that seem to hold parents and children alike. Now it seems that a lot of the time Disney are just cashing in. EVERYTHING has a sequel! And none of the sequels are half as good as the original. I think the Pixar/Disney collaboration has been good. As i said, Finding Nemo is an amazing Disney film that has many of the memorable characters and witty lines that makes it a film sure to be remembered for years to come. I think Disney should stick to the new ideas for movies. New Stories. You don't need to make 7 Lion King movies or Aladdin movies for kids to still love the characters. The Land Before Time film from Universal was quite probably one of if not my favourite film when i was a kid. Now you look at Sky movies and they are showing Land Before Time IX and even more! So i say keep making stand alone films with the quality, care and thought that you put into Finding Nemo and you'll remain a success forever.<br/><br/>That's my two cents on that then! Hee hee x"

"elb62886","10","0","2","1 May 2006"," Finding Nemo review
","Three years ago, Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar teamed up to release Finding Nemo to the masses. The hit children's underwater adventure video is an animated story based on a rebelliously independent young clownfish and his overprotective father's inability to let go. Enticed by a witty trailer and a captivating graphical design, Finding Nemo attracted a wide audience to the theatres. Digitally mastered and exquisitely written, Finding Nemo premiered May 3rd, 2003, as a G rated, light hearted, animated production geared towards children. The familiar voices of main characters, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) and Marlin (Albert Brooks) teamed up in an encore partnership, returning from 1998's Dr. Dolittle. The hour and 44 minute presentation that brought over $300 million to the box office in its first week in the theatres. The script is a roller-coaster of friendly humor, written by Andrew Stanton and is sincerely thought provoking for Disney's adult viewers. Finding Nemo is sure to become a childhood classic. The opening scene is at Nemo's elementary school. Marlin, the widowed single parent, introduces Nemo to his teacher as a timid student, who requires extra attention for his special needs. Crowds will chuckle at the cynical humor, merciless mimicking students in the background and defining sarcastic gestures in this scene. Taunted by his peers, Nemo challenges his father, swimming farther and farther out into the abyss, towards a row boat at the surface. By the time Marlin catches his curiously disobedient son in the act, he swam far away from the group and was at the surface. The authors' creative expressiveness and ingenuity with the line ""he touched the butt!"" is innocent enough for six year olds to repeat, and at the same time harmlessly pokes fun at the daily trials parents face with young children. With the conscious lesson that every ill minded action has consequences, the row boat unexpectedly carries Nemo away from his home. Marlin enlists into a desperate rescue attempt for his beloved son and soon encounters Dory, the annoying travel companion with the funky problem of poor short term memory. In their travels, Marlin and Dory accidentally stumble upon two great white sharks. Instantly intrigued, Dory tries to make new friends, while Marlin backs off because of preconceived stereotypes about vicious great white sharks. As it turns out the two have joined to form an anti fish eating support group. With a membership pledge of ""fish are friends, not food"", Marlin and Dory escape a near death experience. In this fast paced scene that speaks to breaking stereotypes, adults will pick up on the parody on the politics of vegetarianism and a poke at ""meaningless"" support groups. Some of the content in this two minute scene may frighten younger viewers, as the loud noises, exploding mines and sharks with big scary teeth dominate the screen. Pressing on with the goal of finding his son in Sydney, Marlin and Dory ride the East Australian Current with a huge pack of sea turtles, and Marlin has a chance to tell his epic story. One of the elder turtles and an experienced parent, Crush (voice of Andrew Stanton) listens in, imparts some wisdom, and helps Marlin regain a firm a grasp on life. His advice, and the movie's main message, is that children are going to grow up and that part of successful parenting is letting them go and watching them. You have to know that you have done all you can for your children and that they have learned well. The climax of the movie is this scene, where Marlin realizes his error and finally begins to believe in his son. As the music tempo accelerates, the current quickens and the scene makes a dramatic switch back to a comedic tone, keeping children on the edge of their toes and leaving adults satisfied with the depth of content matter. Having arrived in Sydney, Marlin immediately jumps back into the search for his son. While the graphics change with the new on-land scenery, their impressive Pixar quality remains. New sounds from the city and music perfectly accompany every plot curve as the two fish face new challenges of human and bird interaction. A pelican named Nigel flies in to save the two fish from a particularly hungry flock of seagulls placing bids on their next meal, saying ""Mine! Mine! Mine!"" in their thick Australian brogue. The creative scripting is again paired with a hidden message of parenting that sometimes you need to take a risk and trust other people. Finding Nemo is a fantastic film, with much thought, enthusiasm and heart behind the plot, animation and message. Finding Nemo leaves Mom and Dad with a feeling of parental community in that they are not alone in their struggles with parenting. The innocent humor and narrative plot leaves children wanting to watch the movie several times over and quote their favorite lines with friends. The movie is appropriate for all children ages six and older and all adults who are young at heart. The underlying comedy and animation in this film hides a message that speaks of social issues, politics and parenting, which makes Finding Nemo a great movie for children and adults alike. Disney's Finding Nemo jumps a full step above Toy Story and does not even compare to the original classics like Cinderella, winning an Oscar Award and Best Animated Children's movie in the 2004 Academy Awards."
"JerseyJoanna","10","0","2","25 April 2006"," ""Finding Nemo"" is a great example of the genius of the folks at Pixar.
","I have always been a fan of animated movies and, starting with Toy Story, I've become increasingly impressed at what can be accomplished with computer animation. ""Finding Nemo"" is a great example of the genius of the folks at Pixar.<br/><br/>The story is the parent-searches-for-lost-child plot in an aquatic setting. What is truly amazing is the artists' ability to turn fish into realistic characters. They carry all of the same kinds of insecurities and faults that humans do. Marlin's insecurity about becoming a parent comes back to slap him in the face during his fight with Nemo at the drop-off. The artists are able to convey expressions so well. Marlin's confusion when confronted with Dory's short-term memory problems is clearly communicated before he even opens his mouth to demand what's going on. The scars that you see on Gill  and later on Dory  are just an example of the level of detail achieved.<br/><br/>The voice talent for this film is outstanding and greatly contributes to the believability of the characters. Albert Brooks is the perfect choice for the paranoid Marlin. The eternal optimist / mental sieve, Dory, is excellently voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. The voice of Gill, the scheming tribe leader of the fish tank, is provided by Willem Dafoe. The towering Brad Garrett is a fitting match for Bloat, the largest tank fish who needs assistance deflating after puffing himself up. Other actors lending their voices are Alexander Gould (Nemo), Elizabeth Perkins (Coral), Geoffrey Rush (Nigel), and John Ratzenberger (Fish School).<br/><br/>Writer-director Andrew Stanton provides the voice of Crush, the 150-year-old sea turtle. The choice to give the sea turtles the attitudes and speech patterns of surfers was inspired. Life moves at a slower pace, and they ride the currents much like surfers ride the waves.<br/><br/>The success of ""Finding Nemo"" is well-earned. It is clear that a great deal of thought went into the making of this movie. Everything from the characters to the environments was masterfully done."

There were no cheap innuendos, nothing but good clean fun. At the same time, it was never stupid or clownish (no pun intended). I would really like the creators of this film to know that I appreciated their work as being an effort in ""using one's powers for good, not evil."" In addition, I'm sure that people who have similar dilemmas in their family life: children with special needs, parents who are overprotective, or anyone with a loss or grief in their family, will feel especially attuned to this film.

","I guess that what truly differentiates the children's movies that my generation has grown up watching from those of previous generations is the various references to other things (think the popular culture references in ""Shrek"" I and II, and the genie's Rodney Dangerfield and Jack Nicholson imitations in ""Aladdin""). ""Finding Nemo"" brilliantly continues this. It focuses on Marlin (Albert Brooks), a tense clown-fish searching for his son Nemo, who got caught by an Australian dentist. Along the way, Marlin meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a big blue fish with short-term memory. Maybe it sounds too wimpy to say that the movie is about the importance of having solid relationships in one's life, but you might say that.<br/><br/>And the popular culture references? I never would have imagined a kids' movie spoofing scenes from Alfred Hitchcock's and Stanley Kubrick's movies, but they do it here. I don't know how they did it, but they did it. A very well done movie. Also starring Willem Dafoe, Brad Garrett, Allison Janney, Austin Pendleton, Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana (those last two of course later co-starred in ""Munich"")."

","This movie was a very family friendly and funny movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. Great voice work really makes this one, as both Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenerous do outstanding jobs with their characters. I especially enjoy Ellen's spacey character, that does not have to good of a memory, but is so cute in her delivery. I love the part where she takes her turn at the shark intervention. Great scenes everywhere as the father goes looking for his son Nemo who is captured and placed in an aquarium of a dentist. In the tank are some of the most neurotic fish ever, including one determined to escape the tank. They all band together when it is found out that Nemo is going to be given to the dentist's niece who lets just say isn't very good with handling fish. Nemo's father faces many perils in the quest for his son including jellyfish, a lantern fish, a whale, seagulls, and many other very funny perils. So watch this movie and enjoy as it is one of the better computer generated movies I have seen with great voice acting. I enjoyed almost every minute though the opening is a bit sad it makes up for it with great comedy...look for John Ratzenberg as a very funny school of fish and check the end where the flaw in the escape plan is obvious."

In each film we find interesting characters, a funny and colorful setting, and creative ideas. But in all of them, the story is set in a different world or different world with little emphasis on how they would react to our world.<br/><br/>In Finding Nemo we get that sense. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is the clown fish father of young Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) and it is Nemo's first day of school.

They are living in the Great Barrier Reef and the coral reefs are safe but beyond is unknown and dangerous.<br/><br/>After being embarrassed in front of his friends, Nemo decides to swim out and touch a boat to challenge his father.

","""Finding Nemo"" finds the Pixar animation studio back in top form after their somewhat disappointing (I thought) ""Monsters, Inc."" This group has always had a knack for finding source material that will give them full freedom in unleashing their animation imaginations (the toy-chest world of ""Toy Story,"" the insect world of ""A Bug's Life,"") and in ""Finding Nemo"" they take us underwater and show us the beauty, wonder, and danger of the sea. There are any number of jaw-dropping set pieces in this film: a field of jellyfish, a shark attack, a mass escape from a fishing net. As usual, Disney fills its film with liberal messages about the treatment of wildlife and the environment, much welcome and needed messages in my opinion. But great animation alone cannot sell me on an animated movie--that's done with the quality of the story and characters, and ""Finding Nemo"" delivers there as well. The Pixar movies are never as cloying as the traditionally animated films produced by Disney--there's always a drier, cheekier brand of humour, and you get the feeling that just as many jokes are aimed at the adult audience as at the kids. The voices are terrific, the story is quick and funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Grade: A"

"DavidSim240183","9","0","1","26 January 2005"," My favourite Pixar film.
","In recent years I've become quite a fan of Pixar, the best distributor of computer animated fare at the moment. And just this Christmas, I've seen three of their films. Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. Finding Nemo is my favourite one, and even though it has the weakest plot, it manages to be wonderfully entertaining.<br/><br/>Pixar have established themselves as quite a force to be reckoned with in this day and age of computer animation. The only one to oppose them is DreamWorks, and they always seem to be one step behind. But despite that, the advent of CG animation will make the time-honoured cartoons of old obsolete when compared to the stunning visuals of Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Our fishy tale begins along the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. Two clownfish, Marlin and Coral (voiced by Al Brooks and Elizabeth Perkins) live on the Drop-Off, which is the last stop before open sea. They're about to become proud parents, which is unfortunately cut short when a passing shark eats Coral and all of their babies. Only one survived, which Marlin names Nemo.<br/><br/>Marlin has become very overprotective of Nemo, and is always stifling him. On Nemo's first day of school, father and son get into an argument over Marlin's overbearing protectiveness. But fate decides to plunge Marlin and Nemo into adventures of their own. Nemo has the bad luck of being captured by a scuba diver, and taken to a dentist's fish tank in Sydney, where he will be a gift to the dentist's niece, the dreadful Darla.<br/><br/>While Nemo plots an escape with the tropical fish he's sharing the tank with, Marlin must now conquer his fears of the ocean, and mount a rescue mission. With the aid of an absent-minded fish called Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), our mismatched travelling companions brave one life threatening situation after another in the great depths of the ocean to find Nemo.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is admittedly very thin on plot, and I was initially surprised that it got rave reviews. I was expecting it to be terrible, and although a little overrated, it is a great adventure to see. With a colourful range of quirky characters and breathtaking effects the most hardened cynic will be swept along for the ride.<br/><br/>Al Brooks is suitably neurotic as Marlin, who has become so paranoid after the loss of his family. I can't help but wonder that if it were Woody Allen as Marlin, it would have been a more grating performance. Brooks makes for a refreshing alternative.<br/><br/>But the real star of the film is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. She injects a great deal of pathos into the role, and she is side-splitting with the way she's in two minds about everything because of her terrible memory. That type of routine could have become very tiresome quickly, but she manages to find ways to keep the routine funny. She also makes a very endearing double-act with Brooks.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe brings a sense of class and dignity to the character of Gill, one of Nemo's tank-mates. He orchestrates escape plans that are quite brilliant, e.g. jamming the filter in the tank, and escaping through the tube, all drains lead to the ocean, etc.<br/><br/>The rest of the Tank Gang are all quirky in their own way, and have gone a bit nutty after being cooped up in a tank. Nigel the pelican is a great character, especially since he's willing to help Nemo find his father, and the Tank Gang to escape. One of Disney's optimistic messages about animals willing to help others, but it works. I'm also very partial to Peach, the star-fish who talks like a brash New Yorker who keeps a lookout for the rest of the Tank Gang.<br/><br/>The different escapades our heroes get into are both funny and exciting. From sharks that are trying to go vegetarian (but not quite succeeding) to a terrifying angler-fish, a school of fish with a talent for impressions, swarms of jellyfish, laid-back turtles, a whale, the ocean never seemed so crowded, and dangerous.<br/><br/>This includes Nemo's adventures in the fish tank too. You might think they would be boring, but they include some of the film's best moments. The scenes with Darla are hysterical as the spoilt brat who's also a borderline psycho (the film makes a pun out of that!). I don't want to reveal too much though because the surprises are one of the film's many pleasures.<br/><br/>As far as computer animation goes, Finding Nemo is a visual treat. The ocean has exotic colours, and is also murky which is more believable. All the fish are dazzling to look at, the fish tank looks great, and even the scenes of Sydney above water have an uncanny realism to them (check out the Sydney Opera House).<br/><br/>This is one film where adults don't have to be ashamed to be seen in a cinema watching Finding Nemo. There are enough sly in-jokes and film references to entertain them, and lively escapism for the kids. Still, some scenes might be frightening for them, and a little intense, so just be warned.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo has great characters, stunning visuals, and great music too that adds up to a film that is colourful, consistently inventive, and an absolute pleasure to sit through."

","Pixar has done it again, lending their spectacular, realistic visual work to a delightful, fruitful, and entertaining setting and story. They always manage to make their characters (whatever species they are) appear less robotic and superficial, and more human and understandable, and in ""Finding Nemo"", the clownfish, bluefish, blowfish, sharks, turtles, seagulls, etc. are very funny, delightful, and somewhat lovable, in this entertaining, if kiddish, underwater adventure. The story involves an overprotective, overanxious clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is on a perilous quest to find his escaped and abducted son, Nemo, and must plight throughout the Pacific Ocean, with the help of many underwater creatures, in order to prove what kind of loving, devoted father he is. Along his way, Marlin befriends a forgetful and peculiar bluefish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who provides most of the signature Disney humor throughout the film, a gang of ""fish deprived"" sharks, a troop of turtles (""Grab shell, Dude!""), some seagulls, a few other fish, and many more, including some unpleasant acquaintances, such as stinging jellyfish, angry lightning-fish, and savage sharks, all in a delightful, thrilling, and entertaining adventure. Meanwhile, Nemo has been placed inside a Dentist's tank somewhere in Australia and makes friends of his own, learning to adapt to confined waters. What I enjoyed the most about this film was the refreshing and realistic look of the water- one really feels they are situated inside an ocean, ""along for the ride"", with the marvelous animation of Pixar, which is always effective. Admittedly, some of the dialog here is somewhat bland and clichÃ©, and oftentimes Dory becomes more of an annoyance than a funny diversion, and there is a prevalence of wanton sentimentality here that is expected of a Disney family film. Yet, the story is delightful and entertaining, the characters are mostly funny and memorable, the visuals are awesome and splendid, and ""Finding Nemo"" is genuinely a step above the usual Disney family fare.

And not in the way that most kid films do, that are merely bearable and faintly amusing at best to anyone above the age of 14. Finding Nemo has a couple of essentials for all age groups: for kids, there is the moral of the story, the cute and funny characters (think the albatros and the turtle), and of course the happy ending. For adolescents and grown-ups, there are contemporary movie references, and more 'grown-up' jokes that might be hard to grasp for little kids. The amazing animation is always a huge added bonus for anyone who really pays attention to the movie, and would be worth going to the movies for even if the story was only so-so and the dialogue boring. <br/><br/>I know this whole age-group thing because after finally convincing my cousins, who are both boys (ages 10 and 12), to go with me, they watched it and actually enjoyed it. So did a very large part of people my age (16) and my parents have actually seen it twice. <br/><br/>Finding Nemo is a truly great move, and perfect to watch when you don't want to see something complicated, but are more in the mood for something uplifting yet still with substance.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Finding Nemo is one of the all-time animated feature i've ever seen, it should of gotten nominated for Best Picture and it was the best film of 2003!! It's one of the most visually, entertaining & classic animated films in years. Albert Brooks & Ellen Degeneres (especially) did their most & unforgettable performances of their career and had many memorable lines!! Others did excellent, Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) made a memorable Australain pelican and Gill (Willem Dafoe) did well, too. One of greatest animated films ever made and funniest. It's one of Pixar's best. It was like i said, the best film of 2003. Pixar are just unstoppable!!"

","An animated film, on the life in the ocean. This was the film I was waiting for. Hats off to Pixar studio, for making such an amazing film. They explored a whole lot of space left in the world the ocean. An also a story about a father who is in search of his son, it sounds a little schmaltzy, but you will love this emotion when you watch the film Marlin is the father who is in search of his son Nemo. His son is trapped by the fishermen and is now in an aquarium in a dentist's room.<br/><br/>All the characters in the fish tank were amazing The most amazing fish (character) was Dory who helps Marlin in finding her son. And the fun part is that she has a short term memory loss. This added the funny flavor to the film. And the sharks who take an oath that they will never eat a fish were the funniest of them all. This film is for everybody in the family. I rate this film 9/10"

","This movie is one of the best I've seen. It managed to be entertaining and hilarious all the way through. Ellen DeGeneres makes a great Dory and Nicholas Bird's cute voice is just perfect for Squirt. And you gotta admire how they used real Aussie actors for parts such as the sharks (I hate fake accents). It's an entertaining, hilarious, amily film (and you don't have to have a family to enjoy it!) I think it deserved the Oscar. The DVD commentary is amusing and informational(unlike ""it was great working with this person"" crap).It includes an audio track and some nice visual commentary. Anyways, its a clever CGI picture. 10/10"

And she was right! <br/><br/>I consider this beautiful movie more of family genre, rather than a children movie. It's something enjoyable for the whole family -- with a simple yet nice story of the search of a father for his ""lost"" son, adorable characters (for example, the vegetarian Shark, whose ""na(i)me is Bruce"") and beautiful animation. Then there is the adorable Dory, whose efforts at helping Nemo's father to locate him is often jeopardized by her short-term memory loss.

"rapt0r_claw-1","10","0","2","7 August 2004"," A perfect comedy, well-timed, well-written, and a magnificent feast for the eyes.
","'Finding Nemo' is a Pixar film that upholds the studio's great tradition: terrorizing the rest of the industry with the quality of their films, leaving others at a loss as to how they can compete. The story is simple and straightforward: an overprotective father clownfish traverses the ocean that petrifies him in search of his son, who has been relocated to a seaside dentist's office by divers and kept in an aquarium. The film may not have succeeded so blatantly as it did if Nemo hadn't been landed amongst a plethora of comical roommates, while Marlin's pleasantly forgetful companion, Dory, miraculously manages to be funnier than any of them.<br/><br/>'Nemo' abounds with characters as colorful as the reef itself, brilliantly realized. The simplicity of the story is countered by the obstacles Marlin faces, from deep-sea anglerfish that gives little kids the heebie-jeebies to titanic but likable sharks, trying to defeat their 'addiction' to seafood. The visual effects are spectacular. Never has water, lighting, color, texture, and photorealism been so convincing, let alone all these milestones being achieved in the 95-minute running time of a single picture. 'Finding Nemo' is truly special in this, and although Pixar's self-produced Marionette software has already won an Academy Award, I think it should win again, as the AMPAS can't possibly have foreseen the heights it would reach. Long live Pixar! (10/10)"

I ver much enjoyed this movie and now theres a lot of stuff like bags and t sirts mugs etc out with finding nemo on them, showing me that Finding Nemo has been a big seller and shall continue to entertain people whilst it is being seen.

"erwan_ticheler","9","0","1","29 July 2004"," Disney's best effort since THE JUNGLE BOOK
","I'm a big fan of the classic Disney era(late thirties throughout the forties),I don't really like the modern movies.Movies like FANTASIA and DUMBO are from that time and these two are my favorite Disney movies.Since that period only JUNGLE BOOK really lives up to my expectations.Now finally,Disney created a new animation classic:FINDING NEMO.A lot of this success is thanks to Pixar,the computer animation company that created a new world in animation.<br/><br/>FINDING NEMO leans very much on the old success movie DUMBO.Both have got a troubled parent-child relationship(Dumbo and his mother versus Nemo and Marlin)together with a troubled child-friend relationship(Dumbo and his buddy Timothy Mouse versus Nemo and his girlfriend Dory)and in both movies the leading character has got a physical handicap,Dumbo with his big ears and Nemo with a short fin. Besides that FINDING NEMO is still an original tale in itself.<br/><br/>FINDING NEMO has got several references to old films like JAWS,THE GREAT ESCAPE,PSYCHO and THE BIRDS.It is probably the only movie that has put both PSYCHO and THE BIRDS imitations in the space of 5 minutes. There is also a nice reference to the Disney short TUGBOAT MICKEY.<br/><br/>The characters are very well worked out,Nemo is very sympathetic and so is his dad.I must say that the presence of the shark Bruce is not very big in the movie and that's a bit of a shame.Another pretty annoying part is the ""whale language"" by Dory. The voices are not by the most famous of actors,but it's still very good.Willem Dafoe(PLATOON,MISSISSIPPI BURNING,BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER,LULU ON THE BRIDGE)is my favorite voice of the movie as he speaks for Gill.Other voices come from Albert Brooks(who had a supporting role in TAXI DRIVER)as Marlin and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory.<br/><br/>The computer animations are superb which makes it a very pleasant experience.  9/10"

"bsinc","7","0","2","21 July 2004"," A let down
","I just have to mention this first to anyone who's about to read this comment - I am not reviewing ""finding Nemo"" just as a movie for children, but as an adult who loves Pixar's animated movies and knows that other adults love them too. So, let me start by saying this is the 1st Pixar movie that I wasn't impressed with, and I actually never thought this could happen. So far their movies have been simply amazing and breathtaking, and the animation in ""Finding Nemo"" never ever embarrasses this statement. There were however a couple of problems that I simply couldn't forget.<br/><br/>-the character of Marlin. He's just to obnoxious and mistrusting to be anywhere near likable, let alone the quiet ""hero"" of the movie. I was sure that sooner or later he'd realize that he just has to loosen up and trust people, but he sadly never does. Even in the last scene where Nemo tries to save those fish he does't let him at first. and I know that he's just being protective and all, but isn't that just the whole point of the story, put in words by Crush the turtle; ""You don't really know? Like when they know you'll know, ya know?"". Him being over protective is just stupid but he never realizes his mistakes, which is the biggest reason why this movie blows. It just doesn't make sense - throughout the whole movie he just bitches about stuff that Dory suggests and even after realizing on many occasions that she was right he doesn't learn. <br/><br/>-Pixar is much more that this movie. Had they been their usual self they would have made it into one of the best movies of all time. I'm not kidding, throughout the whole movie I expected and guessed how the characters were going to evolve and roughly what was going to happen, but hardly anything if it did, which was a shame because I came up with some great stuff in my mind. I should have written about it immediately after the movie because I forgot most of it. Most importantly, they should have changed the scene where Bruce chases Marlin and Dory. Why you ask? I'll tell you why. It's because of a certain movie called ""Jaws"". And to make a counter effect Pixar could do some good by not portraying every single shark as a vicious killer. Granted Bruce & co have the vegetarian thing going on, but after smelling blood he turns into the usual killing machine and it just ruins the whole concept. The scene should have looked something like this. After smelling the blood, getting his killer eyes and his killer cravings back he should have said, in a controlled, yet tempted fashion, something like: ""daaaarn mate , your AB- sure gives me the munchies!"" Then. for a moment, he'd be very very tempted and start munching his mouth. And then Dori'd see what he's thinking and she'd smack him on his nose so he'd just kind of snap out of it, first excusing himself, but then saying ""Hey Dori, you wouldn't mind doing me a small favor, would you?"" Dori: ""Sure:). Just name it"" Fade to black for half a second. We see them both moving slowly in circle, Bruce just behind her, with a kind of hypnotized and silly goofy-happy look on his face, kind of praying, yet knowing that he must not hurt her(a kind of therapy if you will). And Dori is all worked up and having fun because she's leading him around in circles as if he was hunting her, but knowing very well that he just needs to work on his veggy thing some more. And that's how you do it!<br/><br/>-next, what on earth were the writers thinking when they just left the tank fish to save themselves. It had to be the saddest and most shocking thing in the whole movie for me because it was so mean of Nemo & co to forget his buddies. <br/><br/>Pixar really should have though this one through. They could have made a movie that was environmentally (even politically!!!)conscious, be a breakthrough movie where sharks weren't killers first, friends later, showed how animals are easily mistreated by humans(OK, they actually have this one), show how parents can be overprotective and not realize when their children should have the right to make their own decision, show how children shouldn't disobey parents too often, just about anything they could think of. The saddest part is that they have every single thing I just wrote in the movie, they just don't use them to their fullest potential or miss them completely.<br/><br/>Otherwise a fairly decent movie that probably looked amazing in the cinema. 7/10"

","`Finding Mula' should the title for the sequel to `Finding Nemo'. Yea! That's it! Here's the hook: Nemo discovers he has a long lost sister, and daddy Marlin (not Jack Mckeon) are on a quest to find sister Mula. Ok! Ok! I know! Sounds kind of fishy! Actually, the `Finding Mula' I am referring to are the astronomical profits of `Finding Nemo'. This is the supreme jewel from the Disney/Pixar winning collaboration. Oceanography will never be the same because of the film's existentialism cinematography. Moreover, the screenplay of Nemo is in the school of the great Disney comical scribes. The acting voices were also primo! Albert Brooks as the neurotic Marlin was simply in the class of Fisher Island. We should also thank the wit queen Ellen Degeneres for her generosity here for her work as the memory-challenged Dory. It was `adoryble'!

I wonder why that is, when most adults don't sit through half of them unless they have a toddler pulling on their pinky finger.<br/><br/>The thing I loved the most about this movie was the lessons it taught you about accepting people the way they are - they don't have to be all a like to be cool - and try your hardest even when you think there's not much chance of success. Against all odds, Nemo found his way back home and everyone lived happily after, and it was so much fun along the way seeing the different fish-people he met and got to love. He was so loveably naive and that made it give you heart pains that much more. <br/><br/>A great movie to see with your kids and talk about afterward.

"gcrokus","Null","0","1","3 June 2004"," All About The Reef
","In `Finding Nemo' we have not only a movie designed for adults and children but a tour-de-force in computerized animation.  The obvious attention by the filmmakers to real environments is underscored by our constant study of the screen; there is, like on a real reef, frenetic activity in all of our view.<br/><br/>	Following the adventures of a father fish (Marlin, voice of Albert Brooks) in pursuit of his kidnapped (by a diver to his aquarium) son (Nemo, voice of Alexander Gould) we meet a bevy of characters along the way.   In turn we have fish schools (both of an academic nature and the more easily imagined natural sea configuration), non-traditional sharks, turtles and a host of other ocean creatures anthropomorphically styled.  There is nearly no end to the pleasure received from each animated revelation. <br/><br/>        The obvious care with which the undersea environment is depicted speaks volumes for the research done by the studio artists.  With nearly all contemporary eyes cast heavenwards, it still remains that the vitality of reef life forms serve as a perfect centerpiece for cartoon mayhem.      <br/><br/>
	During one particular chase scene involving sharks we see at its best the dynamic plasticity of animated characters; that quality of animators to stretch the physical reality of any corporeal subject, i.e, the mashing of an impassively expressionless fishes' face as it strikes an object, encouraging empathetic discomfort on the part of the viewer.  This is abstraction at its finest, since it imbues the pratfall with fantasy. 	<br/><br/>	There is a scene involving Dory meeting a whale that is for our money the funniest one moment ever recorded in animated film.   Combined with the entire body of work Ellen Degeneres offers towards the success of `Nemo' we see her in an entirely new light.<br/><br/>	That  `Nemo' is one of the best animated films ever made is in little doubt.  This is a true four-star effort; there is not one flaw evident.  Or to put it another way, what would you have done differently?"

","When I knew that Disney is going to stop making animated films such as Peter Pan or Aladdin, and that is going to make only films with Pixar (computer, computer, computer...), I felt sad. Disney has been with me since I was 3 or 4 and it's a pity that the great designers who work there stop doing such masterpieces. But if you see 'Finding Nemo' everything changes. I think I've never seen a film as good as this is. It's incredible how perfect the ocean and all its animals are designed: the vegetarian sharks (I love Bruce when he smells the blood!), Nemo and his father, the teacher Ray and all his pupils or the little octopus who loses ink. If you watch this film, you'll laugh, you'll feel like crying and you won't want to eat fish never in your life (at least in my case). The first thing I've said, laughing, is the biggest part of the film. In my opinion, Dory would win an Oscar for making me laugh without stopping when she starts to speak whale language or because of her loss of memory. According to the moving moments, what happens at the beginning would make anyone cry, it's very sad. And the most moving scene for me is when there are fishermen in a ship, at the end . And that's why I don't want to eat fish again!! I'm not going to say anything, just watch it! I recommend everybody to do it. You won't lose your time, trust me!!"
"Li-1","Null","0","4","7 May 2004"," Pixar's funniest to date.
","*** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Sure, the message of this flick (parents should have as much respect for their children as said children should have for them) is pure bland Disney all the way, but there's no denying that Finding Nemo is the funniest and most visually complex Pixar effort to date. And consistent laughs and great animation is all that I ask from such a picture.<br/><br/>The laughs are mostly the result of the film's many entertaining and unique characters, from Dory (voiced perfectly by Ellen Degeneres), the fish with short-term memory, to Australian-accented sharks and sea turtles that sound stoned. Ironically enough, it's arguable that the film's two least interesting characters are the clownfish themselves, Nemo and his dad Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks, who's generally funny but whose constant shouting can be a tad ear drum-piercing).<br/><br/>The story concerns these two clownfish, the only survivors from an attack by a barracuda. With his mate and the rest of his children dead, Marlin promises to always look over his remaining spawn, whom he dubs Nemo. But as time passes and Nemo has grown into a curious young fish, Marlin is still the most overprotective parent in the sea. In an act of defiance, Nemo swims too far from safe territory and is caught by a scuba diver and placed into the aquarium of his office. Desperate to find his son, Marlin enlists the help of the forgetful Dory, and it's their long journey proves to be the highlight of this movie.<br/><br/>One of the film's smartest touches is dividing the screen time between Marlin's journey and Nemo's interaction with the other sea life in his aquarium. In fact, the aquarium bunch boasts the film's most hilarious mixture of eccentric characters, led by the always memorable Willem Dafoe. Also very funny are Brad Garrett as a puffer fish and Allison Janney as a sea star (""Scum angel!"").<br/><br/>Adventure fans will probably also want to give the film a look. The search for Nemo consists of an abundance of obstacles that range from dangerous to amusing. The eye-popping visuals ensure that this is a movie that's always visually entrancing in one way or another, and there's so much attention to creating a detailed underwater environment that it's practically begging for repeat viewings (this isn't as rewatchable as, say, traditionally animated efforts like Lilo and Stitch or Treasure Planet, but it'll definitely hold up in the coming years). <br/><br/>Virtually every other Pixar picture I've seen either simply didn't provide much in the way of laughs (Toy Story 1 and 2) or just couldn't keep the momentum all the way through (Monster's Inc.). I consider Finding Nemo a lesson learned; even though it's actually the longest of Pixar's work to date (running at 100 minutes), the filmmakers realize we want to see adventure and laughs, not earnest attempts at sentimentality (though, as if it's requisite, we still have some sentimental moments).<br/><br/>Finding Nemo's pacing is probably the biggest concern, the middle segment is a tad slow and runs short on laughs compared to the much more enjoyable opening and closing half-hours. But that's only a minor complaint; be sure to stick for the final scenes, the funniest since, unbelievably enough, Stephen Sommers' horror/comedy Deep Rising; both actually boast an identical line of dialogue to wrap up the film."
"shoobie1","9","0","1","1 May 2004"," Great fun, always entertaining
","Finding Nemo is a modern animated masterpiece<br/><br/>I found this film thoroughly entertaining from start to finish! First of all the animation was fantastic, truly admirable. When the movie first came out, I immediately began to compare Finding Nemo to other recent animated classics (a la Shrek, Monster's Inc.) and found that it was surely a worthy adversary. Its plot, dialogue, and animation are all very original and Pixar seems to be always striving for a higher goal. Animators didn't simply do what had been done over and over again many times, but came up with something new and fresh to give audiences. And boy does it pay off.<br/><br/>
Not to mention Finding Nemo's enormous success in the box office, I have yet to hear someone nay-saying about this movie. This film can be enjoyed by anyone, any age. Animated movies are beginning to evolve to appeal to a variety of audiences, and Finding Nemo is a very good example. The comedic dialogue is hilarious on many levels, for kids and parents alike, which gives it added appeal and all the more fun. I also found the sloo of characters all unique and funny in their own simple way. Dory, Nemo, Marlin, Bruce (the shark), Nigel (the pelican), and Crush (the turtle) are all very different, original, and hilarious characters that bring something differnt to the table. Also, the fact that the writers present several ironies and stereotypes to this characters adds to their hilarity; vegetarian sharks, surfer turtles, clownfish that aren't funny, mindless hungry seagulls, the list can go on and on. <br/><br/>In conclusion I found Finding Nemo original, hilarious, and fun for everybody; truly everybody. 4 out of 5."

This movie has wonderful humor and jus flat out hands down the best animated movie ever recorded in movie history. The story of the film was actually good to of when Marlin loses his son by divers and comes to save him while meeting all other types of sea creatures. This movie is just excellent and is never boring or slow. Great job Andrew Stanton!! Once again you pulled it off.<br/><br/>10/10"

","When I originally saw the poster for this film (big empty space with a single fish), I instantly wanted to watch it, as I thought it was just beautiful. However, then I saw the trailers, and thought it just looked like a typical cutesy disney kids film.<br/><br/>Today I watched it on VHS, and realised that my original ideas of what it would be like were indeed accurate. Within five minutes of the film starting, we given one of the most emotive scenes I've ever seen in a children's film, and it actually makes you feel stupid for getting so worked up over a film which is meant for children!<br/><br/>The story is predictable, which is understandable as I doubt Pixar wanted to bewilder the children. However, this is made up for as the character development is great, as we see the isolated culture of the fish tank, and the class system between the different sea creatures (crabs being simple tramps, turtles being richer 'californian' thrillseekers etc.)<br/><br/>The way the film has been made is also great, with the amazing endless underwater landscapes, and the brilliant musical score from Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Six Feet Under). The film has the poetry of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, with the tongue-in-cheek humour of Toy Story, and the emotion of Watership Down, making it one of the best children's films I have ever been fortunate enough to see."

","I love my fish.  I've kept fish for quite a while and get a lot of pleasure out of just looking at them and watching their behaviour.  Finding Nemo has made me think about them slightly differently - and has hugely increased my guilt quotient at being responsible for their little lives!<br/><br/>Pixar have scored again with a beautifully made film.  The underwater scenes are absolutely gorgeous, the colours and waves beautifully rendered. However, because of the changes to the creatures - mainly the fact that they've been given human eyes - it doesn't feel as real as Toy Story did. That aside, I really fell in love with Marlin.  Nemo was a little bit irritating, but then again, I always find the cute kid irritating. <br/><br/>
The plots were rather predictable, then then again, that's we expect from Pixar.  They are obviously students of Joseph Campbell, every single step of the hero journey was followed in meticulous detail, right down to the literal representation of the 'belly of the whale' episode.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this film, but it didn't blow me away.  I think my expectations had been raised too far really.  It certainly didn't live up to the hype.  And Keanu Reeves ought to sue them.  Really."

","Finding Nemo is the fourth movie that Pixar and Walt Disney have created.  The movie was directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich. Finding Nemo is a story about a father, Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) and his son, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould).<br/><br/>As the movie opens, Marlin and his wife are staring at their unborn children. Suddenly a large predator fish appears.  As they try to protect their children, Marlin is knocked unconscious and is unable to protect his family.  When he awakes, he discovers that his wife and children are gone except for one egg.  As the story progresses, it shows that that one egg has grown and is named Nemo.  Adventure and new experiences is what Nemo longed for.  It was hard to satisfy his urges because of his overprotective father always worried that he was in danger.  One day while playing dare with his friends, Nemo ventures too close to a boat and is captured by one of the divers.  His father tries to save him, but is too late and the journey of Finding Nemo begins.<br/><br/>The critical intentions of the writers and directors of the film were to show that always trying to protect your children can do more harm than good. They also show that the love for a child is strong and powerful thing which pushed Marlin to find his son regardless of the dangers or obstacles that would stand in his way.<br/><br/>Things I liked about the movie were the animation, everything looked real and vibrant, and the appeal of the characters especially Dory who puts a comical twist to the movie.  I also enjoyed when the angel fish in the tank, Gill, who taught Nemo a lesson that he couldn't let his deformed fin hold him back from taking risk.  Though I thought it to be a little sad when in the beginning of the movie Nemos mother dies.  The movie its self I thought to be very cute.  I am looking forward to the next Pixar and Walt Disney movie that is produced."

"clabra","Null","0","1","13 March 2004"," This is a great movie with great characters.
","warning: possible spoilers. (But probably not)<br/><br/>☼☼☼☼ (Four out of Four Suns)<br/><br/>
Finding Nemo is a great movie that will capture your heart with unforgettable characters, great cinematography and something that everyone will love. There are three main characters in this movie: Dory, Marlin, and Nemo. Dory (Ellen Degeneres) is a fish with short-term memory loss that Marlin bumps into while looking for the boat that took Nemo. Her memory-loss is brought up throughout the movie but not in a way that it becomes annoying. Marlin (the father of Nemo) is afraid of the ocean. Marlin is an overdone, overprotected parent but with good reason. When Nemo was still a small egg his mother (Coral) was eaten while trying to protect all the eggs from a fishy predator. In some parts Marlin's fear is burdening while in others it is humorous. Nemo is a small fish with a small fin that causes him to be ridiculed at some times and at others makes it hard for him to do thing like swimming far distances. Disregarding his disablement Nemo wishes to be a normal fish and not always be stunted by his fathers caution.<br/><br/>
The minor characters are unforgettable themselves. These characters come in groups. The minor characters most focused on by the script are, what I like to call the tank gang. These characters are first introduced when Nemo is dropped into the fish tank at the dentist's office. The `gang' consists of seven former ocean dwellers, all with quirky characteristics. Bloat the blow fish is just a nice, easy going guy; Deb is a fish who thinks her reflection is her sister named Flo; Peach the starfish from e-bay is the all seeing; Jacque is a French crustacean with a knack for cleaning; Bubbles is, you guessed it, addicted to bubbles. The last fish in the tank gang is Gil. Gill is a fish that greatly reminded me of the people I know who want to help me but are really more interested in helping themselves.<br/><br/>
The cinematography of this movie is truly amazing and makes you feel as if you are in the movie. This is definitely one of the best-filmed animated movies I have seen in years. It is obvious that the artists took great care to make the movie as realistic as possible. This is proved when Dory has a nosebleed and the blood moves the way a liquid twirls when squirted into water.<br/><br/>All in all Finding Nemo is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I only have one warning for parents: your children may take to repeating all the lines from this movie (I for one know all the lines of the movie). This movie touched my heart and imprinted characters in my brain.  I suggest this movie to all people , even those who don't see animated movies much. My parting words are: Just keep swimming."

","You should never be worried about going to see a pixar film because not only do they not make bad movies, they dont even make average movies. Everyone of their films have been both a stunning techniqual achivement but great family entertainment as well.<br/><br/>When it comes to the battle between Pixar and Dreamworks, Pixar is the overall winner. Both Shrek and Ice Age were blissfully over-rated as the jokes tried to be too adult and in the end failed misserably.<br/><br/>This newest effort tells the tale of Marlin and Nemo, a father and son that have a great relationship yet Nemo cant help feeling his dad is too overprotective (watch the film and find out why). It is when Nemo is taken away by a group of divers that Marlin searches the ocean for him, with the help of the wonderfully stupid Dory (She suffers from short term memory lose).<br/><br/>Visually this film is great as it looks as if it is actually taking place under the sea. Unlike the rest of their films, this one is ridicuously cute and it works. The animation also helps in the comical value of the movie. Dory is by far the funniest character as she constantly looks confused and blissfully unaware. The surfer sea turtles are a major plus point too ""DUDE!""<br/><br/>The only major downside to this film is that the ending feels rushed. With all of the Pixar films before this there was always a gripping chase that not only showed the hero status of the main characters but the bonding between them. This had the bonding element but a school of fish trying to escape from a net is, frankly, not as exciting as a showdown at an airport (Toy Story 2) or a chase in the rain (A Bugs Life). There are also no outakes to make us chuckle which is missed.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day this is family entertainment at the higher end of the spectrum. Forget trash like The Little Mermaid or Pochontas and watch a film that shows the comical side of family values.<br/><br/>4/5"

","For an animation.  I usually don't care for these types of films because they only go so far before I lose interest.  This film was an exception. Pixar did a great job of keeping me interested.  They had a very good cast, especially Albert Brooks and Brad Garrett.  Hopefully Pixar will continue producing better movies as time goes by.  It would be nice to see another animation like this one come out.  Now that Pixar has left Disney, maybe they will have even more control over what they will do next.  Anybody interested in Finding Nemo 2?  If they have the right type of story, it would be fun to see a sequel of this made.  Assuming, of course,  they use the same cast again."

"valadas","7","0","1","25 February 2004"," Take your kids along with you
","These more or less anthropomorphic cartoon movies in which animals behave like human beings can convey strong moral messages while at same time amusing your kids a lot. Therefore it's very appropriate to take them along with you. On the other hand they can also feature animals (or some species) as friendly creatures ready to love and be loved and prone to tribulation sometimes too. In this concrete case we have an animal species not very often portrayed: fish. Which can also be nice and attractive like any other animals. I remember now ""Bugs"" another movie featuring a much less attractive species and which was also a good one. If you can make bugs appear as nice beings you can make it with any other kind of animals. Nowadays those movies are all made with the help of computers which makes them much easier to make without by saying this, belittling the directors and other technicians' talents. In this movie fatherly love is the main theme and you can draw the following maxim from the story: kids must obey their parents to avoid getting into trouble. A last word to the images and visual effects. Yes they are beautiful visions of underwater seascape and of the sea bottom, full of colour and fantasy. In conclusion I can say that I've seen better cartoon movies but also some not so good therefore the final conclusion is largely positive."

","Finding Nemo is, quite simply, brilliant.  Computer animation has come on in leaps and bounds since the days of Toy Story (1995) and Finding Nemo stunningly attests to this.  From the vibrantly coloured and gently undulating coral on the reef, to the murky depths of Sydney harbour, to the clever use of reflection and refraction off the fish tank, this is a film in which the constantly changing scenery is a large part of its attraction. The original and well-judged score enhances the viewer's sense of wonder and their empathy with the characters.<br/><br/>But computer wizardry alone cannot create a great film.  Finding Nemo is also blessed with an action-packed story and lots of laughs (largely courtesy of Dory - a well-meaning blue tang fish with short-term memory loss).  Nemo is a young clown fish, eager to test his boundaries, who is caught by a diver and taken to an aquarium in Sydney.  Whilst there, he makes friends with a motley collection of aquatic creatures who help him plot his escape.  Meanwhile, his over-protective father, Marlin, begins a frantic quest to find his son.  Along the way he is helped and hindered by three new-age sharks, some bodacious-dude turtles, a whale, and a monstrous angler fish (amongst others).<br/><br/>And yes, the ending may be a little mushy, but after such an epic adventure, the viewer will find the sentimentality relatively easy to stomach.  Indeed, the character development is surprisingly deep for a children's movie, and it's a nice change to have not every character being entirely good or bad. Parents in the audience will certainly identify with Marlin's dilemma of wanting to protect his child, and yet coming to realise that the time comes when one has to let go a little."

The animation is astonishing - the underwater effects are so convincing that, at times, I found myself wishing for a wetsuit. Add to this a clever script, glorious music, and perfect voicing - Ellen DeGeneres, of all people, deserves special mention and I loved Geoffrey Rush's stint as a pelican - and the result is a rather special movie experience.<br/><br/>Is there a flaw? Well, maybe it's a bit on the long side for an animated feature.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended nevertheless. Rating: 9/10."

","I loved the movie, funny bits but also well known Disney sweetness and heartache. Even though I loved the movie I think they should stop give human emotions to animals, it only causes animal tragedy. Maybe they could make a movie about a made up animal or get a prehistoric animal. Sooner or later they start with alligators and every kid in the world would want a alligator. After the alligators are well fed on kids guess how much work the plummers will have when parents flush the 'gators down the toilet."

","Pixar recaptures the charm of its earlier films after the disappointing `Monsters, Inc.'   All the inevitable trademarks are there--busy visuals, talky screenplay, Ratzenberger cameo--but we find that no matter how much we expect it to, this new breed of family film simply refuses to wear out its welcome.  Of course the look of the film is stunning, and the attention to ichthyological detail is admirable, too.  But what keeps the viewer hooked (um, as it were) is not any of these elements (nor the overstated if-you-love-somebody-let-them-go theme), but rather the visual and verbal wit (including several great cinema in-jokes), as well as a frankly crazy approach, and a welcome willingness to be scary.  I was reminded more than once of Jim Henson's Muppets in their heyday.  Quite enjoyable.  8 out of 10."

","Ignore the reviews claiming that ""Finding Nemo"" is great, but not Pixar Studios' best film. Ignore any comments on this page that point out flaws in the theme, humor, or sentimental plot. In fact, ignore everything you may have read about ""Finding Nemo"" and just see it for yourself. ""Nemo"" is Pixar's crowning achievement, and it's as close to perfect as any movie I've ever seen. EVERYTHING works in this film: the vocal performances are top-notch (particularly by Albert Brooks' Marlin and Ellen DeGeneres' Dory), the animation is nothing short of breathtaking, the dialogue is superbly written and genuinely hilarious at times, and the story is wonderfully simple, almost Zen-like. Disney's tendency to go overboard with the sentiment has been thankfully held back, so when an emotional moment comes along, you really feel it. No part of the movie drags, no scene seems out of place, and the entire thing will leave you captivated, whether you're 8 or 80. It's been so long since I've seen an honest-to-God masterpiece come out of the theatre, it might seem like I'm exaggerating, but rest assured: ""Finding Nemo"" deserves any and all praise it receives. This one's a keeper, folks."

","As a traditional `kids movie Scrooge' with a couple of exceptions, no matter what people said about this movie, I wasn't going to watch it without a fight.   I finally realized that people were not going to give up trying to convert me until I had watched this film, so I eventually gave in and went into it with a surprisingly open mind.<br/><br/>*Spoilers within*<br/><br/>True to form, there was a reason that seemingly everyone on the planet saw this film, and not only saw it, but liked it.  I thought it was a really cute and touching story.  Not many kid films start out with the death of one's almost entire family, but this film did, therefore setting up the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) whose son Nemo is suddenly snatched out of the ocean and place in a fish tank in a dentist's office.  Marlin must find Nemo before he falls into the hands of the dentist's horrible young girl whose last pet fish went belly up pretty quickly under her charge.<br/><br/>Not only is the story rich, fun and cleverly written (at times with adults in mind) but the voice talent, most notably Ellen DeGeneres' work, is fantastic.  Probably the most striking feature of Finding Nemo however is its beauty Â– it is so sharp and colorful that I actually half-regretted not seeing it in the theater.  While Finding Nemo did not make me a Pixar/Disney disciple (pretty much an impossible task) I think that its sure Oscar win for Best Animated Feature will be as well-deserved as the win by `Spirited Away' last year.  Spirited Away was far superior in my opinion, but both films transcend the generic `animated feature' label.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","Finding Nemo was a sheer delight, comparable to Lilo and Stitch, but made more like Toy Story. Pixar has really accomplished a classic telling with this one.<br/><br/>Nemo is a small clown fish who is the sole survivor of his clutch. His only living family is his father, as his mother was eaten while defending her clutch of eggs. As a result, his father is a complete almost non-functioning paranoid who would be happy to just live inside his anemone with his sun, and never venture out for anything.<br/><br/>This, of course, does not set well with his son, who is your average, adventurous child in every way but one; he has a deformity which gives his paranoid father all the excuses he needs to closet his child and keep him from the world.<br/><br/>Stolen from his father's loving and watchful eye by divers (probably American, one of the other fish proclaims) Nemo is taken into the world of humans and deposited inside an aquarium where he will be given as a present to Darla the Fish Killer.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his father races after the boat, loses the trail and must rely on the assistance of Dory, she of the short term memory loss. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, literally steals the show with her dialog and lines which are hilariously funny. <br/><br/>Marlin the clown fish hunts after his son for weeks, swimming hundreds of miles in search of his lost son.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh, and a good shot of wholesome Disney. I was a bit taken aback by the anti-American line in this movie, considering it IS an American production AND Disney, to boot, but I suppose it is just Disney's little jibe at those who would blame America for everything, when it turns out an Australian was the one who stole Nemo, after all. *shrugs* I don't know, but it did not sit well with me.

","The story itself is rather simple, but both the humor and the graphical presentation of ""Finding Nemo"" make it implossible not to simply love it!<br/><br/>From a ""nerd"" kind of perspective I'm really amazed about the way they captured the fluid dynamics in this film: trying to model flowing and streaming water is virtually impossible and yet the waves and the flow of the ocean, streams etc. etc. are represented life-like!<br/><br/>
A different angle of reviewing the movie is not looking at the technical highlights, but at the way the different characters are developed. Whether it be fish, whales, shrimp, sea-gulls and turtles (""You've got a serious thrill issue, dude!"") they are all depicted in a unique way. But also in a way that allows us to related to them: they've been brought down to the stereo-types we are inclined to see them as. <br/><br/>Ofcourse, if a movie wants to appeal to a large audience, it cannot be focussed only on graphical superbness, or only on the funniest characters you've ever seen.

I myself find it hard to explain it.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a Disney fan. I loved ""Dumbo"" as a child. I found ""Beauty and the Beast"" endearing and smart. I enjoyed Pixar's ""Toy Story"" and even more ""Toy Story 2"". And that was it. But ""Finding Nemo"" is more.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo is, to put it in simple terms, a beautiful movie.<br/><br/>Everything works to perfection: the scenes, the music, the colours, the voices, the relationships between characters, and oh those quotes! Who could beat ""I'll call him Squishy, and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy""? It's funny and at the same time tender.<br/><br/>I found myself caring more about Marlin, Dory, Gill, Nemo and Nigel than I've done by almost any other character -real or animated- this year. The script is flawless: ""It's there, I know it is, because when I look at you, I can feel it. And... and I look at you, and I... and I am home! Please... I don't want that to go away."" Honestly, what movie this year has had something like that?<br/><br/>Disney has a reputation for pushing the ""easy"" sentimentality buttons of people back in the 50s and 60s. It did work. We have become a lot more cynical as a people in the 90s and now. But Nemo manages to push our ""hard"" sentimentality buttons. I love it not just because it's funny and pretty to look at, but because it made me care. It created a world far, far away from our cynicism and for some minutes that magic I felt as a child came back.<br/><br/>Yes, Nemo deserves to be in my Top 10 ever. Thank you, Pixar."

","I may have been one of the last people to see this movie.  I would have loved to see it in the theaters, but my dad just does not like animated films.  So it was kind of a surprise to hear him say that he really enjoyed this one.  And why is that?  Because he can relate to it, and I don't think he's the only parent out there that felt the same way about Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Out of all the Pixar movies, I think this one is the most meaningful.  What parent can't relate to letting go of their child and letting them live their own life?  And what child can't relate to being overprotected by their parents?  This film reaches to people of all ages and backgrounds, that it is purely astonishing.  You can bet that this movie will hold a place in the hearts of millions of people for a long time.<br/><br/>Now, what do I think?  Well, honestly, it's not my favorite Pixar flick.  I found Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2 to be funnier and more enjoyable.  That's not to say Finding Nemo doesn't have the comedic chops.  I thought the Bruce the Shark scene was absolutely hysterical, and Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks provided excellent voice-work for their characters.<br/><br/>As for the animation, Pixar just keeps getting better and better.  I was quite impressed with Sulley in Monsters Inc, but there were so many beautiful things to look at in Finding Nemo, I can't really narrow down one example.<br/><br/>So with all these great things, I still can't say that I absolutely loved this movie.

","I haven't had so much fun since...""The Emperor's New Groove""! I know many people prefer Toy Story, or Ice Age,but I have a soft spot for the nice, funky lama. Now this movie left me totally excited, exactly as I was when I went to see it; just even better, of course. I've never seen so much humor combined so wonderfully with a smart plot and great animations, not even in Toy Story. After the little, and delightful if I may add, snow man, this movie melted all there was to melt in me. Sweet, adorable, funny, intelligent. These are the words which define ""Finding Nemo"".<br/><br/>Spoilers<br/><br/>The story is about a father and his son, Marlin and Nemo. After Nemo is ""abducted"" by humans, ""probably Americans"", his father, frightened by the perilous ocean, leaves in an incredible quest to find his son. On his way he meets friends and enemies, who he encounters with his newly found buddy, Dory- an adorably cute blue fish, ""natural blue"" as she affirms herself, but who most unfortunately suffers of short time memory loss. A brilliant touch for the humorous parts. Their journey is more than entertaining and exciting, with thrills and chills, laughter and tears, joys and sorrows. The end is never really important. It's important how you get there. That's what counts in life too.What I loved about this movie...is hard to express in one single sentence or phrase. Firs of all I loved the animations. Wonderfully constructed faces and gestures, which make your heart shrink to the size of a clown fish, or grow to the posture of a whale. I have never seen such incredible animations, which reflect perfectly the emotions of the characters. All great! The characters themselves are touching and smartly constructed and I find it impossible not to grow to like them. What they say is also very interesting and sometimes, beyond laughing, they might actually make you think. Unity, freedom, equality, are just some of the fundamental issues of man kind which are portrayed in this brilliant fable. I know, I tend to be boring by adding a superlative in each sentence, but it just makes me feel good! The voice acting is as well as it could be and the actors achieve to fill this movie with life. The absolute moment of brilliance, if I may say so, was Bruce. I think it was a great idea to let him remind us of a certain movie, you know which...yes, I mean ""The Shining"". So here's Brucey! Beyond the Sea, sung by Robbie Williams, at the end was just the cherry on top for me!<br/><br/>It's just wonderful to spend an evening watching this movie, for all ages and all hearts. Well, almost all. I've read in some forums that people are wondering whether an animation movie can be nominated for Oscar. I personally doubt such a thing will happen, but I would certainly stand firmly behind this film. Watch it, is all I have to say. It's worth every breath! 9/10"

","Over-protective clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) witnesses his only surviving offspring Nemo being captured by a deep-sea diver soon after a moment of rebelliousness from the youngster.  Frantic, Marlin endeavours to find his son with the help of an amnesiac fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). On his quest, he also meets sharks which have formed a Fish-Eaters Anonymous group, and a group of surfer turtles' that speak like Bill and Ted.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nemo has been released into a fish tank in a dentist's waiting room in Sydney.  There, he meets a group of fellow prisoners led by angelfish Gill (Willem Dafoe) who has devised a cunning plot for them all to escape.   The challenge that Pixar faces here is to make fish as cute and as loveable as the furry leads of previous animated successes.  Anthropomorphism goes far enough to over ride the fact that in the wild, fish lay eggs and then neglect their offspring and to allow Dory to read the handwritten name and address on Nemo's abductor's neglected goggles.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed both Toy Story' and Monsters Inc', I found Finding Nemo' just as good.  The success of Pixar features is down to the studio's story-telling skills and their ability to entertain the whole family: familiar quotes such as Hop inside my mouth if you want to live' will be appreciated by adults but lost on kids.  However, there is still plenty to entrance the youngsters as well although I do feel that the film is overlong for very young children.<br/><br/>Brilliant characterisation and glorious animation makes Finding Nemo' stunning and charming to watch.  This is a visual treat not to be missed. Also, the fun continues to the end of the credits so don't be too eager to leave your seat!"

","Really, ""Finding Nemo"" needs no introduction.  But, what the heck, I'll give it one anyway.  Working at a daycare this summer, I heard about ""Finding Nemo.""  And those of you who work in child care know that's an understatement.  ""Finding Nemo"" was pretty much everything I heard about and everything I saw.  I saw kid's meal toys, clothing, pillowcases, and just about every piece of ""Finding Nemo"" memorabilia in existence.  When I had trouble starting a deep {cough} conversation with a little kid, I would introduce myself with a statement like, 'So...have you seen ""Finding Nemo""?' But really at this point I had no idea how good the movie was or what it was about really.  Needless to say though, I get a bit skeptical about movies when just about every child in the nation has seen them.<br/><br/>Yet, when I saw ""Finding Nemo,"" I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, I really don't need to say this, but the animation was awesome and visually stimulating.  The voice acting was also top notch.  And, of course, Randy Newman's score matched the movie perfectly.  The story, although unrealistic (but how can it be realistic - talking fish?), is also very well-written and even has some (gasp) character development.  And, since I have a little kid's sense of humor, I found the movie hilarious.  I hardly went one minute in the whole movie without laughing.  I only have one complaint: the opening scene seems a little off-balance.  I know, I know.  It sets the stage for the rest of the movie and helps you get into what's going on.  But something's still missing from it, even if I can't put a finger on it. <br/><br/>
Besides one tiny flaw, though, this movie is a masterpiece, kid's movie or not.  Skeptics out there, I have a suggestion for you:  Give ""Finding Nemo"" a chance.  <br/><br/>Final Grade: A."

","I saw Finding Nemo about four weeks ago (oddly, the British cinema release came seven months after the States, and almost coincided with the US DVD release) but haven't felt inclined to post until rumours began that it was going to be nominated for Best Picture. My initial impressions were: Yeah right. But the more I dwelt on it, the more I thought about my impressions of the film, I realised that it had just a legitimate a claim as something like Seabiscuit. My first impressions weren't fantastic, I must say. The first fifteen minutes or so were rather unsettling - the (SPOILERS) extermination of Marlin's family in the first scene of the film, the slightly tragic and psychological relationship between an overbearing Marlin and his son Nemo, and the slightly restrained depiction of underwater life - danger, we are reminded, is constantly all around - showed us instantly that this is no McDonalds-tied Disney secretion. This is something that director John Lasseter wanted to make into a proper film. This element of darkness and family tragedy is held erratically throughout the film, represented onscreen by Nemo's deformed fin. We have various encounters with nasty sea creatures including a bunch of effette yet unstable sharks, and a soulless killing machine of an Angler fish. The theatre that develops when Nemo is imprisoned in a tank full of fish who are slowly losing their minds is deliciously unpleasant as well. However, Pixar (or whatever forces influenced the script) copped out of making a truly daring work of art by shoehorning in the requisite number of 'Talk to the hand' and 'I love you guys' style jokes which, however much work has obviously gone into them, feel like a clash with Lasseter's vision. Dorey is an excellent sidekick, although I feel the adventures that her and Marlin get into are a series of interchangeable sketches rather that something with an overall meaning. Okay, enough with the dark side - let's praise something. The animation is flawless as always, it's always good to see people pushing the boundaries of what they thought they could do. The jokes are actually funny - Dorey especially is quite a novel comic device, and the voice performances were excellent all round. Somebody definitely had a love for the 'feel' of marine life, the slightly parched and washed out timbers and the ruggedness of the oceangoing fish. It was also pioneering to integrate the fishes' world with the human world; thus the film distances itself from something like The Lion King. Overall, the elements work enough to guarantee at least a four-star rating from any critic without some ongoing Disney vendetta. Pixar so desperately want to break with Disney so they can make the films that they, rather than Disneys' creditors, would like to see made. Yet they would have the same problem as they have here - too wide an audience: fidgeting toddlers to college jocks to knowing parents to film buffs. Pixar need to offend, and they passed up that opportunity in Finding Nemo."

I remember the hullabaloo that Disney had created when Pixar wanted prominent billing for it's studios as well as a larger share of the profits from the Pixar animated features it produces for said Disney company.  Is Disney nuts for actually getting upset?  Pixar has made some of the most financially successful movies for Disney over the last 10 years and Disney is complaining because Pixar wants more visibility and more of the money from the movies they create?<br/><br/>Okay enough of the commentary.  Finding Nemo was a visually stunning, well written, well cast movie in which you forget you are watching a fully CGI motion picture.  The character movements were completely believable and the color treatment and lighting given to the undersea environments were truly unbelievable.  Pixar has truly defined the art of CGI animation and they are on a par with ILM and WETA for their talents in computer animation.  I read somewhere in a review for this movie that Pixar didn't take the craft to a new level in the making of this movie.  I would disagree completely.  The realistic underwater environments created in this motion picture are as good as any underwater adventure ever produced by Cousteau and company during the voayges of the Calypso back in the 60's and 70's.  The murkiness of being underwater with these characters is I think Pixars greatest accomplishment. Watching this movie really makes you feel like you are underwater in the ocean.  The CGI is so good in this movie that you don't realize it is even there.  Anyone that downplays this movie is just looking at a reason to nit pick on Disney."

Trying to describe the movie would be as unsatisfactory as trying to describe what chocolate tastes like to a person who has never tasted it.<br/><br/>Pixar has created a movie that is aimed at all audiences, and finds the mark in each case.  This is a rare movie that is well-suited to every age group (with the possible exception of the youngest children... there are some moments which might be a bit intense for toddlers).  I admit I'm very glad I'm an adult so I could catch some of the jokes which might go over a younger audience's head, but that takes nothing away from this wonderful movie as a whole.<br/><br/>While the animation is utterly breathtaking, it's the vocal talents of Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, and a host of other perfectly chosen performers who make this movie such a constant delight.<br/><br/>Seeing this in the theatre first and later on DVD, I actually appreciate this gem of a feature more than when I first saw it on the big screen.  It works incredibly in a theatre, but the DVD features were perfectly suited to digital media.<br/><br/>Just one final note... I wish that Pixar had run the ""Exploring the Reef"" featurette as an epilog to the movie.

","the movie was great!!! i rented this movie just to see what all the hype was about...im glad i did! it had lots of humerous punchlines and it keeps you intrested. if you have kids they will enjoy it, if you dont have kids you will enjoy it. im glad that pixar had adults in mind when they made this flick, and was much better than lion king or a bugs life. although you need to know a little bit about salt water fish to understand certain things about the movie...if you dont, you will still enjoy it but you might have a few questions ****spoiler alert***** the movie is about a clown fish whose wife and eggs wind up missing after another fish (i beleive is a barraccuda) attacks them. only one egg is left behind, and the father (marlin) keeps the egg under close watch until it hatches. when it does he has a son and named him nemo. on nemos first day of school the other fish try to convince each other how brave each fish can be, and when its nemos turn to do the bragging, his father(marlin) shows up and embarress'(sp?) him in front of his classmates.nemo becomes angry and races out to a boat that was way out in front of him,to show the others how brave he was. on his return a diver appears and scoops nemo up, and takes him to his boat and leaves. as the diver was leaving he loses his diving mask that has his name and address on it.marlin is horrified and begins chasing the boat, but the boat is too fast for him. marlin shortly comes across a fish named dory,they find the diving mask that the diver loses, and as luck would have it dory can read, so she reads his name and address and tells marlin she will go with him to find nemo. they have a wild adventure on their quest to find nemo. eventually they reach their destination and find nemo( which has been in a fish tank in a dentists office the whole time) and reunite with each other.:) i give nemo 5/5 for entertainment value and keeping my intrest as an adult. this movie isnt just for children. its a must see!!!"
"antoinebachmann","9","0","1","24 November 2003"," Beautiful, good story - but why all the violence?
","This is clearly a great film, beautiful images, good story, and as often with Disney it can be taken in at many levels and so can satisfy children as well as adult audiences.<br/><br/>(WARNING: SPOILERS ahead)<br/><br/>
But now, if I may, two questions: - why all the violence? Nemo's mother gets killed/eaten by a Barracuda and the scene is violent and close-up. Then the sharks are close-up though not violent - until one smells blood and turns back into a killing machine, with a chase that's not far behind some of the chases in ""Alien"" as the sharks tries to explode metal doors, gets a torpedo to be shot, not to mention all the submarine explosions that ensue. Still later on we have the whale - it is a friendly whale by between its huge cavernous voice, its dark and noisy insides, its terrible tongue, it is not made to appear very friendly. And of course there is the best of all, the encounter deep into the sea with one of those monster-fish that lurk in the abyss, true to its real-life form but nevertheless very scary, again a close-up of course, and again pretty close to some of the worst ""Alien"" chases. What's the deal here, to prepare young children to watch gore movies by the time they're 10? - why so many orphans in Disney films? I mean, sure, it is great if an orphan can still make it. But why can't we apparently have ANY films from Disney with a normally functioning family? What is the message here, than families with two parents are bad?<br/><br/>So my conclusion: high-quality film, but why don't Disney / Pixar consider next time to include NOT SO MUCH VIOLENCE, and consider to have a history where the child hero will have BOTH PARENTS?"
"bigben5","10","0","1","23 November 2003"," A Worthy Movie (contains minor spoilers)
","After seeing the God awful Bug's Life, I never wanted to see another Disney film again. When the previews for Finding Nemo came out, I dismissed the film as being another lousy attempt for Disney and Pixar to make money. You see I grew up in the 90's era, where all the characters would fall in love at first sight and where all of a sudden characters would get up and dance, sing and would have stupid animals that would tell dumb ass jokes to get you to laugh... So therefore I thought this movie would suck.<br/><br/>How wrong I was.<br/><br/>It was great from beginning to finish. The story as you know is about a insecure Clownfish named Marlin, who because he lost his wife and all but one of his children, is overly concerned about his remaining son Nemo. One day Nemo gets captured and Marlin swims out to try and save him. Along the way he bumps into a fish named Dory, with very short term memory, and so the adventure is begun.<br/><br/> I'll be honest in saying that this IS the BEST Disney movie I have EVER seen. It is the BEST written and has the best acting. The story, alas, is not original but it is considered fresh considering all of the other movies they've made in the past. It rocks! The acting is great, the musical score is beautiful and the animation in this one is awesome. Kudos to writers on this one.<br/><br/>Apparently someone finally woke up and realized that some us, just don't like singing songs anymore and stupid annoying animals. They've finally been able to target a wider audience by making the story appeal to adults more while keeping the characters appealing to children. I love it.<br/><br/>So be sure to see this movie, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>

It does not matter what age you are!  If you are in the mood to watch this kind of film...WATCH IT!  It starts out a little slow, at first, but, once the events that set the film in motion take place, I found myself rooting for Nemo just like I know all the kids do when they first watch this film.  It's one of those kind that you can sum up by the old saying, ""This is the kind of film for kids of all ages...""<br/><br/>There was a time when I really did not care for these kind of films.  And the bad rap that Disney studios has gotten over the past few years makes me sick.  Disney stands for family values and those values have stood the test of time.

","Finding Nemo was really a great film for the family but I see Pixar is falling into Disney's dysfunctional family world though- they killed off Nemo's mother right away! What is it with Disney films and their world of single parents? Look at the past films, in Toy Story their was no mention of Andy's father at all, Bambi's mother gets shot, Cinderella's left to her wicked step-family after her parents die, Aladdin had no parents, Jasmine had only her father, the Little Mermaid, where was her mother? the legend of Tarzan was made for Disney with his parents being killed, and the list goes on and on! I would think that parents groups would be screaming their lungs out by now over these films still having the same plot. Me, I think it's funny because it's gotten to where I bet with others on whether the next Disney film will have 1 parent or no parents in it!<br/><br/>Besides this the film was great with Ellen DeGeneres obviously being the best part of the whole cast. I've never been much of an Ellen fan but she made me laugh pretty good with her character, Dory the short term memory fish. Great casting with her! In addition I got a kick out of the end credits with the ""swim byes"" and the interaction of the characters with the end credits rolling.<br/><br/>Pixar is on their way to becoming the best family entertainment on the big screen if they keep doing what they've been, but I think that they should separate themselves from Disney's orphan ideology!"

When humans capture Nemo, Marlin begins his search of the Pacific Ocean accompanied by Dory (DeGeneres) to rescue his son.<br/><br/>The film's visuals are pretty much spectacular and what you would expect from the people who brought us Toy Story and Monsters Inc. The characters are engaging; capturing the idiosyncrasies of the creatures they are based on extremely well and is added too by the stellar work of the voice cast. Particularly Ellen DeGeneres, who brings to life the quirky Dory making her one of the most memorable Disney characters of all time.<br/><br/>The story is not over complex and for adults can be a bit predictable, there are a few lulls along the way, however these are normally the most emotive parts of the film. The script is fairly fast paced with some brilliantly sharp and witty humour that leads to some truly hilarious moments that scored several belly laughs from the adults in the audience.<br/><br/>All in all, Finding Nemo truly does build on the success of Disney/Pixar's previous films and once more establishes them in my mind as one of the best producers of family entertainment in recent years, managing so deftly to give their younger audience a bit more credit than other animators and making taking the kids to the cinema more than just an excuse for Dad to take a nap.<br/><br/>This is a delightfully sweet, moving and funny film that should appeal to children and adults in equal measure.

If (and I very much doubt it) you aren't sure of the plot, here's an insight to it: After the death of his wife and 399 children, Marlin the Clownfish becomes over-protective of his only surviving son, Nemo. When Nemo gets tired of his fathers protectiveness, he abandons the safety of his home and ends up being captured by an Austrailian diver. Nemo then finds himself in the company of the 'Tank Gang' in a dentists office tank. Meanwhile, Marlin desperatly tries to find his son, with the help of the memory-losing, optimistic and Danger-Prone Dory, a Regal Blue Tang fish. Together they encouter vegitarian sharks, a forest of Jellyfish, the EAC-surfing turtles and many more colourful characters in this story about the seas most dedicated father, Marlin and the funniest fish in the world, Dory.

To get the light shimmering through the water and bouncing off the beautiful colours below is pure genius with God knows how many hours of work gone into it.<br/><br/>The film itself was brilliant. A fantastic mix of all humours with some very colourful characters. Yes it's for children but I find it a bit unreasonable to think that just because Pixar have included more adult material before, they shouldn't be allowed to go and do a straight forward kids movie. To be honest i found Marlon's incessant whining a bit hard to handle sometimes but when the audience is introduced to all the other characters then little things are easy to forget. I laughed constantly through any bit with the sea turtles, the fish tank crew were brilliantly characterised and the Fish Eaters Anonomous Sharks were very cleverly done, if underused. Overall another startling feather in Pixars ever growing cap.<br/><br/>
And one last thing. If I read one more person saying that Shrek was a bold/daring/clever step for Pixar/Disney I'll scream. Yes it would have been bold/clever/daring of they had done it! Shrek is excellent but it was Dreamworks who did it! Not DISNEY!<br/><br/>Thankyou 10/10"

"phil0011","10","0","1","17 October 2003"," Another great film from the boys at Pixar
","In so many different and fabulous ways, Finding Nemo is a wonderful film. As a children's film, it enchants and creates a wonderfully exciting world. Like its predecessors (Toy Story, A Bugs Life, Monsters, Inc.), Finding Nemo provides a fantasy world based in reality  something that, as children, we all dreamed could be true. As an animation, Pixar once again provide stunning visuals; each film made, somehow manages to look better than the last. The computers are getting better and the animators are getting more and more ambitious. Bright colours swirl around the ocean depths and it's one of those films you could watch without the sound on and just enjoy the marvelous imagery. And, last but not least, the writers have included much for us adults to be able to laugh at. Much of the writing is subtle, witty and brilliantly constructed (with at least one fart joke  to keep us all happy).<br/><br/>Every character in this film was a joy to watch  one of the rare films where I wouldn't have minded seeing more of any of the characters. This is where you have to give credit not only to the writers but also to the voice actors. Ellen DeGeneres was my favourite, as the slightly dippy and lovable Dory. Brooks does a good job in a difficult role (he mostly has to play his role serious).<br/><br/>This is one of the rare animations which has a wonderful narrative structure. The scenes are constructed in such a way that each set piece is intimately woven within the story, each providing their own integral part to plot development and character study. This is Pixars best film to date, and - considering Pixar have produced some of the best films (not just animations) of the past 8 years - this is indeed high accolade. Let's hope Pixar keep creating films this delightfully exuberant.<br/><br/>Amongst all the humour and breathtaking visuals, there are true emotions running through the crux of this film, from the surprising opening five minutes, to the heartfelt last five. This really is a film for everyone. And what a glorious film it is.<br/><br/>For those that care, I gave this 10/10."
"psi_fla","Null","0","1","15 October 2003"," Let's go swimming!
","Rating: **** (out of *****)<br/><br/>If Pixar can continue to deliver the goods like they have done once more, with Finding Nemo, then we can be assured that the future of computer animation is in safe hands. <br/><br/>Finding Nemo arrives here following massive success stateside, yet its success has, quite possibly, led to nit picking among some. Certain journalists (Toy Story purists, no doubt) have called it such things as ""formulaic"" and ""strictly for kids"". Well, would you call Pixar as original if they approached all their films' storylines in the same way as Toy Story's?<br/><br/>True, it is admittedly hard to expect anything to astound you as much as the film that signalled their arrival in the world of full-length animated motion pictures. But this film sits quite nicely among their other efforts. I'd put it on pretty much the same level as Monsters, Inc. and just ahead of Toy Story 2. <br/><br/>Finding Nemo is more of a straightforward adventure tale than any other Pixar film (the title character's name could be a nod to Captain Nemo, of 20,000 Leagues under the Sea). Our setting is the Pacific Ocean, where Nemo, a young clown fish (voiced by Alexander Gould), is captured by some scuba divers. His father, Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) immediately begins searching for his son, but finding him will take much longer than he thought, as Nemo has ended up in the fish tank of an Australian dentist.<br/><br/>
Along the way, Marlin hooks up (no pun intended) with a forgetful tang named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), and they both proceed to meet all kinds of colourful and interesting characters, including three sharks (one of whom is voiced by Barry Humphries) and a surfer turtle (voiced by the film's co-writer/director, Andrew Stanton). All the while, the other fish in the tank (including a butterfly fish named Gill, voiced by Willem Dafoe) are trying to help Nemo get out. From looking at the animation, I could see that Pixar have made some truly innovative strides forward with each of their films, at least on the technical side. Their typical `trademarks' are visible here, such as the main characters' wide eyes and the obviously artificial humans (the makers are obviously aware of how out of place Final Fantasy-style techniques would look here). But everything on view is smoother, more colourful, and significantly more detailed than any of their previous major efforts. This makes Finding Nemo more pleasing to the eye than Pixar's other films. <br/><br/>The film's generally linear storyline prevents it from scaling (again, no pun intended) the heights of the original Toy Story. There aren't too many real surprises as such. But by no means have Pixar gone soft in the story department, despite what some believe. In fact, I could argue that this is probably the most consistently funny script they have come up with. It's not short on background gags either, examples being some product placement satire and a possible reference to Monty Python. You'll even find some nods to Pixar's past efforts (some more subtle than others  I'll let you look for them). <br/><br/>Pixar have always struck gold on their vocal pairings for their leads (Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, John Goodman & Billy Crystal...) and they've found another fine pairing in Albert Brooks & Ellen DeGeneres. Both are natural comedians, and they help to make the film as clever and funny as it is. Even if DeGeneres sometimes becomes irritating, I think that's intentional. Listening to them and to all the other characters, we can see that Pixar are almost as good as casting their voices as animating their films.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have said enough. Go and see Finding Nemo. You will not regret it. (And you'll get to see a wonderfully inventive short film from Pixar's past beforehand...)"
"caldersj","Null","0","1","13 October 2003"," Absolutely stunning, a faultless piece of entertainment
","This film is quite simply a work of genius.  The quality of the animation is stunning, with the effects of waves, reflections, splashes, and underwater motion all perfectly realised.  The visual treat is perfectly complemented by a brilliant script that is easy to follow for youngsters, while being full of droll asides and references to keep the adults amused.  The idea that the sharks are in therapy to try and overcome their fish-eating tendencies, and the associated psycho-babble is one hilarious example. Another reviewer complained that the basic story is unoriginal, being yet another quest / journey of self-discovery.  Well I think younger kids need a simple plotline, and this film delivers it so well that any triteness never jars.  My daughter (nearly 5) was held in rapt attention throughout - and so were her mother and I. Highly recommended."

The film fell into cliche's.  Ellen was great as Dory and I loved the seagulls and there are a few great comedy moments.  Story is basic but effective...

"Old Joe","Null","0","1","8 October 2003"," There are 3.7 trillion fish in the ocean, they are looking for just one. You will have never seen fish prepared like this before. 'Finding Nemo' is totally wild dude!
","People all over the world have been falling in love with a little clownfish called 'Nemo'. I have been waiting to see this film for a while and it has not disappointed me. Pixar have proven once again that they are the best when it comes bringing 'animated feature films'. This film shows of many great things, like what it is like to be a fish, life in the sea, what Australians are really like and the famous landmarks of the harbour city of 'Sydney'. But what I think is most important about 'Finding Nemo', is the warm fuzzy feeling a film such as this will leave you with.<br/><br/>
Dive into a whole new world of computer-animated fun, fantasy, and heartfelt emotion by following the epic journeys of two 'clownfish' - the overly cautious Marlin and his curious son, Nemo - who become separated in the Great Barrier Reef when Nemo is taken from his ocean home. Despite his fears of the open sea, Marlin embarks on a dangerous trek to find Nemo. Buoyed by the companionship of a friendly-but-forgetful fish named Dory, Marlin finds himself as the unlikely hero of a thrilling journey to rescue his son.<br/><br/>Firstly, I want to praise the animators that worked on this movie. They did a remarkable job in creating the world that we find all these sea animals swimming around in. The attention to detail is most noticeable, especially the way they have shown the water, which looked 'real'. The Pixar animators certainly put great detail into the film, and used a vast array of colours, which has to be another of the films major highlights.<br/><br/>The script for 'FN' is as classy a script I have ever seen for animated feature film. Not only is it clever, it is very funny and has some strange, but hilarious characters. I believe that the character of Dory was the funniest, one that at least I know I will be able to 'remember'. The movie's underlying themes, which include the importance of family and friends, were also very important. The story for 'FN' was written by Andrew Stanton, while the screen was done by Stanton, Bob Peterson and David Reynolds.<br/><br/>
The direction 'FN' took onscreen was another aspect of the film I liked. It must be difficult to direct an 'animated feature film', but the way the directors' did this film, show how it can and should be done. Director Andrew Stanton (with Co-director, lee Unkrich) certainly gave the movie good flow and allowed the audience to enjoy a fine cinematic experience. Stanton's role on the film is truly great, considering he also voiced the totally wild dude, Crush the turtle.<br/><br/>With so many characters, I want to talk about the ones that had the biggest impact on me. The main characters include Nemo, the baby 'clownfish', who goes on an extraordinary adventure, Nemo's dad Marlin and Dory, the blue tang fish, with short term memory loss, who has to be up there as one of the great cartoon characters, ever made for a film. I also loved the impact that the three sharks have on the film. Bruce, the great white shark, Anchor, the hammerhead shark and Chum, the pointer shark, could have been (and would be for some littlies) very scary, but in this film were also hilarious. Out of the characters we meet in the fish tank aquarium at the Dentists, the strange exotic Moorish Idol fish Gill, the very amusing 'Bloat', and Nigel, the clumsy pelican, are all very good. In fact the dentist himself is a very important character for reasons that I will let the movie explain.<br/><br/>
However these characters would be nothing without the voiceovers that accompany them. The main voices include Albert Brooks, Alexander Gould and Willem Defoe, who all are very good. But the stand out for me is the performance of Ellen DeGenres, who has proven that she totally suits doing voiceovers. I hope DeGenres is casted again in a role like this one. The voiceovers also have a very Australian flavour as well. People like Barry Humphries, Eric Bana, Bruce Spence, Bill Hunter and Geoffrey Rush are all great additions to be hearing. The additional voiceovers also see a very famous Aussie as well. While the voice of cartoon expert Jack Angel appears, we also have the latest 'Gold Logie' winner Rove McManus, being a part of the ocean too.<br/><br/>There are many wonderful moments in 'FN'. My favourite has to be when Marlin and Dory stumble across the three 'friendly' sharks. This scene has to be the scariest and the funniest of the film. Then when Marlin and Dory play the 'Jellyfish' game, it is also funny and dangerous at the same time. In fact the whole journey that Nemo's father has to find his son in the film is very entertaining to say the least. Then when Marlin and Dory first meet Nigel, the pelican, it is hard not to laugh at the cries of 'Mate....' by the many pidgins that we see. Also the experiences that Nemo has while trapped in the aquarium at the Dentist surgery, are not only frightening, but very fun and exciting as well, helping Nemo to grow up.<br/><br/>
'Finding Nemo' was dedicated to the memory of Glenn McQueen, a man that obliviously had an impact on Pixar animations. While I love all the different aspects of 'Finding Nemo', I am still a bigger fan of 'Monsters, Inc.', but believe me, Finding Nemo is not far behind it, and I cannot wait for the DVD release of this movie. I believe that this movie has the perfect opening, thanks to the viewing of the 1989, first-ever Pixar production 'Knick Knack', that undoubtedly inspired 'Finding Nemo'. While this movie has as perfect and funny conclusion you will see (Note: do not get up before the credits!).  What a joy it was for me to finally see 'Finding Nemo'!<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'Finding Nemo': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)"
"stephenmogg","10","0","1","9 October 2003"," Pixar plumbs new depths of excellence !
","Ofen reality never lives up to hype and expectation but Finding Nemo delivers in every respect. After Bugs Life, I doubted that animation could improve much and while Monsters Inc made hairs seem interesting, Nemo seems to move the goal posts so far away, I think it will be a long time before it is matched. The story is strong, the voice characterisations are just perfect with Ellen DeGeneres standing out as the Oscar winning performance and the underwater animation is simply breathtaking. I would defy anyone not to get something from this film and if ever computers needed justification for their existence, this one film provides just that. I guess one day, Pixar may produce a lemon, but on the basis of their track record so far, even a Pixar lemon will by sharper than anything else out there."
"Adriane","Null","0","1","8 October 2003"," This is now the 2nd best animated film I have ever seen
","This movie stands in line next to my personal favorite, Lilo and Stitch. But from Pixar, the best is obviously Monsters Inc and both Toy Story's. What drives this film and makes it delightful is not only its animation (which you want in every aspect of your field of vision), but its heartfelt story that kids and adults can relate to. Marlin as the constantly funny Albert Brooks does nothing less than what we know from him, and the short term memory Dory by the wonderful Ellen Degeneres never failed to entertain me and my family. But what parents can take from the film is to believe in your kids, don't constantly watch over them, let them breathe and have fun!!! Maybe great white shark Bruce (as the film's most intimidating character, and the bully all kids recognize) sums up the best words of the film, ""fish are friends, not food."" 10/10"
"Rob_Taylor","7","0","1","1 October 2003"," Solid Disney fare that the adults won't mind seeing.
","Disney has been a very hit or miss affair recently. The appalling Jungle Book 2 is best forgotten, whilst such delights as Lilo and Stitch and The Emperor's New Groove are to be praised. Finding Nemo falls squarely in the thumbs up zone, so it would seem that the mouse-house is finding its feet again.<br/><br/>FN is quite an eye-fest. The animation teams have captured the underwater world with astonishing realism, though the fish characters are, as might be expected, a little bit cartoony. On the whole, though, an amazing piece of technical work.<br/><br/>The story is simple and there are plenty of action scenes and sight gags to keep the kids happy. At the same time there are enough adult gags thrown in to keep parents amused and entertained too. There's even a Star Trek reference in the form of the ""Nexus"" (watch it and see!)<br/><br/>If I only have one criticism to level at the movie it is this (spoiler!).....<br/><br/>After having rescued Nemo, both father and son appear to completely forget about the fish in the dentist's tank and return to their own idyllic existence. There is a short final sequence showing the fish escaping from the tank by themselves, but you'd have thought that Nemo and Marlin would have wanted to at least try and help. A bit puzzling that one, and disappointing in a film that clearly espouses values such as loyalty and friendship. Perhaps I missed something, but that bit messed up an otherwise excellent film.<br/><br/>All in all though, great fun for the kids and entertaining for adults too."
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","1","29 September 2003"," It's a small ocean after all
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>So here's Disney's latest animated adventure, and for those of us out there who love Disney, it's a treat.<br/><br/>In ""Finding Nemo"" we are introduced to two clown fish (who aren't very funny) Nemo & his dad Marlin, who have an arguement as Marlin is overprotective & Nemo is taken by some Scuba Divers. This then leads to Marlin travelling across the ocean facing numerous obstacles in an attempt to get his son back (the rest of the family already dying before the opening credits).<br/><br/>This film progresses in typical Disney style with bright characters (my personal favourites being the Turtles ..... dude!), imaginative scenarios and a couple of classic small sketches (the best being two seagulls sat on the surface and a small bubble appears next to Seagull A. Seagull B looks at him ""nice"" & flies off).<br/><br/>Truth be told, the thing I love about this film is that I can't actually identify that many of the voices. If you look at ""Toy Story"" (still the bench mark, although personally ""Shrek"" is my alltime animation, but then, it isn't Disney), whilst the story is stunning, the voices are blatantly Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and many other well known faces, which ultimately I personally think hinders it slightly. Now if you look at ""Finding Nemo"" whilst one or two of the early characters voices are recogniseable (Ellen DeGeneres being the most notable) for the most part, they may be famous actors, but I found it hard to recognise the voices (hence my surprise at discovering Geoffrey Rush being in it). Ultimately this benefits my enjoyment as after a while, the voices literally become the characters own.<br/><br/>To summarise, this is yet another quality Disney film which is both endering and satisfying. I confess to not being a big fan of recent Disney productions (found ""Monsters Inc"" a bit too infuriating for my tastes and not at all that funny), but with ""Finding Nemo"" they remind me where my heart truely belongs. A stunning film worth it's wait in Coral."

","SOME SPOILERS FOR THE EARLY SECTION OF THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo, the latest in the Disney/Pixar collaborative efforts, is probably one of the best Disney films in a long time.  The film tells the tale of Marlin, a widowed Clown fish who is overly protective of his lone surviving son, Nemo.  Nemo is growing up and resents his father's control. He rebels and ends up being taken by some deep seas divers who are collecting fish to be domesticated.  Marlin is devastated and tries to keep up with the boat.  On his way he meets Dory, a forgetful but kind fish, who agrees to help him in his search for his son.  Together they embark on an odyssey to find Marlin's son, encountering a colorful cast of sea creatures and places.<br/><br/>This film combines both excellent production values and effective storytelling.  The digital effects are beautiful eye candy.  They've come a long way since Toy Story.  Most of the things featured in the movie look real (or like a realistic prosthesis.)  The story combines both hilarious humor and touching drama.  You don't have to be a kid to feel moved by Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"stephenking1985","Null","0","1","23 September 2003"," an instant classic
","A remarkable movie. One of the best animated movie of all time. It has great characters, a load of funny dialogue, and artistic images that only Pixar can create. It's a story of an overprotective father, doing his duty as a single parent for his only son, Nemo. The father, named Marlin, went panic when Nemo got caught by some divers. So, began the journey of finding his son, Nemo (who's now in the aquarium with other fish). Marlin met a forgotful fish named Dory who helped him in finding his son. On the other hand, Nemo and the aquarium gank desperately wanted to get out from the aquarium. This story is full of message, that parents should be more trustful to their children. That teamwork can solve your problems. That, even if you're a handicapped person, doesn't mean that you can't do anything.  Doesn't mean that you have to be protected. It's a family entertainment with heavy message. It's an animated feature at it's most amazing graphics. You'll actually feel wet while watching this movie. It's like you are one of the fish in the computer generated ocean.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo takes animation technique further than what Toy Story did. You just have to see it to believe it. What I love the most about this movie is the richness of it's characters. You'll immediately love Marlin, Dory, Nemo and other characters in this picture. Because they are so real. So funny. So memorable. Finding Nemo has a big strenght in comedy too. Just hear the dialogue and get ready to laugh out loud. There's plenty of jokes here. The clownfish who isn't funny. Sharks who don't eat fish. A pelican who befriend with fish. Sea turtles who talks like surfers. As Pixar said, you just gotta sea it. Sea it. It's better than any of the recent Disney films. It's a treasure, and shares a room with Beauty and The Beast, Lion King, Aladdin and others as the best family entertainment of all time. See it, you won't be disappointed, you'll love it, you'll thank me for that, and you'll know that I'm not lying. 9/10"

","I saw this movie and was totally blown away. The previews looked good, so I figured the movie would be decent. But I was not prepared at all for how incredibly the movie drew everyone in. When I saw it, it wasn't with an enormous amount of little kids, but with people of all ages- 3 to 75. The voice acting is some of the best  ever- especially Ellen DeGeneres. The character of Dory was taken to a whole other level by the quality of Ellen's voice work- you couldn't help but laugh hysterically at almost everything she said. However, she also proved she could do more than just comedy- I don't know how anyone cannot get the slightest bit misty when she says ""I look at you, and....and I'm home...""  Other great voices by Albert Brooks (Marlin), Allison Janney (Peach), Willem Dafoe (Gil), Alexander Gould (Nemo) and Brad Garrett (Brother Blow) make this movie one of the funniest and feel good films I've seen in a long time.

"rdoyle29","8","0","2","11 September 2003"," superb animated film
","Stanton, who helped write ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."", co-wrote and directed this computer-animated comedy-adventure about finding a very small fish in a very large ocean. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is a more-than-slightly paranoid Clown Fish who is extremely devoted to his young son, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould). Nemo is the only survivor after a hungry barracuda swallowed up Nemo's mother and her other offspring. It's not Marlin's nature to explore unfamiliar waters, but when Nemo is captured by a diver near the Great Barrier Reef and ends up in a dentist's fish tank, Marlin gathers his courage and sets out to find his son. As Marlin searches for his son, he makes friends with a friendly but absent-minded Regal Blue Tang named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), a Great White Shark named Bruce (voice of Barry Humphries) who is trying to cut fish out of his diet, a beach-rat Sea Tortoise named Crush (voice of Stanton), and Nigel (voice of Geoffrey Rush), a Pelican who can take Marlin's search from the ocean to dry land. ""Finding Nemo""'s impressive voice cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, Eric Bana, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Bruce Spence. 	""Finding Nemo"" is a superb achievement on three distinct levels. First, the look of the film is gorgeous. The Pixar crew has created a fully realized underwater world. The colors are bright and entrancing, while the movement of the fish is so realistic that the viewer never for a second suspends disbelief. The story is beautifully structured. After establishing the relationship between Marlin and Nemo, the film sets up the separate worlds they each inhabit (the ocean and the fish tank). The screenwriters have dreamed up creative plot points, formulating exciting obstacles (like the wrecking of a filtration system, a dangerous jellyfish zone, and a fish-killing eight-year-old) that allow the film to maintain an exciting pace without sacrificing character or humor. Each member of the cast appears to have been hired for their skills as a performer more than for their name recognition. Brooks, DeGeneres, and Dafoe all communicate real emotional truth in their characters, while such talented vocal performers as Root, Rush, and Humphries lend pitch-perfect comedic support. ""Finding Nemo"" is an inventively written, gorgeously drawn, and perfectly acted animated film."

","FN is a beautiful, touching and highly amusing story that will be enjoyed by millions for decades to come.  It's really too different to Toy Story 2 to make a fair apples 4 apples comp, but since TS2 is the benchmark here, I'll give it a go anyway.<br/><br/>FN is better looking.  The detail is immense in every scene, and I suspect this alone has generated alot of second viewings from those (like myself) who want to make sure we didnt miss anything first time around.<br/><br/>TS2 is funnier - or rather has a sharper ' more adult' sense of humour. FN has some laugh out loud moments, the seagulls in particular I thought were positively Aardman-esque.  But since the main Father/ son characters are actually not very funny at all - TS2 with Woody and Buzz just can't be beat. Plus some of the gags in FN seemed a bit rushed to me, and I sometimes felt I'd missed out on them.<br/><br/>Voice-wise - call it a draw.  Special mention to Barry Humphries as a Vegetarian Shark.  Perfect, possums.<br/><br/>Story.  Hmmmmm this is where the apples for apples thing gets much harder. Everything in TS1 and 2 was under-pinned by the constant fear of discovery by adults. It gave extra dramatic zest to every scene.  FN doesn't have the same backdrop - where action centres more often than not around avoiding being eaten.  This is often fun and exciting, but lacks the X factor of TS IMHO, and when the action stops, there's nothing there lurking in the background to keep the whole thing sizzling along.  This being said, I think that FN had a few nice messages for the younger and adult audience, and got them over without being the usual Disney blunt instrument.  Although the story was very linear - the relief of the Dentist's fish tank worked nicely.<br/><br/>Overall - TS2 still the benchmark for this kind of movie - but FN is still an extremely attractive fun addition to the repertoire.  You will want to see it again I suspect on the big screen - if nothing else then for the sheer inventive detail of the Ocean environment.<br/><br/>Looking forwards already to the next one in the pixar pipeline....."

","Yeah, I waited till the last minute to weigh in: everyone on earth has seen this already ;)<br/><br/>There are very few things not to like in Pixar's 4th movie. The undersea environment was spectacular. The fishy critters were all diverse and interesting and the humor was on par with the Toy Story line. Yeah, there was the whole Di$ney-parent curse where no main character can ever seem to have BOTH parents live to see credits, and I find the forced sympathy of a lost parent to be not only overused but a lame crutch for uncreative writers... but it really was fairly well played and I'll forgive it given the overwhelming number of good things that the movie offered.<br/><br/>The kids managed to sit through the whole thing (which is rare even for a Pixar movie) and laughed. I enjoyed every moment of it and rarely gave a second thought about it being animated except to admire the beauty of the scenes and to pick out occational Toy Story references. All the characters were interesting and well done.<br/><br/>I would have given the story a 10 but it fell just short of perfect in enough places for me to note. Several cliche-ish story twists, a bit of plot stumbling and a few scenes really sort of dragged on. Call it personal preferences or whatever, but hey: a 9 is a rare gem in this summer's wasteland of lackluster blockbusters."

The constant action is a genuine part of what makes this movie purely enjoyable: 1.Instead of trying to imitate from Ghibli animation and probably come up with some superficial deep theme, it stays loyal to cinematic style of continuous excitement as in Monster Inc 2.It follows the initial plot hint; ""the ocean is not a safe place""<br/><br/>Having something beautiful thrown (or presented) at me, I started to compare movies. I noticed some potential inspirational scenes from Spirited Away (intro of theme with title shown, same closing scene etc)& other Ghibli films. Also came to think of how one is deeper than the other, although it has so much unfamiliar/weird ideas and so on. However, I finally got to a level of change of attitude. I stopped comparing and/or putting these profound work of art in ranks.<br/><br/>It's futile trying to put those works in ranks. They simply reach deep within, and such is a unique, wonderful, and heart warming experience; Finding Nemo, Majo no Takkyubin, Whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday, Porco Rosso, Totoro, Spirited Away...the list grows"

","A ""must-sea"" effort for all who have loved the previous Pixar fare, Andrew Stanton directs this lovable adventure that stars himself and such well-known names as Albert Brooks, Barry Humphries, Ellen DeGeneres and Christopher Gould (who voices the title character).<br/><br/>With its well-paced action and stunning visuals, this is a truly brilliantly-told story set deep in the Australian ocean that tells of Nemo, the young clownfish who is captured and sent to live in the fishtank of a Sydney dentist. There, his adventure starts, and as his father, Marlin, begins a quest to find his only son, Nemo tries to escape from his new home, thanks to the friendly group of fish who live there.<br/><br/>While this movie marks the comeback of the good storytelling traits of the older Disney animated films, ""Finding Nemo"" is truly the most complete Disney film of any kind (and more complete than this, the MPAA rating information appears at the end of the theatrical version). In addition, be on the look-out for the 1989 short ""Knick Knack"" before the feature.<br/><br/>This is a highly recommended Disney film that is better than all of last year's box office fare combined. I give it a solid 10\10--the best effort so far from the Disney\Pixar collaboration.<br/><br/>(NB  Watch out for a few hidden surprises from the last few Pixar films while watching!)"

","I thought Finding Nemo was one of the best films I have ever seen. Not only did it have excellent animation but it also had a heartwarming story as well.  If one were to peel back the layers of this story, some powerful lessons in the game of life could be found.  Although the main characters are portrayed as colorful tropical fish, it is easy to apply these messages to ourselves as well.  Two lessons from this movie were especially appealing to me. The first was Marlin and the way he overcame his fear of leaving his home and losing sight of his son Nemo.  That is quite understandable, for Marlin had gone through a very tragic incident with the destruction of his mate and all but one of his eggs.  When Nemo was taken away by divers, he did not just give up and accept that he would never see his son again.  He went after his son, faced his fears, overcame enormous obstacles, and discovered the value of trust with another fish he had befriended along the way. The next lesson occurred when Nemo got stuck in the filter and Gill insisted that he get himself out.  Nemo assumed that his gimpy fin was an obstacle and would therefore make it impossible for him to get out. Also, his dad always helped him in those situations.  When Nemo got himself out, the expression was of confidence and pride.  A disability does not mean that person can do less than anyone else.  The values of trust, letting go, and facing your fears in the setting of the fascinating ocean environment, along with the comic relief of Dory, proved an ingenious way of making an excellent film. I hope viewers will take the opportunity to take the messages to help themselves grow as people.  I know I did."

"rocmaster","9","0","1","3 August 2003"," Truly a gem!
","Since it was hard to imagine Pixar ever topping its original Toy Story, and upon first learning on who was going to provide the voices of the characters, I was not enthusiastic about Finding Nemo. None of the other Pixar releases (Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc.) quite measured up to the original Toy Story, so I had reduced Nemo to rental status. It took a sold out show of Pirates of the Caribbean to make me experience one of the most enjoyable movies I have had the pleasure of watching on the big screen. There are movies that can be enjoyed equally on the theaters or at home, and there are others that you just have to shell out the 8 or so dollars and watch it on theater, and Finding Nemo is definitely one of the latter.<br/><br/>The computer recreation of water and light should in itself amaze you. I know it did to me. The way sand floats, how light shines through rippling water, how algae looks in a dirty aquarium...all recreated in a way that exceeded any expectations I may have had. The story, albeit simplistic in form, is touching and quick paced. The movie never feels like it is an hour and forty minutes long, and that is because Nemo has what I consider one of the best voiced over animated character ever in movie cinema. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that Ellen DeGeneres, whom I never cared for as an actor, could match, and even toppled Woody Allen's comedic delivery as Z in ANTZ, but she delivers the goods, and then some. As the voice of the memory lacking Dory, DeGeneres performance is truly worthy of recognition. Add the amazing way the animators converted DeGeneres excellent voice performance into animated facial expression on Dory, and you have one exquisite character. She is truly the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Funny, addictive, surprising, mesmerizing, Finding Nemo has the substance to please both young and old alike. Just be sure you experience Nemo on a theater...you will be sorry if you don't."

","Well, I can honestly say... I'm 23 and a guy, yet for one reason or another I find myself put in these situations to watch Children's movies. I've seen Shrek, which I loved. Now, I've seen Finding Nemo, which I love MORE. Ellen Degeneres had me, as well as other adults there with their children, cracking up throughout the movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. While I hate Albert Brooks with a passion, he was perfect for the role of Nemo's father (voice wise). He, however, was the only character I hated. But I loved all the Tank Fish, and Dory, and the Sharks, & others were all wonderful. I think any open minded person who can enjoy a laugh, or who can remember their youth, would enjoy this movie. For Children it is a fun cartoon full of adventure and surprise. For Adults it is a great movie that makes you reflect on your youth, and if you are a parent, yourself as a parent. It also gives you laughs you'd never expect to have in a movie like this. While Shrek was meaningful and romantic, Finding Nemo was hilarious and really got you into it and has another message to get to everyone and I HIGHLY Recommend you see this before it leaves theatres, and if it's too late..

The story is engaging and the humor is of the rare variety that can entertain both adults and children without insulting either group's intelligence.  Pixar proves, without resorting to gratuitous depictions of sex and violence (like much of Japanese anime), that cartoons are not just for children.

","I don't usually see animated movies in the theater, and when I do, I never see them a second time, except on video. However, this was the first exception. This immediately became my favorite animated movie, and I actually decided to go back and see it a second time. None of my friends who I saw it with the first time wanted to go back so I went with some others who hadn't yet seen it.<br/><br/>As an 18-year-old, I know many kids my age pan animated movies as only for younger kids, and while this is true for many of them, there have been several that are good for anyone. One of the features I have noticed in Pixar movies (Monsters, Inc.; Toy Story; this) is that they direct the action towards younger kids, but add a number of lines that only an older audience will understand.<br/><br/>Finding Nemo was excellent all around. Technically, it was incredibly well made- with realistic fish-like movements and equally realistic human-like facial expressions, not to mention the amazing aquatic scenery. The technical part actually added to the movie as a whole, making the characters more real, and therefore easier to relate to, despite the fact that they were fish. And then, of course, the plot and action of the film were great. It was funny, creative, and simply entertaining in general. The characters were likeable, the action was fast-moving, and the story was well-written. This will easily win best animated feature of 2003.<br/><br/>In fact, the only criticism I have is not of the movie but of Pixar: since they did almost all the work in creating this film, it seems that they really don't need Disney as a distributor. They have already made enough of a name for themselves that without the backing of a giant motion-picture distributor, they could release the films themselves and produce the same amount of money- only they would be able to keep it all, instead of having to fork over huge portions to Disney."

Of course saying `this isn't the best that Pixar have done' is kind of like giving a starving man 5 slices of Pizza and him saying the fifth slice isn't as good as the first!<br/><br/>What makes this film is the witty script, the engaging story, likeable characters and superb vocal talent. As with many kids films there are messages to both parents and to children, about believing in yourself and what have you but Pixar have a knack of making the entire audience sit their with their mouths open, laughing, flinching and holding back a tear all in unison, with the odd separation at poo jokes (for kids and big kids) and subtle innuendo (for the grown ups and youngen's who know too much for their age).<br/><br/>The cast of voices is impressive, headed up by Albert Brooks as Marlon, searching for his son Nemo, and also Ellen Degeneres. Admittedly I have always found Ellen funny but tiresome after too much, here no such problem, quoting from another review, `Ellen gives the sort of vocal performance that all others will now be judged by`, and it's true she brings the character to life so perfectly that even previous voice's for Pixar including Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack can't compare. The audience loved her character. <br/><br/>This is a fantastic movie, Pixars ability to combine their fantastic animation yet tell enchanting stories and get some fantastic vocal performance is second to none. Every time they bring a film out every two years it is one of the best of the year easily. Finding Nemo is no exception, this is movie making magic, an animated film about talking fish actually manages to gather more excitement than many of the big action blockbusters, and they were exciting themselves! *****"
"paul_auster","Null","0","1","16 July 2003"," Awe-inspiring animation does not a watchable movie make
","First things first.  Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks aren't funny. They never have been.  So when Disney slots this bungling pair as the voices of the two lead characters in FINDING NEMO, then we haven't got much to look forward to.  Or have we?  After all, the animation is stunning.  And once we get past the fact that Degeneres' voice comes from a fish actually modeled to look like her, then it is momentarily possible to get lost in the pixelated splendor of Disney's greatest animating achievement to date. The sea sparkles with the magical touches of what must have been countless talented, tireless animators.  But is this enough?  The plot stinks like a rancid Freudian family drama.   And the missing sexual tension between the two lead characters (both single) is a glaring mistake.  But it does have something going for it.  Almost every scene on land is fantastic.  The comedy is spot on, and the noticeable disparity between good jokes and great timing (on land) and dull, tiresome jokes in the sea (where most of the movie is spent, and where Brooks and Degeneres flounder along, oblivious to their own inanity) make the humor on land seem that much better. Overall, however, the movie is unbearable.  It's one thing for it to be unswervingly predictable.  Sure, every Disney movie is.  But getting from beginning to end doesn't have to seem like a chore, a penance for some wrong that i didn't realize i committed.  Or maybe the wrong was simply buying the movie tickets and supporting Disney.  And i sure got punished for that."

Excellent, positive, entertaining plot, solid special effects, and good humor make this the best family movie I've paid too much to see so far this summer! Yup, we'll end up buying it! Check out this movie for a good, ol' fashioned entertaining time to spend with your family! You won't have to worry about sex scenes, or adult language, and you'll have a good time to boot! More! More! More!"

","""Finding Nemo"" is a whale of a tale (to borrow from the Disney song borrowed in this movie) about fathers and sons, friends and trust, and facing your fears.<br/><br/>Beautifully illustrated and voiced, Finding Nemo is a movie that will delight audiences of all ages.  Ellen DeGeneres had the adults and kids rocking with laughter in one of the best sequences of the movie, and both DeGeneres and Albert Brooks were able to bring real warmth and emotion to the movie.  The storyline, which I will not go into, is written well enough that it never talks down to anyone and does not rely on worn-out clichÃ©s.<br/><br/>As far as the animation goes, it is now undeniable that Pixar leads the pack for clarity, realism, and art.  If you doubt this, check out the reef sequences, or the fish tank sequences.  I could easily have lost myself in the sheer beauty of their animation.  <br/><br/>A definite must-see while it's still in the theaters, and it's on my DVD wish list, too."

","Face it, they're Disney. They can turn out a completely unwatchable piece of tripe and it will still make money. And Pixar has completely earned the right to rest on its laurels. In these days where half-assed efforts are more the norm for studio pictures, it is refreshing to see that they actually got their backs into this one. It is funny, touching, visually stunning, and completely entertaining at every level. The voice talent is uniformly stunning, though it is Ellen DeGeneres who steps up a few classes and all but steals the movie as Dori, the fish with no short-term memory. Albert Brooks, it is to be hoped, will finally gain a small portion of the respect due him for this popular but uncompromised role. A must-see."

"lancec","10","0","1","29 June 2003"," Another world (and, finally, the movie that gets us there)
","I think that some of the more recent box-office successes have been attractive because they have been able to transport people out of this hectic world into some other place.  These movies, such as the original Star Wars Trilogy, the first Matrix movie, The Lord of the Rings, and others, have created this escape in enough depth and detail such that the viewer feels fully removed from their actual surroundings.<br/><br/>Only a handful of these movies though, can take the audience somewhere else and still deal with real-world issues, all at once.  Finding Nemo is one of these movies.  And believe me, this ""other world"" is like nothing you've ever seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Pixar has out-done everyone, INCLUDING themselves.  Finding Nemo's underwater world is on the one hand distant and mysterious and on the other distinguishable and realistic.  The ocean setting has allowed Pixar to really let loose -- with amazing canvases of brilliant color, a shimmering, shifting, particulate-filled sea, and some of the best drawn non-human characters ever.  In Finding Nemo there is a wonderful paradox:  a far-away world that you can actually visit when you leave the theater.<br/><br/>But Finding Nemo's fantasy and reality two-step doesn't stop with the animation.  The story takes that same theme.  The characters -- a family of clown fish, a blue tang, a posse of sharks, pelicans, crazy seagulls, and the demonic dentist's daughter -- add a sense of fantasy and humor.  But their trials -- the young one finding himself, a father's struggle against loss, the lonely one's sense of need, and the elder's desire to break free from his trapped life -- are real-world, everyday issues.  And, in typical Disney fashion, the movie is moved along by an epic quest that brings all of these disparate pieces together.  Everything in Finding Nemo is allegorical, and although the story line itself is not as creative as some show-stopping narrative like Requiem for a Dream, the way the script relates to both the characters at the fantasy level and the audience at the reality level is novel and inspiring.<br/><br/>Despite some of my roommates' skepticism, I wanted to see this movie from the moment I first heard the concept.  For me -- that's some hype to live up to.  But unlike the sequels in the Matrix and Star Wars series, Finding Nemo delivers -- a fantasy / reality combination that I hope won't soon be forgotten. 10/10"

"bix171","10","0","1","28 June 2003"," Pixar And Brooks Make A Great Team
","Pixar assumes the responsibility of gently leading children on the path to adulthood from Disney (itself busy trying to attract adolescents with more mature animated and live-action films) and delivers a beautiful, exciting animated feature about a neurotic clownfish who must rescue his kidnapped son, trapped in an aquarium in a Sydney dentist's office. Albert Brooks is the voice of the phobic father and it's a perfect fit, so much so it seems to have been designed around his persona--he's quite clearly part of the creative process and makes it as personal for him as it does for Andrew Stanton, the director (who also developed the story). It's in perfect harmony with Brooks' body of work as a filmmaker, showcasing his desire for familial overprotection that was at the heart of his `Mother' (but with none of the smug self-righteousness that marred it). His Marlin is joined on his journey by a hilarious Ellen DeGeneres as a short-term memory-challenged bluefish named Dory and she brings the simple verbal vaudeville of Gracie Allen in endearing herself to the audience. We've become quite accustomed to Pixar's dazzling visuals and this film is no exception, with its exquisite painter's palette of sea colors (particularly the shimmering, watery shades of teal and the sharp pastels that comprise the landscape) but the story is the design's equal, a balanced, clear-eyed view of father-son relationships and the recognition of personal growth by one another--it's moving and meaningful at the same time."

I went with my friend and his 5 year old and there were some parts that were a bit scary for him (the 5 year old, not my friend). He still enjoyed the movie however.

I just didn't laugh, though.  The whale talk got stale--fast, the 12 step shark program wasn't that funny.  I liked the seagulls, and I liked the Psycho reference.  Finally, I thought the most striking thing was that Marlin (the father) was the one expected to mature and let Nemo go.

"Quinoa1984","10","0","2","11 June 2003"," Pixar's best since Bug's Life- The voice work corresponds magnificently with the artwork
","Finding Nemo, from co-directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich (who have worked as directors on past pixar films like Bug's life and Toy Story 2) have devised an adventure film that takes the viewer far beyond anything imaginable with Little Mermaid. In fact, much of the humor and dialogue reminded me of the sophistication that went with an animated movie like Antz, where the top celebrity personalities came forth to give voice to wonderful creature creations.<br/><br/>And speaking of Antz, this time there is a neurotic, obsessive caricature of a comic in Finding Nemo, here named Marlin and played by Albert Brooks. After his wife, a clown fish, and his hundreds of eggs are devoured by a larger fish, he finds one egg left and becomes compulsive in securing it's safety. His son Nemo, it turns out, gets caught in a diver's net and taken to a Dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. This sets Marlin off on his quest across the ocean, along with a fish who forgets things as soon as their mentioned, voiced by Ellen Degeneres. They encounter sharks in rehab, turtles with Californian accents, a whale (quasi-Pinnochio there), and much more, all the while little Nemo, inside the fish-tank and renamed Sharkbate, starts to gain the courage his father never considered he had, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>The Pixar team, like in their previous treats, deliver worlds that usually can only exist in the imagination - the under-the-ocean scenes, making up about 65 percent of the film, are obviously breathtaking in design while not going overboard in realism, and the scenes in the dentist office and on the pier are precise too. It's like we've thought we've been here before, but now the filmmakers take us right into the nexus of it. This splendor, along with the voice work by Brooks, Degeneres, Willem Dafoe as the leader of the fish-tank pack, Geoffrey Rush as a pelican, and all the supporting parts, give anyone in any age group the finest animated spectacle of the summer. <br/><br/>By the way, those seagulls are the funniest thing Pixar's come up with since the aliens in Toy Story!"
"Mavrick198","5","0","1","11 June 2003"," Not Pixar's best
","I love the Toy Story movies and enjoyed Monsters Inc., so I was looking forward to Finding Nemo. Unfortunately, Nemo was not nearly as enjoyable as Pixar's other fine movies.<br/><br/>I found very few genuine laughs in Nemo. I thought Dory, a fish with short term memory, was cute and had a few funny moments, but otherwise the movie fell flat. A lot of the jokes were just not funny. Some of the characters were your typical run of the mill cartoon characters, such as the 'surfer-dude' turtle, which I could have done without.<br/><br/>Technically, Nemo looks great. The visuals are good. But, I can't help thinking with the whole underwater world that they could not come up with more dazzling characters other than shark, turtle, whale, etc...<br/><br/>
The bottom line is that Nemo is a pretty movie that ends up feeling empty with very few laughs and flat characters. I give it a 5 out of 10."

It is not flawless. It's not for everyone as reviews seem to indicate.<br/><br/>Actually I enjoyed listening to all the little kids reacting to the movie. My daughter is too young for this one yet - a baby. One thing I was thinking was that this movie might be a little too scary for some of these kids. I would say there were at least 6 times when 'the fish' almost died. There where some scary predators - including humans. After all these are little fish - little fish make good food for big fish. Which would be fine but the predators were also very scary looking. Geez, when I was a kid the Wicked Witch in Wizard of Oz scared me, that is nothing compared to the creatures in this movie.<br/><br/>Also, when watching this movie I could already see a sequel.

I enjoyed Albert Brooks, who always gives a stellar performance, as well as Ellen DeGeneres.  Brad Garrett using his Robert Barone voice as the blowfish was a great choice, but unfortunately there was too little of the witty action that you normally see in Pixar movies, and instead there's quite a bit of the tense action that you usually see in a Jurassic Park movie instead of a Pixar animation. I would rate this movie as being better than A Bug's Life, which I didn't care for, but not as good as either Toy Story 1/2 or Monsters, Inc.  The teaser for Pixar's next movie and the animated short before the main feature were both great tho, and when all was said and done, I'm still not sorry that I went to see it.

Wonderfully enchanting animated instant classic from the geniuses at Pixar keep their winning streak alive with this remarkably lively tale about life under the sea and focusing on neurotic clownfish Marlin (ably voiced by Brooks in full panic mode) whose overprotective parenting gets the best of him when his only off-spring Nemo (Gould) winds up in the net of a diver from Australia, thus sending him on an incredible journey to reunite with his progeny. On hand to aid him is the dotty blue fish Dory (DeGeneres who is pitch-perfect hilarious and steals the show) whose positive sunny disposition is only circumvented by her consistent short-term memory loss making it a bumpy ride along.<br/><br/>Fun for the entire family with some serious belly-laughs of one-liners and sight gags that deserve a second viewing to get them all. Kudos to Stanton (who co-directs with Lee Unkrich and voices a surfer-dude sea turtle dad) who co-wrote with Bob Peterson and David Reynolds the cleverly antic script. ).
