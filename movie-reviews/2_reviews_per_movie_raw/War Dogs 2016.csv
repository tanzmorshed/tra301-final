"MR_Heraclius","8","48","53","21 February 2020"," Better than I expected.
","War Dogs is based on a true story where two twenty somethings sell arms back to the US government. Jonah Hill and Mills Teller put up a great performance, they made the story very appealing. The storyline had plenty of connections with Scarface, from locations to tag lines. It was a good movie with a great cast. Definitely worth watching."
"bodeanura","8","175","209","21 August 2016"," It's good. Better than ""fine"" but not ""great"".
","Right off the bat the best part of this movie is the acting: Teller and Hill have great chemistry on screen. Jonah does a particularly good job at playing the ""guy you love to hate"". I can't attest to the faithfulness of their portrayal of the real life people since I don't know anything about them. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.<br/><br/>The marketing for this movie was, unfortunately, deceitful: the trailer made it out to be this upbeat, funny, over the top comedy - which it's not. In reality the movie has a much slower pace, not a lot of situational humor and is certainly not filled with hilarious quips (the bulk of which are in the trailer). This is not to say that the movie was bad or not at all funny, it just wasn't what I expected (and I am sure I'm not alone).<br/><br/>My final critique will go unnoticed for the majority of viewers but I found it personally offensive so I have to report it: some of the movie takes place in Albania, only the set for Albania is actually Romania. Which is fine, I understand that they probably did this for practical reasons and as a Romanian movie goer I just have to accept it (we all recognized it immediately though). However, at some point in the movie an ""Albanian"" woman says something, only she says it in Romanian. This may not seem like much but it totally took me out of the movie and ruined the experience for me. I find it completely unacceptable that they could not hire an Albanian to say those few lines. The two languages might seem interchangeable to the rest of the world, I am sure, but that was very much NOT the case for me and everyone else in the theater.<br/><br/>I am a paying movie goer as well and I expect to be just as entertained as everyone else. This is, of course, not the first time that I've seen this in a film. But when a producer does something like this it shows me that they don't respect their movie, so they can't expect me to.<br/><br/>My rating, however, is not based on this final bit of criticism. I gave it a 7/10 for slow pacing and lack of humor, which is the opposite of what I expected.<br/><br/>I'd still recommend it, just don't expect to be blown away.<br/><br/>After watching it for a second time I decided to change my original rating from 7/10 to 8/10, mainly because the acting is just great and I respect the fact that the movie made me think about it and made me want to see it again."
"lee_eisenberg","6","34","40","30 November 2016"," war is a business, and we're the commodity
","I don't know enough about the original story to determine the accuracy of Todd Phillips's ""War Dogs"", but it's an enjoyable movie. The tricks pulled by David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli just go to show that the people in the business of weapons have no principles (even violating arms embargoes). They're out to make money by any means necessary. To be certain, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq proved quite profitable for weapons manufacturers. The mistake that Packouz and Diveroli made was getting caught.<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece, but it does a respectable job showing the degrees to which these types go to enrich themselves. A very slimy world indeed."
"phd_travel","9","74","96","1 September 2016"," Eye opening - very interesting and funny look at arms dealing
","The story is eye opening, relevant and very clearly told with a humorous tone through the serious subject matter. This is based on a true story with some fictionalized elements to make it entertaining. A massage therapist links up with a childhood friend who is a small time arms dealer. Very interesting to get a look at the legal but morally questionable world of arms dealing. I thought this would be a juvenile buddy movie with a bit of war thrown in but it isn't.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill has some funny lines and he does a great job with the over the top character but he can be subtly sinister when he needs to be. Miles Teller plays his character sympathetically and I liked him here. Quite different from the rather annoying characters he usually plays. Bradley Cooper who produced the movie and has a small but pivotal role and he is effective as an arms dealer.<br/><br/>Quite a transporting experience as the action takes you from Miami to Jordan and Iraq with some funny situations there and Albania.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. It deserves to do better than it has so far."
"SpoilerAlertReviews","8","38","47","1 September 2016"," Is that even legal??
","Hangover/Due Date director Todd Philipps makes a film base on the true story of young, entrepreneur gun-runners David Parkouz and Efraim Diveroli who managed to secure a ridiculous contract to supply arms to the afghan army via the pentagon. <br/><br/>Miles Teller plays the struggling and ambitious David who bumps into his childhood buddy Efraim played by Jonah Hill who is somewhat of the opposite, a loose cannon, fearless and a little trigger-happy. Now, Efraim has found himself a little niche in the market, the market of arms dealing and strikes up small deals with the US military. David needs a job to support his expecting girlfriend, the stunning Ana de Armas who looks a little like Penelope Cruz only more beautiful and has one of those exotic accents. Efraim sees an opportunity for David and the two team up to what leads to the deal of the century for all parties involved. <br/><br/>Now, the film has plenty of other film references most notably Scarface, even one of the promotional posters is a respectful nod to the DePalma/Pacino's film. But it's actually Lord of War Efraim is a huge fan of in real-life and it's probably more like Lord of War than Scarface, yet it has tinge of Pain & Gain, another crazy true story movie. Maybe it's Miami? But it has that vibrant and funny yet serious storytelling style that makes the film almost unbelievable and shocking. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast does include Bradley Cooper who also produced the film, playing the harden, borderline war-criminal, pretty much the Branson of the arms market and someone you don't really want to be messing with. There's Kevin Pollack playing the bankroll and an awesome cameo of venture capitalist playboy millionaire Dan Bilzerian. <br/><br/>It's accompanied by a great soundtrack with tracks from 50cent, Beastie Boys, Iggy Pop, UB40 and CCR but the awesome score threw me completely thinking it was Harry Gregson-Williams or Steve Jablonski, no, it was Cliff Martinez with those ambient sounds. <br/><br/>The film is highly entertaining, funny in parts but this is not a comedy; its perfectly paced with some great scenes like the duo gun-running across the triangle of death and some nice camera work. However it's not to epic portions, not that it should put anyone off watching this, it's still a very watchable and enjoyable film and I don't think they could have done it any better. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for a slick story, good editing and a great score/soundtrack to boot. <br/><br/>78% 8/10"

"CANpatbuck3664","8","16","19","3 September 2016"," Interesting Story About 2 Con Artists Selling Weapons to the U.S. Government
","I was pretty stoked to see War Dogs. Jonah Hill has been on a roll lately and having an unconventional director like Todd Phillips telling a story about 2 guys lucking into a giant contract to arm the U.S. government was intriguing. I'm also a big fan of Lord of War, I think it's really underrated (one of Nicolas Cage's best movies) and I was excited to see a similar story. After having seen War Dogs, don't expect something mind-blowing but it does have an interesting story to tell.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* David Packouz (Miles Teller) is working as a massage therapist in Miami. He's working to try and start a family with his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) but he hasn't really found any purpose in his life. He gets stoned and tries to get through his day and his clients sexually harassing him. He also makes a stop as he's trying to sell bed sheets on the side and its not going well. The next day he has to go to a funeral for a friend and he runs into his best friend from middle school Efraim Deveroli (Jonah Hill). The two were trouble makers in their younger years and its implied that their parents separated them against their will. Efraim is happy to see David and they catch up a little bit. Efraim laughs at what David is doing and tells him he had a falling out with his last business partner (his uncle) and he moved back to Miami to set up shop for himself. He deals in small time contracts supplying arms to the U.S. government. David is impressed but is against the war. They go to score weed and when they get ripped off Efraim pulls out an assault rifle from the trunk of his car. It certainly causes the dealers to scatter and he invites David to his office to explain his job to him a little better the next day.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie has a really interesting hook. AEY (the company David and Efraim eventually form) finding contracts to fill that major suppliers ignore and making bank off of them is fun to watch. Efraim and David aren't completely incompetent but they're dishonest and they don't understand their place in their industry. How they could appear legitimate enough to be so seriously involved with Uncle Sam is baffling. It's a so strange it's true story and they include some interesting bits about how the U.S. government supplied their army in the Iraq war. War Dogs doesn't have too many twists and turns that you don't see coming but you'll find yourself wanting to know where David and Efraim will go next. It's not as informative as The Big Short for example but you do pick up some good nuggets along with following a pretty engaging story.<br/><br/>I mentioned that Todd Phillips was a strange choice considering how serious the material is. The trailers for War Dogs are misleading, the movie is more of a drama than a comedy but I enjoyed it all the same. It did have the sense of humour that Todd's movies tend to have (on the dark side and sometimes vulgar). The movie was also a lot more stylish than I expected it to be. It's well filmed and there was more effort put into creating an attractive movie as opposed to just relying on the material. The soundtrack was also good but it was a little on the nose and they really blared it at points. It didn't make me mad but the lack of subtlety with it was a little annoying.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill continues his recent run of excellent work. It's not my favourite performance of his but he brings life to this movie and although his character is a scumbag, he's the proficient one and how he's able to navigate through his job is one of the big reasons War Dogs works. Miles Teller is also good, he's playing the more normal of the two characters and he's less in your face. Bradley Cooper really does excellent work in the short amount of screen time he gets. He's menacing and I was happy to watch him play a different part in this movie. His character was more in the background and I liked that, any other movie would have made him an over-the-top villain. He was an appropriately ruthless businessman and it seemed more real. It was nice to see Kevin Pollak again and I also liked Ana de Armas in her role, she's definitely a supporting part and while she's not given a whole lot of backstory, she's fine in her part.<br/><br/>Another small thing I liked with War Dogs is that the ending didn't go the typical route. This is a rise and fall story and it looks like you're going to get that same old ending. War Dogs sidesteps that and instead of scolding David for doing what he did, they go for something more open-ended. The moral of the story is that what they did was wrong but instead of beating you over the head with it, they pose the question that will David stick to his new found moral code when presented with temptation? It was different and it upped the grade of the movie for me.<br/><br/>I thought War Dogs was an interesting movie that did a good job presenting the story of these 2 guys in a different way. It follows a familiar arc and you can guess where the story is going to go but the acting and the new angle it presents on arms dealers help compensate. I still prefer Lord of War but this was a solid movie and a good way to close out the summer movie season."
"tomgillespie2002","6","18","22","3 December 2016"," Entertaining true-life tale that doesn't have the nerve to go all the way
","There were many shocking and quite unbelievable stories to emerge from the U.S. during the Bush/Cheney administration, but none were quite as fantastical as the overwhelming position 20-something minor-league arms dealers Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz found themselves in. Their tale is utterly preposterous, but entirely true, although events naturally have been dramatised for the film. Like something straight out of a culture-clash comedy from the 1980s, Diveroli and Packouz landed a $298 million Pentagon contract involving over a hundred million rounds of ammunition. The mishandling of the deal and the pair's subsequent falling out was covered in a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, and later in a book by Lawson entitled Arms and the Dudes.<br/><br/>David Packouz (Miles Teller) is a pot-smoking massage therapist working in Miami, Florida, dividing his spare time between his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas) and trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to flog the high-quality Egyptian bed-sheets that he has invested in to retirement homes. At a funeral, he encounters his old best friend Efraim (Jonah Hill), who has made a success in Los Angeles trading in arms on eBay. They rekindle their friendship, despite Efraim proving himself to be a unpredictable loose-cannon, and David eventually joins his chum at his new business venture AEY. With the war raging in Iraq, the government has set up a website offering contracts for weapons and military equipment. David's job is to pick up the crumbs; those small orders the big companies ignore.<br/><br/>There are, as Efraim informs David, a hell of a lot of crumbs, and the two are soon making their fortunes while Efraim indulges in everything from prostitutes to copious amounts of cocaine. The two grew up loving Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), and imagery from the film adorns AEY's office walls. The same unquenchable greed that possessed Al Pacino's character seems to drive Efraim also, and it isn't long before you can see the inevitable downfall on the horizon. Director Todd Phillips, on the back of those terrible The Hangover sequels, seems to be intent on making a semi-serious film, and wisely takes inspiration from some of America's great dark-side- of-the-American-dream cinematic works, such as De Palma's aforementioned drug-lord saga and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990). But, unlike Adam McKay's The Big Short from last year, Phillips doesn't have the nerve to go all the way.<br/><br/>Where McKay exquisitely balanced comedy, drama and satire to dazzling effect, Phillips seems too intent on focusing on the goofball antics of its hapless anti-heroes to deliver any real bite. This is a story that highlights many things from the government's irresponsible approach to warfare, the dangerous practice of allowing just anybody to legally deal in arms, and the devastating effects of blind ambition, but these themes are only touched upon. Packouz is essentially our lead character, but he feels like little more than an exposition tool, with de Armas getting the thankless role of the boring partner who must warn her hubby whenever his actions lead him into the dark side. Thankfully, Jonah Hill is a tour de force, cranking his loathsome character up to 11 without ever feeling unbelievable, proving once again what a versatile actor he is becoming. If you're looking for an intelligent satire of a fascinating recent event, then you probably won't find it here, but as a piece of entertainment, it certainly delivers."

"joshuaprentice","8","34","52","29 August 2016"," Solid film, but lacks originality
","This film is definitely worth the watch. Jonah Hill and Myles Teller both shine superbly in this film, and Bradley Cooper has some genuine mystique about him during his performance. However, this is the second film I have seen this year, that seems to try and recapture the brilliance of Martin Scorcese's 'Wolf of wall street'. What I mean by that is both this film and 'The Big Short' take a complex real life event, that not a whole lot of people fully understood, and made a film that took time to make light of the scenarios, and tried to explain them to the audience in a common way. <br/><br/>This film does it well, and beats 'The Big Short' as it was definitely the easier film to follow. However, it does use a lot of comedy aspects from 'Wold of Wall Street'. You compare Jonah Hill's character Efraim to Donnie his character from TWOWS, they are exactly the same for the first half of this movie. Also, this movie makes light of a very serious real life scenario, and felt to safe considering the context. It's to light hearted and the only real drama or tension comes from the two friends. <br/><br/>On it's own this film is highly re-watchable, and that's down to the lightheartedness, but take a second to stop and think about the real life story, it feels to lighthearted. With Wall Street it worked because all the characters were terrible people, so it was funny to see them mess up. Here, Myles Teller plays a very likable character, and with some of the sinister characters, this film needed to feel more threatening. <br/><br/>However, credit is where credits due, the film did a great job of breaking down how arms dealing works, the same way TWOWS did for stock brokering. and the tone just felt fun, and made it easy to watch. To use wrestling terms, the heel turn seemed a little off, and needed more build, and also just the amount of similarities to TWOWS, from the way they close it out, to Jonah Hill's performance, just the narration by Teller, these films are almost parallel, so that holds this film back from being truly great. <br/><br/>But, the funny thing is, this film works. Hill's performance as both a comedic and dramatic actor is fantastic, he balances the two so well. If you haven't seen TWOWS, your going to love this move a hell of a lot, while the film lacks the risks to make it an instant classic, and is to lighthearted on the seriousness of this real life industry, its still fun and re-watchable, and the script and how this film flows just makes it enjoyable viewing. <br/><br/>I know I have talked long about the lack of originality, but honestly besides that and the lack of tone, or pushing the boundaries, the film does its job well. Hill and Teller have great chemistry, and I could go back and watch this over and over again. The effort to make people aware of this event can not be faulted, and they made arms dealing and the art of war a lot easier to understand that Big Short did for the financial crisis in 08. The sinister tone to end it, was definitely a tonal shift, but I won't spoil it for you here. I'm just going to say, you will have fun, if you're a fan of TWOWS or similar films, or you really enjoy Jonah Hill or Myles Teller, they deliver. I'm giving it a 4/5 stars. <br/><br/>If it pushed the boundaries more, and had more originality I would have given it a 4.5 which I only reserve for great movies. As it is though, it's a re-watchable, fun, well acted, educational film. And you won't even know you're being educated."

","This is my review of War Dogs (spoiler free).<br/><br/>*** (3/5) Cast: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, Bradley Cooper.<br/><br/>Plot: Two men who were best friends in high school decide to reunite and become arms dealers, but as their life they get a deal that could possibly be the best deal for them, however this deal could be a big mistake for these two.<br/><br/>War Dogs is sold as a comedy. Yet it is the most serious adult war comedy out there. After director Todd Phillips' made an impact in the comedy world with the Hangover trilogy yes even the clunky, unfunny sequels. This is quite a challenge for him as he tries to create grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong leaping on one of their faces. Yet he succeed with a sort of funny adult war story that has a few laughs sprouting every now and then but it is mostly serious. David Packouz (Teller, still keeping his master performance from Whiplash in play) is a man who wants more from his life rather than being a salesman of expensive Egyptian sheets and his life as a licensed masseuses, until he sees an old friend from high school Efraim Diveroli (Hill) and they get back together again. David and Efraim are now friends again and Efraim introduces him to his job and he is instantly jealous of his life. Although this feels much like the Wolf of Wall Street especially with the narration this mainly comes from David this makes the whole experience a whole lot better.<br/><br/>As the story goes on the comedy standards get better and funnier and this also makes for fun dialogue, mainly said by the two lead characters. However the two lead actors are both ten years older than the characters they are playing yet with their riveting performances you seem to forget that. It's also filled with pretty good action although not as good as a Scorsese masterpiece but the pacing feels the same in this and the pacing is spaced out to show that the director certainly didn't rush to make this feature. There is pretty good action not much in terms of violence but mainly from the use of guns, and also the funny one liners each of the lead roles come out with. In one scene when the two friends go to Albania a country literally torn by war they have to deliver a ton of ammo in a very short time but as this goes through David has to stay there alone while, Efraim gets drunk and also he does the most sinister thing ever which will probably end their friendship, however Efraim realizes his mistake and tries to make it better, without success. There are even emotional standards in the film. Although filled with masculinity apart from the one woman Ana de Armas' Iz who is David's girlfriend but that is all the femininity that this film has to offer so mostly men. Especially with Bradley Cooper's top arms dealer Henry Girard's random outburst ""See this is why I like arms dealing - no women."" Although apart from all the funny outbursts this peace of comedy is mostly serious, with a much similar tone to Whiskey Tango Foxtrot another comedy about a war torn country and the lead role goes there to try an sort things out. So essentially based on the Hangover series and yes even the Wolf of Wall Street, this shows to be a film that is based around war time can serious and funny at the same time.<br/><br/>Verdict: Buoyed by riveting performances and pretty action, this proves that Todd Phillips can do grown-up material without a naked Ken Jeong.<br/><br/>6/10 Rude and laugh out loud funny."

It's not the first time I've seen either Miles Teller or Jonah Hill in something more dramatic, I just may have assumed their first real outing together in a movie would be more of a straight up comedy.<br/><br/>Semi based on a true story of two young guys from Miami who became arms dealers, Miles Teller narrates the story of how David Packouz teamed up with this best friend from the tenth grade, Efraim Diveroli and got in too over his head.<br/><br/>I was expecting more comedy from the two rather than just two young stars being entertaining. The movie is not disappointing with the team of Teller and Hill. If you are a fan of either one of these guys you are going to love the film.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill gives a performance that seem to be something between what he did in 21 Jump Street and the Wolf of Wall Street. The part just fits him so well as he plays a con man who tries to be everyone to everything on the outside but is really evil in the inside, and no matter how much you discover about his evil, Hill still makes the character likable.<br/><br/>But the likability is more met for Miles Teller, who Hill is supporting with greatness. Teller plays the sympathetic role of a man whose lost in his life at a time when his girl is about to have a baby, and he needs the money.<br/><br/>Director, Todd Phillips weaves a story about how people have profited from the war, and done bad things to profit from a bad war. It's almost like the Big Short, with it's explanation about how the arms game really works, but I always felt that the actual story was getting overshadow by the personalities of the two stars worthy of watching.<br/><br/>But overall, It is a very funny film and very entertaining, thanks to the Hill, Teller combo<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com"

","Much like 'American Made' and 'Atomic Blonde,' this also mismatches the cast and turns what should be a drama into an action film with the wrong feel to it. Miles Teller looks like a boy scout. The attempt at irony and juvenile sarcasm that was present in L.O.W. in a sort of narrative style of the very dry delivery of Nick Cage was poorly copied in this turd."
"ronanmeire","9","15","23","3 September 2016"," Based on real story? I wish my life was so daringly exciting!
","The movie is classified as a crime/ drama film but one knows it will have a comical aspect when Jonah Hill is involved. He is the anti-villain: at any opportunity, he (Efraim) endeavours to illude the audience into believing he is the virtuous character. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, Miles Teller (David) plays a very strong anti-hero. He is innocent and begins to get unduly caught in the crossfire of an international arms dealing stratagem, albeit one could argue he does so himself and the repercussions are as a direct result of his childish behaviour. <br/><br/>On the whole, this movie - like many other contemporary crime films - would lose a star or two in its rating had it not contained such wondrous actors. Hill and Teller are the perfect tag-team, but their split by the end of the movie reminds me of a phrase I coined a long time ago: ""He (Efraim) is a time bomb: tick, tick, ticking. And I (David) have no intention of being around for the boom."""

","Most people are going to want to see this film based on the trailer alone. It looks like a funny and adventurous heist movie of some sort. While it's not a comedy in the truest sense, it's just light enough to keep the audience involved.<br/><br/>The film follows two twenty-somethings, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as they venture to the top of the international arms dealer industry. Amidst the war in Iraq, they use unorthodox techniques to fulfill US military contracts.<br/><br/>War Dogs gets a little wordy when it's setting things up. Also, Teller's voice-over goes on a little bit too long at times. But while verbose when explaining things, it covers a lot of ground answering most of our questions in a Big Short type of way. Thus, a potentially byzantine premise never becomes convoluted.<br/><br/>Teller plays David Packouz, the antiwar protagonist who is contributing to the war effort out of financial necessity. He's good, but Hill arguably carries the film, playing the real-life Efraim Diveroli. He's basically a selfish scumbag who could double as a mob boss at any given moment. Hill broadens his range as an actor with this role, proving he can play sinister along with his goofy trademark. He's so deceptively creepy that we become literally afraid of him.<br/><br/>Genre-wise, it might seem to be stuck in limbo, but it's not. The comedy is evenly written and is balanced consistently into the drama. The exposition is fast-paced and doesn't require us to look back scratching our heads.<br/><br/>War Dogs doesn't necessarily explore any new territory as far as the life of a criminal goes, but it's educational and entertaining every step of the way.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 89"
"Rendanlovell","3","26","50","20 August 2016"," A dull movie with no new ideas
","Miles Teller and Jonah Hill in a movie about international gun runners? Sign me up! Is what I was saying going into the film. Coming out was a different story. As is the story with many movies so far this year, 'War Dogs' is a boring mess of a movie. If you saw 'The infiltrator' or read my review you know I hated that film. And for the same reasons I hate that film, I hate this one. Except this one has the nerve to be nearly identical to the far superior 'Wolf Of Wall Street'. This movie hits all the same beats and story lines that Scorseses near masterpiece does. The difference between the two is that this one is neither funny nor entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>It is quite possibly one of the most dull, lifeless, boring films I have seen this year. Every time something funny or stressful could have happened it just cuts to another scene. Or, even more upsetting, ques up a voice over track from Teller. It blatantly skips over possible character building scenes in favor of out of place, lazy voice overs.<br/><br/>I don't think I would be lying when I say that there is more voice overs here than in 'Knight of Cups'. Which literally had not script. Why the choice was made to do this really comes down to laziness. There is no other reason to explain why it couldn't just let scenes play out. Not only was there countless voice overs that robbed scenes of tension, but it also did chapter kind of things.<br/><br/>Every twenty minutes or so a black screen with a sentence appeared on screen, describing what we were about to see. Just like the voice work, it didn't seem to have a point to it. It just felt like it didn't know how to transfer to the next scene so it threw in these random titles. They came from no where and served literally no purpose other than to tell you what was going to happen before it did.<br/><br/>But what was I expecting? Right from the first few scenes this film has jarring tones that clash with each other from scene to scene. The first shot of the movie is a tense scene involving a kidnapping and it cuts immediately to a stylized, scene with a pop song playing over top. It is a completely jarring tonal shift that is off and on through out the film. And, much like 'Suicide Squad' it has no idea how to place a song in a scene.<br/><br/>The songs it chooses are good on their own but, the scenes they are used in makes me hate them. All but maybe once were they used appropriately. It's sad that films have decided to just throw in pop songs to try and get a bigger audience instead of making a score that works in the film. It never helps the story move forward, they are all just kind of there.<br/><br/>That being said, nothing could have saved this story. As I said, it's exactly like 'Wolf of Wall Street'. But it's not near as fun nor does it have the interesting character study that 'Wall Street' has. It has Jonah Hill and Miles Teller furiously trying to make the dialogue they have sound organic. Yet, it's so poorly written that these Oscar worthy actors come across with little chemistry and sound like morons while doing it.<br/><br/>There isn't much that redeems this film. It's mostly well shot and these two performances aren't to bad. Other than that everything fails. It's poorly written, horribly boring, offers no interesting characters, and fails to deliver any comedic moments. It's one of those movies that thinks it's so much better than it is. It wants to be great and desperately tries to be but falls flat on its face."
"Fiurilli","4","26","52","22 August 2016"," Another disappointing summer movie
","In 'War Dogs' we follow Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as two young men trying to make money from the war in Iraq by selling weapons to the US army. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips who is better known for the 'The Hangover' trilogy.<br/><br/>Right of the bat the movie tries to seem more clever than it actually is. Via a flash-forward that shows one of the main characters in a predicament the movie tries to create a sense of tension that would otherwise have been non-apparent. This quickly fades as the story is very predictable with characters that are not all that interesting considering their motives are never properly explained and very flimsy. Throughout the movie is some narration paired with title cards indicating different chapters. Most of the times the chapters do not seem any different which made these title cards unnecessary and it is clear they were just added afterwards in as a last ditch effort to make the movie more interesting. Halfway trough the movie almost comes to a grinding halt and from thereon out it never really manages to get the viewer's interest back.<br/><br/>The directing was very bland, considering not one scene was shot in a very interesting fashion. Often times it seemed as if the movie does not really know what it wants to be. Sometimes character's respond to a certain situation in a comedic fashion while other times the tone is shifted to a more serious one. Todd Phillips never really tries to mix in some of his own style and with another director the movie would've probably turned out roughly the same. <br/><br/>The only redeeming factor of the movie are the actors themselves as they did a decent job at portraying their characters, though ultimately not one performance was very memorable. In the end 'War Dogs' joins the 2016 collection of disappointing summer movies.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10"
"theCoffeeGirl","8","5","7","21 January 2017"," Brilliant film
","I admit that I was skeptical at the prospect of Jonah Hill making a serious film, but boy was I in for a surprise. <br/><br/>The trailer made this film look like a weird drama comedy, something like Knocked Up with an inverted comedy to drama ratio (Knocked Up is maybe 80% comedy, 20% drama), playing up the funny/wacky Jonah Hill parts. The love/relationship aspect of David Packouz could've gone the wrong way and could've gone on for too long, but I think they got everything right.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything (I'm saying what the trailer shows)<br/><br/>The business part was fun and intriguing. Smart use of montages to cut time and tell the story quickly, something similar to Breaking Bad's cooking/growing business montages.<br/><br/>Their adventures were just the right amount. Enough fun/action/outdoors to not make this a claustrophobic office film where deals are done on phones/faxes/internet. <br/><br/>The personal story between the two was good. The family drama, although not my favorite part, made the stakes higher and made everything personal. <br/><br/>Shady characters, shady wars, grey market, dirty business and you've got yourself a great picture.<br/><br/>There's enough comedy to cut through the drama and not make this a heavy piece. <br/><br/>Some may fault it for not saying anything about the war, but it didn't need to. Not everything needs to be an anti-war piece, just as not every film needs to be some chest- thumping flag-'n-anthem patriotic tear-jerking ode. I like that it did neither - this is not some ""USA USA"" film nor some lecturing film that tells us war is bad, or that the Iraq was is bad, something almost everyone agrees with ALREADY (and the rest won't change their minds because of a Jonah Hill film, so why should we all suffer?).<br/><br/>This film reminds me of Wolf of Wall Street more than anything, but it has shades of Casino, American Gangster, Catch Me If You Can and American Hustle.<br/><br/>I would rate it higher than Wolf of Wall Street, which is too choreographed and theatrical for my taste. This film doesn't overdo this ""look how rich we've become"" because it didn't need to.<br/><br/>The story is front and center. There is no time wasted on lavish parties, fireworks, champagne, women in bikinis, etc. It is not a ""homes of the rich"" and arms-dealer mashup. It's just the story of the arms dealers.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year."

Teller is the best actor of his generation. Though this is probably not going to be his best performance this year. I have a feeling his performance in that Boxing film is Oscar bait. Jonah Hill plays the sort of character that he is best known for, but who cares he does it so well. I was not familiar with the female lead Ana De Armas, but she is mesmerizing.Bradley Cooper was terrific in a relatively small role as well.<br/><br/>I can see hundreds of twenty somethings wanting to become War Dogs after seeing this film, but I a pretty certain that window of opportunity is closed. <br/><br/>This has been a pretty disappointing year so far in film. My guilty pleasure was Tarzan, and I really liked Sing Street and 10 Cloverfield Lane but this is my first ten of the year. Maybe I should only have given it a 9, but I it certainly is the best film released in the last eight months, and you gotta give a 10 once in awhile."
"CookieVanSnott","6","8","14","6 September 2016"," The newest soon to be forgotten entry in the 'loophole' movie genre.
","If you surf the web regularly, then you sooner or later encounter annoying ads promising to reveal to you some sort of secret or 'loophole' that will make you rich. While they are overwhelmingly ignored, the persistence of these ads proves that they gather at least some clicks, if only from people who are bored.<br/><br/>Recently, Hollywood appears to have evolved the 'loophole' idea into a little movie genre of its own (seen in 'limitless', 'the big short', 'wolf of wallstreet'). The protagonist, an ordinary Joe with whom we are supposed to identify, comes across a loophole which allows them to generate very large amounts of money using immoral and/or illegal means. To avoid real controversy, the discussion of what is wrong with the system that allows this to happen regularly is usually very limited and there is a catharsis in the end: the protagonist is caught, but gets to go back to an 'ordinary' life. The fast food version of social criticism if you will.<br/><br/>If the kind of movie I just described is familiar to you, then there is nothing in 'War Dogs' that you will find unexpected. The acting is fair but not memorable - and so is everything else about this movie. The plot does not offer any real twists, down to the fact that (here slight SPOILER) the 'catharsis' part is triggered when the guy who is introduced in the first part of the movie as somebody who cheats people does just that with our protagonist. <br/><br/>I can't say that I hated 'War Dogs', but this is only because I did not really care much about it."

He looks like an obese, over tanned Bradley Cooper. Some one like, from the future or past of Bradley's character, seriously, when Teller's character meets with Bradley's character at the bar, for the first time, for a second, i waited something like: "" hey! i'm from the future! don't do this."" etc.<br/><br/>any way, nothing exciting, funny or compelling here, move along."
"tjgoalie13","6","7","13","23 August 2016"," Somewhat Funny, but Riddled with Clichés
","War Dogs seems like a film with a ton of potential, because of the people involved in it, but lacks the spark to make it anything other than okay. The problem seems to be that the crew wanted to tell a true story and make the audience laugh but didn't fully understand, given the source material, how to do that. War Dogs is intermittently funny, but relies too much on clichés, and fails to pack any kind of a punch. If you're trying to figure out what kind of a movie this is, picture The Big Short with a slightly lesser known crew.<br/><br/>War Dogs did have a lot going for it, namely the talents of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as well as the direction of Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy.) Above that the trailers for this film looked fairly funny, but note that almost all of the genuinely funny parts of the movie are contained in the trailer. That being said the film often tries to take a more dramatic approach, and fails to ever generate a hilarious moment. That being said both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill's performances are great in this film.<br/><br/>While Teller and Hill are great in this film it really feels too familiar, as if you've seen it before. That shouldn't be the case with a film about two men in their twenties running guns in the Iraq War. That being said it ends up making it's characters into clichés, and tells an overdone storyline about rags to riches idiots, and betrayal of best friends. It really is a shame because, as I mentioned before, this film could've been very original and interesting, but ends up being like most other films of today, more recycled than anything else.<br/><br/>Above that the film fails, at what it ultimately wants to do, which is pack a punch. It seems self evident watching it, that the director and writers wanted to expose a scary problem in America, and at the same time generate a few laughs. In that sense it's a lot like The Big Short, however War Dogs fails to ever do what it strives to do. Where The Big Short was informational, funny, and in the end terrifyingly honest, War Dogs is not. This movie may have a moment or two, but seems to miss it's intended mark on both ends, in that it's not as funny as it'd like to be nor is it as damning. <br/><br/>In the end War Dogs feels like more of an average film, which is disappointing because it had the potential to do everything wanted to. If you expect a great comedy, it's not really that, if you're expecting a great look at true and terrifying events that led to two young immature men running guns for America, it's not really that either. War Dogs is funny, well acted, and has a story to tell, but relies on clichés, stereotypes, and doesn't offer very much thought provoking material. This is a good film if you want a few chuckles but it doesn't supply a ton of laughs."

","Movie started with narrating everything and it kept it through movie that is was very bad. Scene introductions with quotes is not what you do in movies, except if you are one great story teller and you got powerful writing skills, instead you should just let the movie plot flow. Everything from meeting two friends up to their partnership is very lame. From bunch of so called fun moments there are just few of them worth real laugh and Jonah laugh in the movie starts to be annoying after a while. Some of dramatic moments with Iz are nicely played and showed the power of their lie. Best scene of the whole movie is when they run guns in Iraq, it was the only moment that was very funny but at the same time full of action and tension. Acting was on place, Teller did it very well as he had little bit more dramatic character, Jonah tried to make it funny but ended somewhere in between. Cooper playing bad guy is a nice catch as he did not disappoint. It seemed that movie tried to be better with comedic approach to subject. Great story and not so good story telling of it. 2.5/4"
"PopSpective_net","9","9","20","19 August 2016"," 'War Dogs' Proves Life Is Often Stranger than Fiction
","Holy crap.<br/><br/>That is my summary of War Dogs. The movie was produced by Todd Phillips–director of the Hangover movies–and Bradley Cooper. The truly crazy part, though, is that War Dogs is real-life. It's a story based on actual events, but if you didn't know that it wouldn't seem much different than one of the Hangover movies.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on a two twenty-something friends in Miami Beach who become international arms dealers. Their company–AEY–leveraged a federal website to find and land lucrative contracts with the Pentagon. Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller) eventually landed a $300 million contract to arm the Afghan military, but government corruption and some illegal decisions on their part proved to be their undoing.<br/><br/>All of this went down only a few short years ago. Diveroli and Packouz–as AEY– were able to take advantage of an initiative implemented by the Bush administration to expand federal contract opportunities to small businesses. In 2011, however, the two were convicted of multiple counts of fraud. Diveroli was sentenced to four years in federal prison, while Packouz was sentenced to seven months' house arrest.<br/><br/>If you want all of the salacious details, read the lengthy feature article in Rolling Stone written by Guy Lawson. It was this article that first caught Todd Phillips attention and led to the War Dogs movie project.<br/><br/>In a Q&A following the screening I saw, Phillips and Cooper shared some of the back story and their experiences making the movie. Phillips said the project was built around the idea of Jonah Hill starring in from the beginning. In fact, Phillips said that he had actually been trying to work with Hill for years–revealing that he originally tried to get Hill to be in The Hangover as the younger brother. The role was eventually re-imagined as an older brother and given to Zach Galifianakis instead.<br/><br/>It seems like a brilliant choice. I don't know how Efraim Diveroli acts in real life, but Hill seems like a natural in the role. Miles Teller also does an excellent job as Packouz–the character through whose eyes the movie is told.<br/><br/>If you've seen the Hangover movies, you know how that group of friends manages to get into a lot of trouble resulting from a series of comical errors and bad decisions. That's pure fiction, though. Phillips relayed the story of how he first learned about and became interested in this story. ""I remember, I was literally flying to Bangkok–we were shooting Hangover 2–and I read it in Rolling Stone just like anybody. I just couldn't–the thing that attracted me is I couldn't believe it was real, honestly. It just felt like it was one of those, um–you know, if it was a piece of fiction in The New Yorker I would have said, 'Oh. That's a cool story. Cool characters. But, it's so unbelievable it kind of doesn't work.'"" The Q&A moderator asked, ""Bradley, when you found out about the story, was there anything that really surprised you? Where you were just like, 'This couldn't be true'?"" Cooper replied, ""Oh my God. Where do we start?"" Granted, this is a movie that is ""based on a true story"", which means that there is some artistic license and embellishment for the sake of entertainment. Phillips stressed that this is not a documentary, but also shared that Lawson–who is more familiar with the story than just about anybody other than Efraim and David themselves–expressed that he was pleasantly surprised with the journalistic integrity of the film.<br/><br/>War Dogs is an excellent movie. The acting is exceptional and the story is engaging. It is 114 minutes of entertainment that will be worth every penny you pay to see it. The fact that it is somehow a true story of two anonymous young men doing something extraordinary is just icing on the cake."

"Pramitheus","5","5","10","24 December 2016"," Boring to the point of putting you to sleep
","I think the title sums it up. Jonah Hill's laugh is annoying as anything and so is this movie. Hell, I'd say it's worse than Jared Leto's ""attempt"" at the Joker laugh. Just like the laugh, the movie is a half-ass attempt at being as cool as Fight Club or Ocean's Eleven but all of it amounting to nothing other than being boring to the point of putting you to sleep.<br/><br/>STORY & SCRIPT - The story is about two high-school friends who meet over a funeral after a long time. Miles Teller's character,David works as a masseuse and has an incredibly hot, Spanish girlfriend. You want logic here? Look away. As David can't make both ends meet Efron(Jonah Hill) offers a job in his company, so that he can support his family and also help Efron make the most out of the loop-holes in the American system. As this is based on a true story, I really can't say that which is more absurd, the plot or the story- telling. The script is woven over this plot, which sounds like a joke you tell at a party and everybody has a good laugh. But here, that joke is extended to a 2- hour long film full of phone-calls and talking and narration. There is so much narration that you will start thinking that why are they showing the film, just read the script and get it over with. <br/><br/>DIRECTION - Now it is clear that Todd Phillips was indeed a one-time wonder with the Hangover. Maybe it was a stroke of luck or stroke of genius but it isn't working now. The levels of absurdity which was promised in the trailers are missing. Like I said, if you have to make a party-time joke into a movie, you better have the substance for it. The movie begins with a semi-dark-comedic tone and then it goes all dark and gloomy. This is in the first 40 minutes. The rest of the movie keeps going up and down regarding tone. It's all over the place. The characters aren't given time to build up. Few small, stereotypical, easily relatable situations and a truckload of narration. That's what the director used to establish the characters. On top of that, the movie suffers from the Suicide Squad syndrome. Songs everywhere. Just everywhere. There is a scene in the movie where three things are happening simultaneously:narration, characters talking and music playing. It was just horrible.<br/><br/>ACTING - Other than Bradley Cooper's small role as a shady agent, everyone was what they are. Miles Teller was Miles Teller. There was no actual room for character building because of the exposition and narration by his character. Jonah Hill is awful. Either he is shouting too loud or he is laughing. I hate that laugh. If it was intentional, good job, Jonah because it really took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT - Give it a pass. It does boast of two of the youngest and finest actors right now in Hollywood but watch it if you want to know how stupid the American Defence system is. I mean, that's the only takeaway from this. You won't remember the characters, nor the story. Yes, you'll remember that laugh."

Preferably, he should just not be cast.<br/><br/>The only appeal of this film is the middle segments, where the two leads get to party way harder than what their age should allow, but as soon as the film tries to develop a story, you'll wish it was over. The ""family problems"" things are badly written and just out of place.<br/><br/>I would not recommend War Dogs to anyone, regardless if they have seen the far superior Lord Of War or not; the film does not stand on it own, there are a few bits which are mildly amusing, but nothing you haven't seen before.<br/><br/>A honest vote of 5.5/10 - could have been much better with decent actors."

","'War Dogs' is the second movie 'inspired by a true story' that I have seen in the last 24 hours, and is actually the one that I liked better (the other one being 'The Infiltrator'). Its film-making style (director Todd Phillips) and its comic thriller approach fit well the month of August. If I am to chose one easier entertainment with no super-heroes or space-ships, and yet a film that raises serious issues this summer, I will recommend it (but of course, I did not see them all).<br/><br/>I am not sure if 'War Dogs' will make it to too many Jewish film festivals, but the two lead characters are Jewish or better say one nice Jewish kid (acted by Miles Teller) and a one Jewish trouble-maker kid (acted by Jonah Hill) who meet about one year after high-school. The bad guy is already in weapons trade and he easily convinces the good guy to become an associate. It's the Bush-Cheney period, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan need arms, and the government seems to have privatized at least part of the guns and ammo supply chain and opened it to free competition. A golden business opportunity for many, including the couple of young entrepreneurs who start small, win bigger and bigger contracts, break more and more moral rules, laws and trade restrictions, move into bigger offices and houses, and ask themselves less and less questions about what is right and what is wrong to do in such business.<br/><br/>The film is fun to watch. There is no great characters development, the characters are from the start to the end what they seem to be when they show up for the first time, but they are enjoyable, and Jonah Hill at least does here his best role on screen to date. Bradley Cooper also shows up in a small but key supporting role. Story telling has pace and humor, although I could have given up the off-screen story telling which tries to provide the personal and somehow moralizing perspective of the good guy. It seems to be a returning fashion in the American cinema which I frankly dislike. It usually hides lack of skills in setting the contest and telling the story, but it was not the case here.<br/><br/>It's the final titles before the credits, the one that usually relate the characters on screen with the reality of the 'true story' and show the real faces of the 'heroes' that we have seen acted on screen, that made me click. So these guys, who sold lethal weapons that caused death in the battlefields of Iraq or Afghanistan, who tricked the government and the individuals fighting for what they believe is a just cause got a few years in jail (one of them) and a suspended sentence (the other one) and they are now selling their story in books and movies? Something is broken in our justice systems if the 'war dogs' selling illegal weapons to the conflict areas are not punished. This film is not a masterpiece, but at least it causes to some of us to ask the right questions."

","War Dogs (2016): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, J.B. Blanc, Bradley Cooper: Tense action comedy about the lowest level of humanity. Jonah Hill plays a charming yet manipulative illegal arms dealer named Efraim Diveroli. Miles Teller plays a childhood friend named David Packouz whose past with Efraim landed him in trouble in the past. He is married and his wife is expecting their first child. He struggles in a business that sells bed sheets while dreading his job as a massage therapist. A chance encounter at a funeral reconnects the two and he is sucked into Efraim's dangerous world. Easily Todd Phillip's best film since The Hangover. Hill brings out the charisma of someone who does not care who he steps on to get rich. Teller as David sees opportunity until trust is broken and a trip to dangerous territory has him on his knees with a gun to his head. Ana de Armas plays David's frustrated wife who fears for their life and the safety of their child. She calls out David on his ongoing lies and his questionable loyalty to Efraim. Bradley Cooper plays a shady character named Henry Girard whom they deal with until merchandise turns up to be wrong and problematic. This is at times funny but often tension makes way for suspense as trouble closes in. Action scenes are fast paced with narrow escapes. Theme regards trust and those whom manipulate our lives into disaster. It also reveals the reality of cutting corners to prevail thus leading to severe consequences. The dogs bite savage in this chaotic and numbing action farce. Score: 10 / 10"

","Some movies are exactly the same every time you see them. Todd Phillips's The Hangover is a perfect example. It is my go-to film anytime I'm blue and need a laugh. It is always the same stupidly funny movie that makes me laugh in all the same places (""Not you, fat Jesus..""). The same director does something very different with War Dogs. I loved this film when I saw it in the movies so I knew I'd enjoy it again recently on DVD. In the theater I thought it was funny - a great buddy film featuring two former middle school friends who reconnect and have an amazing adventure. Jonah Hill's character seems a brash, funny wheeler-dealer - the kid who always has big ideas. By the end of the film you see him for who he really is - a much darker, malignant personality - cunning and manipulative with no regard for others. And that is what makes War Dogs so different the second time around. The scenes he made funny and maybe a little endearing the first time you watch are much darker on second viewing as you see how he pulls people into his web. It was fascinating to see the same movie twice and get such a different feel the second time - if you liked War Dogs, it is definitely worth a repeat watching."

","Usual hit-or-miss director Todd Phillips returns after the last couple of force fed Hangover duds, but delivers a steadily paced and solidly entertaining biopic which has been marketed as a ""Wolf Of Wall Street"" for the ""Hangover"" fans.<br/><br/>The film's plot revolves around two young in-over-their-heads gun runners, told from the perspective of the relative straight man of the duo David Packouz, portrayed by Miles Teller. Jonah Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, the bombastic and over confident member of the two. The film relies on the set up to be the plot as the story more or less takes us through the whole meaty parts of the true story in a positively meandering fashion, as the leads run into major success as well as major mishaps.<br/><br/>Both Hill and Teller successfully carry this film, though Hill is given center stage as well as more scenes and moments as opportunities to shine. Teller works well in his role once again deferring from the loud/party animal figure his introductory roles offered. After seeing ""The Spectacular Now"" and ""Whiplash"", it was hard not to think of how great his role here could have been if given more room to work. Hill impresses in his role, offering layers of seediness and greed under the likable and humorous character he portrays. Nonetheless the acting all round is solidly delivered. <br/><br/>Phillips does a sufficient job with his directing duties, as the passion can be noticed behind the film. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher offers impressive visuals of each of the settings that are shown throughout.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film for it's entertaining performances, steady pacing and visuals.

"bryank-04844","5","1","1","23 January 2017"," Don't go to war over 'War Dogs'!
","'War Dogs' looks good on paper and the trailer for the film sells the movie's comedy and fun moments. It seemed like the perfect project for director Todd Phillips ('The Hangover' trilogy, 'Road Trip', 'Old School') as he reunites with Bradley Cooper and adds Jonah Hill and Miles Teller to this story, based on true events about two school friends who love to smoke up and run guns for the government – some of which might be illegal. This is a very different film for Phillips from what we're used to, and unlike the trailer, the film isn't all that funny. Sure, there are some moments of small laughter here and there, due to Jonah Hill's character, but the rest is Phillips' wink to a mix of gangster movies, including 'Scarface', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', and even a bit of 'Drive'.<br/><br/>That sounds good on paper, but the end result was lackluster with the 115 minute movie seeming like a three hour endeavor. The pacing is off and one scene just seems to be a repetition of the one before it. 'War Dogs' tells the true story of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who were high school friends, who eventually got a government contract to supply weapons to the U.S. Army in Afghanistan with no prior experience and being in their early 20s. This film of course has a bunch of fictionalized elements, which is good, but never has anything original or fresh.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best scene of the film is in the trailer, where Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and Packouz (Miles Teller) are riding in the truck in the Iraq desert, being chased by people with guns. That scene was funny, action-packed, and highly entertaining. Unfortunately the rest of the film is fairly drab with some flashes of funny Jonah Hill moments. Phillips sure packed the film with winks and nods to the gangster movies I mentioned above with the same music, shots, and narration style that you see in Scorsese films. Plus, there are 'Scarface' posters everywhere in the film, along with references to the actual movie by name. I just got tiresome very fast.<br/><br/>It's an interesting enough story to tell, but the characters aren't that redeeming nor are they that likable throughout, particularly Jonah Hill's character, who he plays the part perfectly. Teller is also great, but isn't given much to work with. Bradley Cooper shows up for a few seconds here and there, but again, isn't given much time to really explore his character, who turns out to be the most interesting part of the movie. 'War Dogs' looks good from a technical and visual standpoint, but there really isn't anything underneath that veil.<br/><br/>WAIT FOR NETFLIX!"
"SquigglyCrunch","6","1","1","27 December 2016"," A Generically Presented but Intriguing Story
","War Dogs follows a man who, after meeting up with his best friend from school, joins him in working for his arms company. Ultimately , however, they are pushed to commit more and more illegal acts for the sake of more money. <br/><br/>For starters this is, and was, a really intriguing premise to me. It's based on a true story, and I was curious as to how it'd play out. The path the story takes is an interesting one, and I was happy to see that. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Jonah Hill is definitely one of the standouts, and although this definitely isn't an amazing performance, it's a pretty good one. Miles Teller is subtly really good as well. He gets really into this role where he plays the morality of the company, and you can tell that he feels most every line in the movie. He's not trying to fake it like some actors. After the failure that was Fant4stic (2015), I think he was probably seeking redemption somewhere. And he found it here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this otherwise great story is weighed down by it's presentation. In the technical aspect, this is a very bland movie. The way it's shot, the way it handles itself, it's all very generic. Even the writing is a lot of the time. It's just all so mediocre in that sense, it doesn't do really anything with this story on the technical spectrum. <br/><br/>On top of that, this is like Plot Convenience: The Movie. There were so many points where I found my wondering how the characters would get out of their situation, only to find out minutes later that everything works out perfectly with some rushed resolution. It got incredibly frustrating after a while and really took away from the movie. I know it's based on a true story and claiming that these events did happen, but I don't care about the source material. I think it's more interesting to see an intriguing, realistic movie and I'd sacrifice accuracy any day for that. Sure, it is possible for a movie like this to have plot conveniences and still make sense, and these still more or less did, but considering how poorly presented the whole movie is it feels like just another Hollywood movie. It doesn't seem real really, and as such it comes off as even more generic and Hollywood-ized when these conveniences present themselves. <br/><br/>Overall War Dogs was largely a disappointment. While the acting and story are both near great, the presentation and writing proved lackluster most all the time. In the end I'd still recommend this movie simply for the story."

Later, they search Pentagon Offers and - with some creative accounting - win a $300- million Arms Contract to supply the Afghanistan Army with AK-47 ammunition. <br/><br/>I didn't think I would like this because I was afraid Jonah Hill would try to be a comedian again and he's never close to that consideration. This is considered a Comedy/Drama (Whaaaa?) However, I saw this as light drama only and found that Jonah Hill does a very good job. If there were funny lines in here I missed all of them.

"KristianZacc","7","1","1","20 September 2016"," The B-Grade Wolf of Wall Street
","Minor/Vague Spoilers<br/><br/>Based on a true story and directed by the guy most well known for the Hangover trilogy so how well this movie goes was up in the air for me as I did enjoy two out of the three even if only one of them was truly great. <br/><br/>The story is basically two guys, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, who were friends in high school reconnect and Hill's character offers him a job with him selling guns to the army and Teller easily accepts because he's desperate for money especially since he has a kid on the way and of course, things don't go as they planned. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill played his character perfectly. As soon as he comes on screen you know he's a jackass but he's one that is fun to watch on screen. He has great scenes and moments where Hill just goes all in and he becomes this nutjob of a character. It's kind of easy to see where the film will end up going with his character which I think is a bit of a problem with the movie. <br/><br/>If this were a straight comedy than Miles Teller would be the straight guy with Jonah Hill as the idiot comic relief. Teller is amazing. In everything that I've seen him in (yes, including Fantastic 4) he has always been fantastic. In this film he has great chemistry with Hill and you believe that they did have this past relationship. His character just wants to be something more than just a simple masseuse doing anything he can to get his next pay check. Hill leads him to get in over his head which kicks off the premise of the movie. The two actors play extremely well off each other whether it's for comedic purposes or otherwise and it works! I was very impressed with the pairing and wouldn't oblige to seeing them together in another film in the future. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is fine, and doesn't really add anything to the movie in terms of the character being played by Cooper and he could've been played by anyone else. To be honest, I completely forgot he was in the movie until he showed up halfway through. <br/><br/>I'm always interested in these kinds of movies, the little guy making it big, basically The Wolf of Wall Street. That's how I would sum it up as just the B or even C grade Wolf of Wall Street. That really couldn't escape me at all throughout the movie and when they're doing crazy stuff all I was thinking was of Leonardo Di Caprio and, funnily enough, Jonah Hill. <br/><br/>The film does have absurdness with it; you could get that from just reading the synopsis or watching the trailers. So, if that's not your kind of movie then it would probably be best to skip this one. The one that stood out to me was when they go through ""The Triangle of Death"". The craziness was what made this film fun to watch, just anticipating what crazy thing they would do next. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie could've been edited much better and there were some parts in the middle where I thought it dragged a little. So, I would understand if some people can feel the two hours of the movie.<br/><br/>While the film has problems with the predictability in its character direction and how the three act structure will play out you can still get a tonne of enjoyment from this movie just by watching the couple's zany adventures."

","War Dogs is based on a true story. The actual story is far less exciting than the theatrical version, but still amusing when you consider what they managed to do.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into detail about the story, but it follows the two main characters (played by Miles Teller and Jonah Hill) as they delve into the arms trade.<br/><br/>It all leads up to one massive deal they enter into with the US government, and circumstances arise that make it seem like they bit off more than they can chew.<br/><br/>War Dogs is at times a comedy and other times a serious drama/documentary. Certain scenes were added to make the story more interesting than it actually was (their real life counterparts never put themselves directly into danger, as was featured in the film when they smuggled guns from Jordan into Iraq), but they seemed necessary to make it more than just an exaggerated documentary."

","War Dogs follows two young stoners as they weasel their way into the arms business and somehow manage to land a $300million military contract with the government, supplying guns, grenades, and ammunition to the Afghan army circa 2008. They find they have to cut a few corners and forge a few documents to make sure it all runs smoothly, which it does, until it doesn't. Based on a true story, a lot of the broader strokes are public record, but being a movie, certain events have naturally been added or embellished to make them a little more interesting (no-one wants to watch two stoners sat in front of their computers for two hours).<br/><br/>First thing I have to note is that the marketing lies. It lies really hard in order to get your seat in the cinema. The way it does that is by painting a different movie to what you get. In some ways it's understandably easier to market this film as a comedy, especially when you emblazon Todd Phillips' and Jonah Hill's names all over it. There are light-hearted moments and the odd joke, but almost every humorous moment is packed into the trailers. War Dogs is a drama/thriller first. This isn't a criticism, I'm just trying to manage expectations. Don't go in expecting The Hangover with arms dealers, because that's not this movie.<br/><br/>That said, War Dogs plays a lot like Wolf of Wall Street meets Lord of War (the latter of which the real Efraim Diveroli was apparently obsessed with at the time). Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same character he did in Wolf of Wall Street as well. War Dogs plays out as a fundamentally anti- war/anti-military movie though. That's the only message you can really take from it as it highlights how ridiculous the whole situation is. These are two stoner kids running Barettas through Iraq, to be greeted with stacks of Hussain's billions just sitting in a warehouse, paying for the US invasion. When they inevitably get busted for fraud, David Packouz suffers only seven months of house arrest, which is nothing. A patsy he may have been, but it hardly put a dent in his life considering how serious his crimes were, and that's because the military was willing to turn a blind eye to the Chinese ammunition they were being sold, because it fuelled their war for a discount price.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are pretty great though, even if they do just play to their typecasts. As I mentioned, Jonah Hill pretty much plays the same love-to-hate character he did in Wolf of Wall Street, only fatter, and ever so slightly more of a douchebag. He does it well though. Alarmingly well. His weight and his high-pitched laugh are used to comedic effect (if that's the kind of thing that amuses you, the group of lads sat behind me sniggered every time Hill laughed), and in a way to mock the real Diveroli, but largely holds no factual accuracy (Diveroli is actually quite well-built). Miles Teller plays his everyman out-of-depth character really well as well, with a beautiful young wife and baby daughter on the way providing him a motivation for getting into the business in the first place. Teller's Packouz is our character to root for, painted likable if slightly inept. Ultimately though, it all works because Teller and Hill share a fantastic chemistry that is both engaging and entertaining.<br/><br/>War Dogs isn't a must-see movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's not particularly original, it's marketing was a massive misfire, and his underlying message is a little haphazard. That said I can't say I found myself bored at any point in the film's runtime. The acting and character work was done really well, and the story balanced out it's serious moments with light-hearted humour just enough without bowing into full-comedy mode. I give War Dogs a respectable 7/10"
"adamhoulding","7","1","1","31 August 2016"," No top dog, but certainly no runt
","An odd dog which can't decide to be either dramatic or comedic at certain points, especially the cannabis scenes that felt phoned in. Obviously to cash into the Superbad angle the trailers an executive had in mind. The bookmarking chapter-headings damaged some flow, but heavily reminds the viewer of its Rolling Stone origins. The only female role is disgustingly bland but other supporting roles - Bradley Cooper, Kevin Pollak and Gabriel Spahiu - made up for that shortcoming. Jonah Hill proves he can play sociopaths as much as dorks, displaying his Moneyball dramatic ability. Miles Teller is so-so, but his character is so written blandly as an audience surrogate that he can be forgiven. It also glosses over details of the 'Arms & the Dudes' source material, probably because a Hollywood executive didn't want to accidentally create a How-To guide (nothing new - Fight Club's Hollywood adaptation omitted elements of its home-made Napalm recipe). Honestly this is not Lord of War, but this is no amateur hour. The film-making itself is solid enough to keep interest in a by-the- numbers script, making it better than it really should've been."

","Miles Teller and Jonah Hill star in the remarkable true story of two young arms dealers who became way over their head when they try to snag a $300 million dollar deal. Todd Phillips who brought us the Hangover trilogy gives us a reveal of how much money is invested into the US military, and it can be easily intercepted by two twenty something year old's.<br/><br/>Watching Jonah Hill and Miles Teller felt like these two had been working together for years and therefore another successful duo seen on screen this year. We witness the events through Miles Teller's eyes as David Packouz a former massage therapist who jumps from his hollow career to the dangerous arms trade. Though Teller's performance is standard he effectively acts to be the average Joe in the scenario and guides us through the story as the narrator and helps us relate to the character in the situation. We may not totally approve of what this pair are doing we are in favour that Miles Teller ends up okay.<br/><br/>But at the heart of it is Hill's performance as the Scarface impersonating money thirsty gangster Efraim Diveroli. Hill gives us a great performance unseen by any other young actor trying to be a rich arms trader, but unfortunately carries a very annoying laugh throughout the film.<br/><br/>Also making an appearance is the always charming Bradley Cooper who passes the torch to the aspiring dealers in providing his assistance in the trade. Although his appearance is brief he still gives us a dangerous Robert De-Niro style meeting.<br/><br/>War Dogs although based on true events is a surprisingly entertaining and an easy to watch experience. However the film does juggle with its serous dark themes and comedic moments which doesn't quite reach what it wants, as what you get are rather hit and a miss jokes that don't work at the right times, but what you do get are effective jokes that takes a breather from all the seriousness which is much better. This also only really takes place during the middle of the film and from the beginning and end we have the more dark atmosphere of what's going on.<br/><br/>All in all War Dogs is entertaining and fascinating in revealing its true story and I'm sure won't let anyone down, but it does not quite make a good balance in humour and drama. 7.6/10"

","The basic structure of this movie is something we have seen before in movies like ""goodfellas"" and ""wolf of Wall Street"". It's basically the same the main character as a narrator. The movie starts off somewhere in the middle for a brief scene to show you what to come and then goes back to humble beginnings. And the structure goes on the same so if you have seen those movies then except the same kind of film. Despite that unoriginal I still enjoyed the film. The acting was solid Jonah hill delivers another solid performance adding to the list of his good performances. And young miles teller shows he can act with this and his previous movie ""whiplash"". I was afraid of the movie based on the trailers being just a silly action movie but I was wrong although it had some action it was mainly an interesting story excited well. If you are fans of goodfellas and wolf of Wall Street you will enjoy this because it is very similar with a new story to tell about shady young stoners attempting to screw the government in the arms industry.

Hollywood seems taken with making movies about massive scum buckets (see Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short, etc.) These two guys are certainly near the top of that list.

Bradley Cooper's character is well crafted and is entertaining till the end. <br/><br/>The supporting characters have done a decent job.<br/><br/>This wouldn't be on top movies but sure is a fun watch in summer. <br/><br/>my rating 7/10"

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued. The screenplay was extremely promising. A true story of two 20 something stoners turned gun runners during the Iraq War, and it was directed by Todd Phillips? Will this go the way of Spotlight, or even The Wolf of Wall Street?<br/><br/>It does not reach the acclaim of either of those two films, but I will say that it makes for an entertaining watch. War Dogs borders on the seriousness of Spotlight, but also includes the debauchery of Wolf. And that's not a bad thing, but it cheaply cashes out instead of digging deeper.<br/><br/>Phillips took many creative liberties with the story. Take a look at the original Rolling Stone piece, or any other article and you'll see exactly what I am talking about.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Miles Teller portray the two real life runners, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, despite looking nothing like them. They are here for the laughs. Both offer plenty, but Teller's character provides a seriousness to counter Hill's Scarface persona. They create a dynamic buddy pairing that neither is bad, nor great.<br/><br/>Phillips picked a screenplay that is so interesting, it would be very difficult to screw up. He avoids doing so by instead taking the safe route. For more substance, check out the movie's inspiration, the book ""Arms and the Dudes."""

"jboothmillard","8","2","4","2 September 2016"," War Dogs
","I saw the trailer for this film just days before it was released, I liked the three big stars in it, and it looked like it could be good fun, I was also intrigued by the high praise by critics, directed by Todd Phillips (Road Trip, Due Date, The Hangover Trilogy). Basically in 2005 David Packouz (Whiplash's Miles Teller) spent his life savings on high-quality Egyptian cotton sheets, planning to sell them to Miami retirement homes, to make income for him and his girlfriend Iz (Ana de Armas), but it fails. At a funeral he runs into his high school best friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), who used to sell guns for his uncle, he has now formed his own company, AEY (which doesn't stand for anything), which fills orders for arms placed by the US government due to the ongoing War in Iraq. David and both oppose the war, but he accepts a job from Efraim, following Iz telling him that she is pregnant, David lies to Iz that he is selling his cotton sheets to the military through Efraim's contacts. Efraim explains to David that all military equipment orders placed are posted on a public website, where anyone can place bids on filling the orders, their job is to find the small orders that larger contractors ignore and place bids on them, these smaller orders are still worth millions of dollars, they funded by small Ralph Slutzky (Kevin Pollak), who has also been lied to. Eventually David and Efraim land a contract that could put them on the map, for US Troops stationed in Baghdad, to provide several thousand Beretta pistols, there is a problem for the shipment to travel through Jordan to Iraq, Iz overhears a conversation between David and Efraim and discovers the truth of the business, she is upset. David and Efraim fly to Jordan to free up their cargo, or risk being blacklisted, with no permission to fly the cargo to Baghdad they are are provided with a driver to transport the guns to Iraq, as no permit is required for driving weapons across the border. They drive through the night, bribe border patrol with cartons of cigarettes, and get attacked by insurgents, but they eventually arrive at the military base, Captain Philip Santos (Patrick St. Esprit) is impressed with the lengths David and Efraim have gone to, and they are paid. Following this AEY continues to secure larger deals and make more money, they move into a bigger office and hire more employees, David welcomes a daughter named Ella, but Efraim is becoming increasingly unstable and untrustworthy, as they are given the chance to land their biggest deal yet, the US military want to arm Afghan for the military long-term, and place an order of $300 million, which includes 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, this is called ""The Afghan Deal"". US arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper) has access to the massive weapon storages created in Albania but never used, which includes well over 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, he is on the watchlist and cannot deal directly with the US Government anymore, he makes the deal with AEY with Efraim's agreement, but David is uncomfortable working with a man on a terrorist watchlist. David and Efraim go to Albania to confirm the ammunition deal, but their bid on the contract ends up being fifty million dollars less than other bids placed, they win the bid, meanwhile Iz has grown frustrated with David's lies, so leaves to live with her mother. David realises that virtually all of the rounds have made illegally, but Efraim comes up with the idea to re- package the rounds in generic packaging, pretending that they are concerned about the weight of the shipments, it also saves them thousands to fly the cargo. David oversees the process of rounds packaged and shipped off, but Efraim plots to try to cut Henry out of the deal after making a discovery about the markup, David protests, Efraim destroys the contract between them, Henry retaliates by kidnapping David, held at gunpoint and beaten. David leaves Albania and returns to Miami, he wants out of AEY and demands a $4 million payoff from Efraim for the work he has done, Efraim refuses, David is forced to return to working as a massage therapist and convinces Iz to come back, telling the truth about everything. Efraim offers a break-off package of $200,000 to David, which David responds threatening to blackmail him with evidence of the falsified documentation the two created to look like a respectable company, shortly after this David and Efraim are arrested by the FBI, they were reported to the US Authorities by the men who had been hired to re-package the rounds, as they were never paid, Ralph Slutzky was arrested, wore a wire during a meeting between David and Efraim, giving the FBI evidence to arrest them. In the end Efraim was sentenced to four years in prison for charges related to The Afghan Deal, and David was put under house arrest for seven months, in exchange for co-operating with the investigation, David later meets with Henry, who apologises for the kidnap, he also thanks David for not mentioning his name in confession, Henry pulls out a suitcase full of money, part of his cut from The Afghan Deal, David's choice of taking the money or not left ambiguous. Also starring JB Blanc as Bashkim, Barry Livingston as Rock Island Bureaucrat, Homeland's Shaun Toub as Marlboro and Brenda Koo as Vanessa. Hill and Teller play their parts equally well as the unlikely 20-something arms dealers / gunrunners, Cooper gets his moments as well as one of their associates, it really is a stranger-than-fiction fact-based story, it gets the laughs from their stoner interactions and one- liners, and gets thrills from the arms trading and war zone stuff, an inventive and impressive biographical crime war comedy-drama. Very good!"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","2","4","2 September 2016"," It is definitely style over substance, but it is enjoyable and worth a watch despite having little staying power.
","'War Dogs' is the latest film directed by Todd Phillips of 'Hangover' fame, a comedy/drama starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller as a pair of amateur arms-dealers. The film is loosely based on a true story, even featuring a cameo by the actual person portrayed by Teller, though it takes several liberties with the source-material. The feature isn't as controversial or important as it perhaps thinks it is, but it is still mostly entertaining with good performances despite having little beneath the surface. <br/><br/>The movie spends more time trying to create a style then it does trying to inject the story with substance, and as a whole suffers for it. The narration is very expositional and feels lazy, not to mention that the film freeze-frames for no reason other than for Teller to get his voice-over out, and the semi-frequent use of stock-footage gets a little annoying as it feels rather out of place. The other thing that got on my nerves was the intermittent quotation title-cards, used as unnecessary chapter breaks. These short asides were never needed, their unnecessary nature compounded by the fact that they always contained a quote that would then be said in dialogue just minutes later. They also didn't separate distinct parts of the plot, such as time-jumps or location-changes, and thus beg the question as to why they were included. The stylistic choices hark back to 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' and 'The Big Short', but they never add up to something unique and instead feel like re-treads; the elements never feel consistent, meaning that the film itself comes across as poorly disciplined. The story is interesting most of the time, and the two lead characters provide engaging screen-presences, though the film does drag its heels in the second act. As a whole it feels a bit too long, lacking in a proper finale and leaving us with a relatively weak conclusion. There isn't really any danger and the characters tend to enjoy what they're doing. In the end, it all seems mainly inconsequential as it is mostly consequence-free and focused on frivolous antics; it doesn't get as deep into the ethics of the situation as it should, leading to a light and fluffy affair with little staying power. The other issues with the story are that it is generally unmemorable, spends too much time on set-up but not enough on pay-off and features weak characterisation.<br/><br/>Other than the two leads, the other players don't have anything to do – even Ana de Armas' character is only included to provide a motive for Teller's protagonist to do what he does. It's a shame as there are some great actors here, the best performance is given by Bradley Cooper but he is barely on-screen. Thankfully, the two leads are good. Hill delivers another diverse dramatic performance that proves he can really act, while Teller is solid as essentially a surrogate for the audience. The script is decent, featuring fairly naturalistic dialogue and some witty banter. However, I didn't find the film funny at all. The audience I saw it with laughed consistently while I barely cracked a smile. It didn't take away from my enjoyment, but I feel as though it works better as a drama than a comedy. That's why it is a shame they went for style and humour over depth and emotion, I think it would have been a much more engaging film if it was a little darker and more contemplative. Technically speaking, everything is good here. The direction is competent, bordering on proficient, but it is unremarkable on the whole and goes largely unnoticed. The cinematography is clean, crisp and efficient. The movie feels tangible from start to finish, with real locations being used frequently and the occasional action being shot neatly. The music is a slightly underwhelming, lacking in an original score and flittering between licenced pieces frequently. The choices are quite generic and have been used before under similar circumstances, but they fit the scene they're in and never detract from the experience.<br/><br/>Overall, 'War Dogs' is an enjoyable film that is a clear example of style over substance; the performances are good, the script is entertaining and the plot is mostly engaging but a lack of depth hurts the staying power of the picture. It is unmemorable and unimportant, but a decent time and worth a watch once: 6/10."

","War Dogs had me captivated at the way the events unfold, as we see two arms dealers try to score big. The movie tells a good story and keeps you curious on how events will turnout. The down side of this movie is we have seen such on screen pair before and while watching you have this striking feeling that the more outspoken carefree character will mess up everything for the partners, so there is no element of surprise when it finally happened.<br/><br/>Everyone is always aiming for that one big score, but sometimes the price to pay for that score can eventually make the score a useless endeavour. That was what this movie had to deliver as we watch two childhood friends form a company AEY, which deals specifically in arms deals with the U.S. Pentagon.<br/><br/>The movie has one of the best performances I have seen Jonah Hill pull off, he was a master of character shifts in this movie playing a greedy and intelligent Efraim Diveroli. Jonah Hill deserves all the praise he is getting for his performance and even more, as his presence takes the movie which could have been done better into what is enjoyable.<br/><br/>War Dogs is a biographical crime drama directed by Todd Phillips. The movie plot is based on a story published in Guy Lawson's 2015 book Arms and the Dudes. Although the movie is biographical many of the elements and happenings were fictions, just wound together to make a more compelling story.<br/><br/>What these two 20 something friends did rocked the U.S. Army and caused it to review its procurement dealers and measures.<br/><br/>The movie is narrated by David (Miles Teller) who is a licenced massage therapist. David is tired of giving massages to old people for a living, and tried his hand on selling bedsheets to old people's home, but the business failed and David was to lose all his savings. When his old time childhood friend and bad influence Efraim shows up at a burial of a mutual acquaintance, the two hooked up and tried igniting their past fun days. After hearing about David's predicament and his unborn child on her way Efraim asked David to come join him as an arms dealer. Their work together made them enough money to buy houses and live a good life, but they always wanted more and decided to go for a big score worth $ 300 million.<br/><br/>The problem is, they had to fool the U.S. Army to get away with it.<br/><br/>A good enough movie to see even if it is just to appreciate the performance of Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"RforFilm","6","2","4","22 August 2016"," War Dogs has some shiny weapons and story: it needed more ammunition to fire off
","Funding the military is expensive. We have bases all over the world, each with facilities and housing for those solders. Each solider (over a million of them) is carrying thousands of dollars worth of equipment and weaponry. I bring this up because war may be a travesty, but it's a business opportunity itself. Several companies are out and about to generate the best material for the armed forces to use, and to do so in an inexpensive way. While I doubt I could ever get into that business (personal morals would prevent me), I can see why gunrunning would seem attractive to those that want the high life. <br/><br/>The subjects within War Dogs are gunrunners, but they're also very young. Their college aged, which would make their maturity a big question. The good news is that if your smart enough, then age doesn't matter. What matter's is how well your know your clientele and the best manner to negotiate with. <br/><br/>The early 2000's was a period of two wars; the War on Terror in the Middle East and the Invasion of Iraq. Both would obviously require some ammunition. Let's see how the real life subjects handled these ends in War Dogs. <br/><br/>Starting off in 2005 in Miami, David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) is a guy with little direction. He dropped out of college, has failed in a business selling sheets to retirement homes, and makes a small living as a massage therapist. While attending a funeral for a friend, he spots his middle school buddy Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill). The two meet up where we find out that the two did bad things in their youth and Efraim's parents sent him away to work with his uncle's arms business. Efraim has now returned and tells David about his new business venturethe war.<br/><br/>Despite not agreeing with the war, David comes on board when his girlfriend Iz becomes pregnant. Efraim shows him how they acquire these contracts: the Pentagon has a website a lot like a job search site where they have thousands of listings for businesses to put a bid into. They manage to acquire contracts from Bagdad to Albania where they stay true to their word and become millionaires overnight. As Efriam's company gets bigger, his greed grows (along with a drug addiction) and tensions rise when David is forced to live in Albania to secure a 30 million deal with a terrorist watch list candidate Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).<br/><br/>The idea of irresponsible people getting into a shady business and rising in that world is nothing new. Scarface did this (and is referenced several times. The Wolf of Wall Street, The Lord of War and Pain & Gain did this. What does War Dogs have to offer that's new? The movie brings these two guys who are played well by Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. The movie shows that these guys would be smart enough to pull off these government deals by day while going to Miami nightclubs at night. <br/><br/>War Dogs is a nice looking movie. Director Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy) has a way of shooting his comedies like thrillers. A lot of that has to do with how he uses lighting. His colorful shooting of Miami becomes brighter once we arrive in the bleaker and grayer Albania. <br/><br/>For his first mature story, Todd Phillips found a good blend of political problems, comedy, and some surprising thrills. What's lacking is a closer study at the relationship between these two. With what could have been a dramatic look into these two young men is more of a party. At least what they say can be interesting at times.<br/><br/>I'll give this six machine guns out of ten. I can't say that War Dogs is an intelligent insight into how the government acquires its weaponry, but its still an entertaining look at some smart individuals. This needed a Martin Scorsese like director to really help this take off. I can still have fun with this."

","With one of those true life stories that you'd never believe had it not actually happened at its disposal, Old School and The Hangover director Todd Phillips and his capable duo of Miles Teller (in need of a hit) and the scenery chewing Jonah Hill (going all method on us) make War Dogs an entertaining and quick-fire experience that shines a light on an interesting aspect of White House law and how strange our modern warfare has become. <br/><br/>A dark comedy filled to the brim with deplorable and colourful characters, language and drug addled life lessons, War Dogs is one of those somewhat uneasy hybrids that flirts the line between becoming and out and out drama or an outright comedy and while Phillips at times finds his directional abilities tested in a tale that has a number of different aspects going on at any one time the story of best friends turned gun running business partners David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli is brought to life by Teller and Hill thanks to their considerable talents and the two actors know doubt elevate the material at their disposal to another level.<br/><br/>The talents of these two performers has been evident in such tales as Whiplash, The Spectacular Now, The Wolf of Wall Street and Moneyball and while War Dogs won't be going down on their all-time greatest list and Hill has a tendency to take things a little too far (his Efraim is a nigh on irremediably arrogant creature and his laugh is a little much) the two work up a good cooperation on screen and when they're both doing their thing from a near suicidal gun run through the Iraq wastelands or conducting a government meeting while far from clear headed, War Dogs is a film owned by the actors.<br/><br/>Who would've thought that two mid 20 year old's with a tendency for drugs, alcohol and massages could've become arms dealers for the United States Government but War Dogs makes good use of its bizarre yet true story and while the film isn't as smart as it perhaps thinks it is, this is a fun and breezy experience that would make for a great double bill with the underrated Nichols Cage starrer Lord of War. <br/><br/>3 ½ golden grenades out of 5"

As the film got going both aspects started to kick into gear.<br/><br/>The film reminded me a little of Lord of War for obvious story reasons but in tone reasons as well. I like learning about these type of situations and stories that seem to slip through the cracks of our observed society and to learn how these issues actually drastically affect our world society. War Dogs accomplishes this for me. The tone comes with a comedic and light heart-ed ""fun"" of the subject but it still brings a darker serious side as well, and when I left the theater it kept me thinking of how the world is and operators."

","War Dogs is a movie about down on luck David Packouz (Miles Teller) and his childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill). Diveroli is a small arms dealer, taking the ""crumbs"" of weapons contracts from the military. Diveroli asks Packouz to partner with him and the two slowly move up, only to take a big jump in status with a risky arms trade to the US military in Iraq. With a nice gulp of success, they decide to stop with the crumbs and eat the whole pie with a 100 million AK-47 bullet order. Things come crashing down as Diveroli becomes greedier and angrier.<br/><br/>It's weird that this movie is tagged as a comedy/crime/biography. The comedy elements completely failed as I don't recall any memorable moments. If anything, it got in the way of the story.<br/><br/>But the story is interesting, suspenseful where it needs to be. Jonah Hill does an excellent job as playing a greasy slimeball type of guy -- a used car salesman stereotype that you wouldn't trust and didn't like, but know that he'd get the job done. Packouz is the scarier character in that he seemed to have the morals that Diveroli lacked, but, because he was poor and a soon to be father, probably saw Diveroli as a godsend. Had Packouz been a bit better off, he probably wouldn't have even considered Diveroli's offer. Indeed, Diveroli might have offered the partnership because he knew Packouz was down on his luck.<br/><br/>Some things seem hard to believe, but given it's based on a true story and I don't know the true story, I don't know what was truth, what was exaggeration, or what was completely made up. But I did enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Yeah, this type of movie has been done before (Blow, Lord of War, Wolf of Wall Street), but I don't think this was trying to be a novel concept. It told a story of something that actually happened, and for that, it did it well. I did think Lord of War was far better, and only bring that movie up in case someone liked War Dogs and was looking for something similar."

","Right now it seems if you don't have an opinion on Todd Phillips' DC foray you're either dead or Joaquin Phoenix. Having not seen Joker hasn't stopped anyone from offering an opinion to date but journalistic integrity (and frugality and laziness) has driven me to explore Todd Phillips' back catalogue available on Netflix before attending a picture theatre and subsequently diving head first into spurious debate about his latest effort.<br/><br/>With titles such as The Hangover (2009) and Due Date (2010), Phillips has previously shown that he can point a camera at Zach Galifianakis. But how would he fair with the Galifianakis-free, true(ish) story of two young arms dealers who hustle their way into a major contract with the Pentagon in War Dogs?<br/><br/>Taking a lesser-told story from a secretive industry can be both a blessing and a curse. If we take the main reason we watch films as being 'catharsis' which necessitates empathy with a protagonist and the second reason as being 'to watch something we've never seen before', an inherent problem with ambitious cinema can be that of how to tackle exposition.<br/><br/>In tackling this problem, Phillips tries to balance a sympathetic 'everyman' protagonist-come first person narrator with that character's willingness to engage in nefarious acts. And thus the film effectively falls at the first hurdle. While we can all empathise with a young family's desire for stability driving as it does to make money ""between the lines"", moral lines can surely be drawn somewhere soon after the first few million dollars are achieved.<br/><br/>Yet the fact that our protagonist has an extreme change of heart late into the Third Act, having been previously complicit in all dubiousness and duplicity which amounted to the films tensions and therefore main entertainments left a sour taste.
While technique, including Fight Club inspired-text-labels for weapons costs sustains the early part and subsumes the necessary exposition, the film's pace drags as it deals with manufactured moral dilemmas now minute in comparison with the margins in which its protagonists are continually working.<br/><br/>War Dogs is not without quality. Its cast is adept and its subject matter alone is almost enough to sustain it. However, its reliance on the (non-existent) 'everyman' qualities of its lead protagonist are essentially what diminish this quality."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This was more plot-focused and less comedic-focused than I expected which wasn't a bad thing. Anticipating modern fluff, I didn't pick apart the plot to the nth degree which could easily be done. I just went along for the ride which was fairly entertaining. Solid acting, a rather engaging and detailed plot and a smattering of humorous bits. The story is 'loosely' based on a true story of a couple young guys taking advantage of a under-publicized Federal Government program to send small defense contracts to 'the little guys'. Selling arms and shipping them where needed. They get in over their head by bidding on a large contract which required more coordination and within the country of conflict. Will they be able to manage the contract? How will they manage to navigate international business in dangerous area? Fun and easy with a few smirks and better than average for the genre."

","Yet another spin of the greed is good / rags-to-riches American success story formula pioneered by Oliver Stone's 1987 classic Wall Street"", still heavily used by all the others. This is a true story about 20-something guys (Jonah Hill, Miles Teller) exploiting a little- known government initiative that allows small businesses to bid on U.S. Military contracts during the Iraq War. They begin raking in big money but soon get in over their heads. Also starring, Bradley Cooper, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak. This type of movies usually depend heavily on the coolness of the leading actors, and Hill + Teller surely is an exciting combo. Hill's work is especially noteworthy, giving the staple comedy actor a chance to create an unusually multifaceted character, a sociopathic narcissistic dude. War Dogs"" also has the typical weakness of this type of movie: underdeveloped final act. After taking their sweet time showing all about the humble beginning and rise to fame and fortune, the later events are shown in a hurry. Stuff happens because it has to happen, not because the story has evolved to this point naturally. Director Todd Phillips is known for moderately funny but not especially inventive mainstream comedies (Road Trip"", Old School"", 2004's Starsky and Hutch"", School for Scoundrels"", The Hangover"" trilogy, Due Date""). This is his first break from the mold, and surely a refreshing step in new direction. Like some of the best screen stories, ""War Dogs"" is not tied to a particular genre such as comedy or action or drama. It has a bit of everything which has always been one of the most attractive aspects of this type of rags to riches movies. By the way, the poster design is a parody of the iconic poster for mafia classic Scarface"", which is referenced throughout the film; also, Hill was born in 1983 when Scarface"" was released. I don't know if it's really important in some way. It's a solid way to spend nearly two hours, but there's a great number of movies of the same type already. Don't expect to remember it in the morning."

","Miles Teller, who looks and sounds a bit like John Cusack, is a nice Jewish young man, just trying to get along in Miami by giving massages and selling first-class sheets to the many old age homes. His wife, Ana de Armas, doesn't really care. But Miles' life course is full of bumps. He meets an old high school friend, plump Jonah Hill, who involves him in a money-making scheme selling armaments and ammunition to the US Army. Maybe some others. I was lost from time to time.<br/><br/>Well, I'll tell you, the money rolls in. It rolls in in barrels, visible even through the cloud of smoke from all the weed they do. There are cascades of one hundred dollar bills. They drive Porches. And all those thousands of first-class sheets of Egyptian cotton that Miles had bought? He and Hill make a mountain of those boxes and jubilantly set fire to them. Their arms empire grows. It expands from two ambitious guys to a vast international group of shady characters. The flow chart turns murky. What the shady characters are doing is outside the box but apparently legal enough, though dangerous. Then they discover that some AK-47 ammunition, left over in Albania from the Cold War, was made in China. It's illegal to sell Chinese-made ammunition to the US Army. So they set about anxiously repackaging the millions of dollars worth of ammo, from heavy wooden crates to fiberboard boxes, which gets rid of the Chinese ideograms on the wooden boxes.<br/><br/>But somebody squeals and one by one the organization is taken down by the FBI.<br/><br/>This sound a little complicated, and it is, but we're helped along by Miles Teller's matter-of-fact narration. He tells us what's going on every step of the way, often during a freeze frame. There are overhead shots. There are vicious arguments with the wife. Hill, who is the springboard for all this chicanery, turns out to be a perfidious boss. There is judicious use of contemporary pop music from the likes of Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The deployment of cuss words is unfettered. One of Jonah Hills' previous performances was in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" This could easily have been directed by Martin Scorsese. In fact, if you didn't know it wasn't, you might think it was. Perhaps it most closely resembles ""Casino"", with Jonah Hill in the Joe Pesci part -- the guy who just pushed a good thing too far. The structure also owes a lot to Scorsese's ""Goodfellows"", with Miles being taken up into illegal activities while explaining in the narration exactly how it works. One might call the movie ""The Wolf of Albania."" That's not bad. If you're going to steal from someone, steal from the best. And there are funny moments. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill are about to have an extremely important meeting with some US officials regarding a huge arms deal. The meeting will take place on the upper floor of a huge office building. They're nervous so they decide to get stoned before the tête-a-tête and they approach the meeting half wrecked. The duo walk down a long hall, their footsteps clicking loudly on the stone floor. Hill stops. ""Wait a minute. Does it sound to you like there are other people in this hall?"" Miles replies, ""Yes."" Okay, satisfied, they begin walking again.<br/><br/>It may be imitation Scorsese but it's a good imitation. Brian De Palma's near constant imitation of Alfred Hitchcock became an irritation after a while, but as long as director Todd Phillips finds his own vision, sooner or later, I don't care. I enjoyed the hell out of it."

","This was a film I unfortunately missed last year even though I really wanted to watch it and now I have and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of this film sees two 22 year old men get into the world of arms dealing and slowly get over there heads. Miles teller plays the lead in this film and he does a great job in the film, he is easily the most likable character in this film but he also has the best development of anybody in this film to make you care about his predicament. Jonah hill plays his loudmouth best friend and he fit the role pretty perfectly. He was entertaining to watch and there chemistry is really good but when he needs to be unlikeable he does a really good job of selling that. Bradley cooper is in this film in a smaller role as an arms dealer and he was typically really good in his role, even though it isn't a huge role. I also really liked the performance of Teller's characters girlfriend who gave a strong performance to sell there relationship. The story of the film is pretty fascinating as you go on the journey with these guys and learn the arms dealer industry with teller which helps with connecting with the character. All the twists and turns feel appropriate for the situations that these characters are put in due to there profession. The script has some pretty great humour in it, hill and teller have great chemistry when it comes to there humorous dialogue. However, especially towards the third act I feel like the drama could have been more heated and it doesn't really hit the emotion that you need it to. The style of the film shows this industry as a cool lavish lifestyle and it makes you understand why these characters would find this lifestyle such an appeal. However, this film gets a little ridiculous towards the end and it just isn't as interesting as I found the first hour of the film to be. Overall this is a great fun film that should be seen because of just how cool it is."

Jonah Hill and Miles Teller definitely own this movie, their chemistry on screen together is undeniable. There is a great back and forth between them that had me in stitches on several occasions, and they also shined in more dramatic moments when we really get to see these character's relationship. <br/><br/>I had expected more, I was anticipating more fun, it took itself quite seriously at times. I understand that it is based on serious events, but it is advertised as a comedy with the same levels of Superbad and The Hangover, so I was not hoping for, nor was I pleased with, long, dragged out dialogue scenes. <br/><br/>We do not know who to support in this movie either. David is clearly set up as the protagonist who watches his friend Efraim drive to the brink of insanity. However, David is not a very likable character either, he is greedy and self centered, while he may have some good traits, it's not enough to make him a protagonist we support. <br/><br/>It's fun, but very forgettable. It has its flaws, but War Dogs is a good time while it lasts, would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or crime film, just do not go out of your way to see it. <br/><br/>Two lifelong friends receive a contract from the Pentagon to become arm dealers for American troops in Afghanistan. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jonah Hill"

","Two childhood friends discover that there is money to be made as illegal arms dealers, but an atmosphere of distrust, basic human greed and the dangers of the Middle East get in the way in this vibrant comedy from Todd Phillips. The film is based on the experiences of two actual amateur arms dealers and with voice-over narration plus the presence of Jonah Hill, it is unsurprising that the film has been compared to 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. What made the Scorsese film such a ride though was the narration by a very charismatic Leonardio DiCaprio. Here though it is Jonah Hill, not Miles Teller, who is the charismatic one, and it is hard not to feel that 'War Dogs' would have flowed better with the deeply flawed Hill rather than the moralistic Teller narrating the tale. Tension also peters out somewhat towards the midway point, but the introductory scenes are great and the final 40 minutes are excellent as the plot takes a 'Social Network'-like turn with memorable quips like ""you're just playing the part of my best friend"". This final section of the film is in fact so strong, with the friendship between the pair really tested with so much money on stake, that it almost makes up for all other shortcomings. This is an unquestionably bumpy ride, but excellent chapter headings help pace the material well and Teller certainly holds his own even if Hill dominates every scene he is in."

Everything from helmets to automatic rifles to tanks. <br/><br/>Miles Teller is David Packouz, a basically honest young man working in Miami as a message therapist, then trying in vain to sell bed sheets to the multitude of old-folks homes in Florida. When, at a Jewish funeral, he meets up with old boyhood friend Jonah Hill as Efraim Diveroli. Both of these guys were the real people, they did not change the character names.<br/><br/>Diveroli in most respects is the polar opposite of Packhouz. He has no morals, consumes drugs, soft and hard, services of prostitutes, and will cheat anyone at any opportunity to make money. He finds ways to illegally meet contracts, but his downfall was when he attempted to cheat a re-packaging company working for him in Albania. Once the FBI became aware of his illegal operations, repackaging 42-yr-old banned Chinese ammunition for a multi-million contract, the fantasy ended.<br/><br/>The story is good because it shows how the scheming and dishonest can take advantage of cracks in a system like military weapons procurement.

","I wasn't too sure what to expect going in to 'War Dogs'. I had put off seeing it for a while. The trailers hadn't really done a lot for me. I'm a huge Jonah Hill fan, but Miles Teller I could take or leave. Todd Phillips in the director's chair is almost always a sign of quality though, so I knew I'd get around to seeing it eventually. I finally got around to it tonight and now I regret waiting so long. What a great movie. <br/><br/>Firstly, it finds the perfect balance between comedy and drama. If anything it probably leans more towards the dramatic side of things, however there are plenty of laughs, mostly thanks to Hill's terrific comedic timing. Secondly, what I had feared might be a bit of a bland story actually works very well. It's simple enough to appreciate and never strain your brain over, yet complex enough to be fascinating due to it being based on a true story. It reminded me a lot of 'The Wolf of Wall Street', simply minus all the sexuality that film contained. <br/><br/>I can see the argument being put forward that none of the characters were likable, but it's not a film that's ever trying to make them likable either. The film doesn't need us to root for them, it simply wants to take us on their journey. Other than that I can't see a lot of areas that you could poke holes in this film.

"asifahsankhan","7","0","0","30 December 2016"," So yet another Martin Scorsese wannabe? So what? At least it was a good one!
","Based on a Rolling Stone article, and subsequent book, by Guy Lawson, ""War Dogs"" tells the improbably true story of how a couple twenty-something meat-heads from Miami gamed the no-bid contract system then-Vice President Dick Cheney put into place to award government contracts. As if you needed any proof that was a terrible plan from the beginning, here come two idiots to prove just how easy it was. Miles Teller stars as David Packouz, a seemingly nice stoner stuck in a dead-end, degrading job, with a baby on the way and no way to support her. Enter his childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), an obvious sociopath and con man with a plan to get rich selling guns through the new no-bid system.<br/><br/>There are a lot of problems with War Dogs, but the performances aren't among them..... Teller is always watchable, and even though David is a bit of a wet noodle, and makes for the most gullible narrator in the history of ever, Teller's charm keeps him interesting enough. But Hill is the real standout, going in literal guns blazing as Efraim. Hill does not shy away from Efraim's excess or his pathetic over-doings, and he embraces Efraim's slimy amorality and turns him into what should be one of the great cinematic scumbags, alongside Tony Montana and Jimmy Conway. And that's the problem. As the film moves towards, sneakingly, wanting to pave its intention to copy ""Goodfellas,"" and eventually does, makes it a waste to a somewhat enjoyable ending. So another Martin Scorsese wannabe? So what? (To be fair, eventually everybody rips Marty's Wiseguys or one of DeNiro's classic off at some point in their career).<br/><br/>At least this was a good one!<br/><br/>The conflict that comes of mouthy, aggressive and woefully under qualified wise-boys-wannabes entering into a world which is clearly more complex than they can instantly comprehend has become a modern dramatic boilerplate – As the American dreamers hammering bureaucratic weak spots for tidy personal gain. Yet where War Dogs offers a cautious celebration of reckless, industrious youth, the film itself is the product of a filmmaker who is utterly unwilling to scavenge for advantageous points of entry. But all that potential is wasted by Phillips' conflicting messages. He wants this to be condemnatory of the ""kill or be killed"" economic mentality that ruined our economy, but he also wants us to care whether or not David and Efraim are still friends. (It's never clear, at any moment, why we should like Efraim at all, let alone hope he has friends.) He wants to excoriate Bush-era policies, but also revel in bros being bros in the Iraqi desert. And, like The Wolf of Wall Street, the economic commentary is compromised by the glut of wealth porn as the boys revel in their fast-made millions.<br/><br/>Perhaps fans might have hoped for more comedic moments in ""War Dogs."" Because of Jonah Hill's comedic history (as well as that of Miles Teller), it could easily have been utilised more, which would have strengthened the character development between Efraim and David.<br/><br/>Aside from its more obvious predecessors, War Dogs also takes a superficial, but interesting look at the cultural legacy of Brian De Palma's Scarface. Hill's Efraim Diveroli mounts a giant screen-cap canvas of Al Pacino wielding his ""little friend"" on the wall of his office like a moral totem. He references the film, claiming that the pair are akin to high-rolling gangsters, getting things done like money-making machines, leaving the ethics of their endeavour for someone else to deal with. Phillips constantly finds ways to let his heroes of the hook, always taking their semantic swerving at face value. He is loath to just let their criminal conniving be judged as such. There's always the sense that this film will only work if an audience believes that the scampi-sh wars dogs themselves are full- bore idiots, and not pathetic bottom-feeders in hand-me-down cabana wear. <br/><br/>And in the tradition of Scarface, Goodfellas, and The Wolf of Wall Street—so basically, all the classic American Scumbag movies — with a dash of The Big Short thrown in for a falsely moralising ending, War Dogs is a sweaty, bro-y, barely even sheepish celebration of Bush- era amorality dressed in coke and cash that squanders a brilliant scumbag performance from Jonah Hill, Miles Teller and a very watchable Bradley Cooper. What more could you ask for? Watch it, it's pretty good if you're in the mood and maybe even better if you're new to the genre."

","While watching this film about two guys who figured out a way to virtually have the American Government hand them $300 million dollars, I found myself rooting desperately for them, much akin to the Bad News Bears hitting a bottom of the ninth grand slam for the Little League World Series. It wasn't so much about bilking the US government for something as American as guns, it was about a couple of loose playing, fast talking societal rejects getting the upper hand where they just had no business with any hand at all. This movie, which is promoted as being fact based, is definitely worth your time. Jonah Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, a small time hustler who has figured a way to play in in the big game of procurement for Government contracts, specifically supplying arms to the Pentagon. He works on a little known program implemented after it was revealed that US VP Dick Cheney's associates and friends were benefactors of huge government military contracts. The procurement program allows small American businesses to participate in the provision of supplies to the American government's war effort. The beauty of Efraim's methods included scanning the back pages of the government's website listing all contracts up for bid, and then digging out the small, almost overlooked ""Requests For Proposals"" which the big players understandably avoid. As he says, ""I live on the crumbs"". His efforts pay off, and he begins to fill his pockets on small contracts, working as a middleman, never touching or seeing the arms he sells, while he dances the nights away in the hot nightclubs of Miami and beds prostitutes for good measure. Enter David Packouz (Miles Teller) who ekes out his living as a ""licenced masseuse"", dragging his massage table from one waterfront mansion to another. However, he knows there is more out there for him and he's going to get his slice of American Pie. While in the midst of an idea to sell bed sheets to retirement homes in South Florida, he realizes that he has blown his life savings on 64 cartons of sheets, and in spite of his best efforts, he is unable to sell them. He's desperate, his girlfriend is pregnant, and he is resigned to losing his investment and having to refocus his efforts on his massage business, which he is trying to avoid. As luck would have it, during a funeral in Miami, David sees his childhood friend, Efraim Diveroli, recently relocated from California, suntanned and adorned by designer sunglasses sitting a few feet away. A short catch up on the happenings, recounting days as eleven year olds at summer camp, and a night prowling the nightclubs together, before long, Efraim and David are business partners and small arms dealers. Using the same strategy of picking up contracts which nobody wants, David begins to learn the ins and outs of the business quickly and before long, both men have matching Porsches, apartments in same high-rise building on the beach, plenty of cocaine, and money falling out of their pockets in the hot spots of South Beach. What is fascinating about the story however, is the sheer luck which they encounter, when they find a contract on the US government's procurement website for ammunition and arms needed in Iraq which could total over 300 million dollars. They virtually have no idea how to get it, and this is where it all gets interesting, they pull off the impossible. They win the contract, and in loser fashion, they are told their bid was close to $50 million dollars less than the next competing bid, which to them is money left on the table. They can't believe it. However, the story is only beginning here, and it is the vehicle to reveal the depth of integrity and honesty of our protagonists, their personal beliefs and the test of their friendship. Its a roller coaster ride through wrestling and pinning down the American dream through greed and capitalism and how it changes who we are. The bottom line is that this movie comes through on depicting just how greed can lay the groundwork for betrayals on every level of a friendship."

","Going into this movie I thought it was gonna be another Jonah Hill comedy movie. Although it did have really good comedy it was an interesting story to follow. This movie blends drama, action, and comedy into a well developed movie. <br/><br/>As a person who loves his guns it was a fun one to watch. It is acclaimed that this movie is another version of ""The Wolf of Wall street"" and as it is another American dream success story, it is one that is more modern. It has some similarities to the success story of the early 1900's but it just has a different feel to it. <br/><br/>The positives in this movie include the great performances by Jonah Hill, Miles Teller and even an interesting character of Bradley Cooper. Even though I thought this whole movie was going to be a comedy, the comedy it did have came at great moments and were stomach hurting laughter. Another thing that was good about the movie was being able to explain the gun selling business in a simple interesting way. It really dives into the whole story of their business and how it affected them and their lives back home. Now for some of the negatives. The end of this movie seems to drag on and on. You think it's about to end but it just keeps going. Also the ending the does happen isn't one to wrap everything up. Some more closure would have been nice but it didn't take away from being a good movie. <br/><br/>I give this movie a two thumbs up. I will totally watch it again and advise anyone to see it."

","Ten years ago a similar film was made with Nicolas Cage in the lead called 'Lord of War'. This was based on the two youngsters who got into arm dealing, but many events were fictionalised. War is a business and these two made lots of profit out of it. So it all begins when financially struggling David clueless about raising his unborn child. At a right time he meets his old friend Efraim and decides to partner with him to supply arms to the US army abroad in a small scale. But when they saw a big opportunity, they decided to give it a try. From the obstacles, they go the extra mile to achieve it. But not knowing how serious the consequences are, finally they step into a dangerous turf and from there, what follows is revealed in the remaining parts.<br/><br/>This is really amazing film. Obviously a slow start, but like after 10-15 minutes later it gets better and better. For these actors, this is something big and they have done it excellently. Jonah Hill was simply unbelievable. Kind of good, as well as negative, totally unpredictable character. Mile Teller was superb, he narrated the story with the opening scene, gun pointed at him, the flashback begins. While the story keeps developing, it only gets crazy and crazier. Nearly two long was never been an issue, because of the good pace, as well as for the off beast storyline.<br/><br/>Lately I have been seeing lots of Ana de Armas, quite a coincident to watch some many films of someone in a short time. Anyway, her role in this was small, but she was decent. From the director of 'Hangover' trilogy, I think one of his best films it is. If you like the American Dream themes like 'Pain & Gain' and 'Wolf of Wall Street' about making dollars in a fast way risking everything, you would enjoy it as well. Like those two, it was also a comedy, despite inspired by the real. One of the film posters imitates the 'Scareface', but there's a strong reason for that, so you should watch it. Definitely worth a watch, so I suggest it!<br/><br/>8/10"

","Based on a true story, 'War Dogs' makes a light comedy out of the shady goings-on of the international arms trade. From an acting perspective, Teller and Hill's on-screen chemistry tells the story of a close friendship that clearly goes back a long way and results in an immersive, emotional journey. Editing was, to be frank, better in the trailer than the film - at times, it felt slow; however on a whole 'War Dogs' was fun, punchy and action-packed. The soundtrack had been well thought about and the plot stays fairly true to the story on which the film was based. I'd definitely recommend watching 'War Dogs' with your mates as a fun, Saturday afternoon film but it certainly isn't iconic."

","War dogs is about two young Jewish men who knew each other in high school and reconnect at a funeral. David is a married massage therapist unhappy with his job. Efraim draws David in with his stories of how easy it is to make it big in weapons and ammunition sales. David joins Efraims company and proves to be a perfect fit, so business is booming. When they meet a shady arms dealer, they start on a major deal that could make them millionaires. At this point, they're willing to do whatever it takes, including breaking the law.<br/><br/>Told in a brief kind of style.(Not spending enough time on each phase of the movie). WAR DOGS ended up being a great combination of fun and excitement. Very entertaining with a big energy coming from Jonah Hill and his amazing work with this role. It doesn't stop there though there were many more great roles like ""David,"" Jonah's costar.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is the perfect fit of swagger, sweat and sexism, that for a while, you don't immediately realise what an incredible performance he delivers. Bulked up considerably for the role, he plays Efraim Diveroli, one of the twenty something Yeshiva school friends from Miami who made millions by selling dodgy supplies to the US military. He looks like a doughnut stuffed with testosterone. His amazing laugh has a combination of crazy and fun that makes it very effective. It's Jonah Hill's commitment to his role that makes this movie so great and not just that but the great chemistry between his costar and himself puts the movie over the top. Making a great cinematic picture.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips the same guy who directed the hangover is an old fashion writer. His movies are told in an old fashion kind of way, but with this film, which could have been the movie to go from only comedy movies to something a little more serious and exciting.In my opinion unfortunately he drops the ball. The aim of the movie in my opinion was to show the American hustle. We all have to find a way to make a living and this was theirs. Also a mob kind of movie, a business empire, but by the old school fashion style of directing and the not so good music. Phillips just looks lazy. This is a great story of two young guys scoring billions of dollars and traveling and visiting some of the most dangerous places in the world, it should have been a great movie. Don't get me wrong i love it. Two strong actors that played their roles perfectly the rest of the cast was also great. The direct and overall message i don't think was clear and could have been made better. Overall the goods outweigh the bads. In the end it was one of the best movies i've ever seen."

","""They call guy like us 'War Dogs'. Bottom-feeders who make money off of war without ever stepping foot on the battlefield.""<br/><br/>""War Dogs"" is based on the true story of David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, two young men in their twenties who landed a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm the U.S. army in Afghanistan. The film has a mix of comedy and drama to entertain as well as inform the audience about how a massage therapist and his childhood friend were able to make a deal with the U.S. government through illegal arms dealing. Viewers are in with the action as Packouz and Diveroli continue their covert business dealings from Miami to the deserts of the Middle East to parts of Eastern Europe. To the two men, life becomes about money, guns, and drugs. As they enjoy their fun, wealthy lifestyles and continue their big business dealings, they start to conflict with each other as they become stringent about money and labor, changing the plot of the film from dealing with the government to dealing with each other. ""War Dogs"" is comparable to ""Wolf of Wall Street"", with its base on true events and its similar elements of crime, extravagance, and adventure.<br/><br/>With Miles Teller, Jonah Hill, and Bradley Cooper, as well as Todd Phillips, the director of the ""Hangover"" trilogy, ""War Dogs"" infuses comedy into the serious drama of arms dealing. This is called Black Comedy, a style that makes light of serious topics, in this case war and arms dealing. To prepare for his role as Efraim Diveroli, Jonah Hill had gained a significant amount of weight, a noticeable difference from his characters in previous movies such as ""22 Jump Street"". Diveroli is aggressively against the film, refusing to meet Jonah Hill and suing Warner Bros. for stealing his story from his memoir, Once a Gunrunner. The film, however, is actually based off of the novel about Packouz and Diveroli, Arms and the Dudes by Guy Lawson. On the other hand, Packouz is for the film, even making a cameo as a singer in a scene at a nursery home. After being released from house arrest for his part in the arms dealing, Packouz went on to pursue his musical career, inventing a guitar pedal, the BeatBuddy, a few years later.<br/><br/>""War Dogs"" has received mostly positive reviews, for its lively, wildly entertaining qualities and exposé of the international black market of arms dealing, a topic rarely talked about in the sea of corrupt politics, money laundering, drug dealing, etc. that make for most biographical films. ""War Dogs"" demonstrates the danger of greed, corruption, and lawlessness, driving two old friends into enemies. To viewers looking for a fun summer flick with friends, ""War Dogs"" makes a great option. On the other hand, ""War Dogs"" had not gone over well with other top critics, who judge the film as shallow and a mere presentation for entertainment that glorifies the luxuries lives that resulted from the illegal actions of two criminals. It makes too light the immorality of the black market, even making the men's business out of lies look thrilling, when really it is a violation of societal rules. It serves as fleeting diversion, lacking a lasting message about the incorrectness of gunrunning.<br/><br/>The action is thrilling and eye-opening for the audience, engaging for teenagers and adults. It is especially relevant now, since the events took place only a few years ago in 2007, and since another biographical film ""Snowden"" is in theaters now. This new genre of government corruption is not exactly educating the American audience of the iniquities of dishonesty and immorality, but rather informing them of the reality of what goes on with the U.S. government and politics. The critics do make a good point in that the film does celebrate the avaricious actions of criminals, just like the film ""Wolf of Wall Street"". However, the average adult should realize that, after watching ""War Dogs"" as well as ""Wolf of Wall Street"", the luxury of the characters is a result of their deception and thievery of American taxpayer money, unethical qualities that always end up in their incarceration and unscrupulous images. The bad guys are egocentric, and they never end up successful in the end. In terms of social value, the film does denounce the characters' actions, and their luxurious lives, though entertaining to watch, demonstrate their ignorance. The film's relevance, thus, beckons the American audience to watch, keeping the entertainment level and aesthetics (taking place in various settings) high in order to further attract viewers. Unlike normal comedies such as ""Hangover"", its point was more than just to amuse but also to keep the topic grounded in current events."

","War Dogs is many things and bad is not one of them. This film is a ray of sunshine on the recent filmography of Miles Teller who not to mention gives the best performance (so far) of his career and Jonah Hill was a great choice for this role and I think he had a blast playing Efraim. Now where I think this film loses steam a bit is the love story which I think could have been handled a little better, but especially for an action movie romance subplot is was OK. I also thought that Bradley Cooper's character was quite underrated and was a lot more than the throw away character he was going to be. In conclusion, this was one of the best films in the summer of 2016 and it is definitely going to be on my personal list of the top 10 films of the year."

","Aaaand I liked it! This spectacular, funny, very entertaining movie based on an incredible and absurd true story. I like Todd Phillip's former comedies but a satire is more complex and it hard to find the golden mean between comedy and drama. I think he succeeded it and War dogs is an excellent onefold entertainment but nothing more, it won't be a milestone in movie-history of course. I would highlight the great performances: Jonah Hill portrays his usual adult-Cartman character, he is funny and fatter than ever so it fits to him. I don't really like Bradley Cooper, but he was excellent again. And Miles Tellerhe is a big question mark for me, I liked him in Whiplash but I am not convinced about his talent. Anyway he was okay in this film (as anybody else would be). The point is that they created a great couple with Hill and the chemistry works between them. Finally I must mention the cool soundtrack, I liked it so much I will gain it! Summary: 10/7 worth to watch! Etc.: catch the cameo of Dan Bilzerian :))"

","Two childhood friends get together to sell weapons, and time after time they become tangled in situations that defy logic or common sense. The trailer showed what looked like a silly series of situations which could have easily been a mad cap comedy a la ""hangover"". I thought it was just a crazy fabrication that was just going to offer strident, off color and dumb jokes. Mercifully, we end up with a solid film based on real life events that appear incredible when they're introduced, and things become stranger by the minute.<br/><br/>The first half of the film introduces the two main characters, one a young man who is a bit lost and can't find a break which will give financial security so he can leave his massage business. The other is a childhood friend who got them both arrested when they were in middle school and has stayed away for a dozen years or so. When he returns, there are signs that there might be a repeat play. Warnings are offered, but the pressure is on, and the pay off looks too good to pass.<br/><br/>Somehow the two men manage to come through a suicidal mission to deliver some missions to Iraq. Luck plays a good part in their success, and it leads them to think they might able to raise the stakes next time. Things pick up speed, connections are made, and deals are made. Yet, we know there will be complications when greed and ego raise their ugly faces. People are betrayed, deals go unfinished, and the whole thing goes sour.<br/><br/>It'd not be fair to reveal the way the events unfold because it's an important part of the plot. It just seems unbelievable. What carries the film is the way the film is cast. Miles and Jonas are perfect as the mismatched couple, and I wonder if Jonas decided to go all in to give his character a repulsive look which matches the character's personality. He looks unkempt, with a wild look, a couple of days' beard growth, and a very strange laugh, a combination of nervousness and mockery.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has a dazzling cameo as one of the most wanted criminals on the government's list, showing a new side to his growing list of acting successes. He does a very convincing job as the sneaky, shady man who becomes part of the equation.<br/><br/>Go and learn how some business transactions took place, and how sometimes reality beats anything Hollywood could have come up with."
"ken-35957","8","0","0","3 September 2016"," Why greed is not so good
","At a deeper level, the story is about how short sighted, and expensive, greed can be. Efraim Diveroli forgets that not paying is the fastest way to end in trouble, and that's exactly what happens to him - over and over again. The morale of the story - pay you way - it's the cheapest path and the best one if you want to keep what you have. You'll see how the greed creeps through when the biggest contract he ever made under bidded all others by about 20%. The greed bug bites hard and his outburst heralds what is to become of his ""best friend"" and partner.<br/><br/>The darker side to Efraim's character, which allows him to go undetected, is his ability to be ""anyone someone else wants him to be"" - from a high school best friend, to a like-minded investor, the list goes on. It's an eye opening film on how slick some operators can be.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film. Well paced, interesting and highly entertaining."

The honesty of the narrative as our chief protagonist (David Packouz) slips further and further into moral turpitude is both refreshing and humorous. This once again indicates to me that there are no morals when it comes to big money (a Pentagon-inspired market akin to the Stock Exchange) and its' corruption so admirably defined in 'The Big Short', 'The Wolf of Wall Street' etc. Government waste laid bare.

If you like crime thriller type stories this is your movie. It was boring at the end but parts of it really gripping and lots of humor as well. I think the film took on too much narrative type story listing events and could have just let go more and let art speak for the details or look them up later online.

"cultfilmfan","10","4","12","20 August 2016"," War Dogs
","I was so hoping that War Dogs, would be a breakthrough film for writer/director Todd Phillips, much in the way that last year's The Big Short, was not only the most mature film of writer/director Adam McKay's career, but it was also what I would consider to be his best film and it even won him an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, amongst other nominations and honours that the film received. I say this because up till this point, both Phillips and McKay had been known mostly for lowbrow comedies that were obnoxious, crude and featured very juvenile humour and antics which would probably appeal to teenagers and maybe guys in their early 20's, but after that the appeal would greatly diminish within older and more mature viewers. I admit and I have my reviews on this site to prove that I have liked past works by both these directors, but again they were just amusing comedies that I would see once and then probably not bother with again and while humorous and entertaining at the time, they would have no lasting impact, or affect on me other than having a few chuckles amongst the other filmgoers at the theatre. McKay broke through this barrier last year with The Big Short, and now he has plans to do other more serious and yet entertaining films like one he has lined up with Jennifer Lawrence, and while I am sure he will still do his immature comedies, he has proved that he can and has the ability to do more serious and ultimately much better work. Having now seen War Dogs, I can safely say that not only has Phillips shown his truest talent as a writer, director and ultimately as a filmmaker, but I also think like McKay he has made the best film of his career. War Dogs much like The Big Short, focuses on real people and events that unfold before our eyes and the film is very satirical at times and also gives a good commentary on things such as how these two young men could have conned the American government the way they did and basically how easy it was for them to get filthy rich and do so under everyone's noses, or without them being aware. The film looks at war and weapons and how the American government goes about it's daily business with these types of foreign affairs and activities and the filmmakers here give a very critical and sometimes scathing look at such things showing that as voters, citizens and everyday people, we really sometimes have no clue as to what our government officials are up to, or what goes on behind the scenes and it also leaves one thinking that these people must not always be completely competent, or on top of things the way they should have been because otherwise we wouldn't have a film like War Dogs, or a true story and events such as this film depicts because anyone who knew what was going on would have put an end to it a long time ago, or so I hope. The film is just as good as any political spoof, or skewering by offering up many things for us as viewers to both be amazed and horrified at in equal measures. All the while though, Phillips proves he can tell a good story and both make an impact with it and completely engulf us into the world of arms dealings and the seedy goings on that these characters were involved in. The film can be quite humorous at times both in crude ways which Phillips still knows how to do, but yet he improves upon here and yet the film is so riveting that while not a thriller we are still so fascinated by what is going on in front of us that it would be a major mistake to leave the theatre even for a couple minutes and dare miss a second of this riveting story unfolding before us. The film's script is sharp with both it's quite perceptive and sometimes painfully accurate criticisms of what these two men did as well as the failure at the time of the American government, but it also raises good questions about what anyone would resort to and what depths, or lows we might go to in order to make a name for ourselves and be filthy rich even if it means facing major consequences. The acting here from the whole cast is also excellent and some of the finest work of both Jonah Hill and Miles Teller. Phillips has proved he can make one great film and I hope like McKay they continue to make serious and thought provoking films of a higher quality like this and not just go for the easy, or stupid laughs like in the past because in both cases that would be more or less selling themselves out and isn't that basically what they were both against with these two movies? I hope they will continue to work seriously, but as it stands, War Dogs is one of this year's finest achievements and overall best films."

I understand that this is one of those truth is stranger than fiction type of accounts - but that doesn't mean it will make a good movie!<br/><br/>While the story of this film may belong to Teller, this film is without question a Jonah Hill vehicle. His performance could have saved this movie, but it doesn't. As a viewer were supposed to buy into his chameleon like ability to become what other people want. He's supposed to be a sociopath con artist, but really he just comes across as an overweight, obnoxious lout with an annoying laugh. This is enforced by an absurd look and equally off putting vocabulary. <br/><br/>I believe in Jonah as an actor, so I'm going to blame everyone else (writer/director) for building a bad character. Jonah simply followed through as part of the project. But this is equally mystifying because of the one gem in this film: Bradley Cooper. His smarmy, red eyed take on an international criminal on a US terrorist watch list... is glorious to behold. Also completely squandered with about 5 total minutes of screen time... So what happened with Jonah? I don't know. Unfortunate, because if his character was believable, this movie would have received a huge upgrade.<br/><br/>I'd say this is a pretty good movie for Teller, his character isn't asked to do much heavy lifting acting wise, but he is acceptable as the strait guy pulled into a bizarre world of war economics.<br/><br/>Solid production values as well - and really this was a pretty complex movie with all the locations. Very clean, and I appreciated the audio work as well.

If you are reading this, I thank you because your message really meant a lot to me!<br/><br/>""War Dogs"" stars Jonah Hill and Miles Teller, and is an absolute blast and no doubt the best movie of the summer. First off, Jonah Hill's performance is so energetic, hilarious, and fun to watch. I don't want to spoil anything about his character, but let's just say he's very unpredictable, and very funny. He has some lines in this movie that will make you bust a gut laughing, and he's also surprisingly cool. He has a great scene involving drug dealers that I won't spoil, but it's one of the most entertaining scenes of the film. Miles Teller plays more of the serious man in this role, and he is just as good. He gives a compelling, sympathetic, and believable performance, and the relationship between him and his girlfriend, Ana de Armas, (who is probably the most beautiful person on the planet) is sweet to watch, and I enjoyed the romance and drama between them.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Miles and Jonah felt real; they felt like childhood friends, and you could tell they had fun playing off of each other. Jonah felt like the person everyone wanted to be, while Miles felt like the person everyone became. In other words, Jonah was the fantasy and Miles was the reality, if that makes any sense. However you want to word it, the dichotomy between them worked well and they were both supremely entertaining.<br/><br/>Also, Bradley Cooper has a small role in this movie, and he delivers what is probably the coolest line of the entire movie. He was so good, and I wish he played a more prominent role in the film, but what we got of him was great.<br/><br/>While this movie is marketed as a comedy, it is more of a very fun and interesting drama with some really funny moments. ""War Dogs"" is pretty much non-stop fun from start to finish, and is, in my opinion, the best film that Todd Phillips has made so far."

","After three Hangover films, two progressively worse than the first, and after another shift in the popularity of comedy films, you'd think that we had seen the last of Todd Phillips. But here he returns with War Dogs, a film that doesn't include Tigers in bathrooms, Mike Tyson karaoke, or men over the age of 40 waking up the next morning wondering what the hell they did the night before. This time, it's guns, ammo, drugs, the Iraq War, The Bush administration, fraud, corruption, greed and a group of violent Albanian mobsters. This is no laughing matter. This is Phillips' first attempt at making a truly serious film, while supplying his familiar style of dark comedy. But when you factor in the freeze-frame shots, the narrations, the soundtrack of classic rock tunes, the violence and the drugs, this film is nothing short of a love letter to Martin Scorsese. I kid you not, that's what this film is. Roll your eyes all you want, but it's a style of filmmaking that always works, especially when you're making something based on a true story. Paul Thomas Anderson did it with Boogie Nights, David O. Russell did it with American Hustle, Adam McKay did it with The Big Short.. and so on, and so on. I'll never dislike a movie that attempts to emulate Scorsese, no matter how blatant it could be. War Dogs succeeds with this formula, up to a certain point. When it comes to the political angle that the film takes, it wants you to believe that it's smarter than it actually is. It takes it's aim at the military industrial complex under Bush, but with the rise of a non- interventionalist foreign policy embraced by both parties, thanks to Trump and Sanders, this kind of subject is hardly daring. You're preaching to the converted, Todd. We all know that the Iraq War sucked. The edge is simply not there, but the performances and the writing make up for it. Teller and Hill have tremendous chemistry. They make believable brothers. Jonah Hill in particular is mesmerizing, creepy and totally hilarious. If this was a much better picture, you'd probably be hearing a lot of award buzz surrounding his performance. I really enjoyed Bradley Cooper's interesting bad-guy character. In short, it's a fairly entertaining, fairly long, and not too bad time at the movies, but it doesn't break any new ground, and it's nothing to rave about."
"fillerruth","5","6","23","16 August 2016"," Hard to believe but as a comedy it may be successful
","'War dogs' is one of the most anticipated movies of this summer. When I saw the trailer it felt to me that there is so much fun and it will be a good entertainer movie. Casting is also good. Jonah Hill is a good actor but is a very good comedian and Miles teller is a promising actor. It is a ""based on true story"" film so My expectation was huge and as a comedy movie it is good and the story pick up is fair. The title of the film tells you nothing but maybe this is a metaphor.<br/><br/>I am not telling this is only a comedy and fun film. The story is very serious and there are good crude and real incident humor are in this movie. So if anyone is searching the seriousness of that issue it will be good. This is the story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. They won a contract of 300 million from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan. It is a very funny story and the script makes this more interesting. There are lots of real incidents with good political humor and good double meaning dialogues. These double meaning dialogues will make you laugh and the political drama will make you thinking the real reason of the arms dealing. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Miles Teller has done a very good job and the background score is a perfect matching. The story is good and fresh with good humor. the direction could have been better but not bad. The only negative point is movie's pace. Very slow pace movie and sometimes I felt the continuity is not built well. The story-telling style is also another negative point. It could have been better. Otherwise, it is a good movie. The story writer could have made this more believable but after all I will say it is a good choice for fun lover."
"akshay-ak-kumar","7","3","9","20 August 2016"," Entertaining but Superficial !!
","An hour into War Dogs last nite, I was wondering what is tone of the movie director Todd Philips and the writers (incl him) trying to maintain. <br/><br/>At one moment I thought, the movie is trying to be another 'The Wolf of Wall Street' while another moment, I could see 'The Social Network'. And throughout the film, you could see references to many other Hollywood films. <br/><br/>But where the director misses the cut is that The Wolf of Wall Street and Social Network had an emotional core which War Dogs doesn't have. At any moment, one doesn't feel sad or bad for the main leads nor feel their anxiety or happiness. <br/><br/>However, the film is one joy ride from start to end if you're ready to overlook the lack of core as I did.<br/><br/>Its a fabulous true life story of two 20 year old Jews who become arms suppliers for the US Govt. And in one fabulous sequence, they drive from Jordan to Iraq with truck laden with guns to deliver to the US Army.<br/><br/>Another highlight of the film is that the director never takes sides. He doesn't tell us the war is bad or how poorly the US Govt awards defence contracts. <br/><br/>The performance by the leads is the icing on the cake. Jonah Hill is hilarious as the shallow and devilish Efraim though I could feel the hangover of his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. And Miles Teller beautifully plays the role of a man who trying hard to balance the arms supplier and loving caring husband/father.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is effective in a small cameo. However, I felt someone like a Pierce Brosnan would have added more layer to the character than Cooper.<br/><br/>My last word. Keep your expectations low and you will enjoy."

","I had a chance to see this movie in an early screening. I am not a big fan of Jonah Hills body of work (nor do I hate his work); nevertheless, he has managed to surprise me in big productions like WoWS, Moneyball and Django. He stole the show in this one. He embodied the character so well that I actually forgot that he is the same guy from 21 Jump Street and Superbad. The swag he carried was unbelievable. His laugh is unforgettable! The story is portrayed from the POV of Miles Teller's character David Packouz who is a deadbeat albeit honest bed sheet salesman and a ""certified"" massage therapist who is drawn into a shady world of arms dealing by Efraim (JH). He learns the ins and outs of the trade and helps their partnership grow and make tons of money. What happens during and after is for you to find out. Its an insanely fun ride. Cameo by Bradley Cooper, which btw not insignificant at all, as a sly but deadly operator is also memorable. All in all I enjoyed the movie a lot. Much better than all the superhero mania that's been going around this year. A mark of a good movie is that it keeps you engaged and keeps you wondering what happens next, and it avoids scenes where you go, ""oh, come on!"" (like you did when Superman went, ""Martha!""), and it did all that. Not comparing to any of the blockbusters to be fair, but this movie stands on its own. Go see it!"
"robertmaybeth","2","2","5","22 March 2019"," Implausible and awkward portrayal of the real-life story
","While both of the leads (Miles Teller and Jonah Hill) make an unlikely pair, the unusual career field they find themselves in seems even more unlikely. Admittedly knowing next to nothing about the arms business or military contracts, the two somehow prove quick studies and soon find they're in way over their heads (lowest bidders in a multi-million dollar contract to supply millions of rounds of ammunition to the US Department of defense).<br/><br/>""War Dogs"" is based on a true story, so we know that part happened. What is never explained is how two such bumblers could ever fool anyone to get themselves in such an unlikely situation...Miles Teller takes a backseat to Jonah Hill's mouthy character, and seeing the idiotic way Hill handles his first foray into ""arms sales"" would make anybody thinking about doing business with these two, make tracks in the opposite direction. Hill's character is a braggart, a loudmouth, and far too over-confident in situations that get increasingly implausible as the movie progresses. Hill's character exudes all the competence of a chimp with a gun as he makes bigger and bigger arms deals and instantly turns himself into a clownish figure that NO. ONE in their right mind would buy a box of pencils from - let alone several million dollars worth of ammo.<br/><br/>Given a real-life backstory that was ripe for parody, or at least satire, this movie could have been something else entirely then it really is - an absurd, unrealistic, and mawkish story about a couple of real idiots who happened to get very lucky."
"davideo-2","4","2","5","17 July 2017"," Undelivering, scattershot true life dramatization
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the summer of 2005, David Packouz (Miles Teller) makes a living on Miami Beach, giving back massages to wealthy clients for peanuts. Then, at a family funeral, he crosses paths with Efram (Jonah Hill), a brash young guy of about the same age, whose made a killing by making online arms deals of depleted army stock that the US government no longer needs, and wants to bring him in on the deal. But as the boys delve deeper into this murky world, the risks get greater and everything conspires to fall apart around them.<br/><br/>When it comes to war, and the politics and motivations behind it, we're living in a far more cynical, acutely self aware age, where people are no longer falling for the jingoistic, stirring rhetoric used to whip up support for it, and can see beneath the surface of what it's about just fine. And so a different type of film emerges, in the shape of War Dogs, where our heroes aren't rounded, noble figures, but shady, arrogant ba$tards who are really operating behind the scenes. Sadly, despite the potential, the film isn't the soaring hit it should have been.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips seems to have a background in mainstream comedy films, including The Hangover series, and while this is billed as a comedy itself, the darker tone and more uneasy subject matter make it harder to see in this way. Performances wise, Hill has never played his obnoxious American arsehole act to such great effect, making his Wolf of Wall Street character practically Paddington Bear, whilst Teller provides fine support as the slightly more restrained other guy. There is a neat sense of style, savvy Goodfellas style narration and some cool dramatic moments, but none of it comes off in quite as coherent and satisfying a manner as one would have hoped.<br/><br/>If you want a film with a morally conflicted protagonist making a killing during war time, Lord of War with Nicolas Cage (which, ironically, was released in the year the film is set) is a more satisfying option. **"
"jaoneal","Null","2","5","22 November 2016"," Fails to pull you in
","I found this movie severely disappointing. If fails to deliver much in the way of real drama (Nick Cage's Lord of War did a better job of dramatically pulling one into the seedy world of the arms dealing) and ultimately provides no insight into the primary character's ultimate motivations and personality.<br/><br/>The inflated IMDb rating for this movie has to be taken with the grain of salt that basically every IMDb movie gets a six and then gets mysteriously moved up or down by some formula they refuse to reveal.<br/><br/>Some reviewers on here have been willing to forgive the lack of dramatic appeal of this movie on the basis of its ""truthiness"", viewing it as a kind quasi-morality play. But for that angle to work, we need some sympathy/insight/reason to care about the central character played by Jonah Hill. This movie provides none. Jonah Hill and Miles Teller play their parts well enough, I suppose. However, if you are going to sacrifice drama for the ""true story""/morality play line, you really need to give the audience some explanation of what it is that leads these character inevitably to their fate.<br/><br/>But this movie never even tries. You are left with nothing but questions about Efraim Diveroli and his motivations. He is left basically a cypher.<br/><br/>Which leads to the question-then what is the point of this dramatization of a ""true life"" story if lacks any drama and utlimately leaves us clueless about the central character. I'm afraid I can't answer that, and the makers never even seem to try."

","Trigger Warning(s): Islamophobia<br/><br/>Characters Worth Noting David (Miles Teller) | Efraim (Jonah Hill) | Iz (Ana de Armas)<br/><br/>Main Storyline<br/><br/>22-year-old David is living with a cute girlfriend, who he recently got pregnant, is a college dropout, failed entrepreneur, and his sole steady paycheck is rubbing the bodies of older men. Men who like to tease him a little bit. As you can imagine, he is frustrated with how his life has turned out. That is, until Efraim, his friend from when he was a kid, pops up at a mutual acquaintance's funeral and they hang out. Efraim shows off this grandeur lifestyle and of course, David wants in. He has a kid on the way, wants to do right by his girlfriend Iz, and doesn't want to struggle. No, he'd rather trade in his morals in order to obtain the mighty dollar. Hell, even to benefit Iz and his child, he'd lie to her if he had to, and he does.<br/><br/>Thing is, when you have two young men with a huge amount of ambition, willing to fib or outright lie to get ahead, it has to catch up with them eventually right?<br/><br/>Highlights<br/><br/>Hill has mastered crafting someone you love to hate. Efraim, no matter what aspect of his personality or business side, is someone you can't inherently stand. He is a professional con artist with a polarizing laugh which will either crack you up or annoy the hell out of you. On top of that, he is a pro at being selfish. He will adapt to the minimum required to get what he wants out of you, and then play you for a fool. Reminding you that despite some really odd and questionable films in Hill's filmography, he has been in the game for over a decade and certainly has learned a thing or two.<br/><br/>Low Points<br/><br/>Perhaps the main problem of this film is that on top of the trailer giving away most of the best parts of the movie, the trailer sells you an action comedy. Making it so when Teller is left to present, mostly on his own, the film's dramatic elements, he almost seems like a liability. For with Hill, being his usual comical self, like a borderline caricature of what supposedly is a real person, it makes David's issues that Teller is trying to portray feel unwelcomed.<br/><br/>David is trying to make money for his family and Efraim is trying to get his full hour with a prostitute. David is trying to be a good father and boyfriend, and Efraim is flipping out because someone corrects him in a meeting about IBM just being a random set of letters. I mean, the straight man and the fool works in a lot of movies, but it doesn't here. For on top of Teller trying to bring you the drama, and not doing so well at that, you are left wondering why this story, in particular, was important to tell? What makes two kids, barely old enough to drink, worth making a movie about? That question is never really answered.<br/><br/>Going back to the topic of Teller in this film, as I wrote this review, I was questioning that with how much Hill gets to eclipse Teller in this film, could it be Teller has lost his luster? Maybe that charm and possible IT factor wasn't all him? Could it be that with his co-star in Whiplash being a supporting role challenging him or his past love interest focused complimenting his character, could that have been it? Could it be that when someone isn't cast to support or compliment his character, but rather just make their character the one remembered after the credits roll, is Teller no longer the type of lead I, admittedly, took him for?<br/><br/>Either way, be it the movie selling one thing and you buying another, Hill and Teller's having unbalanced chemistry, or simply Teller bearing all the weight of bringing a dramatic element to this film, even if this film is ""Based on a True Story,"" you never get why this one, in particular, was an important one to tell."

It was certainly marketed to be like this to some extent. But what I got was a very well executed and entertaining film, its safe to say it far exceeded expectations.<br/><br/>War dogs is a great story about two friends who partner up and become international arms dealers landing a huge Afghan contract to supply arms to American allies. The film contains the right amount of drama as well as some good doses of humor thrown in such as Jonah Hill's eccentric laugh throughout the film. The humor works very well but at the same time it is an entertaining drama with some very good scenes such as the one where the two protagonists escape gunfire in Iraq when they were delivering weapons. <br/><br/>The film has elements of a Greek tragedy similar to what we have seen with Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street that depicts the rise, glory and eventual downfall of the characters with the FBI eventually showing up at your door. The soundtrack was also very good and the performances were great. Teller and Hill may not deserve an Oscar but they deserve a nomination. Their characters were developed nicely and you could feel the tension throughout the movie. I would say this movie would definitely satisfy the viewer and leave you pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>A strong 8/10"

","Disappointment<br/><br/>We have a great story that never received rightful promulgation--- never told the way it should have been. What a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Where do i begin. <br/><br/>First, i would start with the script. Who's idea was it to take a Dramatic story and make it into a ""weak comedy?"" We're talking about a true life ""high stakes game"" of international arms dealing. You got a malignant narcissistic ego maniac, a nice guy (down on his luck) and holes in the check balance system of the MIC (Military industrial complex). How can you Lose?...you try and make the story into a comedy.<br/><br/>Second, the Acting. Efrims character; Jonah Hill. Either Hill can't act or his lines for his role are badly written...I think it was both. Instead of drawing this malignant narcissist ""Efrim"" out into the full audience view, displaying what a true criminal he is, the director chooses to characterize him as some jolly goof ball who's supposedly ""deep down"" good at heart. The Truth is Efrim is a greedy fat pig who's never been called out for being the pathological liar that he is. The director should have made it a ""focus point"" to draw that character in full color without any misgivings. Instead, the character is presented as some jolly-ole good old boy from junior high that's really a cool guy (deep down). This is where the film goes wrong. Instead of creating tension between the predatory narcissist Efrim taking advantage of the Nice guy Packouz, we are led to believe the Narc was really deep down a good guy until the end. Again taking a made for Drama movie and turning it into a Comedy---big mistake.<br/><br/>The Main Character Packouz, Played by Miles Teller actually does a decent job of playing the protagonist whos' been victimized by his dirt-bag ""fake"" friend. He's good hearted, helps his friend make millions, gives him good advice ""hey, don't mess up this deal, we're all making money, Henry's making his cut, just roll with it....if you do i'm out of here!"" But in the end, like most nice guys gets screwed by his lying fake friend. As example illustrates, Efrim ignores Packouz advice and plays the greedy scrooge that he is and almost gets Packouz killed in the process. If the Director has spent more time developing Packouz's character with more intimate emotional insight his dreams, hopes and motives, the movie would have been much better. Instead, he leaves us with dumb witted arguments between Packouz and his Cuban Girlfriend (a completely unrealistic idealist dreamer). Their discussions are so bad the audience is left to wonder ""who's the dumber?"" <br/><br/>There are some well done scenes but they are far and few between. Bradly Cooper brings some life to the movie but its a ill fated effort. In the final Scene where Henry (Bradly Cooper) and Packouz meet by fate, we see decent acting between the best actors of the movie. Jonah Hill was a disappointment (probably more due to the script his was given and less so to his acting ability) however Hill has never really been impressive as an actor. If you have to pay for a movie, pass on this one."

Both men taste success and become very rich, but with bigger contracts comes bigger risks and the two friends quickly find themselves out of their depth...<br/><br/>War Dogs is effectively a glammed up version of Lord Of War (another film that I believe was based on a true story). What you get here is a fairly predictable rise and fall narrative, but to be fair Todd Phillips does direct the film with plenty of energy and enthusiasm and I have to admit that I wasn't bored at any point during the film. Although these things do make the film enjoyable and fun to watch I couldn't help but wonder if Phillips was enjoying himself a little too much here; he does tend to embellish a little too much and perhaps glamourises Diveroli and Packhouz more than he should - the way that Diveroli and Packhouz talk about and make references to the film Scarface only reinforces this point - did this really happen or did Phillips throw these references in to justify his glamorisation of the characters and events? Although I've put this forward as a criticism this approach is something that I like more than dislike as it does at least make the film a fairly enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>As far as acting performances go then this one definitely belongs to Jonah Hill; he basically channels the same character he played in Wolf Of Wall Street and clearly understands what kind of picture that Phillips intend to make. He was an interesting character who has more faces than Big Ben and is able to become whoever he needs to become to get money or contracts - he has an almost sociopathic charm to him. Teller is OK here, but he's still an actor that I'm struggling to get to grips with and seems to be in Hill's shadow here. Bradley Cooper is pretty flat in his respective role and he looked really creepy in those ridiculous glasses...<br/><br/>Despite being predictable, familiar and overly-glamourised I have to admit that this film was enjoyable and the story was quite interesting. Hill's energy, enthusiasm, and the manipulative nature of his character made the film stand out that little bit more and made the journey from A to B perhaps more involving than it could have been. It's nothing special and isn't remotely original, but the 114 minutes that I spent watching the film did pass by fairly painlessly."

","War Dogs is a film that is based on a true story about two friends that run an arms dealer business and selling their weapons to contractors/ to the pentagon. There is nothing on a film that is trying to adapt a real story onto film. Todd Phillips direction tries to make the film fun and some humor from the two leads like Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Phillips previous work like Due Date and The Hangover films is still better with the jokes and humor. War Dogs is a fair comedy drama film, while playing into a serious direction just cause these events happen. And when a character is in uncomfortable territory in a country and he is just a regular message therapist, trying to make a living. <br/><br/>The plot takes place in 2005, David (Miles Teller) a message therapist that is trying to make a living, and now then pregnant girlfriend played by Ana de Armas. David meets up with a long lost high school buddy Efraim (Jonah Hill) and is introduced in his business of arms dealing.

Feels like the film takes into a serious turn when lives are threatened and people get kidnapped. A reminder that their arms dealing business is far from being a walk in the park job. And when they have to keep up with hiding evidence that can spark them into getting trouble with the law. Basically, the film does have that feel like another arms dealing movie such as Lord of War. And lets thrown in the idea of a true story and mixing with jokes in it just like how Pain and Gain turned out. <br/><br/>Thats one main issue the film struggles is trying to keep a coherent direction and balance between the drama and its dark humor. Only if the script made these characters just as interesting and kept up with the pacing into making a better film. Even when the characters use pop references like the Scarface film and others, etc. <br/><br/>War Dogs is a decent dramedy of a movie, the cast can do so much to make the movie entertaining. But for the dull script, and a coherent direction. The film would be one of those forgettable comedy movies."
"Screen_Blitz","5","1","2","13 December 2016"," True story-based comedy is only half as smart and funny as it should be
","Todd Phillips, the director and writer behind the successful 'Hangover' trilogy along with a string of less memorable comedies, is one of the last people you would expect to tackle on more serious subject matter like international arms dealing. Though Phillips doesn't abandon the comedic territory, this film marks a slightly different direction than his typical repertoire; a film that taps into the political satire of war, arms dealing, and the fateful consequences that ensue. The main problem with this however, is that Todd Phillips seems lost in balancing his translating of the inspiring true story and mix of raunchy and dark, cynical humor. By the end of its 114 minutes, it all transpires to a half-baked comedy that barely succeeds to generate good laughs while struggling to make a crucial point about the repercussions of international arms dealing.So this film follows the true story of David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill), two Miami natives who reunite as friends after many years of no see. Upon their reunion, David learns about Efraim making millions of dollars from illegally selling firearms online to the Afghan military during the height of the Iraq War. David reluctantly joins in on this and together these friends began making a fortune off of capitalizing on illegal arms sales under a fraudulent contract. In the process, they come face-to-face with some shady figures including an expert arms dealer Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).<br/><br/>Todd Phillips attempts to drive this rags-to-riches story in the same wheelhouse as last year's 'The Big Short' which tackled on the financial crisis of 2008 while incorporating an exhilarating mix of humor and potency. Adam McKay however, conducted his subject matter fairly more superior than Todd Phillips does with the true story about two unlikeliest of illegal gun runners. As exhibited in 'Lord of War' starring Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto, illegal arms dealing is a dangerous game; one wrong move is all it takes for everything go south. Phillips has the potential to flourishing a story of full of substance if not without some good laughs to provide a side of levity. Unfortunately, the film not only fails sketch out an effective political satire of its subject material but fails to dig deep into the politics behind international arms or the consequences behind the shady business. Phillips delivers a rather uninteresting approach the real-life tale in a way that deprives from the dynamics of the arms dealing industry including the political controversy triggered by the government spending millions of dollars on fraudulent contracts since 2003 when the U.S launched an invasion in Iraq. Beyond a pinch of social commentary on the Bush Administration and the established greed and corruption of the lead characters, the film barely reaches any dynamic heights.<br/><br/>For a film dealing with the corruption and ill morality of arms business, Todd Phillips at least does a fine job on establishing a comedic field along with the chemistry between leads Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Though a good portion of the jokes are bit hit-and-miss and their level of humor never elevates to the standards of the typical Todd Phillips fare, these likable leads foster almost enough laughs to make up for its faulty script. In comparison to the ""Wolfpack"" in the 'Hangover' trilogy, the characters do not indulge in the same type of raunchy R-rated vulgarity, largely in favor for a slightly more cynical tale than an average comedic farce. Miles Teller, as charismatic as an actor he is, boasts a likable portrayal of the reluctant David Packouz who gets involved with his buddy Emrail Diveroli's immoral schemes. Diveroli himself is granted by a fine comedic performance by the ever-charming Jonah Hill who bears a solid barrage of bold-mouth vulgar one-liners and political bashing commentary against the Iraq War. Cuban actress Ana De Armas delivers a fine portrayal as David's worried wife who grows hungry for info on the nasty schemes her husband getting involved in, but perhaps isn't given a whole to do, nor is the 'Hangover' star Bradley Cooper as the shady arms dealer who the duo must face when they make an ill-adviced contract deal.<br/><br/>War Dogs is a middling rags-to-riches comedy that may generate some laughs to please moviegoers pursuing for an engaging comedic experience, but suffers from Todd Phillips's trite execution on its true story-inspired. Though this film definitely does make for a pain-no-gain experience, the overall results fail to measure up to anything memorable or even clever."

","War Dogs<br/><br/>The worst thing about war profiteering is that the ghosts of your victims haunt your money.<br/><br/>Luckily, possessed Benjamins don't deter the amoral marketers in this dramedy.<br/><br/>Following a string of dead-end jobs, David Packouz (Miles Teller) decides to take his old high school buddy Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) up on his offer to help him sell small shipments of firearms to the US war effort in Iraq.<br/><br/>But when the deals start getting dangerous, then downright illegal, David's conscience and pregnant wife (Ana de Armas) start to influence his decisions.<br/><br/>A highly fictionalized adaptation of an investigative article later elongated into a bestseller, War Dogs embraces its dramatized narrative for the sake of light entertainment. And while the leads do work while together, their puerile antics slight the gravity of the film's context. <br/><br/>Incidentally, it's surprising that two Americans did all this work without having to outsource to India. <br/><br/>Yellow Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
"svorva","5","1","2","27 September 2016"," When Story and Character Works, but Everything Else Goes Wrong
","War Dogs is the latest installment in a hopeful trend. These Comedies derive their soul from the absurdism of our most powerful institutions and our underlying fear of this madness. Two twenty somethings Packouz (Teller) and Diveroli (Hill) make millions selling weapons to the United States. Their only attribute: unfounded audacity. Packouz is the innocent straight man in way over his head while Diveroli is a relentlessly hilarious psychopath. I wish I could end the review right here. Narrative and character. When these two elements are working it should be impossible for your movie to fail. Unfortunately, the creators could not trust their story or their audience. A pointless chapter structure, omnipresent narration, overbearing movie music, all gimmicks used to enhance already sufficient material. The nuts and bolts of War Dogs are so botched the jokes play better in the trailers. <br/><br/>A moment of silence, please, to reflect on the tragic demise of half the gags in War Dogs. Packouz is competent and ambitious, but with a woeful lack of direction. He gets by as a massage therapist before joining forces with Diveroli. The job makes ends meet, but it comes with plump codgers conveniently losing their towels. The joke: things we do for a living, eh? Obvious subtext: Packouz is craving any way out. No more explanation necessary. Still, the moment is butchered by the narrator's play by play. Worse is when Packouz and Diveroli must confront top government officials. Our Packouz as narrator drones: We were not prepared, we were nervous, we were out of our depth, and finally, we decided to smoke a bud. We already appreciate this pair and the why behind the last second marijuana breakdown. The sheer ridiculous factor dissipates when everything is meticulously explained. These kids are making a 300 million dollar deal stoned, let me watch. It follows that the best moments occur when events are beyond explanation. In search of weed, Diveroli gets hustled for a hundred bucks. He calmly walks to his car, pops the truck, picks up an automatic weapon, and starts firing in broad daylight. Protesting Packouz is met with a high, idiosyncratic chuckle that will become the character's trademark. Just give Jonah Hill an open opportunity and let him kill it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, jokes are not the only casualty. War Dogs repeatedly trips over its own style. The movie opens with Packouz accosted by organized crime. Starting with one of the final events of the story is a respected method of building anticipation. Here it is not effective because you only need to watch Diveroli for 5 minutes before understanding this enterprise must end in disaster. Momentum is also a common casualty of the stylistic quirks. There are chapter breaks, a cut to black and an announcement of the title in white font. Yes, War Dogs was based on a book, but if feels that someone had watched Kill Bill and thought it would be cute. Speaking of Tarantino, now infamous movie tune ""Girl You'll be a Woman Soon"" makes an appearance. And ""Don't Fear The Reaper."" ""Sweet Emotion"" too. ""Fortunate Son"", ""Wish you Were Here"", ""Behind Blue Eyes"". If classic rock is not your style, we have 50 Cent, Pitbull, and Beastie Boys. It's like someone wanted to compile a list of the most pedestrian music that has already appeared in at least 50 films. When I heard ""What is Love?"" I thought I was going insane. This rant might seem absurd, but I promise it does not even cover half the soundtrack. Many appearances are not cute five second samplings either. Cease all dialogue. Maybe add a bit of slow motion. We are taking a minute break from your feature film. Often these episodes occur at the end of each chapter, when emotions and energy should be at their zenith. <br/><br/>War Dogs is more than a way to disappear two hours. Its better, but because of the wasted potential, also sadder. Jonah Hill is not just funny, but an actor that improves every film he performs in. I hope in a month I can forget everything in War Dogs except the big picture."

","War dogs is not a bad movie. It's a good story to tell. It is told well enough. <br/><br/>The characters, based on real people, are believable. Unfortunately, the acting and choice of actors lets the story down. Hill does a good job. Probably would've done better opposite someone other than Teller. That said, who would you get for this role? Andrew Garfield or similar could've been a better choice. Cooper also makes a great turn in this movie. It's worth seeing if not much else is on.<br/><br/>As I said, the story is worth telling but do not be deceived, it is a drama with some comedy in it. The previews do make it out to be a comedy. The story line where the girlfriend appears to accept that they can afford expensive apartments without asking a question probably lets it down a little and I'm confident there may have been a little left on the cutting room floor pertaining to this."
"scottshak_111","7","1","2","13 September 2016"," Witty and zesty at the same time unscrupulous
","War Dogs is a crime biopic made thoroughly exciting by its cast. I have always enjoyed watching a Todd Phillips movie. It doesn't rip you apart with humour alone but also thrives on a great theme throughout, primarily with a story that makes every bit delectable. The bottom-line is that there is always something to look up to in his frames, and that makes the imminent, full of promises.<br/><br/>War Dogs is no different. The biopic though fictionalized beyond limit to scooch in theatrics, comes out as an enjoyable piece that shatters doors of gravitas to bring that smile to your face. What work for the movie are hands down mind-boggling performances by its duo, and its uncanny witty theme. Where at one hand, Jonah Hill makes his character one of the most cherishable ones ever, Miles Teller cannot certainly be overlooked either with his riveting gazing mien that brings profundity to the cinema. Both of them, with their dynamic chemistry together, make War Dogs a fun yet intriguing watch.<br/><br/>PLOT OF WAR DOGS <br/><br/>The plot is basically an intensified theatrical look into the lives of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz. With David joining his high school friend Efraim in his pursuit to supply arms and ammunition to the US army, the movie gets into the fine detailing of how their jobs were pulled off. It is a sheer mockery of the then existent feeble policies of US that saw opportunists getting their hands warm in the Iraq and Afghanistan fire.<br/><br/>War Dogs begins with a brilliant diegetic tone from David's perspective, and delves into the story of David's life even before he meets Efraim. It is divided into various chapters with lines of crises from its own screenplay for chapter names. Each section gives away what is about to happen which isn't actually the best way of storytelling to be honest. It takes out that element of surprise of what's coming from it. But you have to give it to Todd for his creativity to weave Guy Lawson's Rolling Stone article ""Arms and the Dudes"" into something tangible.<br/><br/>At one point when you almost begin to think, if War Dogs is just meant to caper all along on its fun theme, the movie proves you wrong almost instantly. You see it enter deeper waters. Drama becomes impactful and you realize all that hourly fun of awesomeness is heading straight for the deep muck they had signed their checks for. Dramatics come galloping then and it levels the movie with its theatrics giving it a perspective and a direction.<br/><br/>DOWNSIDES OF WAR DOGS (SPOILERS INCLUSIVE) <br/><br/>If you stare hard at the downsides of War Dogs you will see how much of the detailing have actually been overlooked. To show you what you wish to see, a lot of the backdrop is made to disappear in your subconsciousness. A city in despair doesn't feel like it when you visit it through Todd's fun frames. There is no real tension you perceive. It wasn't intended to get serious at any point, I surmise.<br/><br/>Also, you can say the same by looking at the character Iz played by Ana de Armas. Tension is not allowed to transpire at all. She ends up becoming nothing but a nagging wife.<br/><br/>War Dogs also elongates the Iraq visit too much, creating dispensable humour for one Dick Cheney's America scene, which seemed quite unnecessary. It feels like Todd might have had some extra time frames to cover or might have ran out of substance. So, he creates something that actually didn't happen.<br/><br/>I really wished a profound character came along to show the perpetrators what they were actually dealing with. Why war is not what they think what it is. The gravity of working with elements of chaos as if they were playthings of a child; I think it was important to show them the misery they were offering.<br/><br/>They get a poetic justice in the end, which was nicely wrapped up. A surprise visit by Henry Girard played by Bradley Cooper, who prefers wearing sunglasses, felt justified on the levels of David's morality. But when the question is posed about Bashkim's whereabouts, Henry shuts him with money, thus leaving all his threads out in the open.<br/><br/>CELEBRATING CRIME <br/><br/>At the end of it all, you have to understand, both Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz were really bad men. The way the movie gets manifested is as if what the actors were doing was a good thing. A context that its direction feeds you, and it is sad that something rogue and out of line like that gets celebrated.<br/><br/>You can't help but notice how the movie only plays out on the vantage of David Packouz's perspective. It puts him in the spotlight as a person who had a conscience whilst slaying Efraim's brazen demeanour altogether. At what point in the movie does Efraim ever realize what he did was wrong? Well, never! <br/><br/>Oh and whatever happens, don't ask Efraim the full form of AEY. Watch out for that bit! <br/><br/>THE FINAL VERDICT <br/><br/>It is hard not to compare War Dogs with the likes of Lord of War. What Andrew Niccol had created was undoubtedly and effortlessly smart, something you see War Dogs struggling with at numerous points. But it still manages to rope you in with Miles Teller's rapt eyes and Jonah Hill's engaging performance despite the theme movie tries to cash in on. Despite, how good the movie turns out to be it still remains unscrupulous nevertheless.<br/><br/>What you would definitely take from this movie would be Jonah's signature laugh; no doubt about that."
"DarkVulcan29","5","1","2","14 September 2016"," I couldn't take much in.
","Is this film boring, well no. Although based on a true story, I've come to realize that most of what I saw here is half creative license, in movies based on true stories I've come expect that. I've felt the trailer was very misleading, making it appear to be an action buddy misadventure, when in fact it was none of that. I believe it was only loosely based on a real events.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Miles Teller are both wonderful actors, and they both put in effort here. But neither one really click, I think the filmmakers where trying to give them a Newman and Redford like feel, but Hill and Teller don't have the right chemistry do give us that, It just didn't sell to me that they where best friends. The actress who plays Tellers girlfriend is okay, but just goes nowhere, and never really convinces me that Teller is truly in love with her. And when the film throws in humor, It gives off that it was trying too hard. Bradley Cooper is in it too, and does alright with his small role he plays. The film is not all bad, the scenery is pretty good, and the country scenes are effective.<br/><br/>In the end the film did not do much for me."
"rafael_jaramillo_avellan","7","1","2","11 September 2016"," Maybe not the best Dramedy Biopic, but undeniably an entertaining one.
","Not the best film of the year and neither bringing anything new to the Biopic/Drama/comedy genre, but amazingly entertaining with characters that you can identify with, and lots of quotable one-liners. I definitely believe Jonah Hill's performance is going to be nominated for the Golden Globes for Best Comedic Performance. Efraim's unique laugh is practically another character; it's like the role was made for him. <br/><br/>Besides Jonah Hill's performance, Miles Teller doesn't get behind. Both actors have great chemistry between them, making the movie an enjoyable ride. Another thing that I loved was the soundtrack; for real, excellent song choices. Young viewers will find themselves wanting to be this couple of youngsters running for the millionaire contracts, strict viewers may not find anything plausible, but I'm pretty sure they will at least laugh a few times.<br/><br/>FINAL CONSENSUS: Committed performances and entertaining moments help to elevate this mild treatment about concerning real life stories."
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","1","2","6 September 2016"," Both Too Close and Too Far
","Blink and you'll miss it, but David Packouz, the real life AEY arms dealer responsible for defrauding the federal government, violating international law and being an all-around skuzz-bucket has a cameo in War Dogs. He plays a few bars from Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" as Miles Teller (playing Packouz) tries to sell twenty boxes of Egyptian cotton bed sheets to a retirement home manager. In a nut shell, this little moment of quiet desperation is a microcosm for everything wrong with this film. It tries to hint at a larger point, and cakes itself with Goodfellas (1990)-level severity, but the affection director Todd Phillips seems to have for our dunderhead antiheroes, clouds the film's judgment like bleary pot smoke.<br/><br/>The true story of David Packouz and middle school chum turned business partner Efraim Diveroli (Hill) was first chronicled in Rolling Stone Magazine. The article and subsequent book written by Guy Lawson details the rise and fall of two twenty-something-year- old's who made a killing (figuratively) procuring guns and ammunition for the U.S. government. Hungry for larger and larger profits, the boys of AEY eventually got themselves caught selling substandard, antiquated and illegal arms to the Pentagon in a debacle known as the Afghanistan deal.<br/><br/>Packouz as portrayed by Miles Teller is a well-meaning yet interminably disenchanted young man who is picked up and corrupted by Diveroli and his psychopathic web of gun running schemes. He also provides the narration which acts less of an attempt to weave a mind process within context and more of a plea for sympathy and understanding. ""When Efraim put it that way, there really was only one choice,"" he says in a pivotal moment. A moment that could have given the character some agency but instead continues to shift the blame to Efraim whom we all know is a bad person, he's got the nose for cocaine to prove it darn it!<br/><br/>Jonah Hill as Efraim for what it's worth, still comes across likable in a teddy bear meets Scarface (1983) kind of way. He does a lot in vital scenes to keep audiences rooting against him but there's something about his crass, school-yard bully distemper that feels like we're watching a parody of wise guy bravado instead of the real thing. This softens the image of a man who at best is a criminally minded megalomaniac and at worst is a killer (literally).<br/><br/>You'd think that in a film about guns there'd be more of them. Unfortunately most of the movie consists of car riding, cellphone talking and pale white faces staring at computer screens sifting through Pentagon orders. When guns do edge into the limelight, they're given a showy, spine-tingling, almost orgasmic quality; with the exception of the screwball Triangle of Death car chase that's highlighted in the trailer. They're basically treated as a triviality; a product meant to be bought and sold with our heroes never really handling them themselves. If guns were replaced by mortgage futures, you'd basically be watching a movie about the least interesting guys in The Big Short (2015).<br/><br/>War Dogs is simply too fond of its subject matter. It arms the story with a pugnacious worldview, sits in a shroud of gray and justifies itself by being comical but never satirical. Say what you will about the operatic peculiarities of Lord of War (2005), but at least it had the good sense to show you the consequences of run running on a visceral level. War Dogs by comparison is just confounding and trite. Todd Phillips is quite simply too giddy in this film to ask questions of any substance concerning Department of Defense contracts, weapons manufacturing, and the economy of war. Instead, like a college journalist getting his first big interview, he's simply out of his depth."
"LukeTitles","6","1","2","5 September 2016"," A good movie and a missed opportunity
","This movie is difficult to decipher. <br/><br/>It is based on a true story and that story is absurd (in a good way). Therefore the ground material is very valuable, the story flows almost always very precisely from point A to point B, without messing around too much. Maybe a couple of small subplots were unnecessary and made the movie a little bit longer than it should be.<br/><br/>The actors' performances are very convincing, Jonah Hill is confirming to be a great actor, pulling off a great performance yet again. <br/><br/>What I didn't like about the movie is that it lacks in personality. It seems to me that they wanted to keep a bright tone while narrating very dark events. They are telling a very upsetting story about how the army is getting its weapons, but it looked to me that the movie doesn't take a stand on that matter. I can't really define it better than just saying: the narration is too flat. It looks like it is denouncing something, but it doesn't really do that. <br/><br/>In other words, it is a movie of half measures.<br/><br/>Probably they could have achieved a much better result by explaining better the transitions in the behavior of the characters, that are, instead, something that simply happens on the screen."

Jonah and Miles play the 2 childhood friends that get into the fascinating world of gun running. They started small and worked their way up to a $300 million contract with the U.S. government.

Kevin plays a small businessman that backs the boys-financially-on some of their deals in return for a cut. Bradley plays another arms dealer that does business with Jonah & Miles. Bradley is on a 'Watch' list, so he can't do business with the government himself. Some parts of the movie are interesting, some are predictable.

","""War Dogs"" (2016 release; 114 min.) is ""based on true events"" we are reminded as the film opens. We are in January, 2008"", when we see a guy, Dave Packouz, thrown out of a car and assaulted by what look to be kidnappers. When then move back to ""Miami Beach 2005"", as we see Dave struggle to make end meets as a licensed massage therapist. Then one day at a funeral, Dave runs into his old buddy Efraim Diveroli, who has recently moved back to Miami. Efraim, a small time arms dealer, can use Dave's help with the arms bonanza that is the war in Iraq. Before we know it, the two are starting to sell arms to the Pentagon. At this point we're 15-20 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie, based on a Rolling Stone Magazine article, is directed by Todd ""The Hangover"" Phillips and equally as important, produced by Bradley Cooper's production company (Cooper himself also plays a small role as another shady arms dealer). The movie is divided up in 7 or 8 chapters (I didn't count them exactly) such as ""All money is made between the lines"", and ""When does telling the truth help anyone?"". Miles Teller (from ""Whiplash"") and Jonah Hill are David and Efraim, respectively. Teller looks so young! Hill on the other hand seems he was made to play this role. The movie is billed as a comedy, and yes there are quite a few laughs to be had, as the absurdity of the situation lends itself to easy laughs, There should've been a serous undercurrent as well, about the flood gates opened by the Bush administration to fill billions of dollars in war procurement, enticing second and third tier companies and scammers to get a piece of the pie. (A recent book called Consequence by Eric Fair goes into that aspect as well, and it is not a comedy). last but not least, there is a smorgasboard of music placed throughout the movie, from CCR's Fortunate Son to the Who's Behind Blue Eyes. to Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows (playing over the end credits).<br/><br/>""War Dogs"" is now into its second week, and it did okay at the box office in the first week. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, not poor, not great. I heard a lot of chuckles throughout the movie, so that was a good sign.

","War Dogs is the definition of 'okay'. It's not terrible but its nowhere near good. It lacks its own identity and the filmmaker struggles to know what it is trying to say, trying to do, or trying to be, including its approach to storyline, the characters and the genre. It doesn't work as a comedy, or a serious drama, and doesn't handle the content well enough to call itself a satire. Still, it has decent performances and isn't too troubling, even if it reminds me of the horror of The Big Short. I am still a little flummoxed as to what the film is/was trying to say, even upon reflection but perhaps that's just my understanding of it.

","Much like Lord of War, War Dogs is about an American arms dealer, or rather, two of them. While Lord of War explores it's protagonist's background somewhat, War Dogs doesn't bother wasting your time with that boring stuff. In one scene, Jonah Hill's character is ripped off by a drug dealer, so he pulls out a really big gun and fires it loudly in broad daylight in a highly developed area, like a total boss, and the dealer and his friends all run away like total wimps. You realize right then that you're watching one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Miles Teller play the main characters perfectly. They were totally believable portraying two upper-middle-class American guys just going through the daily grind trying to make a few bands.<br/><br/>Anyway, Jonah and Miles' characters like to smoke weed, but that costs money. Also, Miles' character has a hot girlfriend that he wants to keep. They realize that by exploiting US foreign policy, ineptitude and bureaucracy, they can get the best bud in all of Florida. By buying guns from old dudes in Bulgaria or whatever and reselling them to American guys they start to make a fortune.<br/><br/>In one scene they're delivering a load of stuff in Fallujah, Afghanistan (or maybe it was Iran, idk) and the terrorists start to chase them. I was like woah, are they gonna get killed by the terrorists and the whole movie will suddenly end at 68 minutes? But no, the US army or maybe even the Marines showed up just in time to stop the terrorists, but the soldiers flick off Jonah and Miles' because they know, just like I did, that they're making the big bucks. I threw my vape down and shouted ""this is awesome"" in the theater when I first saw this scene.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper played the bad guy. He was this Russian or Arab guy who sold guns but was really uncool about it. In one scene his boys jumped Miles and threatened to cut off his d or something like that. He had no chill and said Jonah and Miles couldn't back out of the deal.<br/><br/>Then they bought a bunch of Chinese bullets and resold them to the government but eventually the government found out and they got in trouble. It's illegal to buy and resell Chinese products for a profit if you're an arms dealer, but Jonah and Miles didn't know that, probably because they saw every major retailer in the country buying and reselling Chinese products for a profit.<br/><br/>Eventually Miles and Jonah get into an argument because Miles says having the best bud in Florida isn't worth it. Jonah disagrees and says that all of Miles' money actually belongs to him. Miles' girl is really mad at him because he's been dodging her and fronting like he doesn't sell guns.<br/><br/>This movie was the bomb. I told all of my friends that they should watch it.

","Interesting story showed in a very fun and entertained way. It reminded me a lot of The Wolf of Wall Street. I really laughed a lot in some scenes. On the other hand you are confronted with a true story which is somehow serious and interesting and you really don't know whats gonna happen next. The story is well transmitted and you can understand what the characters are going thru. Jonah Hill is doing great acting as kind of like a weirdo guy, and shows a very weird funny but also cold and psycho guy. The character of Miles Teller and specially the relationship with his girlfriend in the movie give some balance to the story and feels necessary. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it. It exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>9/10. I will certainly watch the movie again in a couple of years"

"ericnottelling","5","1","3","26 August 2016"," This years we wish we were Goodfellas
","Let me start by saying I'm not sure why they have tried to label this movie a comedy. It really isn't funny nor does it seem like a comedy in any way shape or form. Like much of Hill's earlier work, it's just not funny. It's another Hill movie where he is type caste into the roll where he is some sort of sleazy bad guy doing anything for money. Not sure why he keeps getting those rolls as frankly, he's not every good in them. There are drugs, they drop the F bomb a whole ton because you know those things are ""cool"" and are what make a movie, and there of course there is the back drop of a story about guns. If you can't tell i'm being sarcastic there. The whole movie is shot in the same style and manner as GoodFella's was, much like wolf of wall st tried to copy (but came up short) and they are obviously trying to capture into that style of movie. To be honest the movie idea is interesting in the sense that it goes into the story of these two guys running guns based off a true story. But it really falls short in that you can see right through the movie as being another type caste movie of that type. There is nothing ground breaking in this movie and frankly the casting simply isn't that good. Hill frankly just isn't capable of really pulling off these characters (I'm kind of shocked people are still putting him in movies), and his co-star is really a sub par actor not capable of really playing the other side of the role. There are a lot of reasons why this movie seems to sink. The bad acting is one of them, but the main reason really seems to be on the script. We have seen this story before.....many times before. It's old and worn. They added nothing really new to it, and frankly didn't do it nearly as good as the ones that really stand out that were done before it. There really is a lot missing here in order to really make this a must see movie. I don't know if the story itself is just not that interesting to actually be put on film or that they couldn't do anything creative with it. What I do know is that none of the characters stood out and make me think that will be an epicly remembered character or story line. It's something to watch if you are bored but if you are looking for a good movie, this simply isn't it. In a summer full of really disappointing and bad movies this is another one to throw into the trash can."

","Non politically correct, has warts and all. Watching War Dogs is like watching a train wreck. You know the train wreck is going to happen, you just cannot help watch the wreck out of a morbid curiosity. War Dogs has stereotypes, ugly characters, and even nastier real life experiences. War Dogs is a buddy story of, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli. When someone has a friend who a bad influence you know there is going to be trouble. No matter what the good intentions are you know the bad influence can not help but be himself. Everyone looks bad in War Dogs, governments, people and arms dealers. I felt the slime just ooze out! The moral message of easy money with fast people comes with a price hits hard! A good moral in of family/wife over money. War Dogs is directed at a fast pace, which transitions from sub story to sub story well. The Packouz/Diveroli characters create a synergy which drives a character driven story about decidence and greed. 7 out of 10"

However, what really makes this film stand out from all the other adult comedies is that, it has a beautiful emotional core. This makes you care about all the main characters in the film. The dramatic moments in the movie, are as powerful as the comedic moments. The only flaw in this movie is that, it's not as funny as it could have been. The performances are the highlight of the film. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Efraim Diveroli. Hill continues to masterfully balance comedy & drama, after his role in The Wolf of Wall Street(2013). Miles Teller is outstanding as David Packouz. Teller brings an irresistible dry humor to his role. The chemistry between Hill & Teller is effortless. It really feels like they are childhood friends. Ana de Armas is awesome as Iz. Bradley Cooper is amazing in his small yet significant role, as Henry Girard. Shaun Toub is great as Marlboro. Director Todd Phillips has successfully made an adult comedy/drama, after two continuous sequels & four full fledged adult comedies. Kudos! War Dogs is a must watch.

","Based on a Rolling Stone article by Guy Lawson, 'War Dogs' is a BLAST! Director & Co-Writer Todd Phillips regains supremacy in this racy, darkly funny & entirely amusing criminal comedy-drama, that is bolstered by a compelling performance by Jonah Hill. I had a ball. <br/><br/>'War Dogs' Synopsis: Based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), who won a $300 million contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>'War Dogs' is about achieving ""The Great American Dream"", at any cost. You watch 2 young fellas sweating it out, running around & even literally going nuts in the middle of warfare in Jordan, (The entire chapter in Jordan, is a standout). The two leading-men aren't particularly likable, but its one hell of a ride, to watch them hustle, lie, cheat & steal from all ends. 'War Dogs' is a true-story, that has turned into a terrific film, that keeps you on your seat & swings itself with hilarity & sheer menace.<br/><br/>The Screenplay by Stephen Chin, Jason Smilovic & Phillips, is explosive. The narrative arrests you & doesn't let you go. Its so much fun watching the two young bloods doing so much wrong, to get it right. Phillips's Direction is super. Its good to see him back in form, after a hiatus. 'War Dogs' is definitely among his best films to date! Lawrence Sher's Cinematography captures the greed & madness, with fineness. Jeff Groth's Editing is razor-crisp, 114-minutes swing by smoothly. Art & Costume Design are excellent. The brief action-bits are well-done. Cliff Martinez's Score is perfect.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: While its Miles Teller who gets the main role (and also does a voice-over throughout the film), 'War Dogs' still belongs to Jonah Hill. Jonah, an actor who never fails to surprise, is simply fabulous. Jonah sinks his teeth into the part & performs with enviable bravado. He's every bit of the greedy a-hole he plays & gets the best lines as well, who he delivers with his uniqueness. Also, his laugh, is another highlight. Having said that, Miles is quite-good as well, but this is Jonah's show & he owns it. Ana de Armas looks gorgeous & plays the mandatory female influence, with honesty. Kevin Pollak is first-rate. Bradley Cooper shines in an extended cameo.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'War Dogs' is a Dynamite! Don't miss it. And how about a 3rd Oscar-Nomination for Jonah?"

","War Dogs was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 it looked like it could be the next Wolf of Wall Street and while it definitely didn't reach those heights I still think that this is an amazing movie and a very underrated one at that. I've always been interested when comedic directors decide to take on more serious projects and while this still has plenty of comedy in it this is still a drama and Todd Phillips knocked it out of the park he's amazing at keeping a fast pace during both the arms dealing scenes and action sequences. While there isn't a whole lot of action sequences in this film but when there is it's extremely entertaining and they've got a lot of tension to them because you can tell neither of these characters have seen up close what they cause with the weapons they sell. You get the risks of the business they're by it just being implied but when they get involved with bigger fish like Bradley Coopers character you can really tell what they've gotten themselves into. While you never respect what Miles Tellers character does you understand why he's doing it to provide for his family and make a name for himself, these are motivations that anyone can get behind and makes him more relate able as a character. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill both have fantastic chemistry with each other they defiantly feel like life long friends who slowly start to lose their friendship to their business. While Miles Teller was great Jonah Hill was really the man who stole this movie he's very reminiscent of Gordon Gekko in this film he's obviously hilarious that's something we've come to expect from Hill but he's surprisingly a very intense character in a few scenes and that's something we've never really seen from him. There are a few flaws with this movie and the biggest one of the subplot of Tellers characters wife, it's just not very interesting and just amounts to a few scenes of arguing between them in the end. Bradley Cooper in the end is really just fine in this film he's a bit bland but did what he had to. <br/><br/>War Dogs is an amazing film it's entertaining and hilarious with mostly great performances and an interesting story. Defiantly disagree with the critics on this one. <br/><br/>92%/A"

","'WAR DOGS': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The new 'men behaving badly' comedy flick from writer/director/producer Todd Phillips (the man who also brought us 'OLD SCHOOL', 'ROAD TRIP', 'DUE DATE' and all three 'HANGOVER' movies). The film is based on a Rolling Stone article, by Guy Lawson, about two twenty-something arms dealers, that land a U.S. contract to supply weapons to Afghanistan military forces. Phillips directed, co- produced and co-wrote the movie; with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic. It stars Miles Teller, Jonah Hill, Ana de Armas, Kevin Pollak and Bradley Cooper (who also co-produced the flick). The movie's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's done mildly well at the Box Office. I liked it, but it's definitely no 'HANGOVER' (it is far better than it's two sequels though).<br/><br/>David Packouz (Teller) was working (unhappily) as a massage therapist, in Miami Beach during the Iraq War. His girlfriend Iz (Armas) unexpectedly became pregnant, and David decided he desperately needed a new source of income. So when he runs into his old childhood friend, Efraim Diveroli (Hill), at another old friend's funeral, he learns he can make a lot of money selling guns to the U.S. military (like Efraim already is). The two form a partnership, and get rich (really fast), but they also run into some serious problems.<br/><br/>The movie is only loosely based on true events; a lot of it is entirely made up (which makes for a more entertaining film, of course). It's nice to see Phillips branching out as a filmmaker (and I really wasn't impressed with the two 'HANGOVER' sequels), and it's also cool to see Hill playing somewhat of a villain. Teller is perfectly cast as the relatable lead, but he's capable of much more than this though ('WHIPLASH' is one of the greatest movies ever made, in my opinion). This film is fun (at times), and kind of interesting. It's a little too dark, to be a lot of fun though, and a little too light, to be really interesting (in a very serious way, anyway). The performances are good though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WJl7HNQ4N_4"
"burlesonjesse5","8","1","6","19 August 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of War Dogs
","The rise and fall of the American dream gets the veritable Todd Phillips treatment. And after 15 years of directing explicit comedies, he decides to venture elsewhere with the meta-drama, War Dogs (my latest review). Good for him. ""Dogs"" closely resembles the 2006 vehicle Lord of War except that it's far from dull. With a certain amount of flamboyance, a more entertaining flow, and Bradley Cooper in a steely-eyed, supporting role, War Dogs is the kind of movie Lord of War wish it could have been. Bravo Todd the bod. You went out of your comfort zone to channel a little Martin Scorsese (the use of freeze frames, voice-over narration, and freewheeling camera movement) and the result is one of 2016's best. ""War, huh good God, y'all"". Indeed. <br/><br/>Anyway, ""Dogs"" is based on a true story and takes place anywhere between Miami Beach, Florida to Albania to Jordan to the largest city in Iraq (that would be um, Baghdad). There are decent performances from the two leads (Jonah Hill and Miles Teller), a favorable use of dialogue- inserted title cards, and biting soundtrack tunes spanning at least four decades. Yeah I was a little unfulfilled with the way ""Dogs"" ended or if it even had an actual ending. No matter. This Warner Bros. release is sumptuous in every frame. Whether it's giving us long shots of high-rise condos in South Florida, rapid editing by way of business computers (and bookkeeping), plenty of characters smoking dubage, and even a poolside scene straight out of Scarface (the flick War Dogs references frequently), ""Dogs"" is a step above most cinema endeavors that have hit theaters in the dog days of August. Just call director Todd Phillips the surprising lovechild of 90's Scorsese and Andrew Niccol. The only difference is that he is not quite as self-serious.<br/><br/>With a running time of just under 2 hours (114 minutes to be exact) and featuring the stunning Ana de Armas (Knock Knock, Exposed) as its love interest, War Dogs chronicles two twentysomethings named Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and David Packouz (Miles Teller). David lives with his pregnant girlfriend and is just getting by financially with his massage and (nursing home) bed sheet businesses. Efraim is his best friend and just happens to be an arms dealer operating out of Los Angeles. Hill's character saddled with plenty of cockiness and will, takes David out of his life of doldrums all the while showing him how to make some real money. They team up to form a company and land a $300 million dollar arms deal that gets them in over their heads. There are random bits of humor here, suggestive language, a slight of hand towards the Bush administration, some mild violence, and plenty of guns (duh). Ultimately, this is Todd's best and most full-grown work. He should do films like this more often and stop resorting to his frat boy tendencies. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
"rgkarim","8","1","7","19 August 2016"," War Meets Wolf of Wall street: Teller and Hill Take On Politics
","Robbie K here, starting the weekend off with what elsea movie review. Tonight we jump into the political drama movie that is about our beloved country and those who try to cheat the system to make excessive amounts of cash. So lets bump past the formalities and dive right into my thoughts on War Dogs starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller! <br/><br/>LIKES:  Good chemistry between actors  Interesting story  Comedy is witty<br/><br/>When I saw the trailers for this movie, I shuddered to think of the mess this movie could potentially be. After all, both of the actors (while talented) had not been in any roles that I absolutely loved. Therefore I was nervous to see these cast together and the potential stupidity/annoyance that could have been. To my surprise, these two were great together, having a dynamic relationship that sold the characters to me. Hill's brash, aggressive nature led the charge of the movie, but was able to be toned down by Teller's calm, intelligent, and more mature role. Each one was able to balance the others extremes and certainly felt like two coworkers/friends cheating the system. Once more I say that alone these guys were good, but together they were excellent. While the relationship is certainly the driving force of the movie, the story helps keep the pace and suspense going. The story is exactly as sold in the trailers of two young men giving up their mundane jobs to begin selling weapons across the country. Unlike other gun running movies, this film abandons the frontlines for the bank, and feels much like another rendition of the Wolf of Wall Street. Todd Phillips and his team integrated the lives of our characters well into the story while still adding an edge of threat to keep you wondering what would interfere. The many moving pieces keep one engaged in the movie, and while there were components I felt under developed, had enough detail in each to bring things together. Finally the comedy, I was expecting the comedy to be nothing more than a bunch of one-liners and facial expressions to make the next wave of memes. Truth isthere are plenty of these moments, but surprisingly there is some rather witty dialogue that had me laughing. In particular the banter between the two held plenty of clever insults and jabs at American stereotypes. Hill's character in particular had more lines I found funny, mainly by his delivery, but Teller's responses to those lines also assisted with that factor. All-in-all, the comedy has all of the insult and stupidity you expect, but is delivered so well. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Wanted more Ana De Armas moments  The F word and comedic antics getting old  Underdeveloped parts and the ending<br/><br/>My first dislike is the limitation of Ana De Armas' character. I won't lie, she is a beautiful woman and was very nice to have on screen (hey I am human after all). But I also really liked her character and how she drove the morals of the story despite all the corruption in this film. That goodness could have really refreshed the movie at some of the slower parts and they could have injected some more suspense in the film by having her in the film. Perhaps she isn't the most key character in this war/crime drama, but hey it couldn't have hurtI think. <br/><br/>To sound like a broken record, the F word does not equal great dialogue or great writing. Yet Hollywood still can't get that idea through their skulls. War Dogs has moments where it is just one bomb dropped after another, which may not bother you much. Still this reviewer would love the strategic use of the word to maximize its comedy potential, instead of replaying the ploy much like a Hallmark Channel Christmas movie. The same can be said for the comedic ploys in this film, some of which are again beaten to death without much remorse. Jonah Hill's laugh (which sounded like a mixture between the joker and a donkey) in particular grew stale to me and was more annoying by the tenth time it escaped its lips. Fortunately, there aren't too many of these stale antics plaguing the riding. <br/><br/>My final limitation was the underdeveloped components of the film. I've already stated the Ana De Armas parts, but there were other components I felt were in need of some fine tuning. The Bradley Cooper character I expected to have a bigger role for the price tag he carries and the way they snuck under the government's nose was a bit far-fetched as well. In addition, the fact that this is all based on a Rolling Stone article left me wondering how much was true and how much of this was Hollywood magic and fantasy. And as for the ending, it is a little lackluster and I would have thought more ploy, drama, and actual footage would have been in the film. Not to mention the final scene was ambiguous and unnecessary. <br/><br/>The VERDICT<br/><br/>War Dogs was much better than I expected and really portrays the actions some may take to make a quick buck. While certainly not the most original or entertaining movie, the engaging characters will keep you entertained and the dialogue will have you laughing. However, these qualities are not enough to recommend a trip to the theater for most of the audience members. Only those with great capitalistic pride and who don't mind American political jabs should venture into this movie, otherwise wait for the Redbox rent. <br/><br/>My scores:<br/><br/>Comedy/Drama/War: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"

","Without the lead duo, War Dogs wouldn't be much more than an unusual tale dressed up for the big screen; fortunately, the casting is immaculate. Before seeing this, I would have placed Miles Teller (Whiplash, Fantastic Four) in the category of my least favourite actors (a mixture of public persona and previous films), but he has obviously matured since his earlier performances into an actor with quality range. However, Jonah Hill (Superbad, Wolf of Wall Street) is the unleashed personality of the film - a brash personality with expensive taste and an iconic laugh like no other.<br/><br/>The storyline follows the leads trying to pave their way into the international arms industry, moving from small-fry deals to bidding on the biggest international contracts. David (Teller) tries to juggle work alongside his pregnant and strongly anti-war girlfriend, whilst Efraim (Hill) drags him deeper into the murky waters of war. The dark horse for me is Bradley Cooper's Henry - a brilliant portrayal of a man who has already crossed ethical lines trying to make money, giving the duo a glimpse of what their futures could end up being.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the soundtrack is one of the most refined cinema has had in years: every track selection captures the scene perfectly, no mean feat given the potential for nearly any scene to morph from comedic to gravely serious. The accompanying scenes of both over-the-top brashness and flaunting of wealth across the globe perfectly captures the public image of arms dealers, making War Dogs an enjoyable romp through the lives of those living off war's inevitability."

A slight critique. The wife used in the movie is way too hot. I'm down for hot chicks in movie roles, but that chick is supernaturally hot, thus giving it an unnecessary fake vibe. Don't get me wrong, I'll take fairy tale wife over something like Point break for instance where we have to pretend that Keanue Reeves is madly into this chick who is unbangable to the vast vast majority of the population.<br/><br/>The info below is just ramble about the actual actions of those involved, rather than any critique's pertaining to the movie.
Aside from Efrain's insane lack of ethics (to say the least), the only thing slightly criminal was selling Chinese ammunition to the US government and disguising it as Albanian or Russian ammo. I theorize the US government was fine being in the dark as to the actual point of origin, but was forced to react when the man heading the workers in charge of repacking all the bullets got stiffed and outed them. I wouldn't be surprised if the US gov. organized it in the first place, however, since when is the government trying to cut down on spending, so who knows?<br/><br/>I take these shows based on true events with a grain of salt, however all of the points that check out make this Effraim guy about as shady of a human being as one can get. Cutting the Albanian workers out of their money is biggest example as to just how bad of a person this Effraim dude is, but to cut your partner out of his 30% and to cut the dozens of workers who slaved to repackage the bullets for however many weeks over a measly 100k (allowing you to make several million more) is beyond criminal. It's one of the worst things I've ever observed. I would have still been pissed if he only ended up paying him the 100k, which was such an insanely low amount as it was, but to stiff the workers is such a shady act and to stiff the workers was so painfully stupid. Oye Vey!
So, the way the movie ends is a mixed bag. I liked that David Packouz didn't have to do jail time and that the sweedish dude paid him his cut in the end (in real life Effraim kept all of the profits and they added Packouz getting a payday). Anways, not really a review, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but the level of crooked by the Effraim dude I found a bit disturbing. I don't even find killers as disturbing."

","Recently on the television show ""American Greed"", the story of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz trading firearms and ammo to the US government was showcased as a morality tale of greed beating out common or good sense. Although both were against the US-Iraq War, Doveroli and Packouz decided market profit eclipses domestic moralizing. The US government was at war, and there were people in the world who were going to profit by dealing arms and ammo to those engaged in the fighting. The dirty little secret about war: there are many who profit largely whenever a superpower goes to war. The kind of money made in arms dealing as compared to something like illegal drugs, makes the latter look like a few lemonade stands.<br/><br/>David Packouz (Miles Teller) was a massage therapist and occasional seller of high-quality blankets to the elderly. He doesn't make great money at either endeavor. He chances to meet his former school buddy, Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill in an award-caliber performance) at a funeral. Diveroli has been in illegal drug trading, but has found a more lucrative market: dealing in used weaponry and selling to the most fanatical gun enthusiasts on the planet: the United States Military. They find used weapons at wholesale and then resell online and to the US Government. His small company was called AEY Inc.<br/><br/>Because the US is at war in Afghanistan and in Iraq, there is a shortage of munitions supplies. Diveroli discovers there's a US website detailing hundreds of requests for munitions. With governmental approval, anyone can sell the munitions to the US Military. At first everything is on the up-and-up. But they are mainly getting the crumbs while the larger manufacturers are getting the bigger pieces. The crumbs are worth millions but the thing is, the larger contracts are worth in the hundreds of millions. They even get a silent partner/backer Ralph Slutsky (Kevin Pollack).<br/><br/>At a conference on firearms in Las Vegas, Diveroli and Packouz learn they may be in over their heads as they can't compete with the large munitions companies. Until Packouz meets with the notorious arms dealer Henry Girard (Bradley Cooper). Girard tells the novices several pieces of information which in this business can turn into hefty profits. (While I don't always agree ""knowledge is power"" only ""potential power"", in this case, the first one with the map to the treasure could win) Firstly, there's a shortage of AK-47 ammunition, needed especially for the Afghan army in the Middle East. Secondly, Girard knows where he can procure a large quantity of 150 million rounds of ammunition. The last piece is that Girard can't do business with the US Federal government, probably because he broke trade regulations. (Girard is probably loosely based on Swiss arms dealer Heinrich ""Henri"" Thomet.) Girard proposes to the newbies that he will sell them the ammo he has access to. If AEY can broker the deal to sell 150 million rounds of ammo to the US government, the deal is potentially worth $2/round, in other words about $300 million. It will be the largest deal AEY has ever brokered. The question is: will the US government fork out hundreds of millions to two twenty-something arms traders who have been in business for less time than a typical baseball season?<br/><br/>A thoroughly compelling film. Aspects are a bit like some of Martin Scorsese's offerings with voice-over and occasional freeze frame. The voice-over by Miles Teller helps us understand all the pieces of the arms-dealing world. Some aspects were fictionalized but many of the details of some of the deals are accurate, especially the one worth $300 million. All acting is solid, particularly Tellers as Packouz and Bradley as Girard. However, a fantastic and believable performance by Jonah Hill as the guiding force behind AEY. Definitely one of Hill's best acting performances. A fairly underrated film."

","One of the better movies I saw in the last month and I watch between two and three movies per day. It's an interesting look on the weapon industry. Also the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more interesting. It's just appalling that almost anybody could trade and sell any gun or ammunition without questions asked. In fact the buyers practically don't even want to know where they came from. The most important is that they can get them cheap. Jonah Hill is funny to watch, even in a bit more serious movie like this one. Because this movie has it's funny moments but it's not really a comedy when you think about the subject. The subject is war and weapons. It's an industry. Whole countries just need wars and weapons business. The USA are in a perpetual war, they are always at war with somebody, and that since they exist. It's a billion dollar business and they just can't afford not being at war. The movie is well shot, with a good cast, and an incredible story. Certainly worth at least one watch."

","War Dogs After movies such as ""The Hangover"", ""Due Date"" and ""Project X"", Todd Phillips is back with another home run movie. He writes, produces and directs ""War Dogs"" a film based on the true story of two men's quest for riches through government-contracted gunrunning.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill plays Efraim the greedy self-absorbed gun dealer who pulls an old friend into the business. Jonah delivers Efraim as a character who the audience can both love and hate. With a crying laugh and swaggering I'm-better-than-you walk, Jonah believably changes into Efraim and leads you from one emotion to the next. Miles Teller who creates David, an equally memorable character, plays Efraim's friend. Teller shapes David into a frustrated man who's looking for a way out of massaging Miami's rich business class. Teller paints the character as an ordinary man of quiet desperation. David's shortcomings are made relocatable by his frustration. He's the kind of guy who's looking to do the right thing but is trying to succeed in a dangerous business at the same time. Teller's laid back, morally driven character succeeds at seeming so baseline by maintaining a surface calm throughout the film. His appeal comes from the way Teller portrays Packouz's relationship with his pregnant girlfriend. Everything he does is to take care of, and protect her even if it is by lying to her. Towards the end of the film, Teller's portrayal of the anger of being betrayed by a friend seemed so genuine you too hate Efraim right along with him. Allowing the audience to connect better with him, than his coke-snorting counterpart. The script seems typical of most of Todd Phillips movies. Cultural slang was pervasive in some of the characters. Both Jonah and Miles said ""Bro"" enough times to truly make me believe they did not even know each other's names. Teller's script with his girlfriend endears the couple to the viewer. You can easily tell at he beginning of the movie that they are at peace with each other. As the movie's tension builds so too does the tension between these two characters. There are a few scenes where Teller's girlfriend accuses him of lying to her and his reply is along the lines of, ""I did it for you."" On the other hand Efraim's character was also built upon through the language he used, with racial slurs and cursing Jonah was able to paint the picture of an ignorant American out of place in a business, country and day in age. The way the movie put events together was also quite interesting. With a series of blackout text frames, Todd Phillips was able to cover a larger time frame than a single running story line would have allowed. The text frames also gave hints as to what would happen in the up coming segment. It helped build excitement and in some cases dread for the characters as it became evident that the text in the fame would eventually turn into dialogue before the next section would begin. Although this did break the cohesion of the piece as a whole, it added an interesting aspect I do not see very often in films. The movie starts with David in a fog encrusted warehouse district with a gun pointed at his face before going back to the beginning of the story. This skipping around in the time frame of the film made me think of Quinton Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". Although I would not say War Dogs will have the cult following that Tarantino's film does, by starting the movie where he does, Todd Phillips created a more compelling beginning for the movie.<br/><br/>""War Dogs"" takes a unique look at the way the United States government handled dealing with undesirables to work the war machine during the Iraq war. With a compelling story, excellent actors, and social commentary extending beyond just the war to a social commentary on the American dream. This story about the desire to accumulate wealth is well worth the nearly two hour run time. I recommend you check this movie out!"

","Even though ""War Dogs"" isn't claimed to be an action film it has certain aspects of the mise-en-scene which puts it under the action genre. Such as, guns money and drugs. It is an all round spectacle.<br/><br/>I really liked the way this film was edited as sometimes we see captions pop up on screen such as ""if i wanted you dead, you'd already be dead"". Then, over the next few scenes we will hear the lines be said. My opinion of it was a nice touch from the editing crew as it makes the audience prepared on what the chapter is about. A lot like Tarantino's films. <br/><br/>During the film, we see the personalities of two friends and throughout the movie we see their personalities evolve as well as their friendship. Packouz (Miles Teller) is a masseuse working in Miami and at a funeral we learn that his junior high friend Diveroli (Jonah Hill) is an International arms dealer. When we find out that Packouz is having a baby, Diveroli takes him on to work at his company to earn more money. This gratitude of kindness and help gives the audience an idea on how friendship should be used and is the main moral of the story for me.<br/><br/>For most of ""War Dogs"", i loved Hill's character as we got to see his personality in a good way. However, after the FBI find out that Diveroli and Packouz have done illegal movements in getting 10,000,000 rounds of bullets to Afghanistan for the American military Packouz doesn't want to speak to him. In the final few scenes, we see Diveroli and Packouz in an elevator and Diveroli tells Packouz he was acting as his friend. This made me extremely shocked because we as an audience had learned to love this character and in an instance all respect had gone, making the scene have a powerful effect on the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film and it signified the real meaning of trust and friendship and was a great spectacle."

","War Dogs is an interesting movie. There's not many films out there that deal with arms dealers and even fewer, if any, could be considered a comedy. As a comedy though, it's a little lacking. Hill's character feels like an exact copy of his character in Wolf of Wall Street. Not necessarily a bad thing, it just feels like it doesn't have too much originality to it.<br/><br/>I think the best thing the film has to offer is the chemistry between Teller and Hill. They both deliver great performances and when they are both on screen together it is great. In fact it's not just them, all the characters in the film are well cast and all do a great job.<br/><br/>Now the movie is about 2 criminals who are selling weapons/munitions to the US government during the war. With a summary like that, you'd think it would be a little darker or more serious. It's very lighthearted with a story that could have been a lot more deep and even funnier.<br/><br/>Overall it's not a bad movie. It's not a great movie, it's slightly better than OK. I just think it needed to play it a little more serious and not make some of the characters seem so likable."

Efraim Divoreli (Hill) is presented to us as the fun, unconcerned, know-it-all and living the ""life"" type of guy. Though roles do seem to flip as the flick goes on. We get a taste of how our ambition and desire of always wanting more and more can sometimes strike back.

Eventually expanding their business, AEY, and becoming a ""big deal"" but run into problems as greed starts to kick in, testing how far they are really willing to go so that they can get their hands on that long-desired prize. It's not all fun and games when your in the big leagues. The film is funny, dramatic and has a Wolf of Wall Street vibe to it. The acting by these two gentlemen, especially Hill is superb.

This movie has almost none, and while that could be marketing's fault (the trailer promises an entirely different movie), at the end of the day it's just not very entertaining.

","""War Dogs"" recounts the true story of David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and of their society for arms trading, AEY, through the years from 2005 to 2009. From the foundation of it, right through every step in the way that they took in becoming a multi million dollar contract arms trader.<br/><br/>Having been sadly underwhelmed in the past years by every feature Todd Philips has put out, I was going into this one not really expecting the surprise I got. This is a fabulous storytelling effort, which, as all great true-story films do, puts the focus on the characters and uses its setting to enhance a film that moves along at a restless pace and with a drive that I as riveted by as much as I was surprised by it.<br/><br/>When putting together these kinds of true story films it is very easy to fail from the start by having a murky idea on what is the focal point of your feature. Many movies loose themselves in social and political commentary, others forget completely to give a narrative pulse and worst of all, many of these focus all of their attention on pulling heartstrings solely through the real-events element, which quickly becomes a gimmick.<br/><br/>""War Dogs"" does nothing of this, it is a clear vision about these two guys, the story is theirs and it moves forwards with every scene, never being interrupted by out of place moral commentary or in your face explanations of who's right. There is no judgemental approach given to what could very easily descend into blatant accusation. The character empathy you have is really remarkable and even when I thought the film was occasionally tripping I was proved wrong by some genuine revelations and changes in the character dynamic.<br/><br/>What this excellent screenplay does is never, not even for a moment, loose you in what is a gargantuan mass of information you have to digest. I can confidently say I could explain everything that went down in the film and the understanding the filmmakers manage to give you to what is going on is all thanks to brilliant storytelling. Firstly, the plot weave is frantic yet crisply ordered, which combined with the fabulous narrative drive injected scene after scene makes for a riveting experience. You are carried through many small stories which each, other than having a brilliant structure in it of themselves, have an incremental amount of importance as the film goes on. Thanks to this the tension in the film just keeps building and building and even I, who did not know anything about the true story, could sense this ominous feeling that something was going to go down. The stakes always increase and with them the closeness to which you get to come with these characters.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Miles Teller have great chemistry, but even more than that, they stand out on their own. Jonah Hill is once again proving he is one of the great actors of our time and has still loads to do, he is performing again as a guy who basically is an asshole, but once again he succeeds in not making this person a flat, annoying brat, but a complex and dangerous human being. Miles Teller has the less showy role here, but he shines just as much, giving the audience and the film a beating heart to follow. Ana de Armas is another highlight of the film and manages to give life to her character on the screen where many other would have probably been a flat presence.<br/><br/>Of the few things that can be taken a part from ""War Dogs"" I just have to say that it does have just a couple of little inconsistencies that jarred me for the moment they were on screen. Furthermore, I have to admit that as much as I loved the chapter division it had I could have done with just a little more style. The editing is quite incredible and the laid-back photography serves the story incredibly well in giving it that open and unapologetic quirk, but I can't help but feel that visually the film did not leave a bit imprint on me, using many traditional and occasionally derivative (Godfather II ending) techniques where there could have been the space to design a visual grammar uniquely for the content.<br/><br/>I found ""War Dogs"" to be a fabulous character piece on a great backdrop of story and setting, with thoughtful directing, of which many choices I could have not agreed with on a first, quick thought, but the more I think about such and the more I appreciate the craft behind them."

","First off: True story = Win<br/><br/>But wasn't just any true story movie. This story is insane. Like the part when they're driving to Iraq? That was epic. In fact, the whole movie was awesome. Guns and money? Uh ya awesome.<br/><br/>Hill nails it. He does the fat/cocaine/F-you-Im rich image so well it's a bit concerning since, only because I like him as an actor. <br/><br/>Checks all the boxes in terms of a good movie, and you walk away learning some pretty interesting stuff.<br/><br/>Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid...<br/><br/>Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid...<br/><br/>Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid...<br/><br/>Spacing this out because it requires 10 lines? stupid..."

","Lets start with what we were all nervous for, Jonah Hill - my god, does he nail this role. Humor, intelligence, and experience all put into one role.. He drives this movie and gives every viewer something different to think. Apart from the usual 21 and 22 jump street we are all used to seeing him in, which are good films by the way! We see him play a much more serious role in this film! and he smashed it! Cant top Wolf of Wall street of course. As for Miles Teller he also did very well in his role, i don't know a lot about the bloke but i know he played a part in the latest Fantastic Four which was a shambles! But in my opinion he smashed the role of being David Packouz!!<br/><br/>All the best,
Alfie Williams, London UK"

","Am I the only person on IMDb message boards who actually liked War Dogs?<br/><br/>I know I'm not the only critic in the UK who liked it, as the Radio Times and Daily Mail marked it up as 5 and 4 stars out of 5 respectively.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill turns in a performance full of garrulous vim and vigour and Miles Teller, as the dubious conscience of the piece, perfectly holds the film together during Hill's brief sojourns from the screen and matches him when he returns.<br/><br/>Director/co-writer Phillips keeps the sleazy narrative on course throughout and leavens the questions about ethics and being a good citizen for his 'heroes' with some of the best wise- cracking one-liners and some critically questioning scenes."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","0","1","28 August 2016"," Not Illegal
","In ""War Dogs"", Jonah Hill's Efraim says, ""Just because it's not legal, doesn't make it illegal."" Director and writer Todd Philip's ""War Dogs"" is smart, hysterical, and ultimately sad. It is based on a true story about two twenty-somethings (Miles Teller and Jonah Hill), who win a $300 million U.S. Government contract to supply arms in the War in Afghanistan. Phillips wrote the screenplay with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic based on a ""Rolling Stone"" article by Guy Lawson. The bizarre truth trumps fiction. <br/><br/>During the Bush Administration, the ""Cheney Law"" allowed for small independent contractors to bid on U.S. Government armament contracts. Often these contracts were for weapons that were illegal or not readily obtained. So essentially the system is rigged; it encouraged entrepreneurs to leverage the heavy lifting of the arms black market. The Government doesn't care as long as they get their weapons, but just don't get caught. This is a big ""but"".<br/><br/>Phillips brilliantly captures with hypocrisy and whimsy the turmoil engulfing his guys, David (Teller) and Efraim (Hill). The dudes openly chose this work, and the possible consequences. However, the money is not easy to dismiss. In an Albanian warehouse David and Efraim verify that the $100,000 additional cost will result in $3 million more profit. Hill provides the right arrogance and paranoia in Efraim, who loves living large. Teller reminds of a young John Cusack. He is the decent everyday man caught up in overwhelming circumstance. Teller as David is knowingly seduced by the dark side, and he shows remnants of his noble conscience. Here that makes a difference for us. David is also beholding to Iz (solid Ana de Armas), his girl friend and mother of their child. Iz seems to believe whatever benefits herâ€”perplexing to David. Bradley Cooper has a showcase role as slick arms dealer Henry Girard. Cooper amazingly balances Henry's ruthlessness offset with a weird code of honor. Cooper's performance punctuates a theme of the movie that things are not always what they seem. <br/><br/>""War Dogs"" is visually stunning. There are magnificent aerial shots of the Jordan desert as the dudes cross the ""Triangle of Death"" to deliver Berettas in Iraq. The scenes in dark and cold Albania express the starkness and emptiness of the mood. The visuals enhance the exacting details of Phillip's story. <br/><br/>Predictably, ""War Dogs"" is a cautionary tale. However, it is told with wit, humor, and a sense of compassion. The hypocrisy lies within the system. And here are two guys making a fortune. Teller, Hill, and Cooper are great. ""War Dogs"" is worth a watch and more thought."
"DKosty123","9","0","6","20 August 2016"," Real Story That Might Anger Some Viewers With Shock & Awe
","Ripped from the news, this movie is the story of 2 twenty-something guys who went into the arms peddling business in 2005 during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. It tells the story in the first person with Miles Teller (David Packouz) narrating it throughout. The film packs a lot of surprising things into it and is one of the better told true story tales spun on film this year.<br/><br/>The writers who did the screen play were also writers on The Hangover and they know how to tell a story and make it into comedy. What is strange is how the truth can be funny and is most of the way through until the conclusion where things do get serious. It is spun here as a quite incredible story.<br/><br/>The anger of some viewers might be in how inept the Military and W Bush administration are presented. W Bush does not come off looking great here by any stretch. Efraim (Jonah Hill) and David (Teller) do not appear to be very intelligent, and yet they manage to make a lot of money because of the system set up to provide weapons in the Middle East conflicts. When it is put together overall, Government waste in these wars is massive, and it appears that it was quite easy to make money on the US Government.<br/><br/>Is there comedy? Yes, some of the situations are quite funny, and the narration is spot on in telling the story. There are no weak spots in the story, as this is story telling the way it should be done. It is easy to follow and does not get lost. There is one scene at the beginning which David is getting a gun to his head. Then the story goes back to the start and goes through everything logically. It does get back to the gun, though I think the first opening of the film is not needed but does attract the viewers attention.<br/><br/>This is an important film which is very much worth going too. It is not a waste of time by any means."
