"henrycoles9","9","14","15","4 February 2020"," Ryan Gosling as a ragdoll
","This was an ecstatics spectacle. Ryan Gosling just keeps falling off and tumbling and walking out unscathed in search of the truth. And the beautiful vibe of 1970s Los Angeles is brought it to perfection."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","186","256","27 May 2016"," A raucous buddy comedy and stuff.
","I'm sure this film is going to divide audiences, in the same way that ""Kingsman"" did.<br/><br/>It's 1977 Los Angeles. Star Wars has premiered. Disco is in full swing. And porn star Misty Mountains has just died (spectacularly). It's pretty disturbing then that dodgy licensed private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired two days later to find Misty by the slightly kooky Mrs Glenn (Lois Smith, the equally kooky doctor in ""Minority Report"") who saw her through the windows of Misty's home. Never one to turn down a pay check, Holland takes the case and the trail leads him to search for a missing girl called Amelia (Margaret Qualley). This leads him right into the substantial fists of the 'heavy for hire' Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe), who's been hired by Amelia NOT to be found. But it's clear that Amelia is at the centre of a tornado of intrigue, since her mother Judith (Kim Basinger) is head of the Justice department and there are some heavies from New York and Detroit looking for Amelia too.<br/><br/>As the film's tag-line admits ""The Nice Guys"" are ""far from nice"", and this is a sort of bromance buddy movie of the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"". (And that comparison is 100% valid since - and I honestly discovered this after I wrote that - director Shane Black (""Iron Man 3"") got into cinema by writing the screenplay for the original ""Lethal Weapon"" back in 1987). But ""The Nice Guys"" has an edge that those films of the 80's couldn't have got away with. Subtle it ain't. There is a lot of violence, a bit of 70's porn and some fruity language that sensitive viewers may find offensive. (All in all, it's a bit of a surprise that it got away with a '15' certificate in the UK).<br/><br/>But it's also insanely funny at times. Some of the sight gags are laugh out loud material (and I don't tend to act on that often in a packed cinema). You might recall in ""Diamond's Are Forever"" that a Vegas hood tosses Plenty O' Toole out of Bond's hotel window. ""Good Shot"" quips Bond. ""I didn't know there was a pool down there"" responds the hoodlum. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable.<br/><br/>Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry together (although the degree of acting required by Crowe is debatable: he looks and acts like he seems to in most media interviews!) Some of their dialogue appears distinctly ad-libbed, which shows how comfortable they were with the roles. And Matt Bomer and Beau Knapp make memorably crazed villains. A role that unfortunately does irritate is Qualley's: the character of Amelia is supposed to be a bit crazed, but her speaking part is 120% off the scale.<br/><br/>The acting star of the show though is young Australian Angourie Rice as Holland's morally-centred and bright daughter Holly, who steals just about every scene she's in. A young lady to watch for the future.<br/><br/>1970's LA is nicely realised, with nice little subliminal drop-in shots: a Jaws 2 poster; Tower Records; the original Hollywood Tower Hotel. And the film naturally attracts some banging' 70's tunes to the soundtrack, with Al Green peerless over the closing titles.<br/><br/>But it's not perfect. The plot is quite impenetrable (I'm still unclear exactly what the relationship between Misty and Amelia was). And Black's screenplay (written with Anthony Bagarozzi) over-eggs the pudding of the final showdown scene. But while it won't be to everyone's tastes, I thought it was a blast from beginning to end: a guilty pleasure of bad taste that begs for a sequel. I would go to see the Gosling/Crowe show again. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far.<br/><br/>Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review and provide feedback on your views. (Thanks)."
"rwicky19","9","195","288","15 May 2016"," Stupidity as an Art of Comedy
","The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is a excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes — absurd in a comic way. The gags are all unexpected; I was constantly asking myself ""What the hell is going on?"", and then burst into laughter. The plot could seem weird at the beginning, but it's not the main point in this movie, it is only used to create a context to the jokes. People in the theater couldn't stop laughing. There is a new and original joke every two minutes. Russell Crowe plays his part very well, but Ryan Gosling's performance is already cult. All is in the look in his eyes, and that stupid expression on his face. Two stupid and impulsive men in an outrageous world full of porn stars and guns, fighting for...money. And truth, of course. Always the old truth about some kind of conspiracy (the only weakness in the movie). Hopefully, Shane Black doesn't insist too much on that and concentrates himself on the constant jokes. I guarantee you, you will laugh a lot. I know I've just watched an excellent movie when I feel sad during the credits, because it's already over. And then, it's just pure happiness."
"PyroSikTh","8","88","126","7 June 2016"," A Laugh Out Loud Comedy
","The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy, except instead of cops, they're a private investigator and a contract tough guy who find themselves both looking for the same girl, who's gotten herself wrapped up in political and pornographic intrigue. While there are a number of action sequences, The Nice Guys is focused more on delivering humour and jokes based around a couple of reasonably well-developed characters and a mystery that's a little absurd and off- the-wall.<br/><br/>The comedy on offer here is quality stuff. The Nice Guys isn't just the latest Apatow or Rogen production that seems to just recycle jokes from other movies. Many of the jokes are well- thought out and some of them are actually clever. There's also a number of more slapstick moments, but none of them come as hammy, including the sight of Ryan Gosling fumbling with his gun and cigarette while sat in a cubicle. The comedy can be a little dark at times though, so if you like lighter laughs, The Nice Guys probably isn't your kind of movie. On that note, I was quite surprised at the amount of violence, gore, and nudity in play. Thankfully it's only gratuitous when it needs to be (which in this movie basically means for comedic effect). People do die, sometimes gruesomely, and there are a lot of boobs and constant talk of sex and pornography, sometimes from kids. Again if these kinds of things offend your soft heart, avoid The Nice Guys.<br/><br/>Talking of kids in this movie, one of the earliest lines refers to how kids these days know too much and act too grown up. This is a subtle theme of the entire movie. The line in question refers to a thirteen year old girl who chats up a guy three times her age for some weed, and another scene has a kid on a bike talking about his big dick, but more prominently is Angourie Rice who plays Holly, the PI's daughter, and shows a massive amount of maturity in every scene, often showing up her father in smarts. I would love to see a sequel set a number of years ahead where we follow a grown up Holly continuing her father's work.<br/><br/>The father himself, Holland March, is Ryan Gosling on top form. Most of the roles I'd seen him play were super serious ones, and his mumbling, tortured personas, while fantastic, started to grate. Here he is completely different. He's a silly, fumbling idiot a lot of the time, and provides the most laughs. His sense of comedy timing is perfect, and his slapstick antics are flat-out hilarious. That's not to mean that he plays the fool. In a lesser actors hands, that's exactly how March's character would have come across, but Gosling manages to balance all the over-the-top comedy with something a bit more grounded. While he shows a lot of signs of idiocy, he also shows some intelligence that helps us believe his role as a father and detective. Unfortunately I can't level the same praise on Russell Crowe who I can't decide whether he phoned it in for the paycheck, or tried too hard. When it comes to comedy, Crowe is Gosling's opposite; almost entirely unfunny, even when his lines do a lot of the legwork for him. He's not a complete failure, but he looks awkward and uncomfortable more times than he doesn't. Margaret Qualley as the missing girl is also a bit of a swing and a miss. Her hysteric lunacy comes off more as a hormonal teenager shouting things she doesn't really mean, than a girl who believes fully in her claims and is determined for the world to know what she does. Thankfully there's Keith David, Matt Bomer, and Beau Knapp who more than make up for her in the supporting side of things.<br/><br/>I never really laugh out loud when I'm by myself, especially in the cinema, but The Nice Guys had me chuckling heartily with alarming frequency. It's not a perfect movie, not even a perfect comedy, but it's right up there amongst the best comedies, for certain. I found it hilarious, and that's all that really mattered. I give it a solid 8/10 and would recommend."
"Lewis_Heather787","9","20","25","2 September 2016"," One of the most surprising films in years!
","For a start i can't believe that I missed this film in the cinema and am I now regretting that decision considering how unbelievably good this film is. The main reason for me to take a look at this film months after it had been in cinemas is the two main leads, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both of which are amazing actors and are just fantastic in there respective roles in the film, they play of one another in the film so well it really shows that both actors genuinely get on with each other. As for other actors they are all great however there is one who in my opinion rises above even Crowe and Gosling and that is the character of Holly March played by Angourie Rice. She is brilliant in every scene she is in whether it be insulting her father or giving advice for a con, this actress has great potential to go on a do great things. Turning our attention away from the cast and to the story and director, both roles which where filled by Shane Black. Once again this very talented director has hit it out of the park, the script is absolutely brilliant and there is never a dull moment in this film. Whether it be the banter between Holland and his daughter or to Jackson the lines that the actors deliver are amazing and perfectly timed, especially Hollands random quotes about Adolf Hitler. As well as the script that Shane Black helped to write the directing in this film is simply unique and brilliantly stylised, it probably really helped Black to write and direct this film. I would like to mention that ""people"" these days say Hollywood isn't making original films anymore and that only franchise films will be made. However a film like The Nice Guys is original and was made and unfortunately from what the box office results are know body bothered to go and see it, I know I'm guilty of that as well. This really makes me sad and it is also sad for this film because it 100% deserves a sequel but will probably never get it. There are some films around that have conned their way to multiple sequels without any of them being any good...divergent..cough.....Finally I would like to say that this film in my opinion is the best of 2016 so far, this film is such a surprise you will not be disappointed if you see it."
"cougarfan-bridger","7","88","132","26 May 2016"," The Nice Guys
","I'll admit that I am unfamiliar with most of Shane Black's original works, watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. While the first two thirds of the film seemed excellent, the writers set themselves up for a fantastic finish, but were unable to capitalize on that potential. The script seemed to suddenly turn very basic, with things ""falling"" into place almost too miraculously to be true. I never felt like I had truly been given an ending worthy of a classic detective story, but the fast pace of the film and humor was enough to make it very enjoyable."
"WinterbornTM","9","129","203","4 June 2016"," Great Movie
","The Nice Guys is written and directed by Shane Black and stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as two detectives who try to solve a case regarding a missing girl and the death of a porn actress in Los Angeles during the 70s.<br/><br/>I'm a big Shane Black fan ever since my childhood, with Lethal Weapon being one of my all-time favorites. After that I followed his career, and I have to say, he is a really great writer/director. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is another great movie which he wrote and directed which some might argue it brought Robert Downey Jr. back in the center of the attention, and before the whole Marvel business started. Black is great at writing buddy comedies with crime and mystery touches and The Nice Guys is one of his best works to date.<br/><br/>First of all, the two main actors, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, have an amazing on-screen chemistry. Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a by-the-book though guy enforcer type who you call when want to have someone taken care of. Crowe is now over 50 in real life, his age is starting to show, but he embraces that completely in this film. He is a little overweight and some of the action scenes he pulls might not look that believable, but he is absolutely perfect in this role. Ryan Gosling took a break from the more silent type roles (Drive, Place Beyond the Bines) which were becoming a bit too much for me and instead takes a comedic turn in this movie. He has some of the funniest lines, he gets in the craziest situations and yet there's also a dark side to him, having some drinking problems and at the same time trying to raise his daughter (Angouire Rice), who is wise beyond her years.<br/><br/>The story itself is not the most original and unique, it doesn't really break new ground and you can solve the mystery on your own while watching the movie. As soon as one character was introduced, I immediately put the clues together. But that's okay, it doesn't really need to do all those things. We were not promised some original concept or never before seen plot, we were promised an action comedy that offers two great characters and a very clever script.<br/><br/>What I truly love about this movie is how simple it actually is. It's not part of a huge franchise, it's not a CGI fest, there are no superheroes, there are no flying cars, we just follow two guys trying to solve a mystery. It really goes back to the 80-90s era, when we had some great action-comedies like the Lethal Weapon franchise or Beverly Hills Cop. It's a nice breath of fresh air with some clever dialogue, noir elements, good action and two perfect stars in the main roles. The Nice Guys is a nice surprise and it deserves a 9 out of 10!"
"kosmasp","9","34","51","25 January 2017"," Not so nice
","But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not: Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get something unique and really good. One of the Highlights of 2016 for sure"
"zetes","8","70","116","28 May 2016"," A tad disappointing given the fantastic trailers (which spoiled the film a little), but still a lot of fun
","'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny, thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two trailers. If you haven't seen them, you might enjoy this even more than I did. I'd definitely recommend it either way."
"Holland_March","10","4","4","18 June 2020"," Gosling and Crowe star in one of the most underrated and hilarious
","The Nice Guys is an absolutely fantastic film from beginning to end! Every scene in the movie has at least 3 jokes that will make you belly laugh, and the action is well shot and choreographed. Additionally, Angourie Rice is also great in this flick, as she puts on one of the best performances any child actor has. Did I mention how funny the jokes are? The villains are great as well, even if they are extremely intentionally cliché making them so much better! That aside, the film provides the audience with a genuinely well thought out and well executed mystery. All in all, is this film fantastic? Yes. Is it funny? Absolutely. Should you watch it? DEFINATLY."
"James_De_Bello","8","68","115","1 June 2016"," 8/10
","Shane Black doing what he excels at the most and doing it at the very best: ""The Nice Guys"" is funny, smart, action packed, violent, irreverent, thrilling and entertaining all at the same time without ever having tonal shift problems, it molds so many elements into one cohesive package that will give you a blast at the cinema and won't alienate you even with the sudden appearance of a giant talking bug in a car.<br/><br/>What has to be addressed immediately is the fact that if there was ever a prize for best on-screen chemistry for 2016 the race is already over, Crowe and Gosling light up the frame with an overwhelming energy, this is something we haven't seen in quite some time. Their job might be overlooked and discounted by some, but this is nothing short of genius, the way in which these two actors bring to life this story is illuminating, their timing, their banter, their personal dynamic, it is all in the brilliant script, but what the two of them do is elevate it to levels that I think not even Shane Black could have ever imagined. I mean they just had to look at each other for me to curl up laughing stupid. They don't have a false beat. And when you try to look back and think of who was better as soon as you point to one, you feel like you've made the wrong choice. Crowe's stoicism is played to perfection and when he boils up it pays off incredibly. Then there's Gosling who is recently on a roll; he was a highlight of ""The Big Short"" and showed comedic chops I didn't know he had, then comes this film and if there was ever any doubt of his comedic timing believe me is dead. The way he moves is enough to make you marvel and laugh at what he's doing, he has multiple moments of physical comedy that had me rolling on the floor, not to mention his witty, smart-ass dialogue that he nails.<br/><br/>And we aren't even halfway done with the cast yet, everybody in this film not only is cast perfectly, but kills it. Kim Basinger's casting as a callback to ""L.A. Confidential"" is a great choice, but then getting into the more important characters: Matt Bomer is terrifying as the cold blooded killer and it is so important to be so if you want to give the audience catharsis when the final showdown happens. It is great to see Keith David again on screen in this kind of supporting character role that he always, unequivocally shines in, he is truly one of the bests in my opinion, there isn't wrong he can do. Finally Angourie Rice is a revelation, she steels the movie from Crowe and Gosling so well it feels like this movie is about the three of them together.<br/><br/>Now, all of these actors get the chance to do such amazingly inspired work thanks to Shane Black. His screenplay presents us to a group of characters that are brilliantly well written and developed and tied into a plot that is absorbing and crazy. I don't know if this film is better written or directed because the two crafts combine seamlessly in this picture. There are so many moving elements and Black keeps up with all of them without ever leaving the audience behind or making them loose interest. moreover the way the setting is used is breathtaking and I mean that literally. He makes these characters move through Los Angeles and between a million easter eggs that I'm sure I missed half of, the locations give the film a whole other level of fascination, it has one of the best party scenes in recent memory. The greatness lies in the fact that story and setting feed each other and couldn't be taken apart, bringing to life a visual feast for the eyes that is grounded in story and character.<br/><br/>And there's still much to talk about: soundtrack, action and fight scenes, pace, cinematography, sound, all of these elements deserve a paragraph on their own. The excellence of filmaking in display here is in my opinion really remarkable. Does it have faults? Or course: it can occasionally digress into 70s visual extravaganza just for the sake of it, the plot is thrilling and all, yet come to really think of it, unfortunately, it comes apart slightly too easily, but these are all details that have to be addressed, yet they did not take away from the overall experience which is one of the funniest and most thrilling rides of the year that I cannot wait to check out again in the theater with a bunch of friend."
"willbecton-244-793074","3","139","255","6 September 2016"," A confused comedy noir buddy cop film.
","A movie-like thing masquerading as a period noir buddy cop comedy. I've read a number of reviews so far and one thing that almost everyone agrees on, even those who like the movie, is that the screenplay is a big hot mess. There is no momentum to the story, which is somehow both predictable and unfocused. As soon as Kim Bassinger's character shows up we know where this is all going but who cares anyway? The movie attempts to swerve towards the broadly comic and surreal but is not inspired enough to revel in its own fun and allow the audience to forgive the meandering and ultimately nonsensical plot for the window dressing that it is. <br/><br/>The characters lack sharp definition and development. Gosling and Crowe give whatever glimmer of hope there is to this movie but the material is not worthy. They may have been miscast but its almost impossible to tell due to the writing. Their characters are not very likable, consistent or distinguishable from each other(important with odd couple dynamics). <br/><br/>Supporting characters are not the fun colorful characters one would hope to have from such a movie. Gosling's daughter character is played by a talented young actress but unfortunately this is one of the worst elements of the movie. The child character who behaves like an adult is a cringe worthy staple of Hollywood and that is exactly what we get with in this movie. And why in a buddy cop movie are you focusing so much attention on buddy cop's 12 year old daughter? Why?? You could have a romantic interest or a fun villain but no, we get a third wheel Nancy Drew character.<br/><br/>From the beginning the daughter character is forced into the plot like this is a four quadrant family friendly comedy and I inwardly groaned as I realized that I was going to have to live with this decision by the screenwriters. This film has a rather bizarre obsession with children and even weaves in inappropriate porn jokes and adult situations with children in ways that I found off- putting, and I love South Park and edgy humor involving kids so that's saying something. <br/><br/>The movie is too scattershot and all over the place. Worst of all, its not very funny. There are maybe three moments in the movie that are chuckle worthy and they are featured in the trailer. The filmmaker has fun with the 1977 setting but this movie could have taken place in 2016 or 2026 or 2177, it doesn't matter."

","Nice Guys is a film you can enjoy but does not satisfy. <br/><br/>Crowe & Gosling are really good in their roles but I felt we needed to know more about there characters and lives. <br/><br/>The virtually alcoholic private investigator (Gosling) with a 13 yr old daughter. I was left puzzled : Why was he virtually alcoholic? Why did his house burn down? What happened to his wife? Why is he such a loser? <br/><br/>You know even less about Crowes character. <br/><br/>Which is a shame as they both worked well together and it makes it interesting being set in 1977<br/><br/>One is searching for Amelia (Gosling)<br/><br/>The other is paid by Amelia (Crowe) to stop people searching for her. <br/><br/>The first half of the film is good. Why are people searching for Amelia, including some who intend to kill her. <br/><br/>But for me, the second half of the film was ruined by a pretty stupid plot, which I will summarise as follows. <br/><br/>Amelias mother (Basinger) is head of justice department. She (Basinger) is in cahoots with car manufacturers to cover up excessive pollution from their cars.<br/><br/>Amelia outraged makes a 'porn film' that exposes all of this. She intends it to shown at the 1977 car expo to reveal all the dastardly dealings. <br/><br/>Basinger is having everyone involved in the film killed, including her daughter Amelia and all copies of the film destroyed. <br/><br/>I know it's pretty stupid. Which is a shame because Crowe and Gosling did such a good job. <br/><br/>There are plenty of laughs, you start the film with high expectations, But 'Nice Guys' doesn't know if its a comedy, a thriller or a film with a serious message. So ends up a disappointing 6.5/10"
"rickh98","6","25","43","22 October 2016"," The Nice Guys: potential not reached
","The Nice Guys glimmers towards moments of excellence, especially towards the beginning, but ultimately as the credits rolled I felt disappointed. <br/><br/>The first 25 minutes of the film, focused on introducing the 2 main characters, played by Ryan Gosling and a fairly wooden Russell Crowe, is hilarious. The characters are refreshingly satirical and interestingly presented, but as the film progresses the formula for each character becomes tiring: Ryan Gosling is unreliable, often drunk and a bit dainty, Russel Crowe is violent, sinister but has a much more soft and noble side. Every joke in the film is just based around these attributes. By the 1 hour mark I was getting sick of the same sort of material being reused and by the final act of the film I was considering just turning it off.<br/><br/>The narrative of the film is slightly confusing and hard to follow. It's basically Crowe and Gosling trying to find a missing girl and piece together the 'so called' suicide of a famous Pornstar, but because I kind of got lost towards the beginning about who was who and what was happening I found it hard to be engaged in the story. Just for the record I understand and can follow most films I watch, I genuinely think this film was abnormally difficult to follow. I also think the flow of the movie is poor, like I mentioned the first 25 minutes is brilliantly paced, with violence and humour, and then it sort of slows and jokes become less regular and less funny and the story sort of gets a bit stagnant and then they try to pick it up at the end with a big shoot out but even that was a bit hit and miss. I almost think the writer sort of ran out of ideas after the first act of the film but thought the first part was so good he might as well finish off the story. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling also has questionable moments in the film: his character often overreacts in feminine ways, screaming in a high pitched voice when something surprising happens and I didn't find it funny, but he kept on doing it. It's just poor acting and really desperate writing, trying to force a laugh from a hyperbolised reaction. Another example of this is at the start of the film when Ryan Gosling's character is caught pants down in a cubicle, he slams the door which swings back round so he stands and his cigarette drops to his lap so recoils in horror and tries to close the door again but it swings back open. The first second of this was funny, but it goes on for 10 more seconds and becomes really slapstick, which just ruins the humour of the original joke. Ryan Gosling's character also has a daughter who manages to worm her way into the film and I felt like her character really wasn't needed, she sort of gets annoying and though she has a funny moment here or there, I felt like her tagging along on all the missions kind of weighs the two main characters down. <br/><br/>Overall, watch the first 30 minutes and turn it off, you'll only be wasting an hour of your life if you carry on watching. It's not consistently funny enough to be a god comedy, or intense enough to be a good action film, it sort of floats in the limbo of titles I will forget and probably never re-watch.<br/><br/>Rik"
"jeremy-clay59","6","17","28","3 June 2016"," Mediocre Movie
","The Nice Guys was a movie which showed great potential. Crowe and Gosling work well together even with a dire script. The plot was at best very mediocre and many of the gags were predictable. This was a terrible let down to the film. What also didn't help was that it wasn't the clearest in terms of story lines. I will never tire of watching Crowe beat someone up but alas a great movie it does not make! The main protagonist who was being sought was also dull and to be quite frank it was one of the better parts of the movie when she got shot. The Nice Guys also tries too hard and there are echoes of such great movies like Kick Ass and Boogie Nights, which are never really pulled off in this film. <br/><br/>It's not the worst movie you'll ever see but in my opinion I wouldn't rush to see it again."

","I should have been on high alert when the studio changed the trailer. the second one was better. the story is two guys looking for a missing girl. Russell is a tough guy and Ryan is a detective. I know what the screen writer was going for-laughs-unfortunately these two aren't comedians and can't deliver funny lines. they have absolutely no chemistry together. Ryan has a young daughter who is thrown into the mix, and in many instances the atmosphere is inappropriate for her age group. I guess that is supposed to be funny. I enjoy these guys very much as actors, so I was disappointed. I realize movies are subjective and I notice the 8+ rating. I also noticed that if this is a success there will be a sequel."

","So, seeing Russell Crowe and Ryan Grosling on the cover of this film ehhhhh, I wasn't sure how I would like them on this film together. I mean, the two just didn't mix with me. But they almost reminded me of a duo like Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys, except raunchier! So this story is about two characters, Jackson Healy(Crowe) and Holland March (Grosling) who are both private detectives who go on a hunt for a missing girl. Now, these two weren't work buddies. March was hired by the missing girls aunt to find her, but the missing girl hires Healy for him to STOP trying to find her. In the midst of everything, Healy is confronted by a couple of thugs who want to kill Amelia, so he decides to team up with March to find her together. NO, this was not a happy pair. March only cared about getting paid and also had a sassy daughter to take care of where Healy is still bothered by his divorce from his cheating wife. There are tremendous funny parts in this movie that will have your stomach hurting and asking yourself what would you do in the situation and glad it wasn't you."

There never seemed to be a dull moment thanks to director Shane Black's ability to catch the audience off-guard at any second with a unique and/or bizarre bit. The villain and their motives are a bit hazy and some action scenes go a bit too long near the end, but these small negatives pale in comparison to the positives the film brings to the table.

"AudioFileZ","5","27","50","14 August 2016"," A Good Pairing Hampered By Weak Script
","I think one either likes this movie quite well or feels like it was a much larger opportunity missed. For this viewer it was the latter. As the movie began I felt it had promise especially because Russell Crowe was likable slug Nick Nolte type and I liked his character. The film has a definite film noir nod, but it's a late 70's period buddy crime flick to be more precise. It does try to inject continuous comedy, but none of it is knee-slapping funny as it's more of a low-key, fairly constant, comedy. <br/><br/>The story is pretty lame which is the main (only) problem. A young woman, Amelia Kuttner, whose mother is the head of the justice department (Kim Bassinger playing Judith Kuttner) seeks to reveal her mom is corrupt in letting the Big 3 auto makers off the hook for pollution. Think that doesn't sound stupid, well the vehicle to reveal all this malfeasance is an ""art house porn"" flick staring the daughter. The inane reason for this was to shame the mother and get the maximum exposure only a porn movie could get? This is all while the porn industry in LA starts having mysterious deaths, including the top star, the top director, and this art house porn ,wanna be, director, With the last one the Amelia Kuttner film aimed at her mother's corruption goes missing. This is, basically, the mystery our two needy private eyes must unravel: find Amelia and the film. Oh, and stay alive since death seems to swirl around lately. <br/><br/>Speaking of the twosome, I also like Ryan Gosling's acting and the character he plays. I found the young lady playing his daughter quite talented in her role. However, I do still get a bit uncomfortable seeing an impressionable youth in the middle of quite a bit of depravity being depicted. Since her dad (Gosling) is a bit of drunk she actually looks more after him than he does her. So I guess it serves that purpose, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Well, this is, in my opinion, a weak buddy movie from a director who is known to be capable of better. Maybe he did as much as he could given the story since - as stated earlier: the story is weak. A viewer could do worse for an evening's entertainment. Make sure your expectations aren't too high and the film is still watchable. I know because I appropriately lowered mine and kept watching. It is a good pairing of two quite different actors, also at very different points in their careers, allowing them to create two interesting disparate fun characters. I just felt the story did the characters potential more of a disservice than a benefit. This pairing could have yielded much better given the right script. One last note to casting director, though both Kim Bassinger and Matt Bomer have a kind of star power, she is plain wrong, plus terrible, here and he is way too opposite the type of a hit man."

","""The Nice Guys"" had pretensions to be a slapstick-style film like ""Naked Gun."" Unfortunately, it fell flat with a convoluted plot, weak laugh lines, and poor chemistry among the actors.<br/><br/>Films like ""Naked Gun"" or ""Airport"" can be great fun, as they build farcical scenes around star actors playing inept cops, pilots, and criminals. But Russell Crowe and Ryan Gossling failed to meet the threshold of performing in the broad comic style. Their characters, who were two incompetent L.A. private eyes, were far too understated. They needed coaching in the broader style of acting.<br/><br/>The scripting of ""The Nice Guys"" also foundered on poorly delineated secondary roles, such as that of Kim Basinger, who plays the ""heavy"" as the corrupt official from the Justice Department. Her scenes brought the film down to an even lower depth of dullness.<br/><br/>The filmmakers should have started their work by simply taking the time to view the ""Naked Gun"" series and to study how Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker found the ability to put together a decent film farce."

","Don't believe me..don't care. I can't get enough of it. I've seen it multiple times and it just doesn't wear out. Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry...the former's best role and a good comeback for the latter. The dialogue back and forth between the two is seamless as is the blend of flaw and quirkiness in each of their characters. Very well done by those two and by Black, who brought out their best in each scene.
The rest of the cast is very well chosen and given some great lines to work with. All of the characters you meet along the way only add to the weave (not a fan of Kim Basinger in it, though), especially Angourie Rice, who truly adds that perfect touch to the whole thing. I know some folks find the situations that this youngish girl is exposed to way too risqué, and I understand. However, she acts more mature than her age throughout and pulls it off without it being creepy...in fact the level of aplomb and thoughtfulness displayed by the character and actress takes the edge right out of it.
The late '70s are perfectly captured throughout in scene, attitude and soundtrack. In so many ways it gave you that feeling of being back there again in just about every scene. I saw my first car..an almost exact copy. The music matched perfectly with the flow all the way through and may rival the soundtracks from Boogie Nights and Guardians of the Galaxy.
Last but not least, the way that Shane Black moved seamlessly from scene to scene without a real pause, yet always building to a satisfying climax just fit so well with the rest of the elements that it makes the whole movie just..enjoyable. Great stuff..too bad it didn't do well enough to warrant a second one."

"wgingery","6","29","59","22 May 2016"," Disjointed, uneven, sporadically funny
","Throughout this film I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed something. Watching it is like watching a long, long trailer with all the highlights, but with the explanatory scenes cut out. Shane Black, the director, seems to want to put on the screen his whole ""bag of tricks"" without making the effort to connect them in logical or emotional order. Watching the film becomes like thumbing through a catalog of Hollywood tropes. Black throws one thing after another on to the wall to see what sticks. (Catalog or spaghetti on the wall, which is it? That will give you an idea of how disjointed and jarring the narrative is.)<br/><br/>The film presents some genuinely funny moments. The problem is that they are not prepared for or followed up. In one scene (in the trailer) the two dump a body over a fence. Big laugh! But so what? We have almost no idea about the people on whose table the body is dumped. Where do they fit into Black's word? Having a body land on your patio table is a very effective metaphor of the corrupt nature of L.A., but it's immediately abandoned. I felt left in the lurch.<br/><br/>The director has declared that he wanted to convey, underneath the comedy, a more serious message about a corrupt world in which two knights in tarnished armor must make their way. So far, so good. The problem, again, is that he hasn't paid enough attention to establishing their backgrounds or to the development of their relationship. I felt constantly off balance and blind- sided.<br/><br/>Which relationship is primary: the one between the two detectives, or the one between Gosling's character and his daughter? The film can't seem to make up its mind and doesn't define either very satisfactorily. I kept comparing this film to ""Paper Moon,"" and the latter won every time.<br/><br/>The director also declared that the moral objective of these knights is to protect little girls (among whom, besides Gosling's daughter, are adult female characters like Misty Mountains and Amelia). This is sentimental and patronizing. If we have learned anything since the seventies, it is that (1) women demand the right to make on their own decisions, and (2 ) that little boys and men deserve protection, too."

To any unsuspecting moviegoer sitting through this dreadful rehash, the age-old adage, nice guys finish last, becomes all too true.<br/><br/>The setting is L.A. during the mid 70's. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe play misfits Holland March and Jackson Healy, a couple of low-life PIs who join forces to solve a convoluted mystery involving a missing girl, a porn starlet, and how two distinguished actors can pick a real loser. <br/><br/>This alleged comedy is directed by Shane Black, whose previous experiences with this crime genre, like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, has shown the filmmaker to have had some relative success. Here, he is more concerned with capturing the seventies era with his references to killer bees, rationed gas lines, disco music, and pong video games than delivering an entertaining and logical film.<br/><br/>His screenplay, co-written with Anthony Bagarozzi, is a total mess. Its plot frequently detours to violent chases and shoot-outs as it tries to connect the two unsolved cases and add some far less clever one-liners between the assorted mayhem. The crime and the comedy elements rarely align unless one agree that this comedy is indeed a crime and a waste of time and talent.<br/><br/>The casting of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, two actors known more for their heavy dramatic roles rather than their light comic style, seems off from the start. When it comes to the high art of comedy, the track record of both actors is spotty as best. (While Mr. Gosling has had some success in this area, with film projects such as Crazy, Stupid, Love and Lars and the Real Girl, Mr. Crowe's comedy film credits include only Noah, a true laugh-riot.) Together, the two leads have zero chemistry between them. <br/><br/>Their foray as two wild and crazy guys is a dismal failure. Their so-called comedy bits are labored and bereft of humor. In fact, in one desperate scene, Mr.Gosling tries to channel the comic timing of Bud Abbott's double takes which elicited groans rather than laughs from the audience members. A paunchy Mr. Crowe is briefly united with an air-brushed Kim Basinger, his LA Confidential co-star, in a brief scene or two. Let us just say time has not been kind to either star and move on from there. <br/><br/>In supporting roles, Matt Bomer is underused as John Boy, a paid assassin, and Beau Knapp as a blue-faced killer is more annoying than menacing.The talents of fine actors like Keith David and Lois Smith are squandered in this dud. Only Margaret Qualley as Amelia and Angourie Rice as Holland's wiser-than-her-years teenage daughter create real characters, but that is due to their screen presence rather than the dialog they are spewing. (Both actresses make a strong impression and do deserve better parts.)<br/><br/>The film is interminably long, makes absolutely no sense, and has no laughs...none!

Ten minutes into this movie will tell you that this in not screwball comedy, it isn't a detective thriller and it isn't a throwback look at the crazy 70's. It could have been any of the three and been successful but the writer(s) couldn't make up their minds which way to go and you're left in a painful limbo where (1) the movie isn't funny (2) there's no suspenseful plot like a real detective movie and (3) you suddenly remember you taped several far more interesting things at home. The writing shows signs of being done by several different people who weren't talking to each other and wrote at different times. Such a shame.....the acting was actually pretty good.

Wow! What a disappointment. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Painfully unfunny, the film's plot is barely discernible and the story is just plain boring. Russell Crowe is still an actor I love (extra pounds and all) and he's the best thing about this movie because he basically plays the straight man and isn't trying to be a clown like Gossling is. I didn't care about anybody in this film. And, I'm tired of Hollywood glamorizing sexually precocious youngsters. Here, the 13 year-old daughter or Gossling's character is made out to be more mature than her idiot father. He's anti-porn and wonders what's happening with young people but the daughter is cool and has frank discussions about sex with porn actresses. Awful movie."

I'm not even exaggerating, it is THAT bad. I went in with great expectations, as the sky-high reviews presents the movie as one of 2016's finest. Oh man, was I wrong to trust these reviews.<br/><br/>After half an hour in, the amount of cringe was unbearable, but I was determined to finish it, it had to get better, right? Oh man, was I wrong once again. I gave up after an hour, I felt like the movie drained me of all will to live, I was on the edge of depression when I had to close my laptop and take a deep breath to prevent myself from crying.

"drmarkus-17221","1","43","100","5 June 2016"," Many reasons why I gave this movie 1 out of 10 stars:
","1. My wife and I would have left after 10 minutes, had we not driven the other couple, who may never get to choose another movie for us to see, again.<br/><br/>2. It wasn't worth the $12 (senior) price of admission.<br/><br/>3. I hate movies where 2 buffoons cannot be hit by automatic weapons fire, yet the same gunman can take out the people who (to their own benefit) are written out of the script with one bullet.<br/><br/>4. Ryan Gossling is a bad drunk, whose 13 year old daughter chauffeurs him around LA in a vintage Mercedes convertible, and talks about rim jobs. He survives more multistory falls than he deserves. He has the 9 lives of Bond, without any of the character needed, or warranted to preserve his life.<br/><br/>5. How the hell did Russell Crowe take this part? He must be at the tale end of his career. How much weight did he gain to play this awful role.<br/><br/>6. Way too much violence, and while the humor was good, I marveled at what kind of drugs the adults in front of us were on. Even the most moronic lines were hysterical to them.<br/><br/>7. The daughter, cute Cybil Sheppard like looks for this 13 year old, watching pornos with the star of the porn flick? Is this what Hollywood has deteriorated to? The theater, a 16 plex, on a Saturday night at 7 was dead. Maybe that's because there's nothing good coming out of Hollywood.<br/><br/>8. The premise, which is finally revealed about 75% of the way through the movie, why Amelia was being sought, was intended for naïve supplicants of Kardashian voyeurism. So thin, as to not be credible to anyone with even a micro cephalic brain. No wonder the rest of the world is scratching their heads, looking at what being President of this formerly great nation has deteriorated to.<br/><br/>9. Apart from the gratuitous violence, there is also gratuitous destruction of many late 70's era vehicles. Gossling and Crowe had a choice, these cars didn't. ATTENTION -- Classic car owners: Don't sell your cars to studios without reading the script too! It must have hurt to see these formerly well-cared for vehicles destroyed with a few key strokes from the screenwriter.<br/><br/>10. I can't think of anything for #10, therefore the movie gets a one * from me (but I don't think that you can give zero stars – 'cause I would have if I could have). I don't write reviews often, and I am not bulemic. Nice Guys has left me with a very bad taste in my mouth, that I can't get rid of, and so felt compelled to try to stick some fingers down my throat (literally), by typing this.<br/><br/>If you need a really good laugh, rent Animal House, or American Pie. Watch some old episodes of MASH, or Frasier, or Friends, or Cheers, or Big Bang, but don't waste your time on this flick."
"petertommaatta-1","2","10","18","17 April 2017"," Shane Black points his gun at the 70's and misfires
","""The Nice Guys"" is too self indulgent and arrogant to be loved. It's another example of how great screenwriters prove they are mediocre directors. Shane Black needed a Richard Donner or a Tony Scott to coral and police his scripts into something cinematic. Black appears way too in love with his own words, which is nauseating. Stylistically it looks great, but the tone flounders and fails.<br/><br/>In regards to ""The Nice Guys"", there is a smugness that shines through from the movie's worst character, the 13-year-old daughter of Ryan Gosling. Don't recall the name, because I just don't care. There's nothing more annoying in a movie, than a child character filled with grown up characteristics. To me, that's lazy writing. Anybody can just slap some adult qualities into an underage character in hopes for a cheap laugh or for a ""look at how clever I am"" reaction. The character was unnecessary and distracted from what could've been something fun. Are we really supposed to believe that she's going to help them solve the mystery of a dead porn star? On paper, she was probably born in Shane Black's mind as ""A 'Nancy Drew' character who sits through a porn film with adults, while being the voice of reason with adults, while holding dying bad guys hands and telling them everything is going to be okay, and then thinking nothing of talking about anal sex and seeing dead bodies... and oh yeah, leaning against a wall, arms crossed with a smug smile on her face when she's got it all figured out."" She put the final nail in the coffin of this movie for me. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is forced to act stupid, and every chance he tries to be funny, you feel every strain of his acting ability to sell what Shane Black has written, but it comes across as embarrassingly bad. When Gosling finds the body and he tries to scream for Russell Crowe's help... trying to be funny... it falls flat. When he wigs out and sees the talking killer bee... to seeing Nixon swimming... It all falls as flat and unfunny as the dead body they inexplicably throw over the fence. NOT FUNNY. Why did they dump the body in the first place? Why not call the cops? Oh, that's right, Black came up with the cheap gag of a dead body landing on a family outdoor dinner party, and then had to figure out a way to use that within the plot. A good trailer moment, perhaps was the intention, but it failed. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe just looks sad in this movie. Is that really all he could bring to the table? His character looked as bored as Crowe probably was making the movie. His character had absolutely nothing memorable about him. He was no Martin Riggs or Joe Hallenbeck by a long stretch. Hell, I can't even remember a single line of dialogue he spoke, he was so forgettable. <br/><br/>Finally and most off-putting about the entire movie, was the repeated inclusion of children and sexual situations. Some not so bad, some are cringe worthy and head shaking. Here's the list: <br/><br/>A kid taking his father's dirty magazine. (That's fine, it happens) The kid walks up on the naked woman, which we clearly see the child actor standing over the naked adult actress. (Was that necessary?) A young 13-year-old girl buying pot and hanging around a creepy older guy, likely for sex. (At least this was handled better with Russell Crowe punching the guy in the face.) A young foulmouthed kid on a bike bragging about his ""big dick"" and offering to show it for money. (Is that necessary? It wasn't funny. It was as if Shane Black spent too much time watching ""Boogie Nights"" and tried to show an underage Dirk Diggler on a bike.) Then Gosling's daughter says ""Rim job"" which is of course the act of licking an anus. (Did we need to hear her say that? It wasn't that funny.) Now we have the girl watching a stag film around adults as if that's perfectly normal. She even mentions anal sex. REALLY???? (She would've shown more maturity if she looked away from the porn and was more like ""I don't think I should be watching this kind of thing yet, might give me the wrong idea."" That would've been not so cringe worthy.) <br/><br/>All of this got me thinking, just what in the hell was Shane Black and his co-writer thinking when they wrote this? Did they really want to rely on children mixed with porn as a source of humor? Very strange territory, unless it's done in a more serious manner. Here, it's done as if there's nothing wrong with it and it's okay for kids to watch porn and talk about sex WITH ADULTS. In private, with their peers, that's one thing, but when you start crossing the line, things get uncomfortable and Black never rectifies this issue by the end. He was writing a 70's period piece but in the atmosphere of today's kids who are far too desensitized to sex, thanks to the internet. Had this been present day, it may have worked as an indictment of our current culture, but instead it comes across as Black using it for shocks and laughs without consequences. <br/><br/>Shane Black spent way too much time enjoying large party set pieces and reveling in the 70's atmosphere, then creating memorable characters, and it shows. He struggled to sell the script for more than a decade and without a $1.2 billion blockbuster ""Iron Man 3"" under his belt, he never would have have sold it. Apparently the main reason he did ""Iron Man 3"",was so he could bankroll this glossy, 70's, fever dream, pulp novel,smug fest that was ""The Nice Guys"""
"statuskuo","4","25","54","21 May 2016"," This is a terrible movie...
","As a massive Shane Black fan, this movie is crushing. And I defended ""The Last Boy Scout."" Warner Bros. seems to be getting his dreck as Marvel uses him as a gun for hire to fool Warner to believe he can direct. He can't. This movie is an absolute mess. I am certain Black can't possibly be proud of this movie. It's awful.<br/><br/>Sure, thank you kindly for the repeat shots of porn star tits. Or, the debaucherous scumbag references of Los Angeles, but aside from all that, it just is too silly to even be interesting.<br/><br/>The year is 1977, and we are deep into a plot about a thug-for-hire Russell Crowe and a sad-sack gumshoe (Ryan Gosling) with a daughter. There's some tragic story there about the mother's absence, but it is strangely played for laughs. As is Russell Crowe's backstory. There is none. He seems to be a good guy who wants to do good, but sees the world as awful. Presumably a recovering drunk, he hires Gosling's P.I. to track down a girl gone missing. Sound familiar? Yep, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" follows the template. Except here, it's really ugly and not very fun. The story takes odd turns, leads come up deadand the wise-cracking timing is off somehow. There are good moments, but that's all there is. There are the moments of endearment. Dad jokes type endearing, where you feel it's been told to Black by a drunken molest-y uncle or something. It's silly stuff you see in every movie he writes. Everything just seemed so misplaced. The action didn't even seem all that thrilling. And the fight sequences are clunky. Save for punch sounds, you wouldn't know if anyone even got hit. And the teen daughter in the world of porn in the 70's is really odd. Odd that it probably seemed more natural in a movie like ""Boogie Nights"" but for Gosling's kid, she was suppose to seem precocious, ended up being a lot more unnerving. The movie is also shot digitally. Film negative would've added so much more to the mood of the movie. And you can tell how much they were fighting with the modernized look of digital with the analog look of film. The setting just looked..plastic and flat. There wasn't that aged feel, even though they had ""aged"" film in the movie itself. If you're going for a plot, there is none. ¾ through the movie you're actually really confused as to what they are suppose to be doing. Never fear, someone comes into push the story forward. It happens too many times that you wonder if luck doesn't play a role in their work. They're not good detectives or muscle, they're just passive bystanders waiting for someone to tell them their next move. TERRIBLE mistake. I get that the studios probably thought ""we can't pass on the guy who wrote 'Lethal Weapon.'"" That is close to 30 years old. Wow, what a difference Black is going through. He's lost so much more when he started directing. Weird, since it seems most people figure out how to directed by writing. This movie stinks bad. Sorryit just does."

I picked up on several problems in the movie. First of all the story and plot were really confusing and really had no connection until somewhat at the end. Just a lot of running around and getting into situations that had nothing to do with the story just so we could have a joke and slapstick comedy. When you thought you might get a payoff in a scene, they chopped it up with so many cuts, the scene fell flat. I did laugh a few times when the scenes worked and we're not cut so fast for so-called action. Ryan Gosling, at times, was just silly and overdoing the gags, like he was trying too hard to be funny. Poor Russell Crowe just kind of went along on the stupid gags. The actress, who played the daughter, was the best part of the movie.

","Niiiiice job Shane Black for directing and co-scripting with inventive flair the very groovy and immensely entertaining ""The Nice Guys"". The movie is set in the 70's and stars Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as (respectively) hit- for-hire man Jackson Healy and clumsy P.I. Holland March. Circumstances that are uproarious in happenstance lead them to team up to find a missing teen named Amelia, who just might be the key to revealing more not-too-nice foul play situations. Kim Basinger co-stars as Amelia's mother who hires The Nice Guys to find Amelia before she gets lost in the clouds (with all due apologies to the late, great Amelia Earheart for that pun). ""The Nice Guys"" will be like no other movie you will see this year; its distinctive quality and magnetic unpredictability are two major reasons this movie is a very nice gem. But of course, other nice gems come in the form of Crowe and Gosling for their super nice performances; Sure the real Crowe has had his real life moments of not being too nice, but who cares, he was very nice here as Healy. And give that Gosling fellow an Oscar nomination for his uproarious performance as March, it's the Ides of March!! Hey, wasn't he in that movie?

Nice guys manage to be crime story with so much comedy and that makes this movie even better. Gosling and Crowe are perfect match and they just help each other to be even funnier. As movie goes it tries to keep you confused as what is really going on who is good and who is bad. Holland's daughter is very nicely played and has a great deal of importance in the movie as she tends to bring all best in both characters. Freedom that are actors given to make scenes in unique way is fantastic as both of them are one of the best in that job. Some things are smart enough but with overall feeling about movie you just don't care so much. Such ignorance about some things in movie and plot makes it funny and enjoyable to watch.

Young audiences that view these type of films like to emulate the characters to be popular.

","The Nice Guys is directed by Shane Black and Black co-writes the screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi. It stars Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling and Angourie Rice. Music is by John Ottman and David Buckley and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.<br/><br/>1977 Los Angeles and a private detective and a muscle for hire enforcer wind up on the same case looking for a missing girl. Can opposites really attract? More importantly, can they survive not just the perils of a case that gets murkier the longer it goes on? But also each other?<br/><br/>I don't care if Colonel Mustard did it in the study with a candlestick. I just wanna know who he did it with and get the pictures.<br/><br/>How wonderful to have had Shane Black back in his comfort zone and producing such a joyful buddy buddy neo-noir of considerable substance. It was eleven years since the superb Kiss Kiss Bang Bang had reminded us that Black had few peers when it came to blending high action macho twosomes who are also armed with sharp tongues to match, this was after all the guy who also penned Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. The idea for The Nice Guys had sat in gestation for a number of years, finally it was unleashed to reward fans of his work and for those in sync with the style of film making he homages.<br/><br/>Much like his other buddy scriptings, we are in the company of two mismatched guys. Gosling's ex-cop Holland March is a bit goofy, afraid of the sight of blood and morally bankrupt. Crowe's muscle for hire Jackson Healy beats people up for money, but he's a stand-up guy, likes his pet fish, even has a hero streak. What binds them together is troubled family baggage, that they are both men in search of a better world, to be better men themselves, and thus Black - to give them a chance of life improvement - pitches them into the seamy underbelly of the L.A. pornography industry - with some corruption elsewhere thrown into the equation.<br/><br/>As a coupling March and Healy prove to be a riot. Crowe is menacing and funny with it, Gosling is affably flaky but charm personified, and thankfully both men have a knack for visual comedy (see Gosling's Lou Costello homage and Crowe's reaction to a henchman's act of fish murder). Crucially both actors can deliver killer lines, which is an absolute must for a Shane Black inspired production, for here there is never any let up, zingers are unbound. Then there is Rice (superb and actually the third lead in the play) as March's 13 year old daughter, she's got youthful zest and a killer matter of fact skill in reacting smartly to the two men currently dominating her life.<br/><br/>The L.A. of the 70s is expertly designed, all blink blink blinkity blink neon lighting, side-burns and disco music, dubious fashions and protest groups protesting about the most mundane of things. Then you got the pornography angle, the 70s a hot-bed (no pun intended) for the sex sells profiteers, the perfect setting for Black to trawl through it all in noir clobber. As a noir piece it has it all, femme fatales, thugs, conspiracies, voice overs and an array of colourfully odd characters (excitable and troubling henchmen, a porno Pinocchio, a young lad willing to flash the contents of his underpants for cash!). And of course there's mysteries to be solved and rocks to be upturned, all of which is played out in a whirl of stylish violence, situational comedy and fluid camera work.<br/><br/>Black kind of wants it all, to stay cool whilst having wry observations on the Americana of the era, and he enjoys going close to the knuckle when he can, which to some (not me) will come off as a shock value humour tactic just to ruffle feathers. It's also a minor itch that he sort of snatches from his previous works in search of reassurance - note for instance the similarities between the opening to Lethal Weapon and here with The Nice Guys. But itches be damned, so much fun and hidden dramatic depth on show here, a real treasure that makes you wish Black would stroll down neo-noir lane a bit more often. Don't believe me? Then may Richard Nixon come after you the next time you go for a swim in the pool! 9/10"

","I could watch ""Nice Guys"" about once a year and love it each time. It's a great comedy that can get pretty dark. Russell Crowd and Ryan Gosling are hilarious and well written characters.

"lasttimeisaw","7","4","6","16 November 2016"," wackily retro and refreshingly nihilistic
","Shane Black's third feature film, after his tent-pole stint in IRON MAN 3 (2013), THE NICE GUYS returns to his home turf L.A. as in his palatable debut KISS KISS BANG BANG (2005). A retro-70s odd-pair comedy couples a stone-faced heavy Jackson Healy (Crowe, sizably ballooned in his physique, whether intentionally or otherwise) and a goofy private eye Holland March (Gosling), who are set to look for a runaway girl Amelia Kutner (Qualley), but soon discover several deaths happened to those who are connected to a porno movie made by Amelia, in defiance of her mother Judith (Basinger), a honcho in the United States Department of Justice.<br/><br/>Black is conversant with the genre ropes, apportions much physical endeavor to Healy, socking low-lives, close-range combating with pro assassins, and leaves the brain work to an ostensibly lackadaisical March, a single father perennially tailed with a premature teenage daughter Holly (Rice), who feistily teams with the duo in their children-improper outings (including a licentious party thrown by an AV producer), and coolly transforms into a dauntless heroine in the process of solving this desultory mystery. <br/><br/>Yes, the plot is half-heartedly baked, there is no need of audience to connect the dots, a timely cue always routinely pops up to keep the story rolling, no matter how far-fetched it seems (a cash- delivery mission is interleaved in a slapdash flurry without rounding off its suspicious corners), and an crucial character can be conveniently dispatched right after beans having been spilt, just because her mission is completed, or maybe because she is a gorgeous, idealistic fruitcake, doesn't deserve a happy break?<br/><br/>However, what brings home to viewers is Black's deft execution of a roller-coaster ride (almost) without brakes, under a minutely reconstructed milieu and location faithful to the ethos. Black pranks routine action shticks with unexpected but absolutely droll twists, e.g. the duo's put-on- an-impassive-face retreat in an elevator when body count is mounting thanks to a then- disembodied hit-man Johnny Boy (Bomer, in a thankless uglified villain mold), peppered with wry Nixon jokes and wacky dream scenes; he also invigorates bravado with cracking gallows humor, for instance. when they are held at gunpoint by a vixen Tally (DaCosta), like father, like daughter, Holly can be madcap on some odd occasion.<br/><br/>The Gosling-Crowe interplay stimulates pleasurable chemistry and rapport under Black's devil- may-care rein, especially Gosling, seems to have an inherent knack at comic timing, and the newcomer Angourie Rice, skillfully straddles both pockets of precociousness and greenness, altogether they form a unique two-dads-one-daughter triad (without a palpable gay context). <br/><br/>For nostalgist, THE NICE GUYS also marks a L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (1997) reunion of Crowe and Basinger (who is another Botox victim borne out of the insecurity of aging) almost two decades later, Crowe can still lead a picture with his rotund but still agile figure, while Basinger can barely find a decent role to boost her waning career. The film doesn't fare well in the box office front, which might hinder the prospect of a sequel so to speak, maybe the 70s milieu is chiefly appealing for the reminiscent and cinephile, lesser to today's Millennials core audience, also justice doesn't fully prevail in the end, and an almost nihilistic overtone doesn't enhance its popularity either."

","We had high expectations for this movie, based on the cast and on the trailers viewed. In fact, the movie was quite good until the ending, which was unnecessarily amateurish and inappropriate. The character played by Russell Crowe would not have reverted to drinking after witnessing--and scorning-- the pitiful alcohol-induced incompetence of the character played by Ryan Gosling, nor would he have partnered with him going forward. Also, the idea of having a pre-teen saying ""I need a drink!"" as the movie drives to its close is a bit of enabling that society (and the story) really doesn't need.

"dave-mcclain","8","10","21","21 May 2016"," ""The Nice Guys"" is more than just a ""nice"" way to spend a couple hours.
","I'm really excited about this one! Sometimes I'm concerned that the movies I reference in my reviews may be too old or too obscure to really help the reader understand the point I'm making, but never before have I come across a group of movies that represent the movie I'm reviewing so remarkably well, or that are so surprisingly well connected to each other! Let's look back at the fall of 1997. Just three weeks apart, two great movies came out which would both go on to receive multiple Oscar nominations and were both set in Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 20th century. ""Boogie Nights"" dramatized the porn industry in the San Fernando Valley from 1977 to 1984, as shown in the rise and fall (pun intended) of young porn actor Eddie Adams, a.k.a. ""Dirk Diggler"" (played by a rising star named Mark Wahlberg). This movie is notable for its excellent screenplay, terrific acting from a fantastic cast (which included Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy and then relative unknowns like Luis GuzmÃ¡n, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Don Cheadle) â€“ and for the film's realistic portrayal of late 70s' and early 80s' L.A. ""L.A. Confidential"" had come out three weeks earlier and painted an equally vivid and nuanced picture of the City of Angels in 1953, complete with government corruption which involved a character played by Kim Basinger. Fast forward to 2014. The Oscar-nominated ""Inherent Vice"" tells the story of a private eye (Joaquin Phoenix) who is investigating a case involving multiple missing persons in 1970 L.A. That movie was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who had also written and directed ""Boogie Nights"". The darkly comedic 2016 film ""The Nice Guys"" (R, 1:56) has a private eye looking for multiple missing persons, while uncovering connections to the porn industry AND government corruption in 1970s Los Angeles AND a character played by Kim Basinger is an important part of the plot. Boom! So, are those some really cool connections, or is it just me? Oh. Just me. Alrighty then. I'll just review the movieÂ… The title characters in ""The Nice Guys"" areÂ… kind of nice, relatively speakingÂ… when you understand that they do some not-so-nice jobs. Jackson Healy (Oscar winner Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire. He beats people up (or worse) for money, but he's relatively polite when he does it and he feels kind of bad about it. (Well, he feels that he's cut out for more than, say, roughing up a guy whose messing around with a client's teenage daughter, and he wishes that he were doing something different.) Holland March (past Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling) is a private eye who seems to make most of his money half-heartedly investigating far-fetched missing persons claims by little old ladies. He's very polite in dealing with his clients and he's sorta smart, but he's not as tough or skilled as he acts, and he has a real problem with pain and with the sight of blood â€“ especially his own. Regardless, Holland makes a good living and takes good care (financially, if not emotionally) of his teenage daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). Holly is smarter, tougher... and nicer than Holland, whom she reluctantly ""parents"" better than he parents her.<br/><br/>Holland is simultaneously investigating an alleged sighting of a porn star named Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) â€“ two days after she was supposedly killed in a car accident â€“ while also looking for an even younger woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who is a protest organizer, who may have appeared in ""an experimental film"" with Misty Mountains, and who definitely does NOT want to be found. Jackson, on the other hand, has been hired by Amelia to get this PI named Holland March off her trail. This situation leads to an inauspicious first meeting between Jackson and Holland, followed by an auspicious second meeting when they decide to join forces and use their respective talents to find out what's actually going on. You see, Holland has recently received an unwelcomed visit from a couple of thugs (Beau Knapp and Keith David) who demand to know where Amelia is, and then people who are connected to Amelia and/or Missy start dropping dead at an unnatural rate. Our titular ""nice guys"" eventually meet a Justice Department employee (Kim Basinger, an Oscar winner for ""L.A. Confidential"") who hires the pair to find Amelia, just as they discover that a Mafioso (Matt Bomer) from New York is in L.A. looking for them â€“ and he ain't interested in talking. With Holly forcing her way into the equation to help her dad and his new partner, it's a race against time to find Amelia and figure out who's killing her acquaintances (and why) before those really not-so-nice guys catch up with the two relatively nice guys.<br/><br/>""The Nice Guys"" is a quirky, darkly comedic and intriguing whodunit. The script, by Shane Black (who also wrote ""Iron Man 3"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"", ""The Last Boy Scout"" and the original ""Lethal Weapon"") and newcomer Anthony Bagarozzi, is intricate, but not hard to follow, and contains smart and very funny dialog and situations (including great tie-ins to TV's ""The Waltons"" and President Richard Nixon), plus a mystery that's engaging but suffers from an awkward final resolution which feels forced. Besides co-writing, Black (who also directed ""Iron Man 3"") directs this film with a good feel for pace, tension and comic timing, while his very talented cast (especially Gosling, Crowe and Rice) really brings it all together. While similar in content to those other three films mentioned earlier, this one is closest in tone and style to ""Inherent Vice"", but is more accessible and less flawed. ""The Nice Guys"" is more than just a ""nice"" way to spend a couple hours â€“ it's a pretty damn entertaining one. ""A-"""

Unfortunately, what starts as a drama set in Los Angels in the late 70s, soon turns into a weird mix of Boogie Nights and Taxi Driver, minus the darkness of those two movies - but missing also their greatness.<br/><br/>Gosling's young daughter gets mixed in the plot and proves to be way smarter than her father (not difficult) and very annoying. A sort of re-take of the Foster character in Taxi Driver, minus the prostitution. The group starts investigating the porn industry territory, but the plot meanders into other territories such as politics and pollution, without making much sense in any.<br/><br/>Not a total disaster, but it tries too hard to be ""cool"" and it is not very funny, which is sort of the kiss of death for a comedy.

I didn't get my first laugh until the middle, and there were only a couple after that. It does get more exciting towards the end with better jokes.

I'm writing this post to tell you that I was right. It was awesome!<br/><br/>Now I did admit earlier that I see all Ryan Gosling films, but let me be clear, that is not the only reason I saw this film.

Holland March (Gosling) to learn the truth behind the death of the famous porn star, Misty Mountains. The case is made more complicated by March's precocious daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) and the realization that the government is involved in a cover-up and it all comes down to finding a young girl, Amelia.<br/><br/>It's Lethal Weapon meets The Man From UNCLE meets Miami VIce meets That 70's Show meets its own unique style.<br/><br/>It is obvious that Crowe is the action and Gosling is the comedy, but that does not mean they switch roles every once in awhile. It is a screwball comedy about two guys that really don't know what they're doing, and yet, cannot seem to stop. They keep tripping over clues and colliding into bad guys until they finally figure it all out.<br/><br/>Admittedly there are some slow parts, I was hoping it would be consistently funny (like The Man From UNCLE remake), but it lagged in places. However, in terms of the comedy and overall enjoyment of the film I'd still give it an A (just perhaps on the lower end of the scale).<br/><br/>What makes this film so funny is that during the parts that didn't lag, it was non-stop/back-to- back/can't-catch-your-breath funny. It's all about the little things. Such as March's drunkenness falling down a hill and stumbling onto a dead body, or March chasing after a bad guy only to smack into a car door that pushes him into another car hood that makes him trip onto the bad guy. The police work is a gamble and the violence is more lucky shots.<br/><br/>For example: March and Healy are held at gunpoint by a ""bad guy"" (I'm avoiding spoilers), so March's daughter comes in and pours the coffee pot onto the ""bad guy"". Nothing happens, because Holly thought it would be hot coffee, but it had been sitting there for a while. Next the ""bad guy"" goes to take a step toward March and Healy only to trip on the cold coffee spill around their feet and fall, knocking themselves out.<br/><br/>Somehow everything works out in their favor. Even though it is completely ridiculous you can't help but love it, because the film makes no apologizes and gives fair warning that it is ridiculous. That's part of its charm."

","This film is absolute trash. I don't know where to begin in explaining how awful this movie is. Maybe with the opening scene with a child viewing pornography, while his father was passed out drunk. This seems to be a theme in the film, with Ryan Gosling's character too busy drinking himself into oblivion to realize his own daughter is at a party watching more porn herself. I'm not sure why the film makers insisted on this theme of minors and porn but it is frankly disturbing. There is no comedic value and a disgrace. I wasn't surprised when people, including myself walked out of the film. Don't waste your money on this, you will regret it.<br/><br/>Aside from this content, the film lacks in comedy with all of the laughable scenes already in the trailer. Everything else is just filler. Gosling plays a complete idiot, who we're supposed to feel sorry for. Maybe the audience could give a damn about him as a single dad raising his daughter alone if he wasn't too busy day drinking and putting her in harms way every other scene.

","One of those films so aswim in the culture of porn that you wonder why....oh yes, there's that, the seeming limitless appetite of Hollywood for pure, unadulterated trash with a heavily misogynistic overtone. Maybe the word should be undertow. Everything that passes for a plot is mere window-dressing, what sustains this awful effort is the lurid atmosphere. And there is one disturbing element that is so prominent it can't be an accident. The children in this film, appearing in very disturbing scenes - it's downright degenerate. ""Boogie Nights"" used banal acting and a tired plot to mimic the feel of porn films. So it could claim (a lame claim) to be a parody, although its moral emptiness was so close to the real thing it might as well have been the real thing. ""The Nice Guys"" has something of the same feel. The exploitation of women and young girls, dumb scenes (hundreds of rounds shot, no one hit), cheesy music, how really different it is from the junk the porn industry turns out - except for two A-list actors?"

When the duo is searching for names or places, they just happen to stumble on them (mostly while driving). Towards the end of the film, a car accident forces their briefcase to open and unveils the fake money. All these are plain luck, but sure as hell aren't genius plot development. (Lest we forget, the dream sequence that leads to the accident, with objects talking to Ryan, is a gigantic clichÃ©) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Small segments of random scenes may seem relatively funny when secluded from the context of the movie. Take these segments and multiply them by 4 and you have a full scene which is not funny anymore. They just didn't know when to stop. Gosling is another victim of this practice. He obviously has comedic talent, but is constantly overdoing it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Didn't like the pacing either. While I was waiting for the story to make some sense, the film unexpectedly slowed down a couple of times. During these parts, even the acting became subdued, causing coherence problems. ""Not quite my tempo"" </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A little kid behaves like a clever adult. How original! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Talking about buddy comedies, even Rush Hour had a huge asset, and I'm talking about the great chemistry between the protagonists. Gosling- Crowe? Not so much. Well, to be honest... not at all! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The two main characters can be dumb. But they can be clever too. Depends on the scene. Wait... What?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""How long has he been missing?"" ""Since the funeral."" Hands down hilarious. NOT!</li></ul>"
"CinePendejo","8","10","22","21 May 2016"," Shane Black is back baybee!!!
","Can we just stop for a moment and thank the all-that-is-cool demigod Shane Black? Seriously, he wrote the scripts of some of the classic action movies like Last Action Hero, The Last Boy Scout, and the iconic Lethal Weapon trilogy, which encapsulates a whole generation of masculine action movies. Utilizing this experience he built throughout those movies, he went to direct his action parody debut, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a film claimed by many to be his masterpiece. Though many might be write him off as yet another cynical action director based around scummy a-holes doing scummy a-hole stuff, I believe that these films hold some deeper context; outside of delivering action comedy chops, what really makes Black stand out is the way he observes and deconstructs his main leads and the environment around him. The way Tony Stark deals with his insignificance and anxiety in the Avengers universe in Iron Man 3, Lockhart and his position as a thief in KKBB, the whole works. <br/><br/>His endeavor this time, in his latest The Nice Guys, he examines two passÃ©, hot-tempered detectives unable to cope with the new generation, all while delivering the most brutally hilarious and endearing buddy cop movie any buddy cop movie can ever transcend to. <br/><br/>To what amounts to a mixture of Lethal Weapon and Inherent Vice, it centers around a single father and licensed PI Holland March (Ryan Gosling), who is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. Among this search, he comes to terms with an unlicensed and unmerciful detective Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, it all gets worse when Misty, who reveals to be an anti-pollution activist named Amelia, vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only party interested. As both men are forced to team up, they'll have to take on a world filled with eccentric mobsters, exotic 70s-style strippers, and a possible government conspiracy.<br/><br/>One of the things that fascinates me about this move is that amidst all the shootings and trashy humor, there is quite a fascinating subtext about a new coming generation overlying the old. These two cops, along with most of the other characters, represents the retrograde, no-nonsense police enforcers now out of their depth with the new generation. At the heart of this subtext and what ultimately brings some unexpected heart to the film is Angourie Rice as the young daughter of March Holly. Having to deal with the hardships and goon mix-ups the same level as her father, she still endures to be tough and capable in her own right and restrain herself and others from going over their limits. Of all the themes I came to expect from this movie, the implication of a younger generation could stand more superior to the wide array of brutes, dirty strippers, trigger-happy criminals, or even police officials honestly passed my radar.<br/><br/>But enough of that pretentious baloney! What you'll likely get from this movie is a plethora of slapstick humor, gun-toting action, and hilarious banter from the two main leads who might as well be called Abbot and Costello with a lot more balls! Crowe, as expected, is a blast to watch, portraying a husky, no-BS private eye who kicks all sorts of ass but also manages to bring some humanity near the end. But the big surprise is Ryan Gosling, bringing an unexpected Buster Keaton-type humor character. Of all of what I usually expect from a Ryan Gosling role (from romantic main lead to un ironic main leads) his turn as sort of a fun and ironic role is instantly his most memorable. <br/><br/>However, for all that goodwill, I still struggle to call this film on par with KKBB. The reason lies strictly in design; KKBB is essentially a parody of these types of buddy cop movies that constantly breaks the fourth wall and pulls the rug from your feet with every twist out of the conventional story beats. This movie, though, sticks to be fairly predictable. It still works as is, and thankfully the movie stays far away from several clichÃ©s, but for the most part, anyone paying attention might catch up with about 40 minutes ahead at most. It is definitely not a deal breaker, but a compromise definitely from true greatness. <br/><br/>Minor issues aside, it's pretty awesome! The jokes are funny, the dirty stuff are really dirty, the character moments are engaging, the old-fashioned and exotic 70s setting feels lived in and compelling, and Shane Black remains the best at directing intense action. Definitely a would-be classic!<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","In 1977, a self proclaimed ""fixer"" Mr Healy (Russell Crowe) and a private detective Mr. March (Ryan Gosling) team up to locate Amelia (Margaret Qualley) who may hold the key to all the murders and what the Hippie demonstrations are really all about. They are helped, at times, by March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). <br/><br/>One thing becomes absolutely clear: Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling should never do comedy or not do comedy with a lame script such as this. Their banter doesn't go anywhere, there are no good lines, nothing is funny and the sight gags fail too. Aside from all that the acting is okay, but what's the point when everything else fails? We couldn't wait for this to be over. <br/><br/>Another thing and this is disheartening is when we have children mouthing F-bombs as we see Holly do. What are we coming to? Huh?<br/><br/>This movie gets dragged out overly long with aimless running around forÂ…Â…..oh, for clues and a big shoot'em up near the end with a couple fight scenes that could have used Jackie Chan's choreographers. <br/><br/>Notable: Kim Bassinger, Amelia's mother, who is also in charge of the Department of Justice. <br/><br/>A monstrously forgettable movie and our hope is that Crowe and Gosling go back to drama where they belong and where we also hear some good lines from time to time.

Both Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling handled all their given materials perfectly. Angourie Rice also did an excellent job portraying Ryan Gosling's character daughter who snoops around her dad's job. She didn't overtake the two main characters, but she also got a chance to shine. <br/><br/>There are multiple laugh out loud moments and some decent action portrayed (and some nudity), and the movie managed to also score a nice emotional touch to the characters. There may have been some played out tropes and old movie tricks, but with clever dialogues and top-notch delivery, you wouldn't mind getting past through all of it and have some genuine, tear-inducing laughs.<br/><br/>Definitely one of an excellent buddy cop movie to watch."

"Sandcooler","9","7","14","13 June 2016"," Great sleazy atmosphere, great writing too
","""The Nice Guys"" has some trouble finding its footing in the earlier scenes, but it becomes incredibly entertaining once it goes completely off the rails. When your story is about two shady characters trying to solve the murder of a porn star in the 1970s, I want everything in the movie to be ugly and slightly disturbing. Shane Black (of ""Lethal Weapon"" fame) has certainly managed that, particularly the current Russell Crowe is just perfect for a role like this. The plot is also slightly more interesting and unpredictable than in an average action movie, this movie has enough unexpected deaths to make you genuinely worry about the protagonists. Particularly for Angourie Rice, who just steals every scene she's in. The thing I loved most though is the incredibly dark comedy Black puts in throughout. It's not forced, it's not shocking for the sake of being shocking, it's just there because it's funny and it fits the rest of the movie so well. ""The Nice Guys"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, infinitely rewatchable."
"patsworld","9","7","14","9 June 2016"," There HAS To Be A Sequel
",".and not only that, but if they're smart, they'd be filming it already. Plenty of violence, lots of laughter and excellent chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. I'll tell you, I'm not really a Russell Crowe fan, but he was perfect for this role. I heard people, as they were leaving, saying things about hoping there'd be another one with The Nice Guys before too long. Personally I think there is going to be a market for a series of them. It was that good. The daughter, Holly, played by Angourie Rice, was a tad on the precocious side but in the grand scheme of things, it worked rather well. This is reminiscent of good detective films from the past with a modern slant and these tough detectives, with their history and issues are sheer entertainment. Crowe showing a vicious side as well as a tender side is the epitome of the tough cop-type and Gosling, trying to be father, find another drink and still earn money detecting is a hoot. Bring on another one. And soon!"
"cahill-64801","8","5","9","25 May 2016"," Very Easy to Watch
","I went into this movie with honestly no idea as to how it was going to turn out. It was nice to see Russell Crowe starring in something different and I thought his pairing with Ryan Gosling could potentially create a solid comedic combo. All in all I thought the movie delivered well enough. It is definitely funny throughout, with no shortage of jokes to Ryan Gosling's expense or humorous scenarios in the film. The movie itself does not try too hard to be a comedy, but rather toes the line being decently funny while staying true to being an action/adventure flick. The movie flows nicely and is consistently entertaining. No scenes are really painful to sit through or necessarily dry. Overall my expectations were met and I definitely feel that I got my money's worth. Russell Crowe's performance is enjoyable to watch, as he effectively delivers a character that is likable and empathetic, while maintaining himself as the muscle of the duo. If you're going to go to the theaters soon this movie won't let you down."
"garethajones","1","12","28","4 June 2016"," Ugly, brutal, nasty film, one of the worst I've ever suffered
","Having read the reviews about this being a light-hearted comedy I suffered twenty minutes of one of the most unpleasant brutal nasty films I've ever seen before leaving the cinema and getting a refund in the grounds of the film being so different from the reviews it almost breached the trades descriptions act! I should have realised that a film nowadays with Russell Crowe is risky (whatever happened to the excellent actor we saw in Gladiator? He's now a fat, lazy inarticulate slob!). This is the first time I've been to a cinema for a while and the constant eating and phone watching of the other patrons again reminded me why a large screen HD TV and Netflix subscription at home are now essential parts of modern life.<br/><br/>With films like The Nice Guys I could then stop watching at no cost or hassle.. I'm sure the hipsters and teenagers will love it, I certainly didn't. I wish I could give it minus 5 stars but that's not possible unfortunately!"
"ipacac22","3","8","17","6 November 2016"," A dud
","I'll preface this by saying that I like Crowe and Gosling's other work. This however was not worthy of their efforts. Shane black is normally a good writer but this fell flat for me. I admit that I did laugh a few times but the rest of the time I found myself scratching my head at the nonsensical plot. Nothing really made sense and there was no cohesiveness to any of the scenes. They all just seemed to run together with no sign of editing or pace. The 13 year old daughter was shoehorned into nearly every scene and made the movie almost unbearable given her character's inconsistency in certain scenes. When I watch a movie I require two things; to be entertained and to care about the characters. Both of these criteria were not met. Spend your two hours doing something else folks."
"SexyBeaver","9","8","17","19 May 2016"," ""Look on the bright side. Nobody got hurt."" - Hilarious and visually authentic!
","The talented Shane Black brings us back several decades with a very unique but authentic looking film. <br/><br/>His latest flick - The Nice Guys - looks like it could have been released in the 70's, just with upgraded visuals. This along with a swinging soundtrack makes both my eyes and ears happy. :)<br/><br/>More-so, I had a blast! I think it's the first time I laughed this much in a theater and it's a film I didn't expect this much humor from, honestly. Shane Black's glorious writing/directing along with Ryan Gosling's perfect execution made for HILARIOUS laugh out loud moments. However, Ryan wasn't the only one standing out in this flick, Russel Crowe and Angourie Rice were just as awesome. Others like Keith David and Beau Knapp with relatively 'smaller' roles packed quite a punch too. But still, these are accomplished actors while on the other side it was the first time I ever heard about Angourie Rice whom felt very mature and talented for her age. She kicked ass as Holly March (literally)! <br/><br/>The young miss Rice is someone we should be on the lookout for, I am sure we will be seeing more of her in the near future.<br/><br/>Mr. Black certainly succeeded in bringing us a fresh buddy film and I very much recommend The Nice Guys!

"bankofmarquis","7","11","26","20 May 2016"," More action and drama than comedy
","Shane Black's new film THE NICE GUYS is being billed as an ""ACTION/COMEDY"" and I think this is a mistake. When I think ""ACTION/COMEDY"" I think more of things like the Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg film THE OTHER GUYS or the upcoming Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart flick CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE. Basically, a comedy with action in it. THE NICE GUYS is a atmospheric period piece that blends drama, action and comedy. It is much more nuanced than the average ""action/comedy"" and, for the most part, succeeds in this nuance.<br/><br/>Set in 1977, THE NICE GUYS pairs Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as they investigate a disappearance in Los Angeles. The more they dig into the case, the more the bodies pile up and the deeper the conspiracy goes.<br/><br/>The key to a film like this is the chemistry between the two leads and I am happy to report that Gosling and Crowe have pretty good chemistry with each other. While I thought Gosling was trying a bit too hard in the comedy areas (he managed the balance of comedy and drama better in THE BIG SHORT), the surprise to me was how easy the comedy parts seemed to come to Crowe while the dramatic parts showed off that he still has strong acting ""chops"".<br/><br/>Ultimately, where this film falls short for me is in the direction by Shane Black (the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and the overrated Iron Man 3). He has the ""70's vibe down, no doubt about it. Where this film falters is it's continual shift of tone. Is it a comedy? Is it a serious action film? Is it a farce? Is it a drama? All of these elements are thrown onto the screen so it takes about 2/3 of the film to settle into what type of film it is - which I would call a dramatic action film with comedic overtones. And, by the way, there are 2 comedic moments in this movie that created huge, sincere belly laughs from me - I would argue that both of those moments are worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Go for those moments, but stay for the friendship of Gosling and Crowe. You'll be entertained.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
"jcjs333","3","6","12","2 September 2016"," a drag
","I imagine this was liked because the stars are so wonderful in other movies they've done and we're supposed to feel an allegiance to them even though the writing is poor, the plot is ludicrous and , for me , there's no laugh and the thing drags along with a forceful attempt to make it interesting which it is not. There are so many actors who could have made this funny , perhaps. Crowe almost pulls it off. I find it hard to write enough words for this review because the show is so lame i'm speechless and can't lay enough words out there. I'm mystified why so many like it including all the sites where critics are grading it. Someone in these reviews said maybe there should be a rating added including age groups and that is interesting but i don't know if the younger group or older group would like this. I think the younger group would like this more than the older group. Maybe the younger group is 'catching' something the older group isn't getting or the generations have a vast different sense of humor. But, i think there are universal appeals. Grand Budapest Hotel, Royal Tenebaums, The Big Lebowski, 'Knocked Up' and a zillion other films have around the same ranking at 'The Nice Guys'. This is simply crazy to me. As i watching this i kept thinking maybe there's something i'm not getting, something wrong with me, maybe i'm in a bad mood and i tried to make myself like it. Just this kind of behavior in myself , now , let's me know this show plane isn't good. I come back, again, to that folks just want to have an allegiance to the actors. Most other shows these guys do are great but i think they should stay away from comedy or get better writing and directing."

","The Nice Guys was a very entertaining movie that delivered amazing acting as well as story telling. The directing, by Shane Black, was not only precise but also pleasing to the eye. The production of the film was amazing as well as the soundtrack. Watching the film really gives you a taste of what it was like in 70's in Las Angeles. Actors Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe complimented each other well and the duo hit comedy as well as the complications of partnership spot on. Ryan Gosling was able to portray the character of a humorous yet serious character with internal issues and Russel Crowe undoubtedly didn't fail to deliver his tough but soft guy vibe. The film is entertaining from start to finish and definitely satisfied every great film desire."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","6","12","21 May 2016"," I Had An Awesome Time Watching The Nice Guys. Go See This Movie
","I love the summer blockbuster season. I enjoy smaller films but it's usually the late spring to early fall where I end up going to the theatre 3-4 times a month. People like to criticize those movies as immature and juvenile. But I like watching franchises and sequels and I won't apologize for it. So while I like the big films, it's movies like The Nice Guys that remind me how important original properties can be.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The Nice Guys is set in Los Angeles in 1977. We watch a scene where a young boy sneaks into his parents' bedroom to sneak a peek at his dad's porno stash. After he gets away, we see a car drive off the large hill behind the house and crash right into the house below. The boy is unharmed and goes out to investigate the wreck. Coincidentally, the passenger in the car is the same porn star (Misty Mountains) that the boy was looking at in the magazine. She lies there half naked and unfortunately dies. The boy covers her up and we hear sirens in the distance.<br/><br/>We then meet The Nice Guys. First is Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) who is a thug for hire but not in a mafia capacity. You need to send a violent message to someone, slip him some money and he'll greet the guy with his fists and a pair of brass knuckles. Jackson doesn't seem evil however, more world-weary and cynical. He's still getting over his divorce and wants some purpose to his life. He meets his next client Amelia (Margaret Qualley) who gives him the name Holland March and his address. She claims that he's been following/stalking her. Jackson agrees to take the job and they part company.<br/><br/>Our other ""hero"" is Holland March (Ryan Gosling). We see him wake up in a bathtub full of water, fully clothed in a suit. There is an answering machine right beside the tub with a message from his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) that he's supposed to be working and that since it's her birthday. March tells us about how slimy his job as a P.I. is, how he's a drunk and that he's dealing with the death of his wife. March does not appear to be sympathetic, we see him take a job at a nursing home from a concerned old lady looking for her missing husband when he's being kept in an urn on her mantle. We also see he's a bit of a klutz, he's been hired to look for Amelia and he tries to break into a bar after hours. He accidentally cuts his wrist however and ends up in the hospital instead.<br/><br/>These two professionals collide at March's house when Healy shows up to deliver Amelia's message. Jackson beats Holland up and seems content to leave but March keeps trying to reach for his gun. This leads Jackson to break his arm just to make sure it sinks in. Jackson thinks his work is done but when he returns to his apartment, two goons (Keith David and Beau Knapp) beat him up, demanding to know where Amelia is.<br/><br/>The first thing I want to say about this movie is that it looks cool. It's a period piece set in the 1970s and it seemed to be very period accurate. I liked the wardrobe, the vehicles and the set design, everything looked great. Add in some great 1970s music for the soundtrack (including Earth Wind and Fire) and you get to travel back in time to the 1970s. I thought the movie nailed that aspect and showed the attention to detail with embracing the funky atmosphere of that time period. I know The Nice Guys wasn't made for pennies but it was nice to see such a great looking film that didn't need 200 million to do it.<br/><br/>So if you talk to film buff, you'll likely learn that the director of this movie is Shane Black who was a pioneer in the action/buddy comedy genre. It's not surprising that he was involved in the writing and he directed the movie because the dialogue and action are both top notch. There are so many funny jokes in here I wasn't just laughing once or twice for every 20 min but consistently throughout. The action was also pretty gritty and brutal. You wince with every blow and they even found a way to intertwine the comedy into it making for some funny gags. You get the feeling that there was a really good team behind this and looking at the credits, there sure was.<br/><br/>At the same time, they didn't just rely on the material because they have 2 leads who pull their characters off effortlessly. Russell Crowe is the less animated of the two, he's more the straight man. But he gets more than his share of moments, he fits into the tone of this movie really well and he brings a great balance of his action man persona with some decent comic timing. Ryan Gosling really shows how versatile he can be in this movie. He does a lot of physical comedy here and he pulls it off completely. He's hilarious and his chemistry with Crowe is excellent. I also wanted to single out Angourie, she has a great character to play but she holds her own against two A list stars. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Matt Bomer, Keith David, Yaya DaCosta are all good.<br/><br/>I really thought this movie was a treat to see. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. The Nice Guys is really funny throughout, the action packs a punch, the cast give some great performances and the story was both interesting and involving. I really hope people get out to see this, we could use more movies like it. Especially if they're made with this level of expertise."

They are bombarded by a short wizard with his magical Beanie and his sidekick Barbishia. They then 'hid in the closet' for an entire ten minutes without coming out. The rest of the film was just insane, if you thought that was weird! Then a bunch tiny men carried the main alien on their knees serenading her, after flopping their hands calling for their Mama Bird for food. After the Mama Bird arrives, she feeds her little men feathers of the mother-ship, and engulfs the little men. The wizard then professes his love to the beautiful Tomethia and performs a mating dance while everyone watches. (I know-I wish they did mating dances today, right? So fetch) The finale is the Mama Bird giving birth to a new batch of little men, the end. Crazy, right? What is the plot to this movie?

I honesty try to imagine what was going on: a group of people - the director, main actors, writers, producers sitting at a large table in some conference room, looking over the script, joking with each other, asking how are we gonna do this that and the other, and then slapping each other on the back and saying ""this is gonna be great!"". I imagine its something like that. Then, after all the shoots are done, editing and sound, they sit in a cozy and luxurious little screening room with big leather seats and couches and view their product. Of course its not funny, interesting, compelling. Its a dog turd. Expect nobody is gonna say it. All the ""yes men"" are gonna blow smoke up everyone's ass and say how great it is and that its gonna make millions. Of course, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling aren't there. They've done their job, their bank accounts have been credited the millions they contracted for, and they're onto their next project or sitting on a beach somewhere, a private beach, sipping some fancy drink with a little umbrella in it. And they're laughing. Laughing because they themselves know this was a crapfest of a movie. Sure they did their best acting, these guys always do. They're professionals and they're good. However, when you have a collaborative venture, you're only as strong as the weakest link. And the chain breaks apart with the director and the writers. You can read all the other reviews that give their technical reasons why the movie was bad. I'm in agreement. It wasn't funny. Mixing sexual situations with children is borderline criminal here, and the story was convoluted, muddy, and strange. I only lasted until the one clown that had the dye pack explode on his face was killed and the young girl then holds his hand. I'm only writing that so as to let you know I did watch this. Up until that point. Then I cut my losses and wandered off. Such a waste of Crowe and Gosling's talents. My advice - if you want to have fun and be entertained, go eat an apple. Way more fun and entertaining than this garbage movie. And its healthy for you too."

","After gifting us the original team up of Riggs and Murtaugh in 1987's Lethal Weapon (as screenwriter) and combining the services of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer in the fantastic 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (as writer and director), Iron Man 3 director Shane Black has now added the successful team up of one time pin up boy Ryan Gosling and the increasingly gruff Russell Crowe to his resume in the fun, colourful and Coen Brothers like The Nice Guys.<br/><br/>A 70's set dark comedy with inklings of a pulp like detective tale that involves everything from pornographic actresses, blue faced goons, talking bees and Ryan Gosling on a toilet, The Nice Guys weaves a quite complicated tale of mysteries, murders and questionable investigating work into a film that at its core often fly's and sometimes fails off the back of Shane Black's witty scripting work, the fantastic use of the 70's landscape and most importantly, the winning combination of the inventive pairing of Crowe and Gosling.<br/><br/>Clearly relishing the opportunity to play each other's foils, Gosling and Crowe are the best they've been in years here and while Gosling has shown his comedic chops in films like The Big Short and Crazy, Stupid, Love, Black un-tap's a fun side to Crowe we haven't really seen before even though some could claim ventures like The Good Year and Mystery, Alaska tried to show off a lighter side to the phone throwing adopted Australian. The Nice Guys is Crowe's best work in sometime and it's likely his future roles will try to harness his lighter persona that works so well here, even though Gosling steals most of the films best singular moments.<br/><br/>Speaking of stealing, young Australian actress Angourie Rice who was first seen in the worth checking out These Final Hours makes a huge impact to The Nice Guys fortunes with a fantastically judged turn as the wise beyond her years daughter of Gosling's often bumbling Holland March, Holly, and considering it's no mean feat to outplay two Hollywood heavyweights, Rice could well be ""the next big thing"".<br/><br/>A sharp, fun and engaging mixture of comedy and mystery with a healthy dosage of violence, The Nice Guys isn't ground-breaking stuff and some of the potential jokes within the film sadly fall flat but as whole this energetic and colourful vehicle driven by Black's wit, Gosling and Crowe's fine pairing and Rice's star making turn, this is easily one of the year's easiest to like cinematic diversions.<br/><br/>3 ½ swimming Nixon's out of 5"

","The Nice Guys is genius. It's Lethal Weapon meets The Big Lebowski. In ten years time, this film will be just as quotable as those films. This is a buddy-cop movie in prime form. Gosling and Crowe, it goes without saying, have the best chemistry a film director could ever ask for. The screenplay is so well written. The mystery really takes you for a ride. The jokes all land solidly. By far it's biggest strength is the work put into it as a period piece. It looks amazing. Not even American Hustle replicated the 70's as seamlessly as this. Every last detail and fabric is perfect. I look forward to seeing it again, and again.. and maybe again after that."
"paul-allaer","8","7","15","21 May 2016"," Pleasant 70s-era crime caper: Angourie Rice steals the movie
","""The Nice Guys"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a couple of private eyes looking for a missing girl. As the movie opens (to the tune of ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone""), we are reminded that it is ""Los Angeles, California, 1977"". Before we know what hit us, a car comes flying around the corner, crashing into a house and killing its driver, whom we later learn is Misty Mountains, an adult film star. We the get introduced to Holland March, a private eye who is down on his luck, and separately also to Jackson Healy, the guy you call on ""to bring a message"". It's not long before Healy is hired to ""bring a message"" to March. At that point we're a good 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Shane Black, who previously brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, among many others. Here Black takes us back to the golden era of police and private eyes dramas and film noir, but with a never missing smile (or is that smirk) on his face. Second, don't worry about the insanely complicated story line, in which I got lost in no time. Instead, enjoy this movie for the many outstanding performances: Ryan Gosling (as March) brings comedy to the screen like I've never seen him do before (the 'bathroom' scene is destined to become a classic). Russell Crowe (as Healy) plays it rough and gruff, the perfect counterpart to Gosling's role (the ying and the yang), so in that respect, this is a great ""buddy"" movie. But with all due respect to Gosling and Crowe, the movie is stolen by newcomer Angourie Rice, who plays Merch's 13 yr. old daughter Holly. She seems like is was born to play in movies, that's how natural she comes across. Surely this is only the beginning of a long career for this young lady. Kudos also to the set designers, who did an outstanding job recreating what 1977 looked like (the ""Jaws 2"" poster, Tower Records, etc. ), And last but not least, there is an overabundance of outstanding music from that era featured throughout the movie, from the opening sounds of The Temptations' ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" to when Al Green's outstanding ""Love and Happiness"" plays over the movie's end credits.<br/><br/>The movie opened nationwide this weekend. Having seen the trailer a number of times, I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but nowhere close to sold out). If you are in the mood for a 70s-era crime and buddy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Nice Guys"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","Something was seriously off with the plot of this movie. First Crowe seems like a savvy detective and then he hires bumbling detective Gosling to find a woman for some reason not entirely clear to the audience. Why a detective should hire another detective to work for him is beyond me and I can think of other ways the script could have brought these two together into this really stupid buddy movie. Then the dynamic shifts where Gosling seems to be the smart one and Crowe is depending on him to find this woman who might or might not be a porn star. I'm having a difficult time writing this, as you can tell. If my synopsis appears confusing well, that's how I felt in the movie. I still feel weirdly unsure about what role each of them played.<br/><br/>I did not find the funny scenes funny. To me they were forced and a little pathetic. Apologies to Crowe and Gosling, I loved you both in just about everything else you've done.<br/><br/>There were three scenes (before I left the theater) that contained children talking about or being exposed to very adult sexual content that crossed the line into inappropriate.<br/><br/>1979 came off strange to me and not entirely right. Sometimes it looked like the 80's and sometimes a bit like the 60's. Maybe that was just me. I was also a little distracted by the couple sitting behind me talking all throughout the movie. Do I shush them? Report them to theater management? Or just walk out? Well, since the movie sucked..."
"subxerogravity","8","8","18","23 May 2016"," A Nice one!
","It's a great action comedy by from Shane Black!<br/><br/>It's very very similar to Kiss Kiss bang Bang! so if you like that movie, this is a slam dunk no brainer. <br/><br/>It's a classic buddy buddy cop film that Black practically created. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling made an excellent comedy duo. Crowe playing the straight man, A tough guy who gets paid to beat people up. Gosling does most of the slap stick, as a private dick trying to balance work and rising his daughter, but doing a half as job at both. Together they are on the trail of a girl in the porn game who got some high rollers looking to do her it.<br/><br/>Both Crowe and Gosling where in good form and had good chemistry. And most important it was absolutely hilarious."
"datemaru","9","8","18","22 May 2016"," It Was What I Thought It Would Be and Was What I Wanted It To Be
","I have to say from the trailer I was hoping for a movie that was fun, full of action, funny, and has good dialogue.<br/><br/>This movie was exactly what the trailer promised me.<br/><br/>I'll try not to spoil the movie, but I'm checking it just in case and read at your own risk.<br/><br/>It almost seems odd that Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have never worked together before because they were really good together. Gosling plays Holland March, an alcoholic cynical private investigator, and Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a thug for hire.<br/><br/>We don't seem to know much about these characters pasts, but Healy seems driven by a desire to do good and help people. He is far from idealistic though, he's very subdued throughout the movie like life has dragged him to the edge of hopelessness. March, well it's not clear if his wife is dead or they're not together anymore, but he is a cynic and pretty much a loser with a 13 year old daughter who takes care of him and while she loves him, also is hugely frustrated by him.<br/><br/>Both men find themselves involved with a girl named Amelia, March is looking for her because she's connected to a missing person case he's working and Healy is hired by her for protection before disappearing.<br/><br/>This however only proves to be the beginning as the two men find themselves working together, Healy because the mob trashed his home looking for Amelia and March because he needs the money.<br/><br/>All the actors do a great job from Gosling playing a loser drunk who is surprisingly sharp at times to Crowe playing a thug who wants to help a girl who wanted to be safe to Angourie Rice playing Holly the daughter. I'm also impressed by Matt Bomer who plays a hit-man named John Boy. I'm used to Bomer playing Niel Caffrey on White Collar. He doesn't get a lot of speaking lines, but the few he had he seemed charming at first, but something was off in an unnerving way. It was well acted.<br/><br/>This movie also does not shy away from violent or language and I haven't seen this many breasts in a movie in a while, though that might be because I haven't seen an R rated movie that interested me in a while. It is not a kid friendly movie at all... though I would soon recommend taking your kids to this than Angry Birds.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you liked the trailer you'll enjoy this movie and there is a lot more that I haven't mentioned. Shane Black has made a movie he should be very proud of and frankly I hope to see a sequel some day."
"rick-j-walsh","10","8","18","21 May 2016"," Wickedly funny and wonderfully profane
","Shane Black's The Nice Guys is a thoroughly entertaining, retro 1970s buddy-action-crime romp that brings to mind a cross between his previous works (such as Lethal Weapon and Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang) and the blackest absurd humor of the Coen brothers (The Big Lebowski). The buddies here are an absurdly bumbling private eye, his far-more- intelligent (though also somewhat bumbling) 13-year-old daughter, and a gruff, disgruntled enforcer (who sends physical messages to people doing things they shouldn't be doing). They are grudgingly drawn together to solve a far- flung conspiracy involving mysterious deaths, porno films, Detroit automakers, the Justice Department, and The Waltons. The chemistry of the trio — played to perfection by Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, and Russell Crowe — is a delight to behold. Sincerely hope this is the start of a franchise."
"ThomasDrufke","9","8","18","20 May 2016"," Bring on Sequels
","I don't know how much broad appeal a period piece that's structured around an adult film industry crime has, but you'll have a hard time not getting behind the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as the title characters. The Nice Guys is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining films from beginning to end in 2016 with a refreshing take on the buddy-cop genre.<br/><br/>Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a tough, uncompromising, and rugged private eye of sorts who is looking for the same young woman who Gosling is as well. Gosling plays against type as Holland March who is everything Healy is not as he pretty much weeps at the sight of blood. The two play wonderfully off each other in what is hopefully just the first time we see them on screen together. It appears as if some of the gags between the two of them is improvised, but Shane Black's script and direction deserves a ton of credit.<br/><br/>If it does well enough at the box office, I have to believe the audience would be open to sequels. Black not only establishes the bond between Healy and March, but he also sets up the characters individually just as well. The subtle hints at who they were before this movie added the needed depth for the story and motivations from both sides. <br/><br/>With that said, the heavy inclusion of March's daughter, Holly, doesn't work as well as I think Shane Black hoped. I didn't have any problems with Angourie Rice's performance, but her presence sometimes overshadows the brilliant dynamic established with Healy and March. Seeing a 13-year-old girl parade around adult film parties filled with gunfire can be quite amusing at times, but it's more uncomfortable than anything else.<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning that Kim Basinger re-teams with her L.A. Confidential co-star, Crowe, so that was neat. In all, I really love the world Shane Black created with The Nice Guys. There's something to be said for a period piece that poses a smart and entertaining time at the movies all while amping up my excitement for sequels.<br/><br/>+Chemistry between Crowe and Gosling<br/><br/>+Intricate and funny script<br/><br/>+Sets itself up for installments in the future<br/><br/>-Focus shifts to the daughter a few too many times<br/><br/>9.1/10"

","Mixing excessive violence with comedy rarely works. Here again the bone crushing, blood and gore just isn't funny. Well maybe it is when they toss a body over a fence and it crashes down on a wedding table. Of course there was no reason to toss the body except to get that laugh. Tossing a child through a glass window just isn't funny.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Shane Black he gets all the credit and the blame. The movie takes place in the 70's and except for a couple of ""hey"" greetings it seemed like the script has been on Shane's shelf for 40 years. A couple of glimpses questioned the 1977 setting. Jaws 2 wasn't released yet and there appeared to be some newer structure along with the ""Felix"" sign. The movie projector in the house appeared to be 16mm. The reel in the projecting booth looked like 35mm. The film can being chased seemed empty especially when hosted into the air with extreme ease.<br/><br/>There is no need to see this in the theater. It will play well and long on home platforms. If you are looking for a buddy action picture watch Black's earlier work which still hold up."

","Shane Black is known for his involvement in the development of late 80's buddy cop film Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Iron Man 3 and this solo underrated crime comedy flick Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Black returns with a new feature film that packs not only the key elements of his works but a solid buddy cop movie that definitely feels like a new Lethal Weapon film for the new generation.<br/><br/>The plot follows two men; tough enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) who has been down on his luck since the death of his wife but tries to raise his young per-teen daughter who paths cross when they discover Holly (Angourie Rice). At first Healy manages to get March off the case for a search of a fading adult film star in the 1970's, but it soon discovered that both men will need to work together when dead bodies surface and they are targeted by hit men. As they draw deeper into the case, a bigger conspiracy unfolds and both men are driven to solve the case.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys plays so well; firstly the direction and the script are well presented that Black himself could write and vision, what is shown on screen is pretty much enjoyable with the production set detailed to high standards (the film is set around the 70's), it's soundtrack is catchy and nostalgic and costumes are presentable for the story's set era. The script is smart, funny and very much a noir mystery, I won't say too much on what is involved but knowing that Black's style of storytelling is a cult following, it surprises to be engaging throughout without a dull moment existing.<br/><br/>Another strong key element that makes the movie work so well it's is great leads Crowe and Gosling, I don't think anyone would ever see these two in a film together but the chemistry they share is often smart, funny and forms the element purpose of a buddy cop film. Crowe manages to be the tough guy as we all see him, but he does give a convincing performance of a man that seems to roll with it. Gosling manages to run with the humour of his fallen character, showing his struggles of being an alcoholic and raising his daughter. Angourie Rice is an Australian actress from the deeply moving These Final Hours, here she show cases not to top over the leads or affect the plot but she serves well as both comic relief and support for the leading characters. The supporting cast handle themselves well, there is no miscast whatsoever.<br/><br/>Overall, The Nice Guys plays out like a nod to noir crime thrillers of the 70's, old school action flicks of the era while it carries a feeling and tone of a buddy cop action/comedy that helps to keep the audience watching the plot unfold and see its leads play out in hilarious ways. Well worth a watch if you love Black's style of film or your just in the mood for a film that packs crime and comedy into the one.<br/><br/>Nick - 4/5"

The writers on this movie basically jam packed it with a ton full of jokes, some were good, but most of them were terrible. A lot of cringe-worthy one liners, rambling non-sense, a repetition of annoying inside jokes and 12 year old sex jokes. Ryan Gosling's character's daughter is basically a b-grade version of the movie; Kick-ass, character; hit girl - which didn't work out at all. It is also filled with a lot of predictable plot-holes which really drives the story round and round again. This is the type of movie to give you light entertainment with a few laughs here and there.

","Nice Guys resembled a Pulp Fiction type of vintage. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gossling suavely portrayed super sleuths. Angourie Rice delivered the role of female sidekick. Kim Basinger played another overly-controlling female character. Margaret Qualley acted as the rebellious one. Clever quips brought out the relationships among the cast. Costumes and dresses from a by-gone era, like Yaya DaCosta's dress in the climax, gave the scenes an authentic look. A soundtrack of hit musical throwbacks helped set the ambiance. Dramatic plot-twists kept the pace of the movie at par with murder mystery movies while the script integrated humor to lighten the premise.

","...we've got a winner!<br/><br/>And, for many reasons! For starters, there's the period music. Most of it, the way too-often unjustly maligned disco. My favorites were the classic songs from Earth, Wind, & Fire and Kool and the Gang.<br/><br/>Then, there's the re-teaming of Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger. Their first appearance together since L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (which I'm positive she makes a thinly-disguised reference to when she first meets Crowe's ""Mr. Healey"").<br/><br/>There's also the chemistry between the three protagonists. Crowe, as a professional strong-arm man for hire. Sort of like Liev Schreiber's character from that Showtime series (only way more interesting). Ryan Gosling as Holland March; a bumbling-but-gold-hearted private eye trying to drown his survivors' guilt following the loss of his wife. And young Ms. Angourie Rice as Holland's long-suffering (though not always in silence) daughter Holly, who's twice as mentally sharp as--and ten times more emotionally mature than--her father!<br/><br/>Throw in some nice physical comedy relief (like Gosling's hilarious imitation of Lou Costello at discovering a body in some bushes after an incredible fall down a wooded hill). Plus some witty banter supplied by co-writer and director Shane Black (most famous as the ill-fated ""Hawkins"" in the original PREDATOR). Not to mention some good old- fashioned corporate crime and corruption typical of the post-Watergate Seventies.

A: Angourie Rice. Who? Yeah, the kid who plays Ryan's daughter. Yet another Australian with a perfect American accent, this time only 15 years old.

","""Sometimes, you just win""<br/><br/>Everyone ready? Cool, 'cause it's superlatives time! The Nice Guys is the best action/comedy I've seen in years. And probably also my favorite film of this year in general. *Insert Classic Footage Of An Old Hydrogen Bomb Test* But why? I'm trying to keep this flashy, so we'll stick to three elements, bearing in mind the rest goes from decent to great.<br/><br/>What's it about? Seventies LA! Private Investigators! Doing... Quips! Action! Drinking! Quipping while drunk! Shooting whilst quipping... In an intoxicated fashion! Also porn stars, stripper mermaids, eccentric gangsters and protesting hippies.<br/><br/>Let's start with the writing. And no, this is always my pet aspect of filmmaking, I'm not turning to it just now because Shane Black is involved. Look, say whatever you want about Iron Man 3, the man is still a rockstar. And if you disagree... Reserve judgment till you see this movie. There's not a line waisted, no tiny setup that goes without pay- off, no detail that's left unacknowledged. Does it have typical Shane Blackisms (quippy characters, subversion of action movie tropes)? Yes. Are those 'isms' appropriate? Never more so. Watching it, I could feel the release of those now so rare endorphins that tend to accompany well structured stories.<br/><br/>Next, let's turn to the main guys and gal. I mention her because Angourie Rice really acts the hell out of the role of 'too wise and quippy for her age teen'. To channel my inner 1977 LA exec: that kid is going places. But you're here to hear about Crowe & Gosling, aren't you? Well, I personally got them served just the way I like 'm. In Crowe's case, it's noble yet down on his luck Russell (also, not throwing heavy objects at my facial area). In Gosling's case, it's fast-talking (!), occasionally dumb- witted or genius, well-written Ryan. Also, chemistry, huzzah. Crowe seems to know more about it than Bryan Cranston.*.<br/><br/>And the final element is: laughter (note to self: great pitch for something at some point). Yes, I know, not really fair and probably a combination of the previous two. Maybe I should've said that this movie looks really great, even has some fun framing at times to improve the visual gags. But I'm going for the sappy line because it (laughter) is essential, at least in my opinion, in knowing why one should revisit this film. Yes, it's a great film all round, but I rarely rewatch films just because they're great. I need something else, and I think many others do to. Casablanca because I want to re-experience a time when movies were 'that', Goodfellas because I haven't seen a good gangster flick in a while and Mad Max because every action movie feels the same.<br/><br/>That's why I'm sure that in a few years time, I won't have forgotten The Nice Guys, and probably, neither will you.<br/><br/>*Get it? 'Cause of Drive? But also... Breaking Bad?"

","Shane Black, the father of Buddy cop movies, returns to write and direct this 1970's action/comedy about private eyes investigating a missing girl who is a person of interest connected to an apparent suicide of a female porn star.<br/><br/>It has everything you would come to expect from the writer of Lethal Weapon, The last boy scout and kiss kiss bang bang: Chemistry between the two leads, dialogue of them bickering, a small case that leads to something much bigger and a insane amount of action make our heroes seem invincible (a trope that is actually acknowledged by one of the leads.) <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling, playing against his usual suave bad-ass type, is hilarious as a bumbling, drunk goofball and Russell Crowe does what he does best, punch the crap out of bad guys.<br/><br/>I recommend not watching the trailer as it gives away some of the film's biggest laughs."

","Anyone who actually watched this film and gave it a bad review has no idea what they're talking about. Ignore them.

"Imdbidia","5","4","8","11 February 2017"," Up and down up and down
","The Nice Guys has two of my favorite actors in it, so I couldn't let it pass, especially this being a comedy and action movie, something that Crow & Gosling rarely play.<br/><br/>Perhaps, I was expecting too much, so I felt a feel deflated after watching this film. Overall, I found it entertaining, with some truly funny moments, but not always engaging, with a poor script and poor edition, and uneven performances.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys revolves about an unlikely couple of funny private investigators, so if the actors playing those roles don't click on camera and they are not on the same page, the whole movie is affected by a domino effect. I felt that this was the case here, at times there was true chemistry between them, but none at others. Also, I found Gosling quite funny, but Crow not that funny. To this, you have to add that the dialogues go from plain and boring to witty and fun, some of the scenes are really great but others a bit bad, so it was up and down up and down like a carousel with mechanical hiccups.<br/><br/>The film needed of a better script and edition, because some scenes were superfluous and didn't add anything to the story, while others seemed to be there for no reason, not well explained, like disconnected from something that was going to be explained but it never was. I liked the character of Holly and Angourie Rice is one of the best things in the film; however, I'm not sure that the character was really necessary.<br/><br/>I was thrilled to see Bassinger in the film, but since this is a comic action movie you need a bit of a caricature of the heroes and baddies to make you laugh; her acting was good per se, but I don't think appropriate for the comedic tone of the film, probably because the script wasn't 'there' either.<br/><br/>I found the production quite good overall, especially good for interior design and references to music and film culture of the 70s; however, I found some of the dresses and jeans not that 70s, like they didn't have enough flare! The same re some of the hairdos.<br/><br/>I don't want to be hyper-critical, as I enjoyed the film overall, but it also let me underwhelmed and feeling that all the elements for success were there, but they were mixed in the wrong way."

","The movie is one of those weirdest but fun but weird to watch movies. The one thing that I feel is to be noted is the incredible connection you feel between the actors. Although, I would not have bet on them being a good duo, they actually deliver really well. The whole story, full of weirdness evolves around the supposed killing of a porn actress that a young kid witnesses from the commodity of his own home. The two protagonists go from being enemies to having to help each other to solve this weirdest criminal story. Serious, often humorous, ""The Nice Guys"" make up for a good watch but might not be everyone's favorite. I don't consider this to be a movie for every palate. It's more of a you either love it or hate it kind of movie."

","'The Nice Guys' is one joyride! A hilarious, violent, suspenseful Buddy-Comedy, that's bolstered by Fantastic Performances by Russell Crowe & Ryan Gosling. They are at their BEST!<br/><br/>'The Nice Guys' Synopsis: A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.<br/><br/>'The Nice Guys' is Blockbuster Entertainment from start to finish. Watching these two unlikely heroes form a team to uncover a mystery in late 70's Hollywood, is irresistible fun. The chemistry between the electrifying leading-men remains in tact, & the series of events that follow, left me in splits. I haven't laughed so hard in a really long time. The suspense works, the pace is consistently crisp & even the action, packs a punch. <br/><br/>Shane Black & Anthony Bagarozzi's Screenplay is Superb. This tale of mystery, laced with some terrific humour, doesn't miss a beat. Sure, its a bit too long, but that never pops up as a major flaw. The Writing is top-notch. Shane Black's Direction, on the other-hand, is fabulous. 'The Nice Guys' is amongst his best works, without doubt! Cinematography & Editing are top-class. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences are solid, while David Buckley & John Ottman's Score, is just right.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: 'The Nice Guys' is another showcase of the impeccable talents of Crowe & Gosling. Crowe, though out of shape, is simply flawless as the brawny bad-ass, while Gosling, is a scene-stealer. Gosling displays a rare talent for Physical Comedy, while portraying the brainy idiot & delivers the best laughs in the goings-on. Crowe & Gosling also share an infectious on-screen camaraderie, throughout. A Special Mention for Angourie Rice, who's sensational as Gosling's bad-ass daughter. Of the rest of the cast, Kim Basinger shines in her brief bit, while Matt Bomer is at his creepiest best. Others too lend great support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Nice Guys' is Great Entertainment! And as for Crowe & Gosling, Salute!"
"jellyneckr","Null","5","11","23 May 2016"," Instant classic!
","If I had to pick my favorite screenwriter of all time, I would probably have to pick Shane Black. Despite not being nearly as prolific as he once was, every time a new Shane Black penned film rolls around, it's always a treat. The trailer for The Nice Guys made me hopeful that the film would be the kind of comedic action flick that used to be made in the 1980s and 1990s, one where the plot actually mattered. As it turns out, while the very action-heavy trailer for the film is somewhat misleading, The Nice Guys is still not only a great surprise, but also my favorite movie of the past decade.<br/><br/>Those expecting non-stop gunfire and constant jokes may be disappointed by the fact that The Nice Guys is, first and foremost, a period piece mystery. Set in 1977, the story follows hard-drinking private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and hard enforcer Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe in his most entertaining performance ever) as they try to find Amelia Kutner, a missing young woman who may be in way over her head. This may sound like a plot that would be full of clichÃ©s, predictable story beats, and characters that have been seen over and over again. While it's true that The Nice Guys does lean on a few staples of the genre, it's also consistently surprising, completely fascinating, and even unexpectedly touching in a few places. This being a Shane Black film, there's still plenty of hilarious lines and comedic elements, but it's a bit less jokey and quip-filled than a lot of his previous work. The story and the characters come first here. When the occasional action scene does happen, it feels purposeful rather than just thrown in to be cool or keep the audiences' attention. Black's direction in these scenes is better than ever, as the shoot-out that concludes the film is the most entertaining action scene I've seen in at least five years.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise for me is how great Crowe and Gosling are together. I've never loved or hated either one of them, as I've always been kind of indifferent to their respective careers. But here, Gosling and Crowe are absolutely perfect in their roles. Funny, sad, mysterious, and cool at times, both their characters are ones that are great to spend the entire screen time with, even when they aren't necessarily, as the title puts it, nice guys. They are insanely well written, damaged, and completely compelling characters throughout every scene. In supporting roles, Kim Basinger, Matt Bomer, and newcomer Angourie Rice shine in parts that could have been stock characters. Every person in this movies so amazingly good that it's hard to pick a favorite.<br/><br/>If there's one flaw in The Nice Guys, it's that the very end, while totally in line with the type of story being told, is a minor letdown. The ending is an appropriate one for the film, but it could have used a bit of punching up. The ending leaves things open for a sequel, one which will never happen due to the low opening weekend numbers. There's no movie I would rather see than The Nice Guys 2. The characters lend themselves to the possibility of a great franchise.<br/><br/>I can't overstate what a blast The Nice Guys is to me as a movie fan. I won't go as far as to call it flawless, but it is as close to perfect of a film as I'm likely to see the rest of 2016. I loved almost every second of it, and would gladly sit through a longer cut in a heartbeat. The Nice Guys is an instant classic, one that I will definitely be watching over and over again. Highly recommended. 9/10"
"ronakkotian","8","2","3","2 June 2020"," Absolutely hilarious!
","Apart from Iron Man 3, I haven't seen Shane Black's other work but after seeing this film I definitely want to explore his filmography further.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys follows private investigator Holland March and tough guy Jackson Healy who team up to find a girl named Amelia and solve the mysterious death of famous porn star, Misty Mountains.<br/><br/>This is a movie that people don't make nowadays and I love how Shane Black decided to revisit a genre of film that became really popular in the 80s and 90s. A buddy cop film in this generation could've easily gone wrong but Black made it work. The 70s atmosphere feels very nostalgic and memories of films like Lethal Weapon start flooding in. The script by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi is extremely witty and funny. The jokes aren't cheap and the overall amount of them keeps you engaged till the end. The plot is very absurd but it feels right for a film that doesn't take itself that seriously. Aside from Black's script and direction, there are two more reasons to see this film.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are superb onscreen together. They have a great amount of chemistry and make each scene all the more funny. I'm used to seeing Gosling do serious roles but this film shows his capability as a comedic actor. His comic timing is brilliant and without a doubt the highlight of the film. Russell Crowe's character is far more serious which plays a great contrast to Gosling. The action scenes involving him are enjoyable to watch. Another star is Angourie Rice who's really entertaining as Gosling's daughter. The only person I'm conflicted about is Margaret Qualley. I think she could have been better.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys is a fun way to spend two hours of your life. The film's jokes and gags are absolutely hilarious and the cast make it even better. It's great to see a revival of the buddy cop genre. I hope Shane Black makes a sequel because this looks like a promising series."

","A 1970s Los Angeles crime flick featuring two P.I's and a young girl accompanied by well delivered cheesy quips and remarks. The two leads, Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe along with Angourie Rice, Gosling's bold daughter all wonderfully show out in a 'crimedy' tale full of twist and turns.<br/><br/>Firstly, the jokes in this film, while not ""Dave Chappelle"" hilarious, have a strong effect and work really well with the characters who deliver them. It stems from the fact that none of the characters are every 'trying' to be funny in the first place which makes the scenes all the more hilarious. Unfortunately for me, viewing the trailer for this film tad ruined the surprise element as it contains some of the funniest lines of the film in the trailer.<br/><br/>In terms of originality, this film doesn't disappoint. Shane Black took a relatively cliched time period associated with hippies, rebellious adolescents, drugs and flashy parties and fashion and managed to use all those elements to the film's advantage.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend seeing this film, even if you have seen the trailers, don't hold yourself back.

","'The Nice Guys' is a comic detective/crime romp, set in the 1970s, reminiscent of Elmore Leonard. It's actually quite funny and inventively plotted, though the comedy is fairly broad-brush and it quickly transitions from low-key to wild, concluding in a lengthy fight scence which although played for laughs could have been taken from a superhero movie in terms of its violence and preposterous complexity. Personally, I prefer my films with a touch more realism, but it's diverting enough."

But to be honest, after five minutes in the movie I started to be skeptical and nothing changed later. With a kid being one of the lead characters in the film and cheap toilet and dick jokes, it felt that this is a movie for teenagers. And when I saw a professional killer with a machine gun who can never hit any of the characters and always aims wrongly, I was counting minutes for it to end. I was very disappointed and this film is below any average film you stumble upon. I recently re-watched Starsky & Hutch (2004) and, in my opinion, there was much more tasteful humor, action and story than in this hopeless try to combine different genres."

","So, I guess I've found my favorite movie of the year--so far, at least. The Nice Guys did so many things right and so little wrong, it's a shame its release will not garner the recognition it should.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays an underground enforcer who's helping out a young girl, Amelia, trying to shake the private investigator, Ryan Gosling, who keeps following her. Crowe beats up Gosling, but soon realizes Amelia may be in danger of getting killed, and Gosling might be the man needed to assist him in protecting her. Little do they know, they're about to get involved in a large-scale conspiracy and a string of connected murders.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys commits to its quirkiness and loves taking advantage of its irony. Gosling's character won't drive after he's been drinking, so he makes his 13-year-old daughter drive him around instead so he won't get in trouble.<br/><br/>It's really hilarious. Not in an over-the-top Will Ferrell sense of the word, but in a very clever and cool Oceans Eleven-y type of way--with a little goofball thrown in, too. Each joke is ingeniously thought-out, but still feels very organic. While credit partially goes to director and co-writer Shane Black, we also have to praise the two leads for their brilliant delivery and conviction.<br/><br/>Gosling is on another level and proves he deserves to be considered a comedic actor with the best of them. Crowe, who may not get to say most of the jokes, is just as important in playing Gosling's straight man--maybe the coolest and most realistic one we've seen in awhile. Their chemistry is undeniable.<br/><br/>Amidst all the humor is a really brilliant script in its own right. We get an enthralling mystery that unfolds perfectly as the film does. There's a lot going on, but it's never confusing or overelaborate. It's old school, but new school just the same.<br/><br/>The only thing you might say, is that there's some underutilized depth. But then again, not really. Both main characters are deep and complicated and interesting in their own ways. There's more than meets the eye and not a lot is laid out for us that easily. <br/><br/>Black likes to make us figure things out on our own, but doesn't ever totally abandon us. Instead of flat out stating what year it is, he drops hints, forcing us to pay attention.<br/><br/>Another marvel is the young actress, Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling's daughter. She has the talent of someone twice her age, while still maintaining a healthy amount of precocity. <br/><br/>Based on the trailer, I knew I was going to really like this movie, save for a possible overwrought premise. But I was surprised even beyond those expectations. This is truly one of my favorite comedies in a long time. Definitely my favorite, so far, for 2016.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 97"
"jtindahouse","5","8","22","28 May 2016"," No chemistry between the stars
","I often find the best way to gauge a comedy is to see it in a packed theatre and observe how many jokes actually get genuine laughs out of the audience. I saw 'Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising' in a full theatre a couple of nights ago and nearly every single joke landed, and landed big, with many jokes causing loud and extended laughter. 'The Nice Guys' tonight however, was quite the opposite. The amount of pieces of intended humour that raised no sound at all were more plentiful than the ones that did. I laughed perhaps five times throughout the entire film and never once more than a quiet chuckle. <br/><br/>The main problem was a lack of chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Gosling was trying so hard in every scene to make things funny, but it was simply coming across as desperate. It wasn't natural. Jim Carrey overacts, but he still has a way of making it seem natural and hilarious. Very few people in Hollywood today can pull this off and Gosling is evidently not one of them. Crowe plays the straight guy, but doesn't add a lot in the comedy department either. A pairing like Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in '21 Jump Street' and its sequel, are what these guys needed to style themselves more around. Those two worked as a team and got hilarious results. Crowe and Gosling were just playing for themselves, and it comes across that way.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though. There are some good action sequences and the story moves at a fast enough pace to be interesting. In fact the story and action are a lot more enjoyable elements than the comedy side of things, which I never expected going in. At the end of the day though I think this set out to be a comedy and failed in doing so. There's a lot of positivity in the reviews of this film, but don't be fooled. It's not as fun of a ride as a lot of them are making out."

","I've noticed some criticism around this film, people judging it poor, stupid, dull, whatever. But after seeing it's good rates from users and meta critics here, I went to the movies. I guarantee it was the best comedy I saw in the last years, can't even understand how people can not find it funny. The plot is good too, no doubt. I put it in the same kind with ""The Big Lebowski"", both with a not too worried kind of humor. I think that for those ones used to big plot twists or impossible/inscrutable situations which we see a lot on nowadays comedy scripts, maybe this one'll be a bit too simple (however it has it's own amount of unbelievable action scenes). The plot goes around one very truthful and smart situation on government illegal intervention in some matters, from the point of view of a idiotic investigator, who couldn't imagine the proportions one simple case of murder would get. I'd recommend it for those who can appreciate a uncompromised comedy, as it's not focused on investigation itself, nor in maintaining the seriousness that this matter could demand. Worth seeing, that's for sure. As a comedy, I give it a 9/10."
"willwoodmill","5","5","12","31 May 2016"," Shane black gives us an incredibly average neo-noir buddy cop comedy
","Shane Black, the writer/director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, returns with another neo-noir, buddy cop comedy called The Nice Guys. The Nice Guys takes place in 1977 Los Angeles, and after a bizarre opening scene that will only fully make sense until the end of the film, the film introduces us to one of the main protagonists, Jackson Healy. (played by Russell Crowe) Who is just low-level muscle for hire, who one day is hired by a shy paranoid girl called Amelia, (played by Margaret Qualley) to beat up a bumbling private investigator, Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) that is on her tail. Later on Healy is attacked by two thugs that demand to know Amelia's whereabouts, which Healy does not know. After Healy escapes the thugs he goes and tries to find Holland March in order that they can team up and find Amelia and figure out what's going on.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys is a mixture of a neo-noir mystery and a buddy cop comedy, but the film is works much better as a comedy then as a mystery, a lot of the jokes are really good with great deliveries on the punch-lines and some solid physical humor to boot. But even though the jokes on a hole are pretty good some of them do fall flat, and the film doesn't do a very good job of keeping the comedy going in a continuous flow, it sort of just comes in these short bursts. But the comedy on a hole as I said earlier is really good, so there's no real reason to get nitpick it, especially when there are so many big problems I have with the film mainly the plot. The plot itself is pretty generic, if you've seen any neo-noir film you've basically seem The Nice Guys, but not only is it generic, it's lazy. The majority of the time the way the plot is furthered is by the characters accidentally stumbling across the thing they needed, or some random character coming over and telling the protagonists the information they needed to know, very little goes on in the way of actual detective work, which makes for a very obnoxious and dull movie.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem I have with the Nice Guys is that it's not immersive. While I was watching the film I never felt like I was actually in 70s. Compare this to Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, (which is a film set in a similar time period) when you're watching Inherent Vice you feel like you're in the actual era its placing you in. All of the characters mannerisms and the smallest things in the background help contribute to this feeling, and it makes the film so much better and enjoyable. I never got that from The Nice Guys. Which was a serious let done, the lack of immersion makes the film feel tedious and just fake. Overall I'm split on The Nice Guys, on one hand there are some funny jokes and solid performances and on the other the plot is unoriginal and weak, and the film is not immersive. I guess it's worth looking into if it looks like something you'd be into, but you wouldn't really be missing anything if you didn't see The Nice Guys."

The film didn't disappoint!<br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are on TOP FORM in this and the pair are a surprisingly excellent double act, Crowe as the grizzled, tough PI and Gosling as the drunk, 'worst detective ever' and it's good to seem them enjoying some levity after their long run of dramatic roles. <br/><br/>Shane Black really delivers and this is his best work to date.

"Oberrated","6","5","12","19 May 2016"," Just an average Joe
","Overall, I was disappointed by this film. I had such high hopes for 'The Nice Guys'. The trailers sold me, the actors and actresses had my attention. I was all-in for this but after my viewing of it; it was good and entertaining but it ultimately fell short of my expectations. Let us start with the good. Crowe and Gosling delivered. I digged their chemistry, they balanced each other out very well and the comedy hit well for me. I felt Gosling had the stronger performance and I was enjoying every scene with him in it. The 70's private investigator feel of the film was also enjoyable to me. Now for the negatives... Too drawn out. The film felt way longer than needed. To be honest, the characters of Jackson Healy and Holland March are not very developed besides being brutal yet comedic characters. The film tries to give the two characters a background story but it feels forced and forgetful. Bottom line: 'The Nice Guys' had incredible potential for me but it ended up falling short. Primarily due to the drawn out story and a lack of character development. Although still funny and pulling enough; just an average movie."

I was hoping to avoid the loud larry curly and moe noises I've heard from Mister Gosling ever since seeing him in a place between the Pines....that was the last theatrical release that ide seen him in. I skipped Blue Valentine and forced myself to watch Mobsters INC...or gang squad...something like that..which I liked better. reading other peoples reviews hi lighted what I think they liked about the film....shrugging things off like water down a ducks back...but seriously...money was the main motivation for the guys to be involved in their coexistence. One of the bigger things to upset me were for example the two hit men...Russel Crowe runs into them again and immediately they fight...Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling have a fight and there isn't an urgency to reciprocate the painful process of that outcome. Using my imagination and seeing the streets and neighborhoods and cocktail parties were the best part of this film. Things that people thought were funny I didn't...I actually didn't think that I laughed at any point of this movie. Even when the little girl feels bad for one of the hit men that got hit by a van and goes to get Help.....Maybe that was the funniest scene to me? But I don't recommend this movie and it does do its best to give you a vision of that old FREAKY DEAKY and Royal TeneBaum era in your face."

"midas-jacobs","10","4","9","2 October 2016"," A fresh take on the genre, with fantastic writing.
","Some Spoilers Might Have Slipped Through.<br/><br/>""The Nice Guys"" follows two private detectives who are both looking for a girl called Amelia, who has a connection to the death of a porn star. <br/><br/>This movie was directed by Shane Black, who has also written the screenplay for the movie. He did a really good job at directing. His use of shadow is amazing. One scene in particular stood out to me. This was the one, where March falls down the cliff, and discovers the body of someone. By his use of shadow the body stays hidden, but you can feel that something is there by the camera movement. When March uses his lighter we finally see the reveal and the body is shown. That scene is handled in such a comical and scary way, with beautiful cinematography that it might be my favorite scene of the entire movie. But this is just one example of the use of shadow. He uses this a lot, but most of the time the were not used to enforce the comedic element of the scene. The lighting in the night scenes were also nicely done. He also uses very cool camera movements, especially the ones where he moves the camera from a driving car, goes up in the air, gives a shot of LA, and than goes to the place they are driving. There are a couple of them in the movie, but it never get's tiring. He also handled the action scenes very well. They were cut and shot like they were done in the 80's. He also managed to put some comedic elements in these scenes which gave a nice whole. To give one minor criticism is on the editing. This is near the end of the movie, when Gosling and Crowe are sitting at a bar. Crowe's often puts the cigar in his mouth and smokes it, but when there were different cuts, you could see his hand suddenly switching positions and the length of the cigar can also grow or shrink between cuts. This is really my only bit of criticism on the technical side of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting also was very good. March, who I've mentioned earlier was played by Ryan Gosling. Before going into the movie, I knew that he was going to be good, that's just how Gosling acts. Now I've seen the movie, I can confirm my thoughts going into the movie. Gosling made his character feel real and gave something more to it than just the character that was written down. You could see that his character had a damaged past. Russel Crowe also was very good. He played the other private detective. He also brought a lot to the character, not in the way Gosling did, but by gaining weight. This added to how you felt about his character and pointed out his style of living. Both Gosling and Crowe had very good chemistry and they play with it, which only makes the movie better and funnier. Goslings character also has a daughter and she was very good. She played with emotion and was convincing. There were multiple antagonists in the movie, but I'll just pick one, and this one is played by Matt Bomer. I picked him, because I didn't know he was in the movie. The character he plays here is totally different than any others he has played before<br/><br/>The writing was, like I've said, written by Shane Black. But he had some help with it by Anthony Bagarozzi. The script was absolutely the best part of the whole movie. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I laughed with every joke, and still thinking back of them, or reading them on the ""quote"" part on IMDb, I laugh, not out loud, but chuckles. Which is not a bad thing, because the movie was not aiming for me to laugh uncontrollably. There were some on going jokes in the movie, and every time they're still funny. The story was well thought out and complex. It was interesting to follow, due to said complexity, but also due to the great dialogue overall, not just the jokes. The characters were multi-layered and differed from each other. Like the difference between Russel Crowes character and Ryan Goslings. Both are very different, yet they seem very similar. Both are damaged people, but March is just less professional. The character I really want to mention is Holly, the daughter of March. She was useful in the movie. She was funny and smart and actually helped to get the story move. She was not just some one there to be funny or be cute or something. No she actually did something and that's really seldom looking at the movies that come out today. The bad guy, played by Matt Bomer, was good. His character was scary and hidden throughout the movie, but this only made him more threatening. The character was just not that well developed as I would've liked to see, but still a good character.<br/><br/>In the end this was a very good movie, the best movie that came out in 2016, that I've seen, even. The directing was very good, the characters were varied and well acted. The jokes were funny and don't get boring. The story was well thought out and fitted well together in the end of the movie.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"skyminster","9","4","9","22 June 2016"," Boobs, Blood 'nd Comedy. This Thang's Got It All.
","I was looking forward to The Nice Guys and boy am I glad I saw it before it stopped being shown. It's glorious.<br/><br/>It's just great watching. Comedies are usually good fun (assuming they're quality comedies and/or don't star Melissa McCarthy), but The Nice Guys carries with it the aura of the funk, the sex, and the mystery – bringing everything to the max. It's in-your-face in its ridiculous aesthetic, or simply its whole shtick, but perhaps what it does best is use quality comedy writing and acting to carry across a lot of stupid comedy, but not always straight into your schnoz comedy — as a lot of the jokes are down to clever writing and are a little more subtle. However, the best laughs in the film explode into your face, like the blood spurting out of March's (Ryan Gosling) wrist and rotting corpses are thrown around. But although the film is full of stupid jokes, it is not totally stupid; as it revolves around a gripping plot that works wonders for the movie – keeping it going at all times. Therefore it is forgiven in the occasional moments where scenes are dragged on for slightly longer than necessary. Occasional.<br/><br/>The soundtrack also helps The Nice Guys, as it's all funky-ass beats to fit the time period — although it's unfortunate the Chili Peppers didn't come up because it was calling for it. Of course, the boobs also help. And although Russell Crowe's American accent is a little awkward, he and Ryan Gosling are a great pair for who are two deeper than you might think characters in March and Healey. Other cast members like Angourie Rice are also impressive in the film, and she, in particular, may help Milo to get along with child actors a little more (and no, Milo is not a pervert, he just doesn't like child actors, and her performance was good so it could prove to him they're not all bad).<br/><br/>In conclusion, from the very start I knew what I was in for with The Nice Guys. Stupid, fairly obscene, and really enjoyable watchin'. It could stand up as a classic comedy of this decade, even, and is the best new film I've seen this year so far. If you get a chance, watch this film. You probably won't regret it."

Pathetic jokes that flop, and desperate attempts to shock with pointless nudity, are what this film is all about. Supposedly set in the 70's it even fails at that; the movie looks patently 2016. It tries to be sexy and comes across as pathetic. I'm sure this one scored points at frat houses throughout America. As a fan of everything 70's, this movie made me kind of sick. Definitely the worst thing Gosling has ever attached himself too, and Russell Crowe's career remains firmly in the toilet with this one.

","Shane Black wrote and directed this film and he did some great work. This is an unconventional and original comedy, with two amazing actors with great chemistry.<br/><br/>Usually, in this type of movies, the main story is always the same: two different people, with totally different pasts and personalities, have to work together to solve some mystery and then end up being best friends. Not with this film. Both characters have a similar past (problems with alcohol) and they both have this funny personality that works perfectly when they're together. Gosling and Crowe really pull it off!<br/><br/>Angourie Rice as Holly March is also really great, she played the ""side-kick"" to all their missions and acted as the adult in that partnership. She sold it so well, even if she was just a kid, great job!<br/><br/>And again, Shane Black's writing is incredible. I was crying of some much laughter, there were scenes that I still remember today because they were so well filmed and funny. I can't wait to watch this movie again! The action was a nice surprise, really well shot with some old film-making techniques. Actually, the whole movie was really well filmed, it looked like I was watching an old movie, but with better effects and all.<br/><br/>The dialogues were great, the characters were super funny and the mystery was intriguing. In a time where we're over-saturated with superhero and sci-fi movies, this is a blessing, movies like this don't exist anymore. The ending was also really cool to watch, it's really a good story.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm excited to watch it again.

","An empty retro-actioner plotted to the gills and absent of memorable characterization. Gosling and Crowe do their best (subtracting one painful Lou Costello imitation) but are reduced to pantomiming chemistry-lacking oddballs, characters we'd be embarrassed to watch in the 1980s.<br/><br/>Maybe Shane Black wanted ""Scarecrow"" meets ""The Last Boy Scout"", crossed with an edgy episode of ""One Day At a Time"". But the $50 million to transform Atlanta into 1977 L.A. doesn't apologize for the zero behavioral comedy rewards, the very UN-70s choreographed and over-Foley'ed violence, and the director's signature: an annoying teenage girl. Here, providing more edge to the porno jokes. The movie just belches songs and sedans as if the costume and art departments never bothered to absorb a 70s movie, to see how they feel. The looks are just window dressing, with a few fun details. Like watching a teenager get thrown through a window. Luckily the wigs and facial hair surpass an Oliver Stone movie. <br/><br/>For a diversion, it could be worse. But with this much production value and a promising cast, it's a bloated fat ass in polyester, a disappointment. James Caan and Alan Arkin are not just missed--they are now official deities."

"asandor","8","3","6","4 December 2016"," A fun and colourful buddy cop film
","The Nice Guys is a film directed by Shane Black, director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3. The movie stars Ryan Gosling as Holland March, a private investigator, Russel Crowe as Jackson Healy, a man who punches child molesters in the face for money, and March's daughter, played by Angourie Rice. Holland and Jackson meet through the machinations of a girl on the run, but soon team up to solve a case featuring a dead porn star, some nasty thugs, and a greater conspiracy.<br/><br/>Shane Black was already on my radar because of the fabulous Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, but we have seen little of him in recent times. The Nice Guys is a return to form. It is a dark comedy, with two disreputable characters who drink, smoke, run from danger, overcharge people, and so on. Even so, the two are lovable, and form a great duo. Gosling and Crowe have great on set chemistry, and the intelligent Holly (March's daughter) rounds the pair out with her smarts. Truly, this is a buddy cop film for the ages.<br/><br/>Gosling and Crowe play two particularly interesting characters. One (March) is an alcoholic who breezes through life, is very sarcastic, and is a bit of a lousy detective and father. Healy (Crowe) is a stereotypical hard-boiled sleuth, who is tough talking, professional, and gritty, but also ruthless. Together, these two make a really great pair. The on set chemistry in this buddy cop action film is great. The relationship between March and his daughter (Rice) is also excellent, with really wonderful banter between the two.<br/><br/>Black's film is full of fantastic dark comedy. The two amateur detectives make mistakes, create a mess, get lucky, screw up and muddle through, all while charging double. Black has created his second dark humour masterpiece (after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) and I look forward to more from him in the future.<br/><br/>As you can guess, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was an excellent and comedic buddy cop adventure, full of great dialogue, excellent on set chemistry from the three leads and all the supporting cast. It was well shot, with the 1970's Los Angeles, California setting looking very colourful and fun. The action set pieces were loud and competent (although not spectacular), the humour was on point, dark and witty. The mystery felt right at home. I could go on, but suffice to say, this was a great addition to the genre, and an excellent buddy cop film. This film can be easily recommended for those who want some good black humour, or a great buddy cop movie. 8/10"

"Jona1988","9","3","6","4 November 2016"," Great movie! Shane Black does what he does the best!
","A buddy-cop action comedy written and directed by Shane Black. It's what he does but he does it so well. Really well The Nice Guys is a great movie. It does have many of his trademarks but still I don't think he's just rehashing himself, not at all. All filmmakers have their own thing and of course some more than others but I won't complain. All of Black's movies do have many similarities, even Iron Man 3 had elements of the buddy movie that he most often or always uses. I have had high hopes for The Nice Guys ever since I first heard of it quite some time before it was released. I'm happy to say that it delivers. Shane Black is a great writer and The Nice Guys does have a better plot than one usually expects in the action genre. It takes a number of unexpected twists and honestly after my first viewing I was not totally sure how it all hung together. But I've seen it again more than once and it pretty much makes sense now. This movie gets better on a second viewing. One seldom expects or demands that an action movie should have an award winning script and I wouldn't claim that The Nice Guys does either but still it's great to see an action movie where you aren't completely sure were the plot is heading all the time. A buddy-cop, crime mystery, thriller, action, drama comedy would be to completely describe it. It has a little of all actually. And a surprising amount of depth actually. It is a detective thriller. The character drama and plot are I feel just as important as the action, maybe even more so. The characters and acting is just great. Gosling and Crow have great chemistry and fit their characters perfectly. But the real standout like many others have stated is Angourie Rice as Goslings daughter. She turns out to be pretty much one of the main characters. At first one might get the expression that she's obnoxious and irritating but this soon changes. There is of course some comedic relief here and there in the movie, most of the jokes come from the interactions between the three main characters and some slapstick also but it's never overdone. Not every single joke lands but by far most of them. While there is humor this is actually kind of a serious story and with sad characters. The main characters are not really heroes but rather deeply flawed and struggling. Tragic comedy in a way. It feels more plausible so you can more related and care for them. The action is well made and also feels like down to earth but in a good way. It feels tense and thrilling without being this massive spectacle that goes on for too long. Not as much action as some might expect but in my opinion it's just the right amount, I feel the detective and thriller moments are just as exciting. Probably the idea is that it should feel kind of like it not just takes place forty years ago but that it's made then as well. I have no experience of 1970s USA so I can't tell if it's a totally realistic presentation but I think so, it feels so. The Nice Guys is one of the best movies of 2016. Great characters, clever plot, action, humor. See it!"

"jzathajenious","7","3","6","8 August 2016"," A Nice Movie. But not a great one.
","Was i hyped to see another California Noir written and directed by Shane Black? HELL YES.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of his earlier film 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', the idea of Black making another movie in the same vein filled me with anticipation. But while TNG hits most of the same notes as KKBB, in every single area it just lacks the same magic of the earlier film. In the end, i enjoyed it, but didn't love it. <br/><br/>It starts with the casting and performances. Crowe and Gosling are good but lack the chemistry of Kilmer and Downey Jr. Crowe plays it fairly straight, as a stoic tough guy reminiscent of his character in LA Confidential. Gosling's performance is well....odd. He goes back and forth from hard boiled PI to zany broad physical comedian. Tonally, its just an odd performance. And along for the ride is his daughter, an all too precocious and worldly beyond her years 10 year old girl. Whilst her performance is OK, she really isn't needed and seems to act as a dramatic device when she is kidnapped or held at gunpoint by the bad guys. Also, the 'femme fatale', that is the girl they're chasing, happens to be a shrill, supremely annoying teenager with no redeeming qualities. When she meets her demise, i watched with almost glee. <br/><br/>The sparkling, razor sharp dialogue of KKBB is also lacking. There are some genuinely funny Shane Black-esque lines, but they're few and far between, and it helps when you have Robert Downey Jr to deliver them. <br/><br/>The story was altogether a bit too convoluted and messy, and i didn't really get a clear picture of the villain's motivations. The climactic shootout was also rather uninspiring and the ending rather unsatisfying. As a total package, TNG feels a little slapdash and lazy in its execution. <br/><br/>Look, despite my criticism i did genuinely enjoy the film. But for me it was impossible not to compare it to KKBB, and note that in every single area, this was an inferior film. Definitely worth a watch, but i was expecting so much more."

Not long after that, after a porn party, which Gosling allowed his daughter to attend, again unsupervised, while he got drunk and did nothing remotely intelligent, I turned it off wondering why anyone would waste their time watching it.

","Critics and audiences alike have rated this movie and some of my friends really liked it, but I was disappointed. <br/><br/>At one level, it's a retread of action comedy buddy films like ""Lethal Weapon"" which is not surprising since director and co-writer Shane Black penned the original ""Lethal Weapon"" in 1987. But clearly, three decades later, he feels that the humour has to be more absurd (interviewing mermaids?) and the violence has to be more visceral (choking a dying man?) and this is a combination which sat uneasily with me in spite of a sharp, wise-cracking script. <br/><br/>Of course, as the eponymous private eyes of seedy 1977 Los Angeles, burly Russell Crowe, as the violent Jackson Healy, and slimline Ryan Gosling, as the more sensitive Holland March, have great chemistry and are very watchable, but some of the female roles - especially Kim Bassinger (remember her in ""LA Confidential"" with Crowe) and young Angourie Rice (an impressive film debut) - are more surprising delights."

The comedy is suited more towards adults and I thought Ryan Gosling surprisingly quite funny. While not of Russell Crowe's best performances he is convincing as an enforcer and still does a good job. The girl in the movie did a very good job and I enjoyed her role not being the helpless girl that does stupid things. <br/><br/>I liked the plot of the movie and without giving too much away found it to flow pretty well without very many obvious flaws, although the ending did seem to go against the tone of the movie, but i was satisfied by it. Basically the two men join together to find a girl named Amelia and it goes from there as they continue to find clues and connections.<br/><br/>So overall I enjoyed the plot and characters and laughed through out the movie.

The film is extremely entertaining and had me laughing throughout the entire 110min run time. I did myself a favor and only watched the first trailer for The Nice Guys. This allowed most of the comic skits to play out unseen by myself and hit hard for me! I feel the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe was on point, with much of their adventure together being more entertaining on screen then when they were not on screen together. Don't get me wrong, both Gosling and Crowe are master performers, but together they really shine! I feel the plot of the film was a little hard to keep up with all the pieces, but overall the film closed all those loose ends up. The Nice Guys definitely deserves a second watch while in theaters to grab onto anything I may have missed during my first screening. One of the best parts was the ending. Because today's films are always looked at as possible film franchises, The Nice Guys does not shy from this, but is wrapped up and president as a stand alone film. However, the ending does leave us with an out to bring in sequels, with brand new stories staring these two private investigators. The 70s setting is a great time period to place a film franchise, and even in this first film the writes remind us it's not so easy to phone someone when you don't have cell phones in the 70s. I really love how the writers used the time placement to play on the story. Definitely check this film out, if you haven't already. Overall, I highly recommend this film! Spoiler alert, this film is not a child friendly film."

","I'm gonna start off by saying 2 things: <br/><br/>1. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because I don't wanna take the chance of spoiling such a great movie.<br/><br/>2. I haven't laughed this hard since February of this year when I saw Deadpool.<br/><br/>I was expecting The Nice Guys to be an action movie with some comedy mixed in, but in reality it was a comedy with some action mixed in.<br/><br/>The movie is about 2 private eyes who end up working together to solve a case that they (unknowingly) are both working on. It takes place in the 70's in a time where private eyes can do pretty much whatever they want, and crime is running rampant. Their chemistry is great; they harass each other all the time, tell each other what they're doing wrong, and actually end up learning a thing or two from each other. (Their relationship is kinda like Murtaugh and Riggs' from Lethal Weapon) <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is perfect in every way. It's violent, hilarious, old-school and JUST PLAIN FUN. If you loved Lethal Weapon (and you should), you will love The Nice Guys. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
"Mr-Fusion","8","4","10","20 May 2016"," Just the right escapist fix
","""The Nice Guys"" had one of those trailers for the ages that you just know would yield a disappointing movie. No let-down here; I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a terrific mix of comedy, action, porn and Detroit gangsters. With less profanity and violence, this is something that'd work great on TV. But that'd be neutering it.<br/><br/>It's a Shane Black movie in every respect - the end result of mixing ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and ""The Last Boy Scout"" - but that's also why it's so entertaining. It's his signature brand of dialog and brutality that make for a good time. But it's also the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both are good casting choices, but this is Gosling's show; he plays the hell out of a hapless loser, and more than a few laughs come from his spastic humor.<br/><br/>The tone is spot-on, the plot has just the right twists, and this works beautifully as light and breezy Summer fare.<br/><br/>And I haven't seen a soundtrack this good in a very long time.<br/><br/>8/10"

"Hellmant","9","4","10","20 May 2016"," A great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of)!
","'THE NICE GUYS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Action-buddy flick from filmmaker Shane Black. Black previously wrote (or co-wrote) such popular (and classic) action-buddy movies as 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'LETHAL WEAPON 2', 'THE LAST BOY SCOUT', 'LAST ACTION HERO', 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT', 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' and 'IRON MAN 3' (he also directed the latter two). The film hearkens back to the glory days, of his greatest work ('LETHAL WEAPON' and 'KISS KISS BANG BANG'). The movie was directed and co-written by Black, with first time film writer Anthony Bagarozzi (it was also produced by Joel Silver). It stars Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling; as two mismatched private investigators, trying to solve the disappearance of a missing girl (in 1970's Los Angeles). The film also costars Angourie Rice, Margaret Qualley, Matt Bomer, Keith David, Beau Knapp and Kim Basinger. I loved it!<br/><br/>Gosling plays Holland March; a private detective, in 1970's Los Angeles, and single father. He's good at his job, but he also takes advantage of people; and he's also a bumbling alcoholic (due to the fact that his wife recently passed away). His daughter, Holly (Rice), takes care of him, more than he looks out for her. Crowe plays an enforcer named Jack Healey. Healey is also very good at his job, but he's also only motivated monetarily. March and Healey's paths cross, when they're both involved in the same missing girl case. They reluctantly team up, in order to solve it.<br/><br/>The movie is hilarious; due to some really cleverly written dialogue, and some insanely odd comic scenarios. It's also a great action flick; with some highly entertaining, and extremely well- executed, action scenes. The characters are really well written, and acted, and there's even some really touching drama (involving them). The movie exceeds on all fronts, and there's never a dull moment. Besides all that, it's just a great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of). The film is a must see!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw"

","I'll keep this short.<br/><br/>This is a vulgar, heartless, mean-spirited, unfunny, misogynistic movie. I won't include any ""spoilers,"" but all but one character is wholly unlikable. It may have helped the director to watch a real period-piece of TV/Filmaking (like UK's ""Life on Mars""). I am in utter disbelief that IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic gave this lazy, stupid, evil movie funny decent ratings. Seriously, it's horrible. Some movie company execs must have spent a lot of money padding the pockets of critics and/or setting up a campaign to write fake reviews on websites. It is very possible to make a film that is satiric, offensive AND funny. This movie is brutal with its cheaply constructed slapstick humor, its pedophilia-humor and its contempt for women. I am not exaggerating when I state that most of the people in the theater where I saw this were disgusted and offended (in a bad way) by this wreck of a film. Awful movie. Don't believe the BS reviews."

","I give it a 4 for the production value. The movie was in color, the camera was held steady, the lighting was good, the sets were well-staged, and the sound was clear. I also give it a 4 for the poor quality of the script. Unfortunately the good production value and the good acting by the principals could not elevate the script beyond the level of a film school senior project. How that script got made into an actual movie by professionals is beyond me, unless it simply signals that professional filmmakers these days have little idea as to script quality. How can the script be described to someone who hasn't seen the movie? I can say that the laughable jokes were weak, few, and far between, the characters were written without any depth (requiring the audience to create them), the story line was much too complicated and hard to follow for a silly comedy, and I wanted to movie to end about half an hour before it did. I did admire Crowe's performance. He is one of those rare people who can become the character they are asked to play. However I think he needs to loose a bunch of that weight if he wants to be an old actor some day."

","Literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I gave it 2 stars out of 10 because of the girl who plays the daughter. She was excellent. There were no other redeeming qualities to this movie.<br/><br/>Note to Directors: Russell Crowe is not a comedian and should never be cast in a comedy again! He and Gossling tried to be like Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers, but it failed miserably. Their prolonged back and forth banter was not funny and provided no comedy. Crowe was completely miscast. He is too serious and monotone, and lacks any comedic whit to pull off the part. Gossling fared only slightly better, but had no chemistry with Crowe.<br/><br/>There was little situational comedy to offset the horrible dialogue. The attempts at comedy were slapstick with Gossling acting like a goofball, or with the teenage daughter reciting graphic pornographic acts in front of adults. Apparently, the writers thought this was hilarious to have a teenage girl speak like that. The movie seemed like it was 3 hours long. It dragged on and on and would not end. It was boring and tedious.<br/><br/>I hope that the teenage girl's career isn't ruined by this film. She really impressed. Otherwise, save your precious time and do not waste it on this terrible movie."
"jersey-lion","2","3","7","29 January 2017"," Bad acting, unlikable characters
","Nothing else was on, so I gave this movie a shot. Ryan Gosling's character purports to love his daughter, but is a complete screw up of a drunk father, barely coherent, stumbling through life and death situations and making it out by dumb luck. Russell Crowe's character is somewhat better, but is the stereotype of tough guy with a soft spot for the kid. The two of them, especially Crowe, commit violence that should land them in prison for life, but face no consequences. Barely even a 'don't do that' from police. There's big corruption supposedly being done, that will be revealed in a supposed porn film. Truthfully, the kid Holly is the best thing in the film, and even that is a stereotype -- smart kid who does everything she's told not to and saves all the adults... Billed as hysterically funny, I found it just incredibly stupid, nothing but bad writing and bad acting."

Russel Crowe is fat and bloated and Gosling is a tiny bit better but nothing can save this waste of time. Do yourself a favor and skip this joke.

"bob the moo","Null","3","7","18 September 2016"," Solidly engaging and entertaining, but never as funny or thrilling as it appears to be
","Somewhat of a throwback of a film, which is perhaps to be expected from Shane Black. The odd-chemistry of the mis-matched buddies are what drives this film, while the noir-esque plotting and style helps it too. The film has a reasonably engaging story-line, good casting, good laughs, some good action, and plenty of specific moments that make it enjoyable. And it was enjoyable, however this is different from saying it is a great film – because it isn't.<br/><br/>In the moments or specific aspects, it does work, but as a whole it seems disjointed and unsure of what it is trying to be. Instead of it feeling like one common film as it flows through moments of varying tone and content, it feels like a series of moments of different tone which have been pieced together to become a whole. In some ways it is dramatic with a wry comedy, in others it is pure slapstick, and then again in others it asks us to take the plot seriously. Mostly it works in this, but it never totally convinces either.<br/><br/>A lot of credit for it working should go to the casting and performances from Crowe and Gosling. They work very well in their characters; in particular Gosling manages to make his daughter work as a relationship (as poorly judged as she is as a character), and even makes things like a Lou Costello / Lethal Weapon-style moment work. The supporting cast features plenty of familiar faces – some work well, but some others only serve to remind of better films (Basinger and Crowe together nods to LA Confidential – which is too good a film to be put in the viewer's mind when watching this).<br/><br/>It is all solidly entertaining stuff, but it never wholly comes together in a way that makes it stick in the mind as a great film that I'd love to see more of."
"manuelwinchester","8","3","7","17 August 2016"," Nice movie Guys
","I absolutely loved it. And how can't you love it? Shane's Black new work brings enthusiasm. Two completely different male characters are cooperating to find a missing girl. ''The Nice Guys'', two bizarre and outlandish guys and a half of a woman (March's daughter) are searching for the gone girl and sooner or later they'll realize that a conspiracy scheme is behind everything. First of all, Shane's Black script is gorgeous, with excellent humor, zero clichés, and the proper action. The whole vintage style and scenery, plus the great characters, renders the film quite special. But I think it's all about the humor. The film is not inherently a comedy, but mostly due to these special characters the joking is astonishing and thus it's tending to a comedy. Shane Black knows how to set a maneuverable plot, thus making the film intriguing, with itself- examinations and conclusions in the end. But the film's highlight is beyond a doubt the protagonist duo. Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling have an amazing ''buddy'' chemistry. Especially, the second's one performance is incredible. As a big Ryan's fan, I didn't expect anything less from him, but the truth is that it's the first time he performed an entire comedy interpretation. The outcome? He is simply delightful. His role reminds me himself in real life. So what if the years go passing by, Russel Crowe is still great, despite the extra weight. The action-comedy movies is a famous genre with few successful attempts, though. The Nice Guys could be definitely considered as, a diamond of this genre."

","From the writer-director of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys is another ravishing, rambunctious & rollicking ride that's full of laugh-out-loud moments, captures the magical vibe of the 1970s with finesse, balances the elements of comedy & thriller in a seamless fashion, and is further bolstered by charismatic performances from Russell Crowe & Ryan Gosling.<br/><br/>Taking place in Los Angeles around 1977, The Nice Guys tells the story of a private detective who's hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous porn star. The trail leads him to a young girl who hires an enforcer to keep him off her. But when she goes missing, the two detectives team up to find her, only to later discover that the whole plot is far more complicated than they imagined.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Shane Black, the film brims with plenty of style, is downright witty & makes excellent use of its resources for the most part. The first half is a laughter riot and presents Black at his best but the second half fizzles out of energy after a while plus the big reveal unfortunately isn't as rewarding as expected. Nevertheless, the narrative stays funny & thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>The 1970s atmosphere is brought to life with vibrancy, thanks to its outstanding production design, fitting costumes & numerous pop-culture references. Cinematography also adds more richness to the story with its energetic camera-work & exquisite use of bright colour palette. The first half is brilliantly paced but it all goes downhill in the next half. And the music further evokes the 1970s feel with its selected tracks.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, The Nice Guys features a colourful cast in Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Margaret Qualley & Kim Basinger, with both Crowe & Gosling stealing the show although Rice gets to have her own moments as well and does a commendable job in her given role. Crowe & Gosling do chip in with strong inputs separately but their chemistry is even better and makes the whole experience all the more enriching.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Nice Guys had all the ingredients to finish as one of the finest examples of its genre(s) but it just misses out on boarding that train, thanks to its less-refined second half that simply fails to live up to the expectations set by its previous act. It still bears all the hallmarks of a Shane Black feature, and is an incessantly fun, endlessly groovy & powerfully alluring cinema that promises an equally thrilling & amusing ride to all its viewers and delivers it in sufficient doses. Definitely worth your time & money."

Having a child actress get a role like that is really something else. Crowe and Gosling made an incredible team together. Overall, much more memorable than I initially expected and I'm surprised that it seems there isn't more hype or talk about this. I can really see it getting a lot of deserved Golden Globe nominations. I do think this is a great watch, although inevitably it will appeal to some film fans more than others and they will have to determine for themselves."

And Ryan Gosling plays an entirely believable not-overly-bright private detective. The interaction between those two was the show. Most of the other stuff got in the way.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was wonderful and all of the mid-70s trivia was just perfect.<br/><br/>The end of the film - with the detectives teaming up in a new co. seems to set the stage for a ""Nice Guys"" franchise I guess. If that's really the case, the producers need to get some better writers for the next episode if they expect this formula to work again. But this first time out was a lot of fun."

The Nice Guys is set in 1977 on an LA sleazy vibe back drop which is convincingly recreated, topped off with the music of the time.<br/><br/>With their own reasons for getting involved the duo team up to achieve one shared goal both reliant on each other's different skills. It's a different era of wild celebrity disco parties, cigarette smoking and lenient police involvement, allowing unlikely partnership of drunkard PI Holland (Ryan Gosling) and Jackson (Russell Crowe) paid hard man to go about their business. What's interesting and surprisingly works is Holland's young teen daughter (Angourie Rice) who helps her dad and dicey new partner as they investigate the murder of a porn star, Misty Mountains and its mysterious link to environmentalist wild-child Amelia (Margaret Qualley) and politically connected mother, Judith (Kim Basinger). <br/><br/>It feels likes it's all shot on location, the period setting is at times the star of show, injecting plenty of atmosphere and mood, the cars, the fashion etc. The supporting cast a great, notable are the excellent Matt Bomer (White Collar, American Horror Story Hotel) who plays a professional hit man and thug Keith David (The Thing, They Live) who want Amelia dead. Black offers corruption, some surprise deaths and twists but it's a comedy at heart. Gosling and Crowe are kind of 70s version of Laurel and Hardy, yelping and mumbling through scenes. Their chemistry is great, it's an interesting and brilliant casting with the leads displaying a naturally comedic zaniness along with Crowe adding a believability that he can bust heads.<br/><br/>Thankfully Black and writer Anthony Bagarozzi create enough back- story for Holland and Jackson to ensure your buy into the characters' plights as they work through clues looking like Starsky and Hutch in Boogie Nights. Both Gosling and Crowe somehow feel they belong to the period. Rice equals Leon's Natalie Portman in terms of a young girl being in an improbable adult world. Gosling is disinclined to being a good dad, in contrast to Crowe's deadpan character wanting to be liked and you find yourself rooting for the at times unsavoury characters. <br/><br/>With its period setting, some hard hitting action and taboo comedy there's plenty of entertainment to be had, recommended."

The laughs are plentiful and very well done. Both Crow and Gosling are funny people. Some actors are just not funny such as Seth Rogan whom I find just plain stupid and vulgar.

I think he's probably a little like me, big movie fan, probably a fan of real good westerns. And also, Ryan Gosling. His good looks have overshadowed how good an actor, and how much range he has. So you put those two together and I bookmarked this movie about 11 months before its release. And it didn't fall short of expectations. The pace is great, the dialogue is great, and the leads have great chemistry and ""do the script its due"" Gosling as a broken alcoholic single father, juxtaposed by Crowe's hit-man with feelings is an uplifting duo. Matt Bohmer is great casting for a bad guy.

"calvin_starr","8","3","7","15 June 2016"," The Nice Guys is a great crime/comedy film
","The Nice Guys was directed by Shane black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron man 3) and stars Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling who are both private eyes during the 1970's in Los Angeles. The plot synopsis of this film is that both characters are a mismatched pair of private eyes who investigate the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The film is great due to its both funny and charismatic two leading roles, The Nice Guys pays homage to many other buddy cop films such as Lethal Weapon. The setting of the film which is in 1970's LA gives the film a retro postcard version of LA during this era, Black captures this version of LA through a very bright and vibrant use of Mise en Scene and lighting. Right from the offset you can tell the films soundtrack has been handpicked perfectly and if you are a huge fan of 70's music then you will most likely want to purchase this great soundtrack after watching the film.<br/><br/>Now onto the acting and the films characters. Both Crowe and Gosling give good performances, especially in terms of how to execute comedy as the two characters and actors completely bounce off each other and their relationship is what most holds the film together. I found both actors in this film very funny and being from the U.K. I am usually skeptical before seeing a Hollywood comedy as the humour is different but i did find myself laughing throughout the film, although some gags went over my head. All in all you could not have Crowe's brutish character without Gosling's clumsy and hopeless character and Shane Black did a great job at bringing these two characters together.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is quite complex and in the end it did pay off and I was satisfied in the end. The narrative deals with murder, mystery and it also takes so twists and turns, it very much reminded me of a comedy version of Chinatown and it is evident to see that The Nice Guys is heavily influenced by Film Noir and Neo Noir which is one of my favorite genres of cinema.<br/><br/>Now on to some of the issues that the film has. I found that some of the jokes and gags were too much and that they should not have been played on so much but other than that I did find most of the film funny. It seems that with a film dealing with subjects such as porn and nudity that having a child in the midst of all this activity is basically a green light to show as much naked women as they want as it appears as 'child friendly', I know the child is placed in these situations due to Gosling's clumsy parenting choices as he feels out of touch with his daughter since his wife died but I found that involving the child in most of the action in the film seemed rather pointless and out of place in a crime/ mystery film and for this reason The Nice Guys felt too child friendly and maybe even it is fair to say too self aware of itself.<br/><br/>overall I would rate The Nice Guys 8/10"

All the side characters had great parts. It was very funny, had plenty of action and character, clipped along at a decent pace and had an interesting plot -- although a little forced at the end. I'm considering watching it a second time because it had all kinds of small, subtle gems dropped in and I'm sure I missed some the first time.

"rcolgan","8","3","7","10 June 2016"," Shane Black Remains the Master of Buddy Cop Comedies
","On a basic level The Nice Guys works like any buddy cop movie. Great action, well developed characters and a decent story to hold it altogether. But just like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the real strength of The Nice Guys is how Shane Black is able to both mock the clichés in the action genre, many of which he helped to create in films like Lethal Weapon, whilst paying homage to all the action tropes that made the genre what it is today.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer whose work mostly includes freelance work of beating up someone for whoever's willing to pay. He has considered becoming a licensed private investigator, as he wants to give real help to some clients, but he doesn't want to pay for the licence. He's a nice guy, but he's not that Nice. Then there's Ryan Gosling as Holland March, who is a licensed investigator and father to a thirteen year old girl. He spends most of his time accepting cases from old people with dementia paying him to find their recently deceased spouses, constantly screwing up and spending most of his time trying to drown himself in Bourbon. Even his daughter calls him a bad person. <br/><br/>After one old lady with bad eyesight hires him to find her niece, who is a porn star who had recently died in a car crash. Thinking the job is easy money to just confirm the girl is dead, March takes the case. But he quickly discovers the girl could be alive. This causes him to cross paths with Healey, who is hired to burst in to March's home to threaten him and get him to drop the case. Before leaving he casually asks March a few questions about his life as a private investigator and how he's able to afford such a nice place on an investigators salary, before calmly breaking his wrist and leaving. It's a good tone setter for their relationship for the rest of the film. <br/><br/>But Healey quickly realises the case was bigger than he thought it was and wanting to be a ""nice guy"" decides to work with March and solve the case. Very quickly they fall in to a case filled with 70's pornography and government conspiracies. It's part Boogie Nights, part Chinatown and all tied together with Shane Blacks tongue and cheek charm. <br/><br/>Similar to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, one of the films greatest strengths comes from the charismatic leads of Crowe and Gosling as the mismatched duo investigating the case. Crowe delivers all his lines in a great deadpan style, whilst Gosling goes out of his usual element, giving up his usual macho man image in order to play a Buster Keaton style slapstick performance. Sometimes they seem like the smartest guys in the room, chasing obscure leads and coming up with good results. Then at other's they seem like a pair of idiots getting by on pure luck alone, such as one scene where Gosling accidentally stumbles down a hill and ends up discovering a dead body. They are both screw ups, but they screw up in such charming ways that we can't help but to continue rooting for them. <br/><br/>The film is also able to avoid the annoying cliché used in films like War of the Worlds or Commando where the child ends up serving no role in the film other than being a victim and a plot device. Instead March's daughter is written with the same charm and depth as both March and Healey. Angourie Rice also pulls of a great performance working very well with all the other actors in the film.<br/><br/>Shane Black both wrote and directed the film and he definitely plays to all of his greatest strengths through the films mixture of great comedic timing and sharp dialogue. He also works in all the clichés that you'd expect from his work, even managing to fit in one scene at the end randomly set at Christmas (since it just wouldn't be a Shane Black film without a little festivity). Ultimately it's a film that keeps you laughing throughout and by the end it leaves you wanting more."

Set in the 1970's, the costumes (Kym Barrett) and environment (Danielle Berman, Richard Brigand and David Utlfey) provide Crowe and Gosling all the leeway they need to take their crazy loose cannon characters across the LA landscape in search of Amelia (Margaret Qualley - The Leftovers), with little Holly (Angourie Rice) as the grown-up of the trio. While initially hard to believe Crowe (with a mature body) and the sexy Gosling in such nutty roles, they quickly and easily pull you into their kooky topsy-turvy world, even when the storyline goes to far or gets off track. Matt Bomer (American Horror Story) gives a fun cameo, and Kim Basinger is a glow in her many soft-lit appearances. ""The Nice Guys"" isn't brain surgery. However, it is filled with many good on liners, a fun script, great costumes, goofy best-bud-banter and a lot of heart."

","Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe star in the neo noir comedy The Nice Guys, which follows the investigation of two independent investigators working together to uncover a case within the 1970s Los Angles porn industry. I have never seen to actors work so well in a a buddy action like this before, and they are just so cool to watch together. Directed by Shane Black the Nice Guys provides a solid good time at the cinema for viewers with entertaining action, intriguing narrative, and enjoyable humour.<br/><br/>So as said before, both Gosling and Crowe are absolutely great together with there different personalities that just work and you can even imagine them being a real team. Especially Crowe is really cool and bad ass which would make you honoured to know him. Gosling pulls of a great typical 70s figure with the support of great costumes although his character is an moron but he accepts that.<br/><br/>At the heart of it is also Gosling's daughter (in the film) who provides more significance than first thought in a non annoying way, and does not try to bring a moral loving side to the narrative.<br/><br/>Although the narrative does grab the audience, there is no real direction where you think its going, and it's not always clear what is going on the whole time.<br/><br/>Then there is also the comedy which is entertaining and will tickle audiences but may not make you laugh out loud. I'm not really the best judge of comedy, so I can't really say how funny it is, but it is enjoyable.<br/><br/>So in the end, The Nice Guys is very enjoyable and fun to watch, but may not be for everyone. It is more unique then other buddy action comedies like Rush Hour, 2 Guns, or The Others Guys. 7.5/10"
"kevin_newdirections","9","3","7","8 June 2016"," A thrilling mix of slapstick comedy, action mayhem and '70s extravaganza, with lead characters who are completely devoid of any equanimity.
","It is 1977 in Los Angeles. The music is funky, the sky is smog-ridden, corruption is rampant, and pornography is as thriving as the automotive industry. Private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of a famous porn star named Misty Mountains. The trail leads him looking for a missing Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley), the daughter of the Chief Head Justice. Meanwhile, Amelia, who doesn't wish to be found, hires a burly enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to keep March out of her tail. As Amelia suddenly vanishes, the wild goose chase for her intensifies, and several parties of interest are thrown into the mix. Caught in the middle of a killing spree, Jackson and Holland, along with his persistent daughter Holly (Angourie Rice), are forced to team up as they uncover a shocking conspiracy linked with higher ranks of the government.<br/><br/>Shane Black effectively hits the audience's spot by creating hilarious characters and putting them in awkward situations. The hapless nature of the duo adds to their likability. Jackson, and most definitely, Holland don't have the skillset of James Bond or Jason Bourne, making them stumble their way through each location and rely on dumb luck as coincidences turn into clues and mishaps turn into leads. The plot, however, could have used more editing, especially in the starting and closing parts where the story gets a bit shambolic. Indeed, The Nice Guys can be a confusing film that each found clue sends the plot to an entirely new direction, and events only start making sense toward the end. Black could have easily spun his film as a crime thriller, which would have served the general plot better. However, his intention here is not to make a point about government conspiracies; rather, he wants the audience to focus more on the comedic detours of the characters. For that reason, this film fares better as a comedy than a mystery.<br/><br/>This film won't work without the fantastic chemistry and dynamic energy that we get from its leads. Jackson (Crowe) is the more rational and grounded guy, whereas Holland (Gosling) is the accident-prone, world's worst detective that holds them down. They don't strike as caricatures for there is a duality in their study; deep-down, these are damaged persons. Holland struggles in his profession and at the same time fails in responsible parenting, and Jackson is world-weary and exhausted of living an amoral life. Crowe does not play an upfront fancy character, but he deliver good comedic talents surprising for a first-timer in the comedy genre. Yes, his IMDb profile clearly states that Mr. Russell Crowe has not done comedy up until now. His stone-faced reactions to Holland's mishaps caps off the impact of each comedic scene. On the other hand, although we've recently seen Gosling's comedic chops in The Big Short, here, he sheds all his vanity and delivers an impeccable performance, from pained squeals to lost breath gags. His relationship with his thirteen year old daughter Holly is also an interesting study. Holly is well aware of her father's shortcomings but accepts him for who he is and acts as the self-appointed brains of the group. She is that rare kid who had to grow up fast but at the same time retain her pristine beliefs. Young actress Rice holds the heart of the film and deserves every right to be on the main poster with the two leads.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys is gloriously violent yet still raucously funny. Mixing these two elements – violence and comedy – is a tricky task especially in a neo-noir setting (unless you're homeschooled by Quentin Tarantino). Black expertly directs classic action sequences (fistfights, shootouts, car chases, building drops) and stuffs them with a stream of verbal and physical gags to look adorably desperate. With a gaudy production that pays homage to the glitz and glamour of the '70s – hippie fashion, boogie music, vintage cars, and even lesbian mermaids (if that's, you know, your thing) –, this film is a lovely mess I can't wait to revisit. For once, I am not moaning over the idea of The Nicer Guys roaring down the freeway.<br/><br/>Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-nice-guys"
"alindsay-al","8","3","7","7 June 2016"," A great entertaining buddy cop film
","I heard good reviews for this film so I went see it and I was very entertained by this fun movie. The premise sees two different personal investigators on the hunt for a girl who has gone missing. Russel crowe and ryan gosling are the two pi's in this film and they are both great in this film. They have such good chemistry on screen together and even though it's pretty cliché you buy there friendship on screen. Also both of them are interesting and funny characters in there own right which helps boost this film. Also goslings daughter in this film is amazing, she gives a performance way beyond her years by providing some great humour and drama so I hope to see her in more things in the future. Unfortunately, everybody else in this film is wasted. All the villains are boring and have absolutely no character to them even though seeing keith David is always cool. Kim basinger is only in this film for a few scenes which is such a waste of her talent. The story is a bit convoluted but it works because it is always moving, the story keeps evolving and you are on this journey with the two guys and its pure fun. The script is really good with all the witty banter between the two being funny and when it needs to be the film hits the drama levels well. The style has some great action scenes that were filmed very well. Also the 1970s feel really works for the stylistic nature of the film. But, I do feel like the film has a few pacing issues especially in the first 30 mins and is probably a tiny bit too long. But I really enjoyed this film and think it is definitely worth a watch."
"j_forbesy","8","3","7","6 June 2016"," The Nice Guys
","The Nice Guys is a film that I didn't see a lot before going into it. I had heard heaps of positives going into it but I was essentially going in blind. This movie was just straight out fantastic. I'm going to start by saying that for me personal, I really feel that this is going to be one of those movies that whenever it comes on TV I'm going to watch it.<br/><br/>As far as humour goes it nailed it. As a comedy you expect it to be funny but it's a type of comedy that I didn't expect. The Nice Guys has a MA 15+ rating here in Australia which is the same rating as Deadpool, but I feel the sense of comedy was completely different. Deadpool would not have worked without that R rating but I really think that The Nice Guys could have easily been a lower rating. Thats a massive compliment to the movie for me. To say that the humour was so genuine and they didn't rely on using coarse language to get laughter really stands out as what I really loved about this film. I do however understand the high rating because this film is essentially about pornos which they simply couldn't do without that rating.<br/><br/>I really liked the story the film had. Story is always a massive thing for me in films and it is often the thing that makes a great comedy even better. I'll admit, it was a bit confusing at the start to follow what was happening and who was who, but in the end it all clicked together and I think second viewing will really benefit from it.<br/><br/>I thought the cast was fantastic. Gosling and Crowe had a fantastic chemistry together and they nailed the buddy-cop aspect of the film. Gosling especially was outstanding, most of my favourite moments of the film were things done by Gosling. I think however, my favourite person in the film was Angourie Rice. She played Goslings daughter and her character in many ways seemed like the most intelligent. I thought she nailed the role and I thought she handled the role of what seems like the strongest supporting character.<br/><br/>I really loved this film. So many times it gave me massive laughs. This is one of those films that I really think everyone will at least like. Unless you are completely against nudity and swearing, there are so many genuine funny moments that will make anyone laugh.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

"asifahsankhan","10","2","4","24 July 2017"," A funnier version of Lethal Weapon
","I saw 'The Nice Guys' just when it came out since it was coming from the same writer as the original Lethal Weapon movie, (while not to mention the two lead actors are from Canada and NZ) one has to wonder if that same magic has been captured again in this weird looking ""buddy movie"" or not, right? <br/><br/>The 1970's: Captured 90% but Recreated 200%.<br/><br/>Set in 1970's Los Angeles, The Nice Guys sees a pair of detectives hunting down information in relation to a missing porn star, who's disappeared from the public eye in what appears to be a suicide. Sounds pretty standard, right? Like any good plot, there's a massive conspiracy going on underneath the surface.<br/><br/>When they first meet on screen, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) assaults his (soon to be) partner, Holland March (Ryan Gosling). This important scene sets the tone for what is to come later, as the two, who both exude a strong screen presence, have a natural chemistry with one another.<br/><br/>It's like a remake of The Classic Odd Couple as Nice Guys, starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe - while you might get a turn-off instantly just by looking at the poster or the mediocre trailer but take my advice: go for it! Laugh your arse of with some real laugh out loud moments in this movie.<br/><br/>Shane Black, famed for another buddy cop movie in Lethal Weapon, has managed to recreate some magic in terms of entertainment and straight out fun. Perhaps his re-pairing with Lethal Weapon producer, Joel Silver, helps here somewhat.<br/><br/>Both Crowe and Gosling play their roles well, and believably so at that. Russell Crowe has always been believable as a hard man in movies, and he is well cast here. Gosling, on the other hand, has a wide variety of roles behind him that are memorable, and this is another that can be added to that long list.<br/><br/>But as under-rated as it is, it is filled with truly hysterical moments, several bits of physical comedy that Gosling pulls off throughout the movie, combined with the excellent straight man work by Crowe, the two actors become a surprisingly brilliant comedy duo, carrying ""The Nice Guys"" past one or two flat jokes, needed edits and a cluttered finale."
"SquigglyCrunch","9","2","4","19 December 2016"," Great Comedy and Characters
","The Nice Guys follows two private investigators who are brought together to look into the death of a porn star and another woman's involvement in it. <br/><br/>I didn't know this was a comedy until about 20 minutes before I decided to watch it. I thought it was going to be a serious murder mystery or something. I was wrong, and I'm pretty happy about it. <br/><br/>The comedy is, while sparsely placed throughout the movie, great. It almost always hits, and when it does, it hits hard. The jokes are pretty hilarious and well-presented. It often takes clichés of the genre and, in a very self-aware way, turns it into an original joke. And I liked that. It was clever, but it was also very dumb. The characters are often goofy and fun, and yet no one felt out of place. <br/><br/>The characters are great. I had a blast with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe's characters. They have great chemistry together, and I can't wait to see them together again. This is easily my favorite performance by Gosling as well. I've liked him as an actor in the past, but he's always been that guy that I mistake for Ryan Reynolds and hasn't really had any hugely memorable roles to me. And yet, here he manages to squeeze out of that place and really blow me away. He perfectly portrays this character, and I really hope to see him play characters like this in the future. Angourie Rice, who plays Gosling's daughter, does a pretty good job too. <br/><br/>When the movie is good, it's great. However, there are a handful of points that take pretty big dips. There's one scene where a woman supposedly jumps out of a building and lands on the roof of someone's car. And she just kind of appears. It was super abrupt and didn't make much sense, and knowing which floor the character was on made it hard to believe that she jumped and landed without injuring herself or the car. Sure, there are explanations the audience could draw themselves, like she climbed down and jumped at a reasonable height, but it was just so abrupt that it seemed lazy, like the writers realized that they didn't know how to wrap a major aspect of the story up so they literally dropped it on the main characters. <br/><br/>Also, Angourie Rice's character, Holly, wasn't my favorite. While she was an interesting enough character, and she provided some depth to the others, her role was kind of forced. She gets way more involved than she realistically should have, and does things she really shouldn't have. Sure, there's a level of comedy to her role, but the rest of the movie still manages to be realistic. When we have a little 13-year- old girl beating up grown adults with guns, it just gets to be a little too much. <br/><br/>Despite this, the problems I had were weighed out by the good, and it didn't stop me from having a blast. <br/><br/>Overall The Nice Guys is a great movie. The characters are fun, the performances are great, the comedy is great, but some aspects, including Holly, take the movie down just a notch. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."

","Wow, well I must start out by saying that ""The Nice Guys"" most definitely turned out to be much better than I had anticipated. Why? Well, because initially I didn't have much hopes for it since it starred two actors which I am not particularly fan of. But they really stepped up and delivered in this 2016 movie.<br/><br/>""The Nice Guys"" is a movie which takes place in the late 1970s in glamorous Los Angeles, where an up and coming porn star is found dead, the result of an apparent suicide. Licensed private investigator Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) teams up with the unconventional private eye Jackson Healey (played by Russell Crowe) to solve the case of the suicide.<br/><br/>The storyline in this movie is actually a nice surprise of a story, especially because it is a story which grows on you. The narrative of the movie is quite good and builds up gradually. And the storyline is helped nicely along by some very interesting characters with some equally interesting backgrounds.<br/><br/>I will say that both Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe both really impressed with their performances in ""The Nice Guys"". Both of them are great individually in the movie, but together then the chemistry is just fantastic.<br/><br/>""The Nice Guys"" is fast-paced and there isn't really a dull moment in the movie. Which really is a great accomplishment for director Shane Black. Especially because the movie is kept interesting right up to the end credits.<br/><br/>There is a good amount of humor in the movie, which serves the movie quite well, because it is a perfect combination with the action and crime elements of the movie. And the setting of the late 1970's Los Angeles was also quite accomplished on the screen. And the sense of that period was really brought well to life on the screen by the props and costume department.<br/><br/>Aside from Gosling and Crowe, then ""The Nice Guys"" boasts some pretty good performances from talents such as Matt Bomer and Keith David.<br/><br/>""The Nice Guys"" is definitely an entertaining movie, and a good movie to watch. I was more than genuinely surprised with the outcome of the movie, and it is well worth taking the time to sit down and watch it."

","Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon series, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Last Action Hero) wrote (with Anthony Bagarozzi) and directed this combination thunder and hilarious spoof of a tow guy crime film and wisely chose Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling to be the pair du jour to pull of this zany and entertaining film.<br/><br/>A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles. Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk, a sometimes-present father to his very bright daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman (Lois Smith) who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress (Murielle Telio) is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia Margaret Quailey) who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a filmmaker, was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on.a complex plot to show the world a film about corruption and greed. <br/><br/>It is always surprising when directors and costumers go to such extremes to recreate a period (the 1970s Los Angeles) and yet allow such oversights as the au courante five o'clock facial hair that would never have been around so ubiquitously during that time. Now that the porn industry is everyday news that portion holds no secrets, but in the 1970s? But those are small issues in a film that keeps us entertained from the first scene through an hilarious men's restroom scene (Ryan Gosling is extraordinarily funny) to the last expected explosion/bang-bang close. Kick back and just prepare for some belly laughs. Adult themes throughout."

","The Nice Guys is a torrential downpour of laughs, prat falls and lovable idiocracy, a formula which director Shane Black perfected with his super underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. This one is no doubt it's sister film, and while it has comedy in spades, top tier performances all round and luscious 1970's production design, it's just a we bit under- plotted. Having said that, that's my one and only complaint about it. It's the funniest film of the year by far, thanks to the rough and tumble pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Crowe is Jackson Healy, a mopey hired thug who will put the hurt on anyone if the dollar is right. This occupation has him cross the path of Holland March (Gosling) an ex cop PI who, according to his daughter (Angourie Rice), is the world's worst detective. He's certainly a buffoon, a trait which forms one half of their comedic shtick, the other being Healy's laid back exasperation every time March gets them into trouble, which is pretty much throughout the entire film. The two of them unwittingly stumble into a dangerous turn events involving the justice department, murder, the apparent suicide of a porn star (Margaret Qualley), a very scary assassi (Matt Bomer) and one angry goon played by an afro'd out Keith David. It's tough to make heads or tails of what's really going on, but like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang it's not about the plot or the outcome, it's more about watching the characters trip over each other in style as they get there. Crowe is terrific, a bear of a dude who's in way over both his head, IQ and pay grade, aghast at Gosling's antics at every turn. Gosling's character belongs to that special class of stupid that is so clumsy that he circumnavigates his own ineptitude and ends up falling right into clues, without a clue how he got there. After a string of recent stoic introvert roles, he's the most animated character of the film and is clearly having a ball. None of what the duo do would be possible without March's precocious 13 year old daughter, played with uncanny ability by Rice, whose star is going to be solidly on the rise, I'd wager. A reunion of sorts occurs with the arrival of Kim Basinger as the head of the justice department, joining Crowe again after their work in L.A. Confidential. Basinger isn't given much to do ultimately, but her presence is a welcome addition to the vibe. Black deserves kudos for his gorgeous recreation of L.A. in the 70's, right down to the sickening lampshades pastel suits and souped up cars it's a treat to see. The energy from Crowe and Gosling is where it's at with this one, and they both eagerly tuck in to the dialogue, making this one groovy, delirious riot of a flick."
"FlashCallahan","10","3","8","21 July 2016"," You know who else was just following orders?
","When you see this wonderful movie for the first time, don't worry if you find the relationship between the two leads and the daughter slightly familiar, Black has just borrowed some of the elements from the equally wonderful The Last Boy Scout.<br/><br/>And why shouldn't he, he wrote it? Holland March is a down-on-his-luck private eye in 1977 Los Angeles. Jackson Healy is a hired enforcer who hurts people for a living.<br/><br/>Fate turns them into unlikely partners after a young woman named Amelia mysteriously disappears.<br/><br/>Healy and March soon learn the hard way that some dangerous people are also looking for Amelia.<br/><br/>Their investigation takes them to dark places as anyone else who gets involved in the case seems to wind up dead.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with Black's body of work, then you will know that he is one of the most talented writers of the action genre, and he practically invented the Buddy movie thanks to the likes of Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout, The Long Kiss Goodnight, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.<br/><br/>But what keeps his writing so fresh and lively is, quite ironically, the fact that seems to follow the same pattern with his characters and the people they seem to run into during different settings of the film.<br/><br/>Crowe hasn't been this good in an absolute age, and it's wonderful to see him putting in a great performance, and seemingly be having a whale of a time with the script.<br/><br/>Gosling is surprisingly hilarious as the hapless PI, and his comic timing is spot on. There is one scene when he discovers something in the woods where he emulates Lou Costello perfectly. And the chemistry between the leads is almost as perfect as Riggs and Murtaugh.<br/><br/>This could well have been a franchise if the film was more successful.<br/><br/>Black has proved himself once again that he is an exciting writer, and to think he's written some of the most prolific action movies of the past three decades is highly impressive.<br/><br/>The film is a hoot from start to finish, and the set pieces, especially the one at the party, and the finale are pure works of genius.<br/><br/>easily one of the films of the year."

Gosling and Crowe, as unexpected a pairing as Gibson and Glover at the time, have incredible chemistry and sell the movie and their relationship to a tee. Bomer is great as well, but possibly better than all of them is Holly, Gosling's daughter in the film, who for my money is a star. The dialogue is perfect, great cinematography, beautiful sets... I could go all day. It's everything you could want out of this kind of movie. Simply outstanding."

","Shane Black has been a name in Hollywood I have always taking great pleasure of seeing in the credits. Creating characters such as Riggs and Murtaugh from Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. This man invented the buddy cop movie and unlikely friendships with The Nice Guys being yet, another fine example. <br/><br/>If there's one thing Shane Black is great at creating, it's those interesting alliances that are formed from equally interesting and awkwardly different characters each presenting counter ideals or attitudes. It's watching an almost mutual hatred for one other slowly turning into trust and tolerance. <br/><br/>Gosling's P.I. Holland March seems to be very much influenced by Jimmy Rockford from the Rockford Files by taking cold cases, avoiding conflicts and charges the same fee of $200 per day. Not shy to drinking and seems to marauder around with a careless yet cowardly way of life. <br/><br/>Now Crowe's Jackson Healy is of the heavy handed, brass-knuckle kinda guy, who's not afraid of conflict and isn't shy of hurting people. However, he bares a moral code and there's something quite honourable about the guy. Wanting to do the good thing but capable of doing the other, he has a sense of heroism. <br/><br/>Basically the two of them are the good bad guys, or the bad good guys depending on which way you look at it. It's creates a great relationship for comical situations where the duo somehow compliment each other. It's not a case brains and brawn, but more so stupid blind luck and haphazard accidents with some clever scripting. <br/><br/>Who does accompanying the cast and inappropriately so is Angourie Rice's character Holly March. Holland's inquisitive and and actual helpful daughter. She pretty much saves the day. <br/><br/>Set in the seventies it has a neon disco haze everywhere it goes and the cleverly shot in a yesterday's L.A. Which is still very much recognisable. There's a good soundtrack but a lack of it and it's fairly unnoticeable score is really quiet compared to his score for X-Men: Apocalypse. <br/><br/>It's shocking and borderline controversial with some great comedy. It's unpredictable but wouldn't say it's original. Different maybe but there's a strong fragrance of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in the air which isn't a bad thing as that film was brilliant and this film is a stand alone great. <br/><br/>It's funny and entertaining, doesn't lose pace and the chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is superb. However, as much as I did enjoy it, it wasn't as funny as some parts should have been and there isn't anything majorly outstanding about it but having said that, I would welcome seeing the two investigate some more but maybe speed it up to be set in the eighties? <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 5 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 5 points for Gosling and 5 for Crowe, just can't seem to award one without the other. <br/><br/>82% 8/10"
"abouhelier-r","8","3","8","3 June 2016"," The ""Not So"" Nice Guys
","A mismatched pair of private eyes investigates the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys reunites director and co-writer Shane Black and producer Joel Silver, who have previously given us the Lethal Weapon movies, The Last Boy Scout, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - among others. Where Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans or Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer have gone before, now we have the sublime pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. <br/><br/>Before our emotionally liberate 21st-century world invented the idea of the ""bromance"", we had the buddy comedy and the first reference that come to my mind is Roger Moore and Tony Curtis in The Persuaders on television. This film is an arch return to this tradition. Not unlike Deadpool, this is a rare American Studio movie willing to acknowledge the stupidity of mindless action with cathartic elements. The complex plotting bears a close resemblance to Inherent Vice in its dirty arrangement of events in which the main characters generally seem lost in the fog of their own pursuits. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are funnier than ever in this buddy movie about crime investigation. Though at the end of the third act, it sometimes shifts into more straightforward procedural details that lack the same spark as its stars. Still there's no doubting the appeal of these two bumbling entities. The Nice Guys delivers brilliant physical comedy, null the actor's ability to turn their screen presence into a punchline. In this movie, everyone is trolling everyone else. Ryan Gosling, among his many talents, has blossomed into an inspired physical comedian. While what's fun about watching Russel Crowe is that he treats the savagery of his job as casually as if he were filling out a tax form. Indeed, they are a brilliant pairing and fit like a glove. So well in fact that you will wonder why it didn't happen sooner. It's a Hollywood buddy pairing that leaves you wanting more - a sequel, if it happens, would be justified and welcome.<br/><br/>This movie is likely to score big with audiences, and for the same reason that it's proved to be a perfect fit. It's a treat to see popcorn movies this decadent made by people who know exactly what they're doing. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography gives L.A. a night bloom glow but not so much of a period authenticity, unfortunately. Finally, the hotel elevator scene, when the heroes duck back into the elevator with a ""we don't need this"" shrug. The timing of the gag is exquisite because it's Black's way of expressing what it feels like when whenever you're expecting is almost certain to turn out worse.<br/><br/>Overall, The Nice Guys is a cynical movie but yet more or less sympathetic. An innocent pleasure that you can just let slide."
"shadowyx12","8","3","8","1 June 2016"," Shane Black kicks back to his signature style with flair and reverence.
","In the era of disco and cheesy moustaches, enforcer Jackson Healy (Crowe) teams up with detective Holland March (Gosling) to track down a young woman last seen acting in a porn film. As the hilariously uncompromising duo gets closer to finding their target, they accidentally stumble upon a much larger conspiracy...<br/><br/>If you enjoyed ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", then you should feel right at home with this mystery-comedy directed and co-written by Shane Black. The film is bolstered by a tightly-knit script as well as strong performances from most, if not all, of the cast. The chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is explosive; not only is the duo's comedic timing on point, but both serve as strong foils to each other's personalities. A genuine connection can be felt in their relationship throughout the film.<br/><br/>Another actor who deserves a special mention is 15-year-old Angourie Rice (who plays Holland's quick-witted and observant daughter). In my eyes, she is the true star of this film. Rice not only infuses her character with a rich energy that few child actors possess but also has no problems keeping up with her enormously talented co-stars. There is not a single scene where she gives a weak performance – Rice was by far the best casting choice Black and his team could have made for the role of Holly March.<br/><br/>The production design, costume design, and cinematography also deserve a special mention. The film is so seventies in the way it is designed and lit, it actually feels like it was made in the seventies. The filmmakers also hid plenty of little nods toward the culture and political climate of that period throughout the film (which makes a second viewing all the more fun). Additionally, the film's musical selections and soundtrack will have you settled in immediately.<br/><br/>At its core, ""The Nice Guys"" is a genuinely funny and sometimes shocking film. It features a convoluted story that's big on laughs, heartfelt redemption, and flashy action scenes. Realistically speaking, the only problem that I have with this film (and see others having) is exactly that: the film's convoluted and seemingly senseless plot. Nevertheless, for those looking to get away from this month's stale slate of sequels and adaptations, but still want to see something entertaining and well-made, this is the film for you."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","3","8","28 May 2016"," The Comedy Duo of the Year is...Crowe and Gosling?
","In the late 1900s, there was a very particular genre of film that had a ubiquitous presence at cinemas and the box office: the good-ole fashioned action-buddy-comedy. From 48 Hours to Rush Hour, it's a mindlessly entertaining genre, known as much for its cozy saxophone scores and cheesy emotions as for its ridiculous explosions and fun patter. The Nice Guys mixes these familiar feels with the gloss of a (less-layered and more accessible) Coen Bros film, giving us a seedy and comfortably familiar noir-caper, full of big characters and bigger laughs. Through a series of chance meetings and unlikely alliances, two men barely on the right side of the law in 1970s L.A. join forces to try to locate and protect a young woman. While tonally the film is very 80s, the 70s L.A. setting perfectly shines with grimy detail. Crowe and Gosling, donned in loud suits and ill-advised facial hair, fall right into place. Both of them are super-funny and clearly enjoying themselves, eating up scenes filled with more character than you can shake a pimp's stick at, and getting to play with dialogue worth dying for. That brainy banter is a large part of director/write Black's signature style. With only 3 directing credits to his name (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3), his fearless confidence with his characters and scripts is admirable in our increasingly play-it-safe action-movie world. The Nice Guys is pure and simple fun that deserves to be supported if for no other reason than to get to see these three dudes team up for more hilarious misadventures in the future."
"Rogermex","8","3","8","28 May 2016"," Great fun!
","I had a laughing-out loud ball watching this. Everything was ""1977"" starting even with the main title design. Then, like throughout the movie, something HORRIBLE happens that caused me a belly laugh!<br/><br/>Crowe & Gosling were terrific as a couple of noodnik PIs, Gosling being the ""dumb and dumber"" sillier of the two. There's one point in the movie when I swear he was doing a Stan Laurel. Come to think of it,""fat & skinny"" are their style as a duo.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this was not a ""stupid"" movie (sorry, I don't want to be politically incorrect to any stupids), it was damned smart. I've wasted too many tickets on so-called ""comedies"" that were boring and laughless. This one, with a really high-action, at times scary- violent narrative, is also simultaneously hilarious.<br/><br/>The Gosling character's daughter in the movie (Angourie Rice) was AMAZING, almost stole the movie from the two leads. She has a great future as an actress. Plus you've got a Coen Bros-like assortment of weird characters. <br/><br/>It's all set in Hollywood and the hills, and that in itself is a touch of tribute to things like ""Mulholland Drive,"" ""Bosch,"" ""The Long Goodbye,"" and (check it out!) ""The Big Fix"" (w/Richard Dreyfuss). There's a stereotypically ""Hollywood"" decadent party that reminded me of Peter Sellers' ""The Party"" - including that Gosling's character may have had as many pratfalls, though at far greater altitudes!<br/><br/>This movie is A-class fun! I don't think it's getting much theater showtime, so I guess we're gonna have to get it around by word of mouth. If ever a movie deserved a sequel, it's this one."
"tavm","7","3","8","27 May 2016"," The Nice Guys was a pretty entertaining detective movie taking place in the late '70s
","I had wanted to watch this movie for a while because of the '70s atmosphere so I just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend just now. It had a pretty weird vibe that was pretty humorous much of the time though not always hilariously so. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling reluctantly team up in search of a young woman who's involved in a porno film and Kim Basinger is also involved somehow. Much of the movie is pretty entertaining though because I was a child of the decade in question and I know what music came out certain years especially the 1977 timeline here, it took me a little out of the picture when I heard something like Rupert Holmes' ""Escape (The Pina Colada Song)""-which came out two years after that year-playing in the background. Still, The Nice Guys is worth a look for anyone interested in the era. Oh, and how cool to once again see the Saul Bass Warner Bros. logo beginning this one..."
"jrayner00","10","3","8","26 May 2016"," Everything you never wanted in a character piece.
","On paper this film would appear as middling and unimpressive as the CV of a middle-aged company-man reeling from redundancy. Desperate, predictable and rife with so many buzzwords that HR's spide.y-senses would tingle - eagerly anticipating an opportunity to snuff-out yet another pathetic attempt. 'I'm sorry, Mr. Doe, but unfortunately you were not considered for the position.'<br/><br/>That presumption was wrong - in fact, it couldn't be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Enter the middle-aged bruiser; stubble unkempt; dress - functional and straight off the rack; imposing. Short on time and patience - he doesn't get paid by the word. Surely he's inaccessible, you posturi.ze? Long uninterrupted monologues provide momentary glimpses into the 'inner- workings' of the veteran. By the end it's clear that all symptoms have dissipated, Doctor - the emotional constipation has passed. A man of action; of professionalism; he's the guy you want to be. Russell Crowe's physical attributes, his rasp and his charm sell, sell, sell on this one.<br/><br/>The yin.g to this yang: a young, good-looking, well-put-together slick-ster; fast-talking, confident and full of good intentions. It helps to be witty when you couldn't fight your way out of a wet paper bag - he often succeeds in-spite of himself. He will always give it the old college try and somehow it works. There's being lucky and then there's being Holland March. He's lovable and totally flawed; he's the guy you can relate to. I don't have time to even mention his child prodigy - and what a performance.<br/><br/>Both work in people - one person, in particular, puts them on a collision course of confrontation, collaboration and eventual conspir.ation. A mutual ruthless entrepreneur-ialism brings them together - money talks, after-all; a unwavering moral compass binds them. They bounce off each other so naturally and with such comedic success that it's easy to buy-in - effortless even. OK, so you get it - it's the unlikely friendship that results in a win. Not quite. The film perfectly paints a picture of transition. The team that can't seem to catch a break ends up being the only two people you'd consider capable of doing the job - in fact every main character reaches their own personal summit in the end. It's satisfying. The plot escalates onwards and upwards and without my consent - these sudden points of inflection, a literal moment of turning on one's heels, keeps the plot's focus in a constant state of flux. It scraps the 'beginning-middle-end' formula in large part by making the scenes timeline feel continuous - I sat down and BANG... Roll credits. Now that's engagement, folks. <br/><br/>Frantic; from the outset the pace is awe-inspiring. Every single inch of screen real-estate is utilized, as is character airtime; witticisms and one- liners feel necessary; cuts and transitions have purpose; foreshadowing is constant and, ultimately, all of the above feature solely in aid of the narrative through-line that will keep you on your toes. There's no excess fat to trim. Is this how a buddy-cop tribute, set in a 70's L.A manages to feel fresh? I think so. *CLIFF HANGER* Quick cut. Cue: Curious funky bass- line. Scoring infallible. Any film set 50 years ago is at risk of hanging it's hat on prevailing modernist perspectives of the past - not in this case. Nixon, Earth Wind and Fire, porno-staches and bell-bottoms make cameos, but it happens so naturally and feels so credible that the fourth wall comes off unscathed. If you could put this film in a time-capsule and watch it 20 years from now, or even 20 years removed, I feel it would still work - this one will age very well indeed. Even the 'action' feels sincere - the 'Jason Bourne' effect is thankfully absent and yet the sense of realistic physicality rings just as true when such moments are called upon. Nothing in this film feels heavy-handed once you accept that the premise itself - and the premise alone - is a dime a dozen. Hey, Hollywood - this is what tip-top writing and execution can get you. Go figure!<br/><br/>To summarize: this movie manages to flip the script on an old classic. The cobwebs weren't blown out, they were vanquished. Maybe I'm a mark, but when the lights came on and I looked around the theater my immediate feelings were ratified - I wasn't the only one smiling from ear to ear. I will give you my money - right now - now give me a sequel. Don't label this a 'love- letter'. I'm hip, man - consider it an exercise in purely self-indulgent hyperbole. And remember: 'For the birds'.<br/><br/>Peace + Plants, JR."

","The Nice Guys begins with the killer bass-line of ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"" and some 1970s attention grabbing neon font, and just like that I arrived in 1977 in my time machine. The film hearkens back to the heyday of bubby movies of the 80s, the celebrated world of porn stars and the crime noir of the 70s. All these is given neo-twist of a fresh lemon slice and wala... out comes a new concoction that I gleefully drank non-stop for 2 hours. <br/><br/>The story is not really as important as the ride. It is merely about an enforcer (Russell Crowe) and the world's lousiest private investigator (Ryan Gosling) joining forces to look for a girl named Amelia. Along the way they will encounter goons, a hired killer, Pocahontas, a human fly and strippers dressed as mermaids in a world of government conspiracy. I only managed to glean the story much later on and was befuddled for the first two-thirds of the movie, but that never took away any joy, not one single bit. I found myself laughing out loud at the hilarious antics of these intensely lovable pricks. Writer-director Shane Black gets the ""anything goes"" tone and the 70s vibe just right and deftly balances the gravity of the story and the hilarity of the situations. How I know? I found myself laughing at sequences of gratuitous bloodletting as boorish people die on screen. That is not an easy feat to achieve. <br/><br/>Even though the film is far from perfect, the snappy dialogue crackles with such vibrancy that it smooths out the uneven passages. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling makes a superb pairing for an odd couple and both of them dial down their gravitas to serve the story. They also have the help of Gosling's daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice) to neatly get them out of plenty of troublesome situations. What a threesome they make! <br/><br/>Endlessly charming and free-flowingly hilarious, you would want to hire these not so nice guys for a missing person case and watch the ensuing havoc with a beer in your hand."

","The Nice Guys (2016): Dir: Shane Black / Cast: Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Margaret Qualley: Director Shane Black revisits the same formula that worked in his Kiss, Kiss Bang, Bang. Russell Crowe plays enforcer Jackson Healy and Ryan Gosling plays private investigator Holland March and they are reluctantly involved in a plot regarding a missing persons, a porn star car crash, and thugs with blue face paint. Despite all the twists and turns to an otherwise ambitious plot, the climax is somewhat predictable in terms of who the villain really is. What works is the back and forth banter between the leads. As with Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer in the previously mentioned film, Crowe is the tough enforcer who must rely on someone whom he previously broke the arm of at the urge of someone else. Gosling provides many laughs as the whimpering investigator. Angourie Rice makes the best impression as March's daughter Holly. She is bright beyond her years and makes like Nancy Drew concealing herself into her father's investigation. Margaret Qualley is also compelling as the female on the run with a gun and ducking both sides. On the negative note the villains are cardboard and about as enticing as bathroom tile. Even Kim Basinger is wasted in a predictable role. This is pointless and pathetically violent but it is not without its finer points, which is the humour that is on tact. The result is an entertaining action comedy that is visually well made with clever action scenes but a worldview that is not that nice. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","It's a fun 70's romp. I almost wish it would have spent a little more time showcasing the 70's (much in the way Zodiac 2007 did), because that is the film's biggest strength next to Crowe and Gosling. There's a few head scratching moments and the movie falters logically in a few places, but overall a fun film with good chemistry between most of the characters. Disappointing to have Keith David cast in a prominent role, but given almost nothing to say. Give the guy at least a few good lines to showcase his voice. Russell Crowe is distractingly overweight. I can see his character as being a bit pudgy, but there are some shots in this movie where you fear for his health. This review is a bit focused on the negative, which it shouldn't be. Good performances, overall good writing, fun movie.<br/><br/>Spoiler: There is an interesting moment in this movie where the character delivers a monologue gradually directly into the camera basically saying that the Detroit automakers do not want you to see this movie because it exposes the truth about pollution, and there is a comical moment referencing electric cars and other hints here and there regarding oil, cars, etc.. The film seemed to want to convey a subtle message about the future (our present) regarding pollution, transportation, and fossil fuels."

He had his influential hand in some great action movies; he wrote Iron Man 3, Long Kiss Goodnight, The Last Boy Scout and the Lethal Weapon movies, and he directed Iron Man 3 and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. That is a nice little resume. The movie takes place in 1977 Los Angeles. Russell plays a guy that is hired by people, just to beat up people-that is actually how he makes a living. Margaret hires Russell to scare off some people that are looking for her. Ryan is a private detective-the world's worst, according to his own daughter-that is hired to find Margaret by Kim, who also happens to be Margaret's mother. Matt plays a dangerous hit man that is after Margaret, and his name is John Boy- anyone remember the Walton's? It has both action and comedy. I don't want to give too much away but other plot elements involve a dead porn star named Misty Mountains and a film that exposes a government conspiracy involving the Detroit automakers and their polluting of the environment. Ryan even gets to do his best impression of Bud Abbott. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.

The preposterous plot at least moved it forward with some appropriate villains in big business and the government. Ryan Gosling again scores by playing his favorite character, a likable rogue. Russell Crowe proves that even with a few extra pounds, you don't want to mess with him. Kim Basinger makes some appearances which are persuasive of her appeal persisting.

","The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is an excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes — absurd in a comic way. It is a ton of fun. Watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy. <br/><br/>Set in 1977 Los Angeles, bumbling private eye Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and muscle-for-hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) become unlikely partners when they find themselves both looking for a missing woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley). The two men then find out that Amelia was working with Misty Mountains and an amateur filmmaker named Dean. Dean, however, mysteriously died in a fire that burned the film. The two end up at a party to search for the film's financier, Sid Shuttuck, a notorious pornography producer. The two detectives come to party for searching Amelia. However, they met Blue Face and Older Guy whom are two assassins hiring by Amelia's mother, try to kill Amelia because Amelia have evident which reveal her mother's bad stuffs such as drug dealer, porn movie, sell illegal weapon. Jackson Healy fights with Older Guy, while Blue Face tries to kill Amelia from inside his car, only to be stopped by Holly (Holland March's daughter), who warns Amelia and then escapes with her. While chasing them down, Blue Face is seriously injured in a hit-and-run. Later, Blue Face was strangled by Jackson Healy and dead. After a brief investigation, the two are greeted by Amelia's mother, Judith Kutner (Kim Basinger), a high-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice, who claims her daughter is delusional and paranoid and she hire two detective to protect her daughter. Jackson Healy reveals the note paper with Holland March 's address given to him by Amelia is identical to a paper he found at the party, which gives leads to an airport hotel where Amelia was going to distribute the film. Two detectives found Amelia land on their car from the building where she is accidentally knocked out. They take her back to March's house and two detective was told by Amelia about her mother bad stuffs in government and bad Detroit group. Amelia created How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? To reveal those bad stuffs in government. Amelia mother has her assistant, Tally (Yaya DaCosta), arrange for Holland and Healy to deliver a case that supposedly contains one hundred thousand dollars. However, a half-asleep March accidentally crashes their car and the case is opened to reveal shredded magazines, causing them to realize that they have been double-crossed. At home, Holly is confronted and attacked by John Boy, who had been sent by Tally under the guise of being a family doctor. Holland March and Jackson Healy arrive back at the house and engage in a shootout with John Boy. John Boy escapes, while an impatient Amelia leaves, only to run into and be killed by John Boy. March and Healy try to bring the matter to court, but are rejected, as they have no evidence, leading them again to search for the film. They found out that the projectionist, Chet (Jack Kilmer), another protester they had questioned about Dean, is the projectionist for the film and had worked with Amelia to make How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? Public by splicing it into the presentation film for the Los Angeles Auto Show, which is being held at a hotel. At the auto show, the two find that John Boy and Older Guy also was in this hotel to searching the film. Two detectives fight with two bad guys. At the end, two detectives have the film and two bad guys (John Boy and Older Guy) was dead. The detectives take How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? To the police and though Judith is arrested, the Detroit car companies are immune to any charges, due to insufficient evidence. When she talks with March and Healy before her trial, Judith claims she did not want her daughter killed and justifies her involvement by insisting that ""what is good for Detroit is good for America."" Afterward Healy and March decide to continue working together as private eyes, naming their agency ""The Nice Guys."""

","This is a fast paced, a bit crude but clever black comedy. Now I thoroughly enjoyed other previous films that Shane Black directed such as ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". Which is another cleverly executed neo- noir black comedy. I was amused and entertained with ""The Nice Guys"" from start to finish. Despite it having few parts where the momentum drops slightly. This is a team up movie of opposites, while Holland March(Ryan Gosling) has the professional title of being a private investigator. But is not really professional and lacks integrity in just about every aspect. He is one of those characters that tries to act cool, but loses his cool when things that getting serious and is the ultimate clutz. However for some reason luck seems to be on his side when things get dangerous. Russell Crowe plays a Enforcer for hire that does not have the professional title of a private investigator but is more professional than his partner. He is a tough guy, that looks tough, knows how to keep his cool and is just really good at handling things. The dynamic between these two characters surprisingly work well without it getting annoying to watch with constant bickering. This is a cleverly executed film with fun dynamics, cleverly executed humor which is rare these days and the scenarios is just so darn amusing.

","THE NICE GUYS (2016) ***1/2 Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Kim Basinger, Margaret Qualley, Yaya DaCosta, Keith David, Beau Knapp, Lois Smith, Murielle Telio, Gil Gerard. Abbott & Costello meet ""Boogie Night"" by way of ""Lethal Weapon"" could've been the pitch for this frequently funny buddy comedy action flick with Crowe and Gosling as two dicks (private eyes) who unlikely team up to investigate the murder of a porn star with conspiracy written all over it in Los Angeles circa 1977. Filmmaker Shane Black who collaborated on the rat-a-tat-tat screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi delivers the goods and the pitch perfect chemistry of his leads are dead-on particularly Gosling in his porn 'stache and in touch with his inner Lou Costello (shrieks and one riotous slapstick sequence involving a fall and a corpse is epic). Nice to see Crowe dialing it back and enjoying himself as well as the tougher of the duo and making a hideous blue leather jacket look good."
"RforFilm","9","3","9","23 May 2016"," Shane Black's nostalgic and great writing make The Nice Guys of the best of 2016
","The Nice Guys takes place ten years before I was born. Though I was technically alive in the 1980's, I've always seen myself as something of a nineties child. I think it's because of the media I was watching. I was heavily into the Nickelodeon channel and the 1990's fast evolution into the computer age. The reason I bring this up is that one's preference of culture can definitely define the era they were raised in. My older brother may have been born in 1985, but he has a love affair of the 1970's. He likes a lot of the television shows from that time like Dukes of Hazzard and Starsky & Hutch. <br/><br/>While I'm not that much of a nostalgic individual, I can see some of the appeal of the seventies. There is something of a bright but gritty combination that's unique. A lot of that had to do with the darker content that was coming out now that the previous restrictions that were present from old studio system were lifted. The Nice Guys returns to this era, giving us a buddy-buddy mystery that's in vein of something that's closer to the seventies cop shows like The Rockford Filesonly with an emphasis on comedy.<br/><br/>In the late seventies, adult film star Misty Mountains is killed in a car crash. The aunt of this star hires private investigator Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling) to find a missing girl named Amelia Kuther (played by Margaret Qualley). Amelia, however, does not want to be found and hires an enforcer Jackson Healy (played by Russell Crowe) to try and intimidate Holland to stop trying to find her. Jackson is something of a wannabe detective who may be better at it then Holland, who is an alcoholic klutz. When Jackson encounters and escapes two thugs looking for Amelia, he decides to team up with Holland to find Amelia before the bad guys can.<br/><br/>The two end up being assisted by Holland's teenage daughter Holly (played by Angourie Rice) who seems to be the only one to truly read things between the lines. Holland and Jackson end up going from a porn producer's party in Bel Air to an air pollution protest. It's there they discover that Amelia was making an experimental movie to work with the air pollution protesters, leading into suspicions into the adult film industry, Detroit auto industry, and the Los Angeles city government.<br/><br/>While it sounds like a lot to take in, The Nice Guys not only has an interesting mystery, it is also a great buddy-buddy comedy. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a surprising good team, given how well they establish Crowe as the rough guy and Gosling as the idiot (a role I never expected him to play). Now if you want to know who had the best performance, that honor goes to young Angourie who played Holly. She may have been smart and curious about the mystery that her father was a part of, but she still acted like a child. Why is it that few movies that involve kids really let them act like kids?<br/><br/>Shane Black wrote and directed this very enjoyable film. You can see a lot of Lethal Weapon's same buddy cop mentality, though I'd argue there's something of a ""meaner"" feeling. A lot of that might have to do with the fact that our heroes are not cops, but private investigators. It also has to do with it's 1970's setting which is so rich in it's own world, that I'd be surprised if the film isn't awarded for it's production design. <br/><br/>I'll give this nine cookie jars out of ten. The Nice Guys is already guaranteed a spot as one of my favorites of the year. Shane Black is clearly one of the best writer's in Hollywood and I'm glad to see studio's like Warner Brothers taking a chance on him to let him make whatever he wants. I can't summarize enough with how much fun this original story is. Please see The Nice Guys to support more new content from Hollywood!"

","The beginning is quite confusing as is the entire plot which doesn't seem to unwind until the end of the movie. <br/><br/>They may have been nice guys, but the film certainly isn't.<br/><br/>An over-weight Russell Crowe plays an enforcer like guy who teams up with Ryan Gosling, a young widower with a daughter. Gosling smokes enough in the film for a life-time and is always hitting the bottle. The daughter, a precocious young teen, always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time which is good for people she saves.<br/><br/>The story would have been better to emphasize the effects of those Michigan car emissions is smog filled Los Angeles. Instead, we have a story of a corrupt government female officer whose daughter makes a trashy film depicting what is going on in that particular industry. <br/><br/>Everyone associated with the film is eradicated and there is enough shooting, smashing of windows and cars to last more than a life-time."

","For those familiar with Shane Black's work, this film highlights his unique and divisive style.<br/><br/>Black masterfully uses quick and witty dialogue, troubled characters, and near comical violence to form an almost dream like story. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Ryan Gosling, Russell Crowe, and new comer Angourie Rice is off the charts. Their brutal honesty and openly flawed characteristics make each character unique and leaving the audience wanting more. <br/><br/>Viewers may be roll their eyes at the amount of conveniences that occur within the story, but Black's understanding and constant use of absurd situations masks what would be a fault in different styles of film.<br/><br/>For those who have never seen Black's work, this is a perfect place to start. If you are curious to see more of his charismatic Action/Mystery films, I highly recommend ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". <br/><br/>""The Nice Guys"" is one of the most surprising and fun movies of 2016 and excites me for Black's next project with his take on the ""Predator"" franchise."

With such great cast and such a good script, this was a very funny, fast paced and action paced movie.<br/><br/>However, I do wish the writers would've thought of a different story for Amelia Kuttner. It seemed a bit too unrealistic that she made such big and dangerous decisions on her own. If maybe someone convinced her to make the movie she made and all, it would've been more believable.<br/><br/>Holly really deserves a spotlight for being so smart, strong and yet realistic. She really mellowed down a lot of the craze from the movie (and from her father) and helped her father a lot.<br/><br/>Also, I really think this should be nominated for Best Costume Design, this may be just my opinion but I don't know I really liked the costumes and outfits shown throughout this movie."

In this movie, he also addresses environmental issues and even the porn industry.<br/><br/>No, it's not a great movie, but still a clever one.

"tomgillespie2002","7","2","5","29 August 2016"," A fast-paced, intelligent and laugh-out-loud comedy thriller
","Long before the term 'bromance' was coined, 80's and 90's action cinema was treating audiences to buddy movies, stories centred around a crime that would pull two opposite side of the spectrum together, causing them to disagree and bicker before finally learning that team-work is key. While desperate TV stations are attempting to re-boot various famous titles from this era with usually awful results, writer/director Shane Black is still around to remind us what made these movies so great to begin with. After all, he was behind some of the best of them - Lethal Weapon (1987) and The Last Boy Scout (1991) - and he's proving there's still plenty of life in the genre yet with The Nice Guys, one of the funniest films so far this year.<br/><br/>Naturally, a convoluted plot brings together the two heroes of the 70s-set story. One is a grizzled fists-for-hire, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), who pays his bills by warning grown men who should know better to stay away from underage girls, traditionally with a knuckle- duster to the face. The other is Holland March (Ryan Gosling), a terrible private investigator who takes jobs from dementia-ridden old ladies who pay him to find the missing husband often resting behind them in an urn above the fireplace. His precocious daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) may also be a lot brighter than him. Despite their flaws, Healy and March are 'nice guys', and when their paths cross searching for a missing porn star, they decide to get to the bottom of a strange sequence of events because it's simply the right thing to do.<br/><br/>There's a conspiracy-laden plot to keep things ticking along, and Black has fun trying to unravel it along with our heroes. The film begins with a young boy finding his father's porn stash and sneaking a peak at centrefold Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), before a car crashes off the road and into his backyard. Lo and behold, the driver is Misty, and the kid covers up her naked body as she dies. March is put on the case by the actress's aunt, and is soon on the tail of young runaway Amelia Kuttner (The Leftovers' Margaret Qualley), who is somehow caught up in all this mess. Only Amelia doesn't want to be found, so she pays Healy to get March off her back. Of course, the deliberately implausible story that brings our two heroes together - and what comes after - is simply an excuse for Crowe and Gosling to exercise their sparkling chemistry.<br/><br/>I've never seen Russell Crowe appear to be having so much fun as he does here, and he shows off some impressive comedy chops as the lovable lug who will always put himself in harms way to protect the vulnerable. Even more surprising is Gosling, an actor who hasn't really capitalised on the promise of his iconic role in Drive (2011), but who embraces the goofy scumbag-ness of his inept but endearingly well-meaning single father, a man we first meet inadvertently slashing his own wrist open while trying to routinely break in through a window. Yet the biggest plaudits go to Shane Black himself who, after a blip with Iron Man 3 (2013), is back to his Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) best. He delivers a fast-paced, intelligent and laugh-out-loud comedy thriller, with one or two genuine shocks thrown in for good measure."

","First of all, I saw this on a whim, and truthfully I was more than pleasantly surprised. The story was reminiscent of the Cohen brothers' best work. It has all the elements of a great comedy from good one liners and incredible sarcasm, to standard physical comedy and slapstick. Ryan Gosling was at the top of his game as a cowardly dead beat yet clever PI, and Crowe shines as a charming thug. The backdrop of the 70s porn scene works so well with the movie since it gives us something even more sleazy than the main characters themselves. The dialogue is so clever at times I wondered if it wasn't being add libbed. Good luck choosing a best quote with so many to choose from."

I really liked Russell Crowe that showed some of his comedy talents that were apparent already but I think that this was the first time I really enjoyed him in such a movie. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling was better than I expected, not that he's not a good actor but I was afraid that Crowe would overshadow him, which did not happen in the end. A really nice movie to watch, from another time with really nice costumes and overall a nice approach. <br/><br/>Would really recommend for a relaxing evening with some laughs.

So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.<br/><br/>It is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.<br/><br/>It was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.<br/><br/>It's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon.

Now there are some unfocused plot elements that prevented me to giving this truly entertaining movie higher score, nevertheless if you like ""Lethal Weapon"" series, you should definitely watch ""The Nice Guys"".<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Nice Guys"" is good, fun entertainment. Seeing Kim Basinger and Russell Crowe together again on screen (even for a short time) since classical ""L.A. Confidential"" was very pleasant - they have some great chemistry together on screen which is simply hard to explain. Still, not everything worked in ""The Nice Guys"" superbly well, nevertheless this is a fun entertainment with far more positive then negative."
"JanksReviews","8","2","5","12 August 2016"," The Nice Guys is a hilarious action-comedy film starring the unlikely duo of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, and they really don't make them like this any more.
","In The Nice Guys, Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, a private investigator/swindler/single father. Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a self- employed enforcer who will just about beat up anyone for money. Their lives cross when Amelia (Margaret Qualley), a girl they've both been tracking goes missing. The two join forces to try and find her, as they cross bad-guys and uncover a larger conspiracy, all while forming a friendship that their otherwise clashing personalities wouldn't allow.<br/><br/>The story of the film is it's weakest point, but only because it seems overly complicated. There's a dead porn-star, a missing girl tied to that scene, government conspiracies, shady gangsters and so on. It's not hard to follow, however a more basic story would have served the film better, as there are some plot points in the film that leave you with questions that need not have been asked. There are also some very coincidental plot points added to serve the purpose of the story, which were quite obvious and took you out of the film a bit.<br/><br/>Story aside, it's the characters and the performances that really shine. Crowe and Gosling form a mismatched pair, on paper and on screen. However the dynamic between the two appears very natural, bringing out the best performances out of each actor. Not only that, they're very funny, when alone and together on the screen. The supporting cast of colorful characters are all great as well, with Angourie Rice, who plays March's daughter Holly stealing the show.<br/><br/>Shane Black deserves all the credit in the world for writing and directing such a fun film, the like of which has universal appeal, with lots of action, humour, twists and turns. It's a throwback to buddy-cop movies like Lethal Weapon, which is no surprise considering Shane Black wrote that film as well. He's also nailed the look, tone and pacing of the film, with its 70's era setting and neo-noir feel.<br/><br/>While The Nice Guys won't ever achieve the classic status of a film like Lethal Weapon (which set the bar back in 1987), it will take you back there, providing you with all the same elements that made that film and others like it great. Where the film faults in its story, it makes up for in its excellent characters, performances, action and humour, offering you a highly entertaining and funny viewing experience."

To me the casting and the chemistry wasn't that good that I would remember the movie for it's unique cast.<br/><br/>The movie had some short scenes with fast cuts and some scenes that seemed really pointless (not many thought) which made me think it was a first time directing for it's director (Shane Black) but when I found he's a pretty experimented directer I changed my mind,well it's an independent film but we've had better indie directors.<br/><br/>As a whole it won't be a waste of time to watch it since it's less than 2 hours (so yaaaay!) It has some good jokes in it but still I think it's not enough for a 1h 50m movie.I watched it and enjoyed some of it's scene but at the end when I thought about it,it didn't have anything special...but it's a clean movie with some weird pointless scenes that last less than 3 seconds."

","I seem to have spent a large part of the last few years devouring late 60s and 70s cult, exploitation and giallo and finding the cinema of today less and less appealing. Generally speaking it is the current trend towards aiming movie product at young teens that seems to have created the giant gap. To compound the problem, for me, so called 'adult' films seem to have to be 'serious' films and dealing with certain 'important issues'. All well and good but I can't be alone in wanting a little action without apology and humour without worrying if someone might get upset. So, much the same way as I have enjoyed box sets of TV shows like Life On Mars and Ashes To Ashes, I very much enjoyed this. The magic devise adopted by the TV production company was to set the series in the past and thereby get round the whole politically correct business and this film set in 1977 Los Angeles does the same. Russell Crowe is fine as the ruthless, almost humourless hard man and Ryan Gosling particularly effective as his 'partner'. Amazingly for a US film the kids are great and Angourie Rice a revelation. She didn't put a fourteen year old foot wrong and helped enormously in making this retro comic neo noir work so well. Sexy, violent and funny."

","The beauty of this cinematic masterpiece lies within two frank elements. Shane Blacks incredible script and direction. The second element is the cast - equally as superb. Equally as enigmatic! <br/><br/>This buddy, noir, almost comic book representation encapsulates the perfect science of making a movie well. Shane Black has an incredible edge when it comes to producing a script that has you screaming for more. The wit is second to none, the shocks are timed well and the dialogue is simply sublime. <br/><br/>Mix this with a master class in direction and you have a movie that will etch its way into the ""favourite"" category within that film library in your mind. <br/><br/>I was overwhelmed with gratitude for this film. It was fresh and a change from the normal daliances with overweight ties to super hero flicks that seem to dominate the screen at the moment. Sometimes, simple, catchy, energetic dialogue and good, well rounded acting is all you need to make a film special. <br/><br/>Gosling and Crowe are splendid. Crowe stands out as the ""chequered past"" investigative partner of Gosling. He is rough and ready, humorous and big on screen. His portrayal of Jackson Healy is one of the best I have seen of Crowe of late. Black seemed to bring the life back to Crowe as he slung his whiskey soured voice around the movie without breaking a sweat. He is endearing and captures the performance with an ease of timing and purpose that makes you hungry. <br/><br/>Equally, Gosling is frenetic and brilliant. His character portrayal is beautifully and mercilessly flawed. This gives an added extra as Gosling seems to perfect his portrayal of Holland March with a methodical flow. You become sympathetic and angry at the character. A testament to the brialliance of Gosling. <br/><br/>The combination works and it works well. At first I was uneasy about Crowe and Gosling being able to pull off this buddy team. However, your mind is at ease as soon as they hit the screen together. <br/><br/>There is another who makes this films cast stand out. Screen starlet Angourie Rice (who plays Goslings daughter Holly March) - tempers the relationship between Crowe and Gosling. This is not her only attribute as she stands firm in her own shameless portrayal. She is quite the actress. Her humour and movement give her, easily the break away performance of this movie. <br/><br/>There is quite a support cast (look it up). <br/><br/>This movie is a gem. I don't need or want to say too much because I genuinely want people to watch it. <br/><br/>My faith in good, old fashioned, simple, well put together screen plays have been restored. This movie shows that there is not always a need to spend 12.3 billion dollars on an ensemble cast with heavy special effects. It is simple and beautiful. It is irreverent and conclusive. The only bitter pill to swallow was that it ended...."

","""The Nice Guys"" is a very amusing detective story set in the stylish 1970ies with a mischievous detective duo, who has more luck than brains, and a touch of porn and violence.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling, who played the personification of coolness in ""Drive"", now shows his humorous side by playing the over-the-hill private investigator Holland March, a single father who doesn't mind looking for people who he knows are already dead just for the sake of earning some money, a laxity that more than once has brought trouble upon him and one of those situations also makes him cross paths with Russell Crowe's character Jackson Healy, a rather moody, professional thug who likes letting his fists speak for himself and who else would be more suitable for the role than the notoriously choleric Russell Crowe?<br/><br/>So together they form a duo as a new case forces them to cooperate and from that moment on they literally stumble upon one trace leading to another and evermore get themselves entangled in the snares of a big political conspiracy which of course surpasses their skills by far and the way in which they nevertheless manage to gain the upper hand gives cause for very comedic moments and memorable lines. The story may be confusing at first but in the end everything adds up convincingly, only the conventional finale is a letdown so to speak.<br/><br/>What, to me, makes the movie stand out is the fact that the duo is actually a trio if you count March's daughter, the very smart, cheeky Holly, superbly played by A. Rice, she plays a very active part in the movie and often demonstrates a higher level of maturity than those two guys together.<br/><br/>I'm very optimistic that this won't be the last case of ""The Nice Guys"" we'll see."

The film is able to balance both the serious scenes with the funny ones, and it pays off. <br/><br/>Gosling does a superb job with his character. While being both the smart one and the goofy one, his antics, behavior and lines are just so hilarious. Quite a few of his actions are *slap hand in face* worthy, and that's what makes it funny at times. Without a doubt, Gosling carries the film. <br/><br/>At the beginning, I was not a big fan of Crowe's character. He play a tough guy who uses fists first, talk later. But after some time I grew to tolerate him. He does have some character development, mostly due to Holly, and I could go either way with that. We aren't given a lot into the other characters' background, but it works for this film. <br/><br/>As mentioned, the subject matter of the film is one I do not generally enjoy. What with the swearing, prostitutes, pornography sounds, and the like. However, it is not explicit at all, save for one nude woman in the beginning (which was censored in my country), and the swearing. For a movie of this type, I would say it is one of the more tamed ones in terms of what they show. <br/><br/>Set in the 70's, the mise-en-scene does a great job at bringing alive the era. As well, the story is engaging and fun. However, I am a little surprised that there isn't a romantic line in the film. Having said that, there is also not much of a female counterpart to the protagonists, in the sense that there is no presence of strong female characters. Amelia and Holly do portray that hardiness, and have quite a lot of screen time, however, the fact that they are young girls is a little concerning. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but if I had to say who the four main characters in the film are, it would be: March, Healy, Holly, and Amelia. Two middle-aged men, and two teenage girls. Think of that what you will."

","We have all seen Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe in far better movies than this and we know what they are capable of. It's more their way of playing that kept me in action and not the story, which was predictable. I know, it was just a comedy, but I have some standards and I want something more than just the average screenplay. Never the less, there were many moments that I enjoyed not only because of the humour, which was good and nothing more, but thank's to the messages the movie wanted to sent us, about many things, which I don't want to spoil. Well, in order to conclude, it's a movie that it's better to see it with your friends (as I did), you will enjoy it better and you will have fun. It's easy and it's perfect to relax after college or work, on Friday evening.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>P.S. I loved the face of Ryan in the biggest part of the movie. I'll not say anything more. You'll know when you see it."
"danielharden","8","2","5","5 June 2016"," A Shane Black comedy n'stuff
","What do you get when you cross Cutris Hanson's LA Confidential with Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang? The answer is this entertaining crime comedy centred around a porn film in 1977. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe make an unlikely pairing as together they investigate a missing persons case which escalates quickly into insanity and hilarity.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe portrays Jakson Heely, a character who shares similarities with his LA Confidental character Bud White. Crowe plays the brute with a softer side fairly well, making a mini comeback after some less than stellar performances in films such as Les Miserables. As good as Crowe is, he isn't the stand out star of this show, the would go to Ryan Goslings brilliant performance as the alcoholic buffoon Holland March. Gosling embodies the clown role of the film, perfectly executing the many, many gags he's faced with delivering. Goslings performance plays a big part in my enjoyment of this film and finally shows that the actor isn't just a pretty face.<br/><br/>The film is a funny film, thanks to Crowe and Gostling for their delivery is definitely in order for the films humour working, but their delivery would have been for nothing if the script wasn't funny to start with. Also the direction and editing are also great in pulling off some of the physical comedy of the film. Long story short the team behind this film work brilliantly together to compliment one another and create a genuinely amusing movie.<br/><br/>The only issue I had with this film was the crime story itself. As the film progresses it seems to shift from a mysteriously cursed porn film to yet another government conspiracy to which I am still confused as to how that was resolved. The films climax centres around our protagonists retrieving a porn film to which the story is evidence against the department of justice for illegal activity... But everyone involved in the films making is dead and its a PORN film, so I'm struggling to see how this singular piece of pornographic evidence is enough to take down someone high up in the ranks of the police force. Sure Chet is alive to testify but that is never specified and is that really enough?<br/><br/>Overall The Nice Guys is a really nice film. Although the overall story gets a bit sh*t the characters and the humour will compensate for this to the end. Ryan Gosling gives the performance of his career so far and deserves a special mention for his work on this film. This is a cool movie filled with porn, murder n'stuff."
"The-Sarkologist","9","2","5","4 June 2016"," A Journey Back to the 70s
","Okay, like a lot of movies, I wasn't really all that sure what to expect from this one, except that from the poster ads it seem like one of those buddy movies (I didn't check out the trailer on IMDb, nor did I see one at the cinema). Okay, from the brief synopsis it said something about a couple of detectives and the porn industry, so I was a little unsure, expecting it to be a little sleazy. However, while it was a little sleazy, it was also absolutely hilarious – in your typical black comedy type of way (and yes, the comedy was really black, especially what happened to one of the bodies that they accidentally discovered).<br/><br/>Anyway, the film opens in 1977 (and the entire film is set in the late seventies) with a kid stealing one of his father's girly magazines from under his bed. Suddenly the girl in the centerfold comes crashing through his house (in a car) and in the valley below. We are then introduced to the two main characters: Healy, who is a strong man that basically discourages sleazes from messing with young girls; and March, who is sort of a private detective, but makes his money more by ripping off his clients than actually solving cases. They end up crossing each other's paths when they both become involved with a young girl named Amelia – Healy being hired to deal with a couple of guys that are following her, and March to actually track her down. As what ends up happening in such cases, both of them quickly discover that they are right out of their depth. Not only is Amelia mixed up in the porn industry, but somebody is going around killing her associates one by one.<br/><br/>The thing that I really liked about the film was the retro feel about it, while dealing with issues that are still relevant today – pollution and environmental degradation, government corruption, and corporate white washing of scientific evidence. As the film opens we are told that Los Angeles is facing a smog crisis, though while at first this seems to be a bit of background information, it soon become evident that this is a major part of the movie's plot (especially since Amelia is involved in an environmental protest group). It also soon becomes clear that the death of the porn star Misty Mountain is connected to this hunt for Amelia (though the lady that hires March swears that she saw Misty Mountain in her house two days after her death).<br/><br/>The thing is that this film is a detective film, and one that harks back to the 70s style of detective mystery. It is not so much a 21st Century film set in the 1970s, but rather a 1970s style film that was made in the 21st Century. In fact it was this real retro feel about this film, and that it shows how the concerns we have today are very much the same concerns we had back in the 70s, that was the main reason that I really enjoyed this movie. Oh, and also that it had me in fits of laughter."
"dobikrisz","8","2","5","1 June 2016"," A good buddy movie
","This movie doesn't make anything new, doesn't make you thinking about the meaning of life but it's a great fun. The story isn't a big thing but the main characters save the whole show. They are cools and there is a bunch of hilarious conversation them. I don't really remember saw Ryan Gosling in this kind of movie but he do it great. One more good point to this movie that it doesn't stop for too long time. It always go on maximum round and you have no time to bored. The only reason why i don't give 10 point because it does not have anything surprise and does not do anything advanced and unremarkable. It wont be the best movie in your life but if you give it a chance you wont regret it."

","The movie was a light comedy. I guess it is definitely a one time watch. <br/><br/>The plot revolves about 2 private detective trying to find Emma. It shows how they cross each others path and how they create a dependency. It is funny for most of the parts. Adding the porn industry makes the movie colorful. Somethings teenagers would love to relate to. You come out with a smile on your face. There were of course things out of the blue but well you can just smile about it.!<br/><br/>There were moments of super good comedy which stitched the movie together. However it was Russel's brilliance acting, which kept the plot in place."
"bartonj2410","8","2","5","28 May 2016"," Crowe and Gosling are brilliant together in another winner from Shane Black
","Yes, oh yes, The Nice Guys is every bit the hilarious and entertaining movie I was hoping for. Part action, part buddy comedy, The Nice Guys is the latest movie from Shane Black and believe me when I tell you, there is so much fun to be had at the cinema with this one.<br/><br/>Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a hardened private eye who chooses violence as his method of business. On the other hand, Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a bit of a bumbling private eye, not akin to the violent methods of Healy's choosing.<br/><br/>When the mismatched duo are paired together to investigate the death of fading porn star, Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio), they begin to unravel a web of corruption and lies, pointing toward murder over suicide. They are hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), a girl who holds the key to the whole conspiracy, before others with cruel intentions do.<br/><br/>First things first, The Nice Guys is really driven by the great on-screen partnership of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, who share such an unbelievably good chemistry as the two private eyes who couldn't be more different.<br/><br/>This is the best Crowe has been since State of Play in 2009 and he has no trouble at all selling the tough guy persona of Healy. The comedy was something I thought Crowe could struggle with however, having seen him do a few interviews recently and after his performance in The Nice Guys, I had no need to worry.<br/><br/>Crowe is funny in this but Gosling is absolutely hilarious. He proved he could do comedy in Crazy, Stupid, Love but there is so much more to the comedy he performs in The Nice Guys. A lot of it is verbal but there are some moments of physical comedy that Gosling nails, particularly one sequence in the movie's finale that was rather quite brilliant.<br/><br/>The two are aided by a brilliant script, full of enough wit and quips, written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi. Black is no stranger to writing both movies and characters of similar ilk, having written the first two Lethal Weapon movies and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which he also directed. It's not only Crowe and Gosling who benefit from the script either with Matt Bomer shining as the sinister John Boy and Angourie Rice almost stealing the show as Holly March, Holland's rather persistent daughter.<br/><br/>I understand that The Nice Guys hasn't performed well so far at the box-office which is a real shame. I urge anyone who likes to be entertained to go and spend two hours watching this at the cinema. Trust me, those two hours will fly by and we could do with having more movies like this being made."

","I got to the local movie house to see this latest action-comedy from writer/director Shane Black over the weekend, which I refer to as ""Chinatown"" meets ""Boogie Nights"". <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe team up as a bumbling PI and, I really don't know how to describe Crowe's character - he just sorta beats up dudes who harass little girls - for cash! <br/><br/>Like the aforementioned ""Chinatown"", the film is a period murder mystery detective story set in LA, including political corruption, and like ""Boogie Nights"", it's a comedy set in the 1970's porn industry! <br/><br/>Gosling is very funny, and Crowe is too, in a different sorta way as a washed-up bloated almost Orson Welles-ish version of himself! The real star here though is the young actress who played Gosling's daughter. She steals every scene she's in, and I definitely see stardom in her near future. <br/><br/>Definite recommend on this one, and, like a lot of Shane Black films, this is a good one to see with an audience. Kim Basinger co-stars."
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","2","5","27 May 2016"," L.A. Confidential if Done by Blake Edwards
","The titular ""Nice Guys"" are two formerly functioning members of the boys in blue who now scrounge up a living working on the fringes of the law. Holland March (Gosling) is a private dick who largely keeps his clients on a leash just long enough to get paid extra for little work. Jackson Healy (Crowe) on the other-hand barely scrapes by as an enforcer of sorts; beating people up on behalf of anyone with the right money. The two cross paths when the secretive and frightened Amelia (Qualley) hires Healy to keep March off her back, but after an escalating set of circumstances, the two boys team up to find out who Amelia really is and why she's on the run.<br/><br/>On the face of it, The Nice Guys has all the outward themes and calling cards that make director Shane Black's oeuvre so appealing. The story twists and turns with the erudition of a Peter Cheyney pulp novel only played up for belly laughs. There's the obligatory precocious child who's often too clever for his/her own good, this time played by Angourie Rice. Then there's the crackling dialogue whose machine-gun wit and irascible one-liners impresses even in his lesser efforts. Here, the script is a perfect blend of Lethal Weapon (1987) pacing and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) sardonic witticism, with a touch of seventies style to add ironic snark.<br/><br/>If one were to find fault in the film's finely tuned, well-oiled machine it'd be the obviousness of the villain. With tons of effort made to establish the film's tone and groove into the plot twists and reveals, you'd think they wouldn't tip their hand so much. No matter; less time thinking about the intricacies of the plot leaves more time to revel in Gosling and Crowe's deft, pitch-perfect acting, the gleeful, uproarious laughter and the gaudy seventies swag.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys is L.A. Confidential (1997) as done by Blake Edwards. It's smart, funny, effortlessly assembled and easily accessible. The story is tight and clever which more than makes up for any far- fetched tomfoolery and the themes are similar to those of Shane Black's other efforts though it never feels like he's resting on his laurels. Give The Nice Guys their due in theaters lest you wind up on the wrong end of a loaded cookie jar."
"rooee","7","2","5","27 May 2016"," A very Shane Black comedy
","Ryan Gosling plays the ""world's worst detective"" Holland March, and Russell Crowe is Jackson Healey, a mercenary tough guy who's paid to punch paedophiles.<br/><br/>This 1977-set LA story starts with a slightly misjudged visual joke portraying the death of adult movie star named Misty Mountains. When Misty's aunt claims to have seen her niece alive, March is hired to find her. Separately, Healey is hired to stop him by force. A series of convoluted events conspire to bring the mismatched duo together, and off they go on a search for a missing girl named Amelia (Margaret Qualley). There are a ton of bad guys standing in the way of their goal, who happens to be the daughter of a sinister VIP from the Department of Justice (Kim Basinger). It's fair to say that March's and Healey's chaotic quest is propelled as much by luck as skill.<br/><br/>Being written and directed by Shane Black, comparisons to Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang and Lethal Weapon are inevitable. It's not quite up to the same standard as those scripts – perhaps future instalments might shed light on Healey's backstory and his neurotic need to be ""useful"", or delve more into the broken home life of March – but there is undeniable pleasure in seeing Black do his thing: banter, pathos, idiocy, lunacy, and old school shootouts. It's probably on a par with The Last Boy Scout, which will do nicely.<br/><br/>Gosling and Crowe are cast subtly against type, playing around with (and against) their ice cool and wounded warrior personas respectively. It's especially effective with Gosling, whose tendency toward stolidity works well in the more deadpan moments. Angourie Rice, playing March's precocious daughter Holly, almost steals the show from the stars. It's a great performance and a great character: she binds these two emotionally stunted men in the way that Murtaugh's family once brought Riggs back from the brink.<br/><br/>The trailers for The Nice Guys have been subtly misleading, presenting the film as a pure knockabout action comedy. Yet Black's skill has always been his ability to combine humour and sincerity. It's refreshing to watch an adult comedy with an intricate (if ridiculous) plot and actual scripted jokes; and one where we're not waiting for the next filmmaker-buddy cameo.<br/><br/>The movie has more in common with the slacker detective pictures of the decade in which it's set – it is faintly reminiscent of Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye in its depiction of nihilism and questionable competence. Another touchstone would be Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, although this is the far less detached and humorous film. Similarly, the period is lovingly reincarnated, in part because it doesn't simply revel in the coolness of the time – here's a movie that's happy to eschew the disco and observe the rubbish brownness of late-70s social decline.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys is a welcome return of one of cinema's most reliable and intelligent mainstream filmmakers. Shane Black is a master of toying with genre (he was responsible for Iron Man 3's bonkers twist); and although the buddy genre may be a familiar one, it remains the perfect vehicle for his talents.<br/><br/>Arguably the worst impulse of the modern action movie is excess, and the curse of the modern American comedy is irony. The Nice Guys offers mercifully little of either, which makes it feel both old and new."
"kimheniadis","7","2","5","27 May 2016"," Fun summer movie filled with mystery, comedy, nudity and violence.
","I was reading some reviews on IMDb, and Whoa!, some people really did not like this movie. I went in without any expectations, and just sat back, and enjoyed a detective noir comedy. <br/><br/>So many people were nitpicking about the music being played in the movie not being out yet in 1977 or that Jaws 2 wasn't out yet. It makes me wonder how many of these people actually knew the release date of these things, or Googled them after (hopefully not during) the movie. To me this is a bit extreme, just enjoy and take in the groovy sounds of the 70's/early 80's.<br/><br/>I loved the combo of an enforcer (Crowe) and an alcoholic P.I. (Gosling) that seems out of it, but is actually very observant. I thought they worked well together. They bickered like an old, married couple. It was just the perfect amount to make it amusing, and not annoying. <br/><br/>The story itself was well done, with lots of twists and turns. And if any part of this was true, it just goes to show how corrupt the government was, even back 40 plus years ago. At times the plot may have gone to extremes (a young girl at a wild party watching porn), but I thought it fit the theme of the story. Life is hard, you see things you can't unsee, and people aren't always around to protect you, so you have to do the best with what you have.<br/><br/>I think Angourie Rice, who played Gosling's daughter, stole the movie for me. She was like a non-naive Nancy Drew. While her dad and partner were bickering or floundering around, she jumped right in and did what was needed. It will be interesting to watch her in more movies, and to see if she does as well in them.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun summer movie. A crime noir, packed with physical comedy and lots of nudity and graphic violence. Four of my favorite things!"

","It's been a while since Russell Crowe made a good movie. He's not quite on the Robert De Niro / Al Pacino spiral of stinkers but he's getting there and with The Nice Guys he continues on his own little run of movie dross. This is about a pair of 1970's private detectives who are hired to find a missing girl who is caught up in corruption involving the porn industry and people high up in office. That may sound interesting but believe me it's not. I found the whole plot of this film utterly dull and If that isn't bad enough the chemistry between Reynolds and Crowe was non existent. I didn't laugh once. This film tries so hard to be a Lethal Weapon or a 48 hours and never comes close. This one plus point from this film is 14 year old Angourie Rice who plays the clever kid really well."

","Kim Basinger plays Amelia's mother, and the character bothers me a lot. She was not at all saddened by her daughter's death. I'm not sure if that was intentional, or just due to Botox. If she ordered to kill her daughter, then why did she even hire the 2 misfit detectives to protect the daughter and possibly mess up her plan? On the other hand, if the GM CEO was the real mastermind, that would mean he hired the the hit-man. Then why would his bodyguards fight against the hit-man? And why would the mother continue to partner with the CEO despite killing of her daughter? Because the issue is the center plot of the movie, not having it resolved leaves us with just 3 people running around and risking their lives for no reason, and therefore a resulting mediocre movie."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Shane Black sold his first screenplay at a very early age which led him to become something of a phenom with the success of that film, Lethal Weapon (1987). Later, he disappeared from Hollywood for about 10 years before resurfacing in 2005 by directing his own terrific script with the immensely entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (my favorite movie of that year), and then hitting big-budget time with his script for Iron Man 3. This time, Mr. Black (directing and co-writing with Anthony Bagarozzi) returns to the detective-farcical-comedy-mystery-action genre and even adds an element of being a 1970's period piece.<br/><br/>Black's rapid-fire wise-cracks were perfect fits for Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr, and for this project he's working with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe  both fine actors, though neither known for their comedic work. What's clear from the beginning of the film is that both Gosling and Crowe are fully committed to the material and their respective characters. Gosling plays a boozy Private Detective and single dad who just can't quite get things right, while Crowe plays a hired-hand bruise type – think of his Bud White in L.A. Confidential (1997), only with an extra 50 pounds and a lot of miles. These two damaged boys play off each other very well, and with Black's dialogue and visual gags, the film provides a good number of laugh out loud moments  more silly than the sophomoric humor that's so pervasive at multiplexes these days.<br/><br/>Of course for comedy to really click, there needs to be some type of story to follow. In the opening scene a young boy (Ty Simpkins) watches as a car slams through his house, culminating with a ""model/actress"" named Misty Mountains meeting a not-so-pleasant ending. We then learn that Gosling's Holland has been hired to find Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who bears an uncanny resemblance to Ms. Mountains – with two significant exceptions. Simultaneously, Amelia has hired Crowe's Jackson to convince Holland to stop searching for her. Soon enough, Holland and Jackson are working together on the ""case"" that mixes in the Auto industry (Big 3), Porn industry, Justice Department (government conspiracies), environmental protesters, Killer Bees, LA parties, LA smog, The Waltons (John Boy), The Rockford Files, Detroit, and Richard Nixon  all hot topics in this 1977 era.<br/><br/>As much as the story is needed, it really doesn't much matter. This is a movie of moments  some of them featuring funny words, while others focus on pretty astute physical comedy. Gosling (and his stunt double) provides some pretty impressive gags as he is bounced and slammed around for most of the run time. The surprising heart of the film  and moral core  is Holland's daughter Holly played by Angourie Rice. Despite the title, she is really the only ""nice guy"" in the whole film, and her good-hearted nature keeps us rooting for Gosling and Crowe, despite their flaws.<br/><br/>Other support work comes from Matt Bomer as a ""John Boy"" hit man, Keith David, Lois Smith, Yaya DaCosta (quick, name another Yaya), Beau Knapp (as the toothy Blueface), Jack Kilmer (Val's son as a ""projectionalist""), and Kim Basinger (re-teaming with her LA Confidential co-star, Crowe). Also playing a significant role are the mid-to-late 1970's vehicles, the period music and houses and décor that puts us right in the moment, and the clothes and hairstyles that are sure to inspire a chuckle or two.<br/><br/>Fans of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang will surely find plenty of laughter here  despite one of the worst trailers in recent memory and even if the film is lacking the one thing it advertises – nice guys."

","PROS: 1. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling work really well together, they have good chemistry. <br/><br/>2. The set pieces are amazing, the movie pulled off the 70's vibe.<br/><br/>3. The movie made me laugh, it has physical humor mixed with intelligent humor, and at times it blended really well together.<br/><br/>4. The cinematography, the directing, and the music blended well.<br/><br/>5. The movie forces the viewer to examine the story, there's so much going on, and you can miss an important detail if you're not paying attention.<br/><br/>CONS: 1. The plot is extremely, excessively, and overly complicated, I believe the movie could've went for a more subtle approach, maybe it did, but I feel like the plot could've been toned-down a notch. <br/><br/>2. Crowe and Gosling engage in some small conversations that ultimately lead nowhere; for example, Gosling tells Crowe that he has no sense of smell, the screenwriter could've created something cool with that within the context of the movie, but it really doesn't cater to the story in any kind of way, and I was disappointed by that (truly missed opportunity).<br/><br/>NITPICKING: In the opening scene, I know that the boy's parents were sleeping, but you know damn well that a car traveling that fast and going threw somebodies house like that would wake up the whole damn neighborhood.<br/><br/>OVERALL, The Nice Guys is a fun movie to watch.

","The first 40 minutes of the film are amazing. The tempo and the beat of the story feel very natural and all of its elements seem to be mixing well together. The story itself is an interesting spin on the classical detective movies of the 70s. My main issue is that like many other films, this one also becomes overwhelmed with its great premise and isn't really sure what to do. Maybe the most staggering case of a great first half and below mediocre second one that I've seen. The wrap up is laughable and doesn't live up to the great start. Crowe and Gosling are great. Matt Bomer is a gross miscast. The movie is competently shot and well directed, but as I already said it seems like it was only a good idea for a story and when it was time to expand on it everything fell apart. Ultimately tolerable movie and if youre not too picky and only looking to be entertained I think youre going to enjoy it."

","A buddy cop throwback in more ways than one, The Nice Guys follows a pair of mismatched private eyes in pursuit of a grand conspiracy that connects everything from porno to the auto industry. It revels in the late-70s setting, poking fun at the fashion, décor, celebrity and personal habits of the era, but at heart it feels a touch more modern.<br/><br/>I was struck, repeatedly, at the tonal similarities to the Lethal Weapon franchise, so it was with no great shock that I discovered Nice Guys' director, Shane Black, made his first bucks as a screenwriter for those Mel Gibson action/comedies. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are the new Gibson and Glover, an odd couple whose pursuit of the truth (and the accompanying payoff, naturally) only barely supersedes their grumbling dislike for one another. Crowe is the anchor, your typical gruff exterior with a warm, chewy center, but Gosling steals the show as his loopy, desperate, unpredictable counterpart. They both get some strong one-liners (and one spectacular silent team-up gag in an elevator), but for my money, Gosling does more with his.<br/><br/>The plot never fully recovers from a risky swerve at the end of the second act, and it plays the pesky kid tagalong card way too often, but it's not trying to be fine art and such missteps sometimes go with the territory. It is what it sets out to be, for better or worse. I enjoyed myself."

","Shane black is one of the most interesting film makers working today, for good or for bad his work is always at the very least fun, I'll even admit to enjoying the predator in a mystery science theatre type of way.
Many film historians would have you believe that film noir is dead... they are lying to you. I will admit that for a genre that 70 years ago was one of the biggest they are few and far between these days. There was a small resurgence in the 90s with films like LA confidential and the big Labowski. In recent years they have been disguised at other genres e.g. sin city and dark city. But for the last ten years it has just been Shane black keeping this genre alive.
Maybe it is too early to say but I believe this to be one of my favourite films. It's funny and witty in all the right places. The action is fast paced and never disappoints. The 70s setting suits Russel Crowe down to a tie. In this he is a large brute of a man that apposes Ryan goslings scrawnier more quick thinking detective."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","7","1","2","8 March 2019"," A film filled with witty banter, adequate action, and an incredible 1970's soundtrack.
","I'll be honest that the trailer for this film is the main reason I went to go see it. The few bits revealed in it definitely painted a picture of a smart and funny film. The pairing of Ryan Gosling with Russell Crowe was an interesting one, but definitely works on the ""buddy cop"" adventure level. While Gosling had almost every funny line, the action brought to the film via Crowe's slightly heavier form really helped to balance things out. The full film definitely delivered on what the trailer had to offer.<br/><br/>With dialogue that comes fast and full of quips, I was laughing throughout most of this film. It almost has a ""self-aware"" feel to it, as each failed piece of the investigation would have normally led to the next logical step. As it is rated R, it unfortunately has an incredible amount of questionable material, including plenty of nudity (as the main plot revolves around pornography), incessant cursing, and regular violence. Much of this isn't too distracting, but the heavy-handed social message about pollution and corporate corruption is a bit obnoxious in a film that I was expecting to be fun.<br/><br/>In the end, the Gosling/Crowe dynamic works and helps to propel the film forward between balanced segments of comedy and action. If you focus on what's being said, there's plenty to laugh about, but also a number of good examples of character development. I wouldn't mind seeing this pair of ""nice guys"" again in a sequel.<br/><br/>A film filled with witty banter, adequate action, and an incredible 1970's soundtrack, I give The Nice Guys 3.5 stars out of 5."

"bowmanblue","7","1","2","1 September 2017"," Not 'nice guys,' but nice film anyway
","'The Nice Guys' has always appealed to me, simply by its front cover. I know you should never judge a book (or film!) on such superficial factors, but it just looked so damn cool. And, I'm pleased to say that it is. Maybe simply setting what it – technically – your pretty standard 'who-dunnit' crime caper in the seventies it hardly that new, but it just seems to work. It's about an 'enforcer' (Russell Crowe) and a private detective (Ryan Gosling) who have to team up in order to solve a crime. So, it's effectively your average mismatched 'buddy cop' movie, even though neither of the leads are police.<br/><br/>When you try and 'sell' a movie like this, it's hard to really make it sound as good as it actually is. As I've already mentioned, everything about the set-up is nothing new and it's only real difference is that it's set around forty years ago instead of in present day, you may wonder what makes it worth watching. Well, I guess it's the chemistry between the two leads that makes it work so well. Crowe and Gosling really do play up the 'mismatched' element of the story to perfection. However, just because they're funny, doesn't really mean that I'd call this film a 'comedy.' The humour is all very 'black' and even when you're laughing out loud, it's probably because someone has just been hurt! I won't go into the plot too much, as with most 'who-dunnits' if you give away what and why they're investigating you run the risk of spoiling what's in store. I guess 'The Nice Guys' won't be for everyone. It's not just the humour that's dark. I mentioned that people get hurt and there some fights and actions scenes that are up there with the best of serious cop dramas and action movies. It's one of those films that splits genres. It's never only a comedy, action film or drama, yet it definitely displays elements of all of them. It's also too violent and adult in nature to be watched by younger audiences, so it's strictly for adults who enjoy their murder mysteries dark when a healthy dose of black humour.<br/><br/>It's a great piece for both Crowe and Gosling who look like they're really enjoying themselves. And it shows. As I said, 'The Nice Guys' probably isn't for everyone, but hopefully it will at least gain a cult following that it deserves."
"brando647","9","1","2","26 August 2017"," THE NICE GUYS Deserves a Lot More Love
","The most overlooked, underrated movie from 2016 was, without a doubt, THE NICE GUYS. I saw it in theaters on the weekend after it opened in a small theater with no more than a dozen people total. The box office numbers for THE NICE GUYS were depressingly low, being siphoned away to the swarm of big budget blockbusters that, let's face it, weren't all that impressive that summer. I treated myself to a double feature that afternoon, starting with the latest X-MEN and closing out with THE NICE GUYS. Needless to say, Shane Black's retro detective buddy comedy was the far superior film and I just wish more people had given it the attention it deserved. We've got superhero movies hitting us from every direction; we've rebooting reboots; we're regurgitating old properties and turning toy brands into franchises. So when an amazing, original movie like THE NICE GUYS comes along we need to pay attention and give it the love it deserves. Why are we wasting theater space on yet another tired TRANSFORMERS installment but my chances of getting another round with March and Healy are low-to-none? I think the only, and I mean only, mistake this movie made was being released in May at the start of the summer movie season. If the studios have played it smart and released it in the winter when audiences aren't bombarded with two and a half hour CG explosions, this movie might've gotten the love it deserved. Because this movie is awesome.<br/><br/>It's set in the '70s Los Angeles in the midst of the national gas crisis. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a sleazy private detective who finds himself teaming with the more honorable hired muscle Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) in getting to the bottom of a mystery revolving around a missing girl and a dead porn actress. THE NICE GUYS is equal parts action and comedy, with Gosling and Crowe giving what are probably my favorite performances from two actors I don't generally associate with comedy. March is an alcoholic who's still reeling from the death of his wife. He's raising his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) alone and makes a living pursuing the sort of cases that might involve ripping off old ladies for on-going payments. Healy is a loner, living above a club with only his aquarium for company, who'll put the hurting on troublemakers for the right amount of cash. The two cross paths when Healy is hired to ""send a message"" to March to stop trailing a frightened young girl named Amelia (she's a person of interest in March's case). Soon Amelia goes missing and a couple of thugs (including Keith David because, as I mentioned, this movie is awesome) come terrorizing Healy in search of her; Healy recognizes there's someone with more sinister intentions pursing this girl and he turns to March for help in locating her. March reluctantly agrees and we're off on one of the best buddy action/comedies in decades from the writer of LETHAL WEAPON.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp. The laughs are consistent. The action is brutal. THE NICE GUYS succeeds on every level. I would've never pegged Gosling or Crowe for these sort of semi-comedic roles but they nail it. I want to see a sequel with March and Healy on their first official case as a professional investigation duo, with Holly tagging along despite the mens' warnings in sort of a ""Penny in Inspector Gadget"" role. Holly is precocious for her age and acts as March's unofficial partner, meaning she's the sober one and keeps him on track. Angourie Rice keeps pace with the heavier hitters of the film and never falls into the pitfall of being ""the annoying child actor"" who ruins an otherwise fantastic movie. She's just as vital a team member. The conspiracy uncovered by the trio is complex without being convoluted and it makes for an interesting story built around the legitimate gas crisis the United States encountered in the era. It's a fun period piece from a fun period. We don't get enough period pieces from the '60s or '70s anymore so I love it when one comes along and, even better, when it's done well. THE NICE GUYS has everything you could want and I don't want to spoil much of anything so I'm trying to be sparse with the details, but I really encourage you to check this movie out if you haven't. By the end, I imagine you'll be aching for another go with the Nice Guys P.I.s as much as I am."
"AngusH","8","1","2","26 August 2017"," The Nice Guys
","Shane Black has been known for his creative writing, clever use of violence and a knack for great humour, we've seen this in Lethal Weapon. This paired with superb characterization and great acting from both Russell Crowe (Jackson Healy) and Ryan Gosling (Holland March) provide the back bone for a fantastic movie. <br/><br/>While the cliché of the serious, hard hitting macho man paired with the witty, surprisingly smart side kick has been used and abused in many detective / cop comedies. The Nice Guys get away with it. The various interactions between March and Healy along with March's daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) are fresh and entertaining. Healy's seriousness is offset by a down in the dumps, depressed, drunken March whose inebriated antics and don't give a **** attitude will have you weak at the knees.<br/><br/>The over the top nature continues to remind the viewer its a movie, the characters never really focused on the immanent and direct danger. This steals most of the serious tones and allows the viewer to take the film with a grain of salt. It plays off completely unnatural reactions to vastly unrealistic movie situations (as many action comedies do) yet at the same time throws in touches of realism that pulls things back into perspective without losing its comedic effect (e.g. the exceptional scene of March punching the glass and slitting his wrist).<br/><br/>I know the previous paragraph is a cliché for modern crime / action comedies (e.g. The Others Guys, Deadpool for example) however, The Nice Guys plays into a genuinely interesting and compelling plot that isn't afraid to push boundaries, woven in with a 70's theme that adds a brilliant extra dimension. <br/><br/>Superb acting and hilarious characters keep it from being another ""passable movie."" So while the movie is a little bit clichéd, it's refreshing, original, comedic take on a already strong movie formula will no doubt have you laughing. This paired with a great, original plot, keeps you entertained and captivated for the full 2 hours. Highly recommend this movie."
"rjm-geo","6","1","2","21 August 2017"," It's not Boogie Nights.
","After the positive reviews I was expecting better.<br/><br/>A lot of work was done on the locations, wardrobe, and sets to make it look like 1970's Los Angeles, that's probably the highlight of the film, though Russel Crowe, Ryan Gosling, and Angourie Rice all do fine work here.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie. Watching it I bounced between enjoyment and annoyance. Overall though, it ended up frustrating me.<br/><br/>I assumed this was going to be a detective procedural. That's how it starts out, and the first half of the film builds up a puzzle/mystery that drew me in and, normally, should have led somewhere. Then around the half way mark it drops that idea and in favor of ... well, stuff.<br/><br/>Maybe this one got hacked to bits in the editing suite, maybe it was just put together incompetently but the end result is a mess. It starts out as Get Carter, ends as Beverly Hills Cop, with bits of the A-Team and Boogie Nights spliced in for good measure. It's hard to stay on board for the ride."

Enough said about that, let's get to the review.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Set against the backdrop of 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys opens when single father and licensed PI Holland March (Gosling) is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. As the trail leads him to track down a girl named Amelia (Qualley), he encounters less licensed and less hands-off private eye Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, the situation takes a turn for the worse when Amelia vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only party interested. As both men are forced to team up, they'll have to take on a world filled with eccentric goons, strippers dressed as mermaids and even a possible government conspiracy. Starring: Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling Director: Shane Black<br/><br/>The Ugly: Okay, in this movie Gosling is supposed to be an alcoholic. You have to look really close to see it. Why they kept it hidden in the movie is beyond me. It could have given the movie so much more.<br/><br/>The Bad: Much like the alcoholism, early in the movie you have to look to see what the main story going forward is all about. It does come to light, but it takes about thirty to forty minutes to find out what is going on. You don't even see the main villain in Matt Bomer until the last thirty minutes of the movie. But that's okay because of the ""good.""<br/><br/>The Good: As I said above, Shane Black did it again. He made a great movie based off one of his scripts. Yes, he wanted this to be a TV series, but Fox wanted Lethal Weapon. So he made this into a movie. That's okay, I don't think it could have been done without the two main actors. They played so well off each other. Ryan and Russell were comedy gold in this movie. Russell as the enforcer is always a golden ticket. And the ""buddy cop"" aspect in Los Angeles is a staple for Black. Why mess with almost perfection?<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Everyone needs to watch this movie. Everyone. For you youngsters under seventeen, you best be asking your parent's permission, as there is quite a bit of language and nudity. Can't wait for Black's The Predator.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"

Very funny, with some very tight, clever dialogue. Some scenes and punch-lines are screamingly funny. Very edgy too - certainly doesn't pull its punches.<br/><br/>However, as a drama, it's less good. The crime plot is okay, and was initially very intriguing. However, after a while it falls back on fairly conventional developments and contrivances. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are great in the lead roles, showing wonderful comedic delivery and timing. 15-year old Angourie Rice almost steals the show as March's daughter and delivers on the promise she showed in These Final Hours.

The story itself turned out to be better than i expected, the trailers really didn't give away the main plot points.<br/><br/>Although Gosling and Crowe gave brilliant performances, Angourie Rice stole the scenes she was in and for such a young actress she gave a funny and multi layered performance. She provided a lot of comic relief and, unlike most child characters, she served a valuable purpose in the film, which again is a credit to the writer.<br/><br/>The only criticism of the film would be that the plot can sometimes get confusing and requires you to be concentrating at all times. i would defiantly say the first half of the film is better than the second, however both are very entertaining. Overall, it is a solid buddy cop movie and shows there still is life for the genera"

","I meant to go see The Nice Guys when it first came to the theatres, but I don't remember why I didn't go. I finally rented it. Most of what I had seen before seemed great. A mutual from tumblr seems to like this movie and constantly reblogs GIF-sets and screencaps from this movie. All that dialogue seemed wild and fun, so I thought it'd be right up my alley.<br/><br/>An almost constant thought that followed me through the movie was ""this reminds me of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"". No wonder, since it's directed by the same guy. Shane Black really handles neo-noir films very well. Few especially great details were the internal monologues at the beginning of the movie. They were like straight from old time-y film noirs, but way more fun. <br/><br/>The plot was way more intriguing than anticipated. From the screenshots and GIF-sets The Nice Guys seemed more like a comedy than actually thrilling crime mystery. The plot is complex, and it's actually very satisfying and entertaining to see how the story goes, what was going on, all that.<br/><br/>One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the 70's aesthetic and music. I've always had a soft spot for 70's fashion, so movies from the past few years set in the 70's are great at least aesthetically speaking.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys is definitely a fun, thrilling movie, tho I am sceptical if it would be as good the second time."

","The Nice Guys (2016):<br/><br/>Its been a long time since I laughed like hell after watching a movie.All the comedies are left out just as a failed attempts of ridiculousness and some times sex.When I found that The Nice Guys is an Investigative crime comedy starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling,I was like ""How the heck could it even possible?""But than I got known that this hell of a comedy is from Shane Black who brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which also as same kind of unimaginable cast for a comedy.(Robert Downey Jr.)<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk. He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a film maker was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going on.???<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Casting: The Nice Guys would not be the same without Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.These two Superstars of Hollywood teamed up in a most unusual way for this crime comedy and surprisingly they are freaking awesome.There is a scene in this movie where both Russell and Ryan goes in an elevator and when they reach the floor they find a guy with his throat cut and some firing going on.They immediately goes back into the lift for escaping from it.Their expressions in that scene are enough to prove that both of them are not only stars of emotional or kick ass movies.Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are nothing short of perfect. A subtle goofball/straight-man line is drawn between them within their individual approaches to the case, and the back and forth between them is magical, often managing to be blissfully goofy while always remaining grounded and real. Angourie Rice as Holly March,daughter of Gosling is very good and her acting is on par with the legends.<br/><br/>2)Screenplay and Direction: Shane Black did not write any out of the box script or anything.Its just a simple detective buddies investigating a mysterious girl related to the death of a famous porn star. But the way he wrote the funny dialogues and situations are excellent.There are lot of hilarious situations in this film.As a director, Black also demonstrates a fantastic eye for visual comedy, be it Holland struggling to handle a gun, a magazine, and a lit cigarette simultaneously while in a bathroom stall, or Holland and Jackson stepping out of an elevator to an incredibly violent scene. From the movie's opening shot, taking the audience up and over the dilapidated Hollywood sign, Black ensconces you in The Nice Guys' noir world, and you really don't want to let it go by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>3)Music: There is this funky music playing in the background helped the movie a lot.<br/><br/>So,The Nice Guys is awesome and the credit entirely goes to the unexpectedly hilarious performances of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.Loved u both<br/><br/>My rating 7.5/10"

","Do audiences demand more cliché laden films or is that film producers and studios are incapable of producing time worthy stories and are training to watch clichés and remakes? Well, this is not a social experiment just a film review intro.<br/><br/>Original simplicity is remarkably difficult to achieve in film nowadays because of the above chicken and egg paradox. Viewers do not mind a film using elements or paying homage to genre defining films as long as the characters and the story make sense without distractions. The team behind Nice Guys has managed to create a smart film about two awkward and unique characters for Gosling and Crowe who are trying to solve a mystery involving the death of a porn star in 70s LA.<br/><br/>Watch it!"
"milkaa","8","1","2","15 January 2017"," Watch it with an open mind and smiles are guaranteed
","I've seen reviews of this that say ""poor depiction of the 70's"", ""the daughter ruined the whole thing"", ""the characters are poorly shaped"" - all valid if you're eager to see this movie as a failure even before you've watched the first five minutes.<br/><br/>What I saw was one of the funniest cop/detective comedies since The Other Guys, starring a duo with just as much potential as Chan and Tucker in Rush Hour.<br/><br/>After recent memory was soiled with all sorts of awful Kevin Hart/The Rock combos, The Nice Guys was a breath of fresh air. Crowe and Gosling were solid and clearly enjoyed the whole thing, and while the script may have been found lacking at times, it was the humor (and arguably Gosling's overacting) that saved the day every single time. <br/><br/>Those of you watching this in the States, I beg you: if you've lived through the 70's, watch this without judging the setting too much. It wasn't meant as an accurate biopic, and looking for flaws will just ruin your experience.<br/><br/>Look out for some old school references and be prepared for a whole lot of random humor. As stated above, I would see this morphing into a trilogy, similar to Rush Hour. All it needs is the right follow-up and a script that keeps playing on Crowe's and Gosling's abilities. <br/><br/>8/10 - would definitely watch again, easily a solid addition to the weekend movie shelf."

","Giving it 6 out of 10 (even though I did not watch the whole thing) because some people might consider this point to be picky, but... Watching dialogue between the two main characters was too difficult knowing that the one had broken the other's arm and that the matter was not prosecuted. Maybe they should have included some justification for letting that slide? Maybe it could have been funny, but the way it is presented seems ridiculous to me. Also, it was difficult to follow. I got the impression the private investigator was crooked but that was not clear to me from the discussion between him and the elderly female client. Also, it seemed heavy on the political correctness. Like a corrupt White Knight, the tough guy goes around breaking other men's faces and arms for their crimes against females. And the wimpish PI answers to his daughter. I suppose the breaking of the PI's arm (without recourse) could appeal more to women/females as well. And that's the way it is, according to me."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","24 December 2016"," Another clever neo-noir comedy from Shane Black
","In many ways, Shane Black's ""The Nice Guys"" is just his earlier film, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" playing 1970s dress up. Considering it's been more than 10 years since that hilarious crime comedy, I'll gladly take ""Nice Guys"" being any semblance of it.<br/><br/>Like ""Kiss Kiss,"" ""Nice Guys"" takes place in Hollywood and tells the story of a tough guy and a bumbling idiot trying to solve a case involving a dead/missing women. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire who's been paid by a young woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley) to keep some guys off her back. He runs in with Holland March (Ryan Gosling), a private investigator living with his teenage daughter (Angourie Rice) who has been asked to investigate the death of porn star Misty Mountains, a job that led him to track down Amelia. When Healy realizes there are some other folks after Amelia, he and March team up to find her and figure out why there's a trail of bodies everywhere she goes.<br/><br/>Crowe gets to play stoic tough guy again alongside Gosling, who gets a rare opportunity to do physical comedy as March, a heavy drinker, womanizer and moron whose daughter is a better detective than he is. There's always something subdued about Goslings' performances and in this case it helps balance how over the top his character is written. Again, March echoes Robert Downey Jr.'s Harry Lockhart from ""Kiss Kiss,"" another guy who is in way over his head, suffers an injury that follows him throughout the movie and makes a fool of himself in the face of danger.<br/><br/>Black continues to own his niche as one of Hollywood's best buddy comedy architects and these neo-noir comedies are his finest work. This screenplay (co-written with Anthony Bagarozzi) is witty, of course, as always, squeezing laughs out of violence and sex in clever ways that usually involve putting his characters in uncomfortable situations. <br/><br/>""Nice Guys"" has all the naked bodies and action that you associate with stereotypical adult male entertainment in movies, but Black is somehow always classy and purposeful about it. Hollywood in the late '70s was certainly seedy, a time when the country was rife with vice, but there's a thematic element of being a decent person in indecent circumstances. Of course, this was also a theme of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang."" Both films feature characters covering up exposed women in vulnerable moments.<br/><br/>Despite being a mystery of sorts, the plot is more about the turns than the twists. Black is so good at taking the audience by surprise without needing to engage in smoke and mirrors. Very little happens in predictable fashion, even if that necessitates exaggeration or implausibility, which Black usually ensures will play to humorous effect.<br/><br/>The strong sense of danger that makes ""Nice Guys"" highly entertaining, however, don't completely mask its emotional deficits. Considering the father-daughter relationship at play, dialogue alluding to the problems with the lack of morality of the era and some mentions of the characters' tragic pasts, it's a bit surprising that the film never operates much beyond face value. The ""conspiracy"" hiding at the end of the trail of clues also doesn't mean anything other than raising the stakes.<br/><br/>""Nice Guys"" doesn't quite measure up to ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,"" but both are effortlessly entertaining films that will remain easy to watch for a long time. In fact, Black could role out another neo-noir comedy with the same footprint in 5 to 10 years and I'd watch and enjoy it all the same.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.

","This film contains everything an action-comedy needs. Some good jokes and with some I mean a lot; sometimes I really couldn't stop laughing. It also contains a lot of great action scenes with, of course, good slap stick. The plot is amazing and for me it was unpredictable. The combination of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling is as expected great. Adding the fact that none of the two actors is taking all the credit, though I liked Ryan Gosling's acting and role more. And of course it has something every action-comedy has and needs to have a happy end. I would also like to complement Angourie Rice (Holly) for her great acting work, if she doesn't become the typical child actor, she will have a beautiful and bright future. As conclusion I would say that this film is one of greatest action-comedies I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot) and that if you haven't seen this movie yet that you should definitely check it out."
"Tastentier","10","1","2","9 December 2016"," Just when I was about to give up on Hollywood...
","...I stumbled across this little gem, which has to be the most entertaining and darkly hilarious movie that I've seen in the past three years. Although the film is a buddy crime comedy at its core, to describe it as such doesn't really do it justice. I occasionally felt reminded of classics like Fargo and The Big Lebowski. To say anything more would potentially spoil the movie, which I think is best seen with little to no plot-related expectations.<br/><br/>I do have to add one final note concerning the low IMDb rating though. I found the amount of one-star reviews rather puzzling, so I read about two dozen of them. With the exception of one lady who downrated this gem because Russell Crowe has gained a little weight (and they say men are shallow!), the only bone of contention appears to be the graphic language, especially that of a precocious teenager. I already knew that Americans can be a surprisingly puritan audience, but this is a little ridiculous imho. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that if you happen to be an overly language-sensitive person, or someone who harbors the delusion that the '70s were a more innocent time, maybe this film isn't for you."
"nick-nawar","8","1","2","6 December 2016"," Worth the watch
","This buddy adventure movie has a 70s vibe, a sense of humour, and a story that is compelling enough to keep you watching and a little more. While the plot is no work of genius, this movie is enjoyable, entertaining, and funny. Ryan Gosling does a great job of playing his alcoholic schemer of a private investigator who gets multiple solid jokes in. Russell Crowe comes through with a solid performance that one would not initially expect, and is very believable in his gruff tough guy role. The villains are a little ridiculous, but the main characters hold things together. Even the child actor is surprisingly good. This is no masterpiece, but it's a feel good comedy adventure that doesn't treat the audience like they're idiots and is well worth the watch."

"LenaAndBarry","7","1","2","1 October 2016"," Good not great
","Like that of another film penned (but not directed) by Shane Black, LETHAL WEAPON: it's the film's unlikely duo that pushes the vehicle over the finish line. AGAIN, I get the impression that Shane put all of his effort behind fleshing out each of the disaccording partner-partner dyad, and their relationship, rather than the story they were placed in. Though, to be fair, THE NICE GUYS' tale was extensively more interesting - however, considering how lackluster LETHAL WEAPON's was, that ain't saying much; NICE GUYS' was only half-assed, whereas LETHAL's was about a 1/16 of a buttock. Still, there are no ""oooohhhh"" moments whenever a piece to the puzzle comes into place, BUT there are a few very convenient moments that force the story forward, so that's um...not so good. Pretty yawn-inducing stuff, to be honest.<br/><br/>Beside Gosling and Crowe (and their characters) arduously keeping me engaged, there was also very consistent snappy dialogue that kept me smiling, and Black's subversion of the crime genres' norms - the usual slick and effortlessly cool are replaced with the clumsy (Gosling excels at this) and quasi- realistic - kept me on my feet and entertained. I'm aware this subversion isn't new to Black - he's done it once before (that I'm aware of) with yet another conflicting-couple crime film, KISS KISS BANG BANG. Speaking of which: I'm keeping my fingers crossed that KKBB doesn't follow the same path as the two I've seen.<br/><br/>One last point: The soundtrack is severely lacking solid 70s jams. It's ALWAYS a joy to nod my big head up and down while mouthing/silently singing ""Ay, Ay, Ayyy! Ba de ya - say do you remember"" to September, but I need more! C'mon, Shane!

","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. After seeing the trailer for this movie my wife decided to skip it, probably a wise choice for her.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. But I would not rate it very high, there are too many flaws and much of the writing is lazy, using ""Jesus Christ"" as an exclamation too often and throwing in filthy language gratuitously. <br/><br/>Set in 1970s Los Angeles it involves a dead porn star, a missing daughter, and a corrupt law enforcement. Russell Crowe is Jackson Healy, who it seems earns his living mostly by taking payment to hunt down and beat up people. The example we see early is a 39-yr-old man getting too friendly with a 13-yr-old girl, smoking pot with her, etc. With his brass knuckles on Healy goes to his door, punches him out, and warns him to never see the girl again.<br/><br/>His job leads him to Ryan Gosling as Private Investigator Holland March. After getting beat up by Healy they eventually form a partnership of sorts and the result is a Two Stooges type of story from that point on. There are some very funny scenes, but also some that fall flat.<br/><br/>Cute young Australian actress Angourie Rice is really good as Holly, the PI's daughter who in many respects is more mature than he is. She even drives him places. She has a very natural acting style and a good screen presence, we will continue to see her in featured roles. <br/><br/>Not a good movie, a very dark comedy with lots of shooting and frequent bloodshed, but an interesting diversion for those who enjoy this type of movie."

","Like I find with a lot of Shane black films the final act is often the weakest part of the film, but what proceeds that is often cinema Gold. Nice Guys is no different! <br/><br/>Gosling & Crow are both brilliant & their characters both bounce off of each other perfectly, but for me the standout star from this movie is Undoubtedbly Angourie Rice, every scene she steals and that's no easy job for any actor or actress when working with two of hollywoods finest, but for someone of her age is exceptional!! <br/><br/>The film itself starts off with a blast, extremely funny from the get go, the dialogue is so typically Shane Black. However leading up to final act the film starts to lose pace, IMO becomes slightly messy, the comedy doesn't really stick & finally kind of blindly stumbles over the finishing line. That's the only reason I gave it 7 (mainly because they don't have a 7.5) had the final been stronger it would have been an easy 9."
"bodhi-13262","8","1","2","20 September 2016"," You can never be too NICE;)
","'The Nice Guys' is the latest return to form from writer/director Shane Black. Coming off the unexplained mess of 'Iron Man 3', Black delivers a fun and edgy dark-comedy in the vein of 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'.<br/><br/>1. Never have I been a fan of Ryan Gosling (March), because his acting has always been on a sub-par/mediocre level to me. Yet somehow, Gosling fits perfectly here and blends well into his character. On the other hand, Russell Crowe (Healy) has always been in my top 10 'favorite actors' list, (not that I'm complaining) but he seems to be playing himself in this role. Crowe is most notably known for being an aggressive tough-guy in real life, and he mirrors his character to a fault in this film. Hence the reason I said he's playing himself lol.<br/><br/>2. The plot of this movie is fairly simple and nothing all that special, but the real entertainment comes from great dialogue and interplay between characters. Kim Basinger (Kuttner) has an important role in this, yet her acting is utterly poor whenever she's on screen. The surprising talent comes from young actress Angourie Rice, who plays Ryan Gosling's feisty and responsible daughter Holly. The darker tone of this film comes in the form of Matt Bomer, who plays the villainous hit-man John Boy. Bomer is quite scary and menacing even though he doesn't have much screen- time.<br/><br/>3. Shane Black took a great direction in making this a murder/mystery which keeps the audience compelled. Also the fact that it's based around the death of an incredible hot porn-star (Murielle Telio) and gorgeous women as suspects, there's no reason guys wouldn't like this film;) There is never a boring moment as things move at a good pace, in which I have to give a lot of credit to the editor. Crowe & Gosling are an exceptional pair, just like Gibson & Glover or Downey & Kilmer, but that's what Black does best, writing strong buddy-characters with great chemistry. <br/><br/>This film deserves a lot more praise and recognition because I know movies like this don't draw large crowds. 'The Nice Guys' is pure entertainment, with a perfect balance of crime, action, drama and of course....comedy."

Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe in a criminal detective story that oozes all the little things that made the 70's the 70's. I have to bow down to the fact that the production and acting is in place, almost perfectly. After the end, the expectations missed the target. Yes, I am disappointed. There is humour, there is class, there is a solid performed story and acting. I just think that the total crew behind this film should have twisted something into this movie, for them to discover. Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozi had a story to tell, and wrote it well. Shane Black had the heavy army of actors to switch on to the picture. Can a director with great cast fail even so? Yes. Did Shane Black that? No. He delivered, plain and simple. Could have squeezed the cast much more. Some scenes is little light in comparison to the depth of the story. David Buckley and John Ottman has done a tremendous job regarding the music! Throwing in Kiss and other known stars to be discovered throughout the movie. Entertaining! <br/><br/>To the point. Was the movie bad? No. It could have been a lot better. Now I am settling with a good movie, for my entertainment perspective.<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made and is top notch speaking of the time the story is related to. Music, commercials, clothes... everything is in place. Very well made, indeed! Splendid! - The actors : Splendid! (One word that I use now and then.) - Entertainment : The high class of subtle humour and situations becoming both extreme and odd (a detective having his 13 year old girl as a tail?) creates entertainment. - Age : 15. Nudity, sex and violence. (And Ryan Gosling speaking to a gigantic bumble bee.)<br/><br/>6,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)"

","This is a bromance bashed up with an action film and whipped into a kind of armed screwball comedy. It stars damned slowly because the critical parts are so far apart, but thereafter it moves along in sprightly fashion, syncopated to much gunfire (the great shootout is the most delightfully non-lethal since 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'). Ryan Gosling plays a professional, licensed private eye who, despite his ineptitude, is rather snooty toward Russel Crowe whose role is that of muscle-for-hire with occasional heart of gold. After the latter whacks the hell out of the former, clinically breaking his arm in the process, they begin to come to an understanding and find they're on, like it or not, the same side of the same absurdly complicated case. Slam-bang: lots of fisticuffs, a couple of killings, enough blood and plenty of mindless fun. Ryan Gosling is especially good."

","Following on from directing the superhero sequel Iron Man 3, The Nice Guys provides a typical buddy-cop comedy with two mismatched misfits â€“ the nihilistic world-weary enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) and the ditzy rookie private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling). Set in the smoke-filled world of the 1970s Los Angeles porn industry, The Nice Guys provides a comic take on the sleazy world.<br/><br/>Jackson initially targets, then teams up with Holland and the comedy is derived from the chalk-and-cheese characters working together on a case involving the suspicious death of porn star Misty Mountains and the disappearance of the daughter of a Department of Justice official. Alongside them for a lot of the film is the daughter of Holland March which provides some comic back-and-forths but mostly awkwardness in having a minor involved in adult industry setting.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys is at its best when it takes advantage of the comic chemistry between Crowe and Gosling, a scene involving the fumbling gun while trying to keep the cubicle door open- unfortunately spoiled in the trailer- is a particular highlight. Throughout, Gosling's hitherto undiscovered talent of physical comedy is on display here.<br/><br/>That said, the plot was incoherent and I didn't buy into the story at all, however the film was salvaged by the several belly laughs provided throughout."
"burlesonjesse5","5","3","12","23 May 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Nice Guys
","Shane Black scripted two of my favorite buddy cop films in 1987's Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. With The Nice Guys (my latest review), he directs and sadly his direction is much better than his writing.<br/><br/>""Guys"" playing like an art house version of ""Boy Scout"", is a mixture of clunky dialogue and bone-crunching payoffs. Whereas that 1991 film had a fair amount of nasty wit, The Nice Guys seems to be all look and no feel. Billed as an action comedy, ""Guys"" is patchy kitsch and contains two actors (Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling) that completely strain for comedic timing. Sure its setting of 1977 Los Angeles is light film noir and variably flawless. However, that's about all the movie has going for it. These ""nice guys"" don't finish last but they come real close.<br/><br/>Shot beautifully in a darkened haze, ""Guys"" unfortunately is sloppily edited, contains songs that came out after 1977 (""Boogie Wonderland"", ""September"", ""Boogie Oogie Oogie"", etc.), and unjustly features 70's relic Gil Gerard in the opening credits (was he in the movie cause I just couldn't tell). Basically this picture is not the best way to get your Me Decade fix. Boogie Nights, a film that also dealt in the pornographic industry and City of Angels backdrops, is truly a better option.<br/><br/>Now the story of ""Guys"" which is based on true events that happened to a real-life Marine in the late 90's, has little reason to occur almost 40 years ago. With the exception of skin flick interludes and visions of old school movie projectors, it could have taken place in any time period.<br/><br/>The main character is Private Detective Holland March (played by Ryan Gosling). Gosling's March smokes and drinks so heavily, he teeters close to having liver and/or lung cancer some twenty years down the line (I'm not kidding). March gets paid to find people and now he's on the lookout for a missing girl named Amelia Kuntner (played by Margaret Qualley). Somehow someway, Amelia is connected to a dead porn actress named Misty Mountains (great name). On hand to help March in his quest, is Enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe). Whereas March's job is to find missing persons, Healy's job is to beat people up. Matt Bomer (Magic Mike) plays a murderous villain named John Boy and Kim Basinger makes a cameo as Amelia's two-faced mother. With heighten sound effects editing, ""Guys"" is loud, violent, and the in-jokes are few and far between. I had to rely on the random chuckles of the audience to see what was funny or not.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I remember seeing the trailer for The Nice Guys in February. I automatically thought that the casting of Crowe and Gosling was interesting and sort of out of the box. After seeing the finished project, I realize it doesn't really work. At times it felt like they were in separate movies altogether. Crowe looks a little bloated while Gosling tries too hard to be funny. In truth, Ryan Gosling stumbles around ""Guys"" and the whole time I was kind of hoping he would turn to his forte which is the dark side (remember Ryan in Drive?). Some much for that. The one bright acting spot in ""Guys"": Australian actress Angourie Rice (she plays March's daughter). She has that ""it factor"". I mean I'm not saying she's Meryl Streep but the girl could be a big movie star someday. Rice is like a charismatic, Reese Witherspoon mini me. She's all coiled up with energy and some serious, glowing enchantment.<br/><br/>Bottom line: The Nice Guys with its locations looking more like sumptuous movie sets than actual, recreations of L.A.'s Hollywoodland, litters its script with the name ""Amelia"" and the words ""find Amelia"". It does this so many times you could make a drinking game out of the entire, two-hour running time. As for the procreated bearing, well Philippe Rousselot's cinematography for ""Guys"" is the high point until it evaporates due to the flick's manic choppiness. During the final act of The Nice Guys, Gosling's March quips, ""I think I'm invincible... I don't think I can die"". This movie, well I think its staying power isn't invincible and I think its box office take will die a little. Soon. Rating: 2 stars."

True, there is good chemistry between Crowe and Gosling, but it is Angourie Rice who runs away with the film, as Gosling 11 or 12 year old daughter going on 35. We're in 1970s Los Angeles. The film has a false film noir atmosphere with high living, sex and a blow for saving our environment. Murder, violent murder is in the air, as Gosling, who never goes without a cigarette and his Zippo lighter, and Crowe who is tipping the scales on weight run down clues and the mysterious porno star Misty Mountain, who uses sex to expose a nasty multinational ruining the air...in a save the birds moment. It's a dumb and dumber 'comedy', that has few laughs. The children on the edge of puberty are bright and have potty mouths, that seen out of place in the 1970s but not today. Kim Bassinger, looking beautiful, turns in a fine cameo as a bent high government bureaucrat who is out to stop her daughter's exposure even if it kills her offspring. Matt Domer, formerly of 'Suits', plays the bad guy who leaves a trail of bodies. The consummate Crowe can and does raise a skeptical eyebrow that says it all. Gosling is good as a bumbling private dick who isn't as dopey as he seems. The pair deserve a better film. Rice gets the golden ring of a smart little cookie with a soft heart. No sequels please."

","Crowe is a rough hit man and Gosling is a washed-out young private eye, father to adolescent Angerie Rice.

The MacGuffin is a reel of porno film that has the recorded evidence of the conspiracy spliced into its midsection. Something like that.<br/><br/>What it boils down to is a lot of chases on foot and in cars, considerable blood letting, and a Mount Everest of wisecracks, mostly of the Rated-R quality. The whole production, set in Los Angeles, is colorful and wacky because the time is the early 70s. Terms like ""reefer"" and ""Mary Jane"" are flung about with abandon and we get to listen to the Strawberry Orange Peel or whatever the band was.<br/><br/>If you intend to enjoy this film, it's best to follow the advice of the Roman philosopher Seneca and not expect too much, so you won't be disappointed by some of the rheumatic gags. As the film opens we see Goslings hungover face in the bath tub. When he tumbles out, we see he's wearing a suit. It was hilarious in ""Some Like It Hot."" The film achieves its goal, which is undemanding amusement. Gosling becomes Lou Costello to Crowe's Bud Abott. Rice is Gosling's thirteen-year-old blonde, blue-eyed daughter. She's extremely pretty and delivers a nice performance. It may also be Gosling's best. It's nice to see him as a comic loser rather than a cocky young man.

","To begin, it's one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated films of the last several years (even decades in the genre). Period. And by that, I mean not a great success at the box office, even though it was very* well-reviewed by critics and audiences, alike. If you haven't seen it because you are weary of the beleaguered and hackneyed buddy-cop/P.I. films (ever since Lethal Weapon started the endless cloning process), you must* see this. <br/><br/>It's got loads more to offer,from its kitschy 70's pop culture setting (Including some memorably awful hair, clothes, and Nixon.), a 'groovy'soundtrack filled with 70s Pop & R&B music..but much more. Gosling, charming as always, is the n'er-do-well, boozy, bungling P.I., adored by his oft-disappointed and precocious daughter. He stumbles on a case (deemed initially, at least, as unsolvable but an easy paycheck) offered first by the worried Grandma of an assumed- deceased porn star, and then another case offered by a tough-guy- for-hire/washed-up but capable P.I., (played appealingly by Russell Crowe in one of his best comedy roles, ever) -who is looking for another missing girl.<br/><br/>Eventually (of course! - and we are grateful) they join forces, stumbling into a wider plot that links the two missing women. Along the way, yes, as the genre insists: mishaps and humor. But refreshing, more sarcastic, less broad humor. And more finesse means better laughs- as Hitchcock found that less gore brings greater terror. This duo is 'fab' chemistry. It's enjoyable, more believable, and such** a relief from the formulaic action films endlessly put forth on CGI-laden cookie-cutter releases that gross 10x more, sadly.<br/><br/>Word is the Director, Gosling and Crowe are on board for a sequel; but the studios are dragging their greedy little feet, because the modestly successful box office of Nice Guys takes a back seat to 45 more Pixar/CGI/ or the ubiquitous 'Boys or Girls' Night Out-with hilarious result'..films.

The costumes are cool, the retro scenery is beautiful but, as with all Shane Black movies, the writing is the standout. Black once again proves why he is the master of the buddy film through his incredible ability to write dialogue. This is only underlined by the screen chemistry that Crowe and Gosling have together which is something I could really get used to seeing. It's not just those two that have chemistry here, Angourie Rice who plays March's daughter is quite the actress herself and plays especially well with Gosling. Beau Knapp is also very impressive here as blue faced unhinged hit-man. Everything here was all aces. It was funny, smart, a well written noir mystery, and the actors had a level of chemistry that has me smelling a potential franchise!

","This is a movie you would want to like even before you watched it. Actually what's not to like - a great teaser trailer showing excellent chemistry between its likable stars, quirky comedy set in the America's favorite period - the 70s, also includes some action, adventure and crime. All they need is just an average script which doesn't completely ruin the setup they have done so far and they manage to do just that - nothing less, nothing more. <br/><br/>Mr. Healy (Russell Crowe) has an unconventional job of being a hit-man for women in distress - no questions asked. Mr. March (Ryan Gosling) is a PI always willing to bend the rules. When they both collide literally when working on things loosely related to each other, they realize that its much bigger than anticipated and have to work together. They are effectively supported by Mr. March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) who actually cracks open the case.<br/><br/>Even though it takes a while for the lead actors chemistry to work, it gets magical after you give it some time and patience. The movie suffers from a poor start where the first 15 minutes of its runtime, it just ponders around in a disconnected manner. Once Crowe and Gosling's characters come together and after a brief period of time, the actual plot kicks in. It definitely has an unconventional but a plot with potential, has budget to execute it to scale, able actors to convincingly portray the characters necessary. Instead of using the slick technology and movie making methods to show the action of the 70s period, the movie resorts to the movie making techniques of the actual period which is a shame. It definitely is not an issue with the potential considering Shane Black has helmed the Director's seat for Iron Man 3 and his much older Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is much more tighter (also following similar plot pattern related to homicide in Hollywood).<br/><br/>Angourie Rice playing Holly has a meaty role and she delivers it with aplomb. The overall runtime is a tad too lengthy and easily could have edited out at least 20 minutes or so. Once the overall plot is understood, the runtime looks redundant with unnecessary chases and shootouts where we surely know nothing's gonna happen to the 'Nice Guys'. <br/><br/>Being more slick in execution, quick in runtime could have made it superior - but nevertheless an entertaining romp which is sure to get better with repeat watches."

","Irrefutably, ""The Nice Guys"" reigns compared to R-rated comedy films of this year (with the exception of ""Deadpool""); with the personal obsessions of its director/scriptwriter, narrative intelligence and heart of those buddy comedies of the 80s, Black resumes the power in a suspense/action comedy movie rich in good performances and argumentative ability, in addition to a fascinating travel across time. Despite not having a vast repertoire of works, Shane Black established the odd couples of rough guys in the films, those which possessed a terrible relationship in daily life, but that in the violent and full of action sequences show their good hearts. After his latest project in 2005, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", Black writes - together with Anthony Bagarozzi - and directs what could become in the best of his career.<br/><br/>The film would survive of independent way, without the need to its extreme action and violent scenes thanks to the incredible chemical of its leads, certainly, they are erected as an of the funniest duos in the film world. Black and Bagarozzi transport us back to the glorious 1980s, epoch where lechery, endless party and the psychedelic pornography were booming. Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, a dishonest and unprofessional private eye who immerses himself into an alcoholic whirlwind to forget the death of his wife while trying to educate and raise in a peculiar way his teenage daughter. On the other hand, Russell Crowe plays Jackson Healy, an unorthodox hired enforcer , he does not matter to work for the most indelible person in the world, provided that you collect a acceptable amount of money, he will work for you, complacently. Angourie Rice gets the same prominence than the main duo, she is Holly March, daughter of March and assistant of the couple of private detectives, unconsciously, a girl as charismatic as intelligent, who gains one place almost immediately in the frantic and demanding Hollywood by herself. The funny and hilarious trio will be challenged to solve four cases that ravage the City of Los Angeles: the death of a porn star, the disappearance of a young woman, a criminal conspiracy of high standards and the disappearance of a man from his funeral.<br/><br/>The plot is a genuine and vile MacGuffin, a trick designed by the selfsame Alfred Hitchcock, who permeated each suspense work of his authorship with this clever strategy. The film borrows several references to the ""The Big Lebowski"" classic, considering that it employs each alleged main plot to take us to the true final storyline, some indecorous and dangerous car manufacturers utilize of camouflage the disappearance of a young girl and the death of the porn star to give one message of singular form; nonetheless, Gosling and Crowe involves us in the complex scheme as themselves.<br/><br/>""The Nice Guys"" is a perfect coordinate mechanism, it not is based only in the sequences of shootings, explosions and fights (which have recreated of lucid and entertaining way, perhaps, Marvel instilled in Black this ability after the success in ""Iron Man 3""), the movie combines with dialogs full of jokes, powerful dialogs, clap-worthy dialogs, besides certain nostalgia by the films of the 80s. Although the film did not expect such reception at the box office, was not created for this objective, it is a movie with fundaments and totally faithful to the old buddy movies, is not a commercial product, although it seems like, it is a project that deserves the name of ""film"", in capital letters.<br/><br/>Shane Black earns good marks in a genre that is quickly becoming in monotonous and without surprises. An intricate plot, an extravagant atmosphere, a explosive soundtrack and an ingenious chemical of its leading actors are complemented by a absorbent pace and a nostalgic tone eighties. If you like to enjoy of one action movie, watch ""The Nice Guys"", if you like to enjoy of one comedy movie, watch ""The Nice Guys"", if you like to rekindle the 80s, watch ""The Nice Guys"", if you want to experience the best film of comedy of the year, watch ""The Nice Guys""."

","My quick rating - 7,8/10. Crowe and Gosling team up in an unlikely crime/mystery film that just works. The characters are acted out just the way they should be which is often rare in buddy flicks. Crowe plays the heavy while Gosling plays the heavy drinker. They get paired up when Gosling is a Private detective working a case that Crowe inadvertently gets roped into. The two of course have no interest in working together which adds to the comedy. This movie is filled with underlying dark humor that sometimes does miss the mark, but overall is entertaining. Also incorporating some little shout outs to spotting the time frame (Tim Allens name on the marquee at the Comedy Store for an example) points out the writers/directors attention to detail. Little things such as this pop up to make you appreciate the care that was put into the film. The story itself moves along very well as the mystery of Amelia (Margaret Qualley) plays out in the porn industry. Explaining what I mean would be in spoiler territory, so watch it to see. I will say that after the majority of the film being so good, the ending just seemed to run out of gas. It didn't let the audience down, it just didn't live up to the excellent work that was already presented. But overall, a very well made movie and I could be open to a sequel if they so chose."

"Turfseer","4","1","4","25 August 2017"," Uneasy mix of comic non-sequiturs and violent noir proves tiresome
","Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys stars a rather bloated and unkempt looking Russell Crowe as Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer who plays opposite Ryan Gosling as Holland March, an alcoholic private detective. March is hired by an old lady, Mrs. Glenn, who insists she saw her porn actress niece Misty, through the window of an apartment, despite the fact that Misty was killed in a car accident two days before. March gets on the trail of a mysterious young female, Amelia, who might be involved in Misty's disappearance. Healey is hired by Amelia to prevent March from finding her so he goes over to his house and beats him up. <br/><br/>After Healey and March's initial dust-up, Healey is attacked by two thugs who are looking for Amelia. After fending them off, Healey joins forces with March to look for the missing instigator. While The Nice Guys is designed as a gritty film noir, it also unhappily features the comic machinations of the two principals whose dialogue is loaded with a series of non-sequiturs. If this is your cup of tea, then you'lli probably like The Nice Guys but I found Crowe and Gosling's comic interplay to be repetitious and grating.<br/><br/>The rest of The Nice Guys plot is a bit convoluted to say the least. March, while in an alcoholic stupor, takes a pratfall over the railing in the back of a mansion where a party is going on, and ends up finding the corpse of Sid Shattuck, a porn producer who was involved with Amelia. Meanwhile, March's 12 year old daughter, Holly, is kidnapped by ""Blue Face,"" one of the two thugs who attempted to kill Healey earlier. Holly prevents Blue Face from killing Amelia while inside the car and manages to escape and flee with Amelia. Surprisingly Blue Face is seriously injured by a hit and run driver. Before strangling him to death, Blue Face tells Healey that a notorious hit man, John Boy, has been hired to take out Amelia.<br/><br/>Also in the mix is Amelia's mother Judith (Kim Bassinger), a high- ranking Justice Department official who describes her daughter as unstable to both Healey and March. When the intrepid investigators bring Amelia back to March's house, they can't decide whether her tale of Detroit automaker collusion attempting to circumvent auto exhaust emission standards and her mother's involvement with them is true or whether Amelia is simply a spoiled brat with grand conspiracy theories. The ranting Amelia proves to be one of the more interesting characters in the film with a personality that appears to represent a satire on the over the top, leftist anti-government young people of today.<br/><br/>In addition to Crowe and Gosling's failed comedy routine, The Nice Guys takes an even further turn for the worse by confirming Amelia's story that her mother Judith indeed colluded with the Detroit automakers. Judith sends her assistant, Tally, to divert Healey and March by giving them a briefcase to deliver that is supposedly filled with $100,000 cash, but actually contains shredded magazines. Meanwhile, in the most unpleasant scene in the movie, John Boy ends up killing Amelia.<br/><br/>Healey and March finally figure out that the near-sighted Mrs. Glenn actually saw her niece in a movie that was being projected inside that apartment. It turns out that Amelia spliced in evidence of the Detroit automakers collusion into a film scheduled to be projected at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It's there that Healey and March engage in a wild shootout with the bad guys, one of whom dies and the other two apprehended.<br/><br/>The Nice Guys disappoints grandly with the stereotyped depiction of Judith, the scheming Justice Department official, who is willing to sacrifice her daughter for the good of the American economy. I don't buy it in the least and you shouldn't either. <br/><br/>With its uneasy mix of comedy and noir realism, The Nice Guys ends up trying to have it both ways. The killing of Amelia undercuts the comedy by introducing a tragic element too overbearing for a seemingly light-heartedly designed vehicle."
"Troy_Campbell","6","1","4","27 May 2016"," Hits and misses throughout, but a fantastic lead pairing.
","Set in the late 70s and based around a string of suspicious deaths within the porno industry, this Shane Black joint lovingly harks back to the good ol' days of ultra-violent buddy-cop flicks like Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs. With this breed of movie almost extinct, it's gratifying to see Black breathe life back into it with his trademark dark wit, genre-subverting style and willingness to unleash a spot of sudden violence for nervous laughs. Crucially, he's aided and abetted by charming lead performances from Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, the former a gravel-voiced, hard-nosed enforcer with a noir-ish edge, and the latter a likable loser with dubious parenting skills but a sympathetic past. Crowe and Gosling are the epitome of chalk and cheese, and are all the more delightful to watch because of it; some of the film's finest scenes are nothing more than them chewing the fat about life, albeit their warped life. Unfortunately it's not all rosy for Black's trip down memory lane though. The central mystery is convoluted, boring and ultimately a damp squib, whilst the numerous tangential subplots, infused with pitch-black comedy, often go nowhere, despite lengthy build-ups. On first viewing it's difficult to grasp exactly how entertaining The Nice Guys really is, such are the typical ups and downs of Black's distinctive writing/directing style. Cult classic status potentially awaits, but so does cinematic obscurity."

Then the humor becomes painfully predictable & the plot (what there is of it) disintegrates into a million bits like an exploding pillow. Most annoying of all is the character of Ryan Gosling's daughter.

"peefyn","8","1","5","14 June 2016"," A recommended watch, despite its flaws
","This movie is great fun, and it's easy to narrow down why: The performances from Gosling and Crow, and the characters they portray. Not only are there several instances of hilarious dialogue and banter between the two, but even some first class physical comedy, way ahead of most other action/comedy movies made these days. Especially Gosling has some hilarious moments.<br/><br/>It's hard not to compare this movie with Shane Black's previous film ""Kiss kiss bang bang"", which also includes a hilarious duo that stumble through a mystery that's way bigger than the both of them. There are some differences, though. In KKBB, the balance of competence is very uneven, where Kilmer's character is the competent one, and Downey plays the moral compass. In the movie, they are more even, with Gosling and Crow both playing deeply flawed characters, with each their strengths. The balance works, and much like KKBB, they are hilarious together. In KKBB the female sidekick is also a love interest, while in this movie it is the daughter of Gosling's character. The setting is a bit different, but it is still set in the entertainment industry, and with some similar locations.<br/><br/>The movie suffers a bit from too much build up, with too little pay of. There are several elements introduced that seem like they are supposed to pay of in a funny/interesting way later on, but that end up only being used in one or two gags. This movie would have lent itself perfect for running gags, and there's one that has great potential, but is dropped quite quickly (a character that accidentally kills the wrong person a couple of times).<br/><br/>There seems to always be some sense of self-awareness in Shane Black's movies, where clichés are either broken, or commented upon. Ryan Gosling's character has a moment in the movie here that very much keeps up with this, where he acknowledges the streak of luck he seems to have. I love how Black plays around the tropes and clichés of the genre, but wish that the story/plot would be as solid like KKBB.<br/><br/>So, while this does not hold up to KKBB in many regards, it's still way better than most others out there, and I highly recommend watching it."

However, at first glance THE NICE GUYS seems to be chewing cud already masticated in the 1900s, as alcoholic drug-addled Califorians plot to eliminate the U.S. Middle Class by replacing the Classic Cars of Detroit (such as Mustangs, Corvettes, Continentals, Caddies, GTO's, and Chargers) with an Invasion of Axis Imports from America's Revenge-Minded Enemies of World War Two, led by Germany, Italy, and Japan. As each Trojan Horsepower takes a hundred bucks out of a True Blue American's pocket (or $20,000 plus per vehicle), THE NICE GUYS documents how civil order breaks down, with everyone at risk of Death by Random Gunshot, as bodies rain down from the rooftops (unless they're burned up in arson fires or Smushed by killer foreign cars first). Ryan Gosling's character drives a German Mercedes here. The script for THE NICE GUYS is sprinkled with references to Hitler, since Adolph is having the ""last laugh"" now. Perhaps Warner's warning is that if you think things have been bad the last 50 years, just wait and see how much WORSE things will get with a One Per Center Secretive Billionaire representing the Trilaterals in the White House!"

","The best way to describe this Shane Black film is to call it ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Lite."" It's dark and interesting in a completely quirky way but I found it to be less charming than KKBB. The dark humor is about the same and it often works quite well. Russell Crowe is exceptional and Gosling works well enough. They do have the chemistry required to pull off Shane Black material. The pleasant surprise was the daughter character. She added much needed heart and motivation for both leads to become somewhat better men. <br/><br/>Overall enjoyable and I'm rounding my rating up based on expectations. I expected a truly great film and left the theatre somewhat unimpressed but that's my flaw so setting my sights so high and not a fault of the film itself."

","The Nice Guys is not a good movie. It's not even good as a buddy movie but as a buddy movie it's ... OK. The stuff and nonsense between Crowe and Gosling grows old after a while but for some time it'll keep you entertained. So will Angourie Rice who plays Gosling's precocious, brilliant, and brave young daughter. Until you realize that the relationship between her and her father is a bizarre one; she is the common sense mother to her immature father. That is until she places her life in danger and once she does that you start asking 'Does anyone here have a brain?' And when the answer comes back, 'Nope', you stop caring.<br/><br/>The plot is impossible to follow. I've seen it twice and I'm convinced that a third viewing will not help. Mistaken identity, bad cops, good cops, porn stars, Hollywood stars, and - get this - a 'clean air message' just serve to propel the buddy business into the film's second hour. Finally the film seems to end three separate times, only to begin again with a new reason for being. I'm not convinced that anything but the buddy-business actually mattered."

","The Nice Guys isn't one of the most underrated films of the last few years, because everyone that's seen it seems to love it, but it's definitely under-watched. Not enough people went out to see it, and that's such a shame because it's wonderfully original and Shane Black's best film to date.<br/><br/>The acting from Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling is nothing short of amazing, and it was great to see them in a film together because they are easily two of my favourite actors working today. The chemistry and dynamic between them was electrifying. Angourie Rice was also phenomenal as Gosling's on-screen daughter. She added a lot to the film, and that's saying a lot considering her age and who she was acting alongside.<br/><br/>Shane Black hasn't directed many films, and a couple of the ones he has directed were divisive with audiences, but I was impressed with what he managed to accomplish here. The camera-work was also outstanding, with lots of impressive shots and gorgeous cinematography.<br/><br/>The main driving force behind The Nice Guys, other than the tremendous acting, is the screenplay. The story is fun, compelling, and edge-of-the-seat throughout. There were a couple of jokes which fell flat, but the vast majority of them worked. It could also become a little convoluted at times, but it all built to an explosive and entertaining finalé.<br/><br/>I have very few issues with The Nice Guys, but it's just unfortunate that not enough people went to support it. The film was left wide open for a sequel, but I highly doubt we will ever get one. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is also really good, but, if you can only see one of Shane Black's films, make sure it's this one.<br/><br/>SCORE: 93%"

Gosling and Crowe are both amusing characters even if they're chemistry is only so-so. The movie is often funny although the humor can sometimes be juvenile and cheap. The 70s period seems random, but occasionally is used for a good joke.

","Shane Black as a young man wrote the screenplay to the hard boiled buddy cop action film, Lethal Weapon.<br/><br/>Black has since messed about with the formula making hard boiled mismatched buddy cop comedy action films laced with sleaze.<br/><br/>This is a retro comedy drama set in Los Angeles of 1977. A young washed up private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to find Amelia by her aunt. Amelia has got muscle for hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop him which he does by breaking Holland's wrist.<br/><br/>When two hoods break into Healy's place, he hires March to find what is going on. Accompanied by March's bright and ethically centred daughter, they stumble on a conspiracy that involves the Justice department, the auto industry, the death of a porn actress and reel of a porn movie that exposes a scandal.<br/><br/>The Nice Guy's comes across as an unpretentious fun film. There are nods to Black's previous films, it can be crude in places, the story can be a bit vague but it did make me laugh a lot. Although set in 1977 it is rather anachronistic in places."

"a_chinn","8","0","1","17 July 2018"," Shane Black successfully mines the buddy-cop film formula he helped create
","Terrifically fun buddy-cop film throwback from writer/director Shane Black, one of the folks responsible for establishing the 80s action films subgenera with ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""The Last Boy Scout."" Set in a scuzzy Boogie Nights looking 1970s L.A., an unlikely duo of smart down on his luck P.I. Holland March, Ryan Gosling, and dimwitted hired thug Jackson Healy, a scene stealing Russell Crowe, form an uneasy alliance in trying to find a missing porn actress named Misty Mountains. From there the plot gets more serpentine and complicated, but what makes this film so fun and worth watching is the banter between Gosling and Crowe, where you get hilariously throwaway moments like:<br/><br/>Holland March: Look on the bright side. Nobody got hurt.
Jackson Healy: People got hurt.
Holland March: I'm saying, I think they died quickly. So I don't think they got hurt.<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>Jackson Healy: So, you know the old lady, right? Did you believe her?
Holland March: What about?
Jackson Healy: When she said she saw Misty alive that night, did you believe her?
Holland March: God, no. She's blind as a bat.
Jackson Healy: Uh-huh.
Holland March: She has actual coke bottles for glasses. You paint a mustache on a Volkswagen, she says, ""Boy, that Omar Sharif sure runs fast.""<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>Jackson Healy: The place reeks of marijuana. They're smoking it.
Holland March: I can't smell.
Jackson Healy: What?
Holland March: I got hit in the head a while back. I lost my sense of smell.
Jackson Healy: You can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: You're a detective, and you can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: Aw, this just keeps getting better and better.
Holland March: Wow, that's really insensitive.<br/><br/>Gosling and Crowe have a great chemistry that cries out for a sequel to happen so audiences can enjoy their future adventures in this sleazy 1970s coke filled version of Los Angels (although the film was sadly a box office disappointment). The other standout performer is Angourie Rice, playing Gosling's quick witted and smart-mouthed daughter Holly (reminiscent of Danielle Harris' character in Black's ""The Last Boy Scout"" as Bruce Willis' smart-mouthed daughter), who has some great banter herself with Crowe's Jackson when she finds out what he does for a living:<br/><br/>Holly March: You beat people up and charge money?
Jackson Healy: Yeah.
Holland March: Sad, isn't it?
Holly March: How much would you charge to beat up my friend Janet?
Holland March: What?
Jackson Healy: How much you got?
Holly March: Thirty bucks.
Holland March: That's good, this conversation is over.<br/><br/>Holly also has some hilarious father/daughter interaction as well, such as when she hides out in the trunk of the car to follow Gosling and Crowe to coke filled party populated with adult film stars and observes:<br/><br/>Holly March: Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.
Holland March: Sweetheart, how many times have I told you? Don't say ""and stuff"". Just say ""Dad, there are whores here"".
Holly March: Well, there's like a ton.<br/><br/>That last interaction leads to a great callback later in the film when Holly is talking to a young adult film actress that's too inappropriate to repeat here, but it's probably the biggest laugh of the film. Overall, ""The Nice Guys"" is charmingly retro, from it's use of the 1970s Warners Bros. logo at the film's opening to the fabulous cars and costumes to a fun soundtrack, it all gives the the feel of a politically incorrect R-rated version of The Rockford Files. Keith David, Lois Smith, Gil Gerard, and Kim Basinger also appear in the film."

We get our first great joke of the movie when a car crashes through a house. What's great is that there's so much going on in this movie.<br/><br/>You just have no idea what will show up next. The one moment that really made me jump in my seat was when a giant bee appeared in the backseat! It's a dream, by the way.

I was watching this weird edited version for some reason. <br/><br/>Why would a movie shown on an airplane screen be edited? You're the only one who hears it! The few moments where the characters yell are especially funny because they're usually so calm.

I can't put my finger on it exactly but they aren't the same as what they used to be, and not made the way they used to be. <br/><br/>With that in mind I was pleasantly surprised with The Nice Guys. This movie brings back the action police-mafia-chase that we all missed. Character backstory somewhat lacks compared to what we've become used to, but that is all fine because it puts more attention to the mystery at hand. The plot is the main point, and it follows the characters who are dealing with it. Ryan Gosling and Russel Crow have amazing chemistry and it's refreshing to watch them.

","Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are paired in a crime thriller set in 1970s Los Angeles which contains more than its fair share of laughs.<br/><br/>Private detective Holland March, engaged on a missing person case, is warned off when hired muscle Jackson Healy beats him up. The two are forced to join forces to search for Amelia, who has become involved in porn - sorry, make that ""experimental movies.""<br/><br/>Shane (Iron Man 3) Black directs and co-writes this period crime thriller in which Ryan Gosling is March and a rather tubby Russell Crowe is Healy. A tolerable crime thriller plot engages the attention throughout, while this pair stumble their way through the search for Amelia. Neither is especially good at their job but fortunately (or, perhaps, unfortunately), March's 13-year old daughter Holly takes it upon herself to assist them from time to time.<br/><br/>That's not all, though. If you've seen the trailer, you will know that, although this film has a serious plot, not everything about the delivery is straight-faced. The humour includes some funny dialogue and some great knockabout business and I was delighted to discover that Gosling, who I have previously found to be rather expressionlessly one-note in his previous work, has a definite flair for comedy. I chuckled often, and laughed out loud several times.<br/><br/>Yet the jeopardy is quite real, and isn't played for laughs. There is always some genuine danger involved, which means you have an emotional investment in these two well-meaning but somewhat inept sleuths.<br/><br/>The action is well-staged, the period feel is authentic (starting with the opening music, very Shaft-theme), Crowe and Gosling have an effective on-screen chemistry, and the cast are all good, especially Angourie Rice, who plays March's daughter Holly. She holds the screen whenever she's on it: keep your eye on her career, she's going places.<br/><br/>If I was to criticise, I would say that there is relatively little substance here: the engaging performances and witty script elevate the film above its natural level. And the profanity in it doesn't always service the storytelling: there is much swearing which is here for no other reason than Because F*ck.<br/><br/>But this is an entertaining movie with much in it to justify recommendation."

Unfortunately, this kind of film needs a somewhat large budget to re-create that era and since it's not a teen sex comedy or one with the current trend of comedy actors doing their shtick, it doesn't draw in the big crowds Hollywood brass hunger for to declare it a ""hit"".

Very good characters who have been given backstories in a way which feels natural rather than just put in the movie to make us care for the characters.The backstories are great . The actors playing the characters are great . Both Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling are great . Nicely executed twists make a movie which is great."

","An unlikely duo must team up to find a missing girl before a secret cabal has her murdered in The Nice Guys (2016), a comedic crime drama written by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi and directed by Shane Black. Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys is a film noir for the disco era, but wasn't originally written as a period piece. Thankfully, the writers decided to rework the concept and what resulted was one of the best films of 2016.<br/><br/>Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a muscle-for-hire who Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley) pays to dissuade private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) from looking for her. March, an alcoholic who lives with his preteen daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice), believes Amelia is somehow connected to the death of porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio). Misty's aunt, Mrs. Glenn (Lois Smith), hired March to investigate Misty's death because she believed Misty might still be alive.<br/><br/>When two anonymous men (Beau Knapp and Keith David) show up at Jackson Healy's apartment to press him for details on Amelia's whereabouts, he decides to pay March to help him locate Amelia before they do. Together, they discover Amelia and Misty were connected to an underground adult film allegedly exposing a conspiracy on the part of auto manufacturers to suppress the catalytic converter. Several people involved in the movie turned up dead.<br/><br/>Things get really complicated when Amelia's mother, Judith (Kim Basinger), a prosecutor at the U.S. Department of Justice, pays March and Healy to find her daughter. When Amelia literally falls into their laps, she accuses her mother of being part of the conspiracy. March and Healy slowly put the pieces together, but will they rescue her and the last remaining film reel in time to expose the truth? <br/><br/>Nice Guys was loosely inspired by true events, although it wasn't advertised as such. Because of its particular geography, Los Angeles has long suffered from lingering smog, which was a pervasive problem in the mid-twentieth century. The film pokes fun at activists protesting ""bird killing"" pollution, but people really did wear gas masks to protest LA smog and it did have negative and long-term consequences for public health.<br/><br/>Auto emissions were a contributing factor to airborne toxins until 1975 when the Environmental Protection Agency mandated all new cars come equipped with a catalytic converter. GM, Ford, and Chrysler (the ""Big Three"") agreed to research pollution-reducing technologies in 1953 but dragged their heels. The Justice Department filed an anti-trust case against the Big Three in 1968, alleging a conspiracy to suppress pollution-reducing technologies. So the events that formed a backdrop for the film occurred years before the film takes place.<br/><br/>Nice Guys is more concerned with evoking the Zeitgeist of the decade rather than a strict adherence to facts. It was a brief time in American history when adult films were socially relevant. The 1970s are sometimes referred to as the ""Golden Age of Porn,"" when porn achieved some mainstream success with films like Deep Throat (1972) and The Devil in Miss Jones (1973). There were also widespread but unsubstantiated fears of Mafia influence in the adult film industry, which Judith uses as a red herring in this film.<br/><br/>Nice Guys features several strong performances. Ryan Gosling is a Canadian actor with a long career in film and television, most notably in The Notebook (2004) and The Place Beyond the Pines (2012). In 2016, he also starred in La La Land, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Holland March is a less serious role, demonstrating Gosling's versatility as an actor. Audiences and critics loved it. For this performance, he was nominated for ""Favorite Comedic Movie Actor"" at the People's Choice Awards and was awarded ""Best Comedic Performance"" by the San Diego Film Critics Society.<br/><br/>Angourie Rice, a young Australian actress, had her breakout role in The Nice Guys. Since then, she's appeared in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), which was praised by audiences and critics, and The Beguiled (2017), which was not. Her character in The Nice Guys, Holly, is an adorably precocious child, insisting she can help her father solve the case (since her father is an incompetent drunk, who can blame her?). Like Natalie Portman in The Professional (1994), Angourie is perfect for the role, and hopefully will have a bright future in film.<br/><br/>Nice Guys is funny, clever, and expertly manages a purposely convoluted and over-the-top plot ala The Big Lebowski (1998) and Fargo (1996). Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling perfectly play off each other's strengths, and bring a sense of ironic humor and style to an otherwise bleak and cynical world."

","The Nice Guys is described as a older style neo-noir type drama based upon during the 1970's. This film was released during the summer of 2016 and appeared to have been overshadowed and overlooked due to higher profile films, which is a shame since this film delivers in what people are looking for in these type of stylish crime mystery dramas. Compared to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (by the same director- Shane Black) and there are some similarities but with the Nice Guys, it shows growth from that film.<br/><br/>What makes this film work is that the storyline is continuously energetic and entertaining, mainly due to the lead actors of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowed- their chemistry is what makes this film top notch. The clever and witty dialogue is there as well as the comedy and action. Nothing feels forced and the film does not drag on. Although, it was somewhat odd and different how the daughter was in as many scenes and had a big role as she did (arguably the third most screen time after Gosling and Crowe). Some complained that she ruined the film but one would get used to it.

The little girl who plays the daughter of one of the detectives is adorable. The costumes look good. The camera work is clean, without shaky cam, and the action is appropriately dumb, as it tries to imitate the bad action movies of the 80s and 90s. <br/><br/>However, beyond the basic quality, there is not much to this movie. There is no major depth to any of the characters; there is no central respectable bad guy; the script is not that smart (appropriately of course, as far as 90's action movies go); and there is no big twist.

","I'm not here to review a movie. I see little point. Give me deconstruction any day. I'd rather sink my teeth into the meat of a carcass than read about its pretty colors.<br/><br/>I struggle with this movie. This is nowhere as near as straight up as Kiss, Kiss, not that KKBB was straight up in the usual sense.<br/><br/>We have an on-screen diatribe during the movie's opening against the advanced sexual & social knowledge we're giving our kids and then the movie doesn't stop doing that very same thing to our favorite character... but yet she holds her moral center... at 13 years-old. The age bridge between child innocence and adult awareness.<br/><br/>No wonder she's our favorite.<br/><br/>There are a ton of reviews on this site against her presence in many scenes without anyone realizing that was half the point. Who commented on the young teen boy bragging about his dick size?<br/><br/>So we as viewers are watching and thus made as complicit as her Dad as to what she experiences, as to what we see her see. (And we are also told with the opening porn star scene that this movie is a typical male fantasy--another anti-Hollywood comment) <br/><br/>We all think of ourselves as innocent and as principled as that tough young girl. Lol. Can a truer observation about social media be made? She wins, and we feel we do too (all while an unspoken bird gets mentions).<br/><br/>And too... Message movies as porn. That's like popping Hollywood one on the nose just right there. From a movie that purports multiple messages and blatantly so, this is reflexive satire at the highest degree.<br/><br/>This is deliberate in its parallels to KKBB, its parent. I think it is intended to be a meta-movie on top of that movie, which in itself was an indictment of Hollywood. The inexcusably flat trailer for this effort tells me that Hollywood is sick of being the villain.<br/><br/>Too bad because the villainy is far more complex than any Darth Vader. It's The Tempest meets Moulin Rouge... A self-aware hurricane blowing down upon the bloody red mill of Hollywood.<br/><br/>And this meta-ness explains the film running away in ridiculous ways from our avatars at the end.<br/><br/>It's a mystery movie, but not the mystery we're ostensibly given. And in this meta-age there isn't a good ostensible mystery we should ever trust to be straight up.<br/><br/>There's no way the guy who could already give us a lethal weapon when he was in college is giving us the same kung fu today.<br/><br/>Think the mystery through.

I think the history could become a really great drama, but they tried to make a funny movie with kids-humour, and it didn't work.

Kim Bassinger had a very small role, but she was a confident addition.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's character blasphemed a lot, which felt awkward and created distaste.<br/><br/>The movie had comical moments where facial expressions, mannerisms and banter made the movie feel human. The backdrop of the 70's was a nice addition as it helped the hapless characters get away with murder.<br/><br/>The plot is not the most entertaining thing about the movie as under the bonnet it is pretty much the bog standard cops and robbers script. As decorative bells and whistles to disguise the mundaneness of the plot, they added the 70's backdrop, 2 alcoholic detectives and a little girl with too much screen time.<br/><br/>I would recommend waiting until you can watch it for free on a streaming service as paying for this is not worth the coin."
"leonblackwood","5","0","2","3 October 2016"," Funny in places, but mostly silly throughout! 5/10
","Review: I'm really in two minds about this film, because the acting from Russell Crowe (Jackson Healy) and Ryan Gosling (Holland March), was brilliant and the chemistry between the two A-List actors was superb but the movie seemed really far fetched and the storyline wasn't that great. The witty script also seemed more silly than funny but there was some scenes that made me chuckle. With that aside, you do end up sticking with the film, because you really don't know which way the plot is going to turn but they did seem like the dumbest detectives on earth. March did have a couple of ""light bulb"" moments, which were completely out of character but most of the time, he was all over the place, and I haven't got a clue why he kept on taking his little girl to dangerous situations. I did like the cinematography, which had a 70's backdrop, and the clothes and outrageous parties were great but I personally was expecting more from the film. The, somewhat, overweight Crowe, was great in the action scenes and he did show some emotion in the movie, so it's a watchable film but the director missed the chance to make something really special. He could have easily made a ""Bad Boys"" type movie, without the silly jokes and outrageous scenes, which is why it didn't smash the box office. If they decide to release a sequel, they really need to make the storyline more believable, because Healy & March did make a fool out of themselves through most of this movie. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although I found this film to be like a long Laurel & Hardy sketch, it's definitely unique in a lot of ways but there was some similarities to director, Shane Black's first movie, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which also had the same type of buddy storyline, with Robert Downey Jr. & Val Kilmer in the lead. The 54 year old director also brought you Iron Man 3 in 2013 and he is due to direct the Predator, which will be released in 2018, so he hasn't had a lot of experience behind the camera. He did write the Lethal Weapon movies, along with Last Action Hero and The Long Kiss Goodnight, so he has a reputation of writing comedic, action movies, which usually have a great cast. Judging by his previous movies, I personally don't think that he would have been my first choice to bring Predator back to the big screen but he has been pretty impressive when it comes to the action department, so I just hope that he doesn't make a mockery out of the all time classic.<br/><br/>Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $57.3million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/comedies, starring Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Matt Bomer, Keith David, Kim Basinger, Margaret Qualley and Lois Smith. 5/10"

You know it's going to be a comedy and you know it's going to be dark.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is carried by Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling.

","Crime is supposed to be an engaging platter. Unfortunately The Nice Guys doesn't score high in the riveting department. It goes really light at times where the call of the hour is to depict tangibility, au contraire, goes full savage where we could have lived without. There is an element of surprise at most places where you feel the flick's true flair working magic for it. But then there are times when it simply falls flat.<br/><br/>DIRECTION OF THE NICE GUYS There is a certain unpredictability about Shane Black's direction which makes his style of film-making undoubtedly unique. Grinding humour into serious situations is something that he uses immensely. However, it wasn't the real genre that forms the basis of the tale. It's the 1970 LA crime scene that does. It takes two booming industries in the backdrop to narrate its telling tale – porn and automotive, and tries to bank on a bigger government conspiracy to cloud its offense.<br/><br/>To top it all, we have Ryan Gosling to do us the honours. His Holland March is a rare character with qualities of fun, subtlety and disgust all written in a single leaflet. He showcases a rare finesse that makes his character the most admired one. Contrasting his character is a grimmer Jackson Healy portrayed by Russell Crowe who is kind of okay in his shoes. Both make an unusual pair who aren't really nice and yet so, as they try to figure out the mystery of the missing girl. But do they have the chemistry that we wanted? The answer is no! WEIRD EMPTINESS AND DISCONNECT The plot is well written as it unfurls slowly into precarious trenches of foul play. The Nice Guys is pretty dark suggestive of Shane's magnificent style again. But the movie tried to sell itself on humour in the trailers which was actually kind of belying. All the laughs that the trailers packed in were the only ones the movie had. You constantly feel there is something missing and you could taste the hollow as connections don't really connect you.<br/><br/>Melodramatic substance is fairly missing, something Shane isn't really a fan of, I surmise. So, you can't take anything seriously, or expect to feel for any losses. Frames get gashed at unpredictable junctures which question the editing of the movie profusely. Yes, the editing isn't that great.<br/><br/>However, there are two things that are constantly working for The Nice Guys – The plot and Ryan Gosling!
