"TanyaToad","1","305","516","9 September 2016"," If this movie was a physical object, I'd kick it in the shin.
","This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'<br/><br/>It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.<br/><br/>I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.<br/><br/>Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.<br/><br/>There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.<br/><br/>It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.<br/><br/>It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.<br/><br/>I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.<br/><br/>There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.<br/><br/>There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.<br/><br/>There was a graphic rape scene.<br/><br/>I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.<br/><br/>You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.<br/><br/>Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.<br/><br/>Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.<br/><br/>There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.<br/><br/>A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.<br/><br/>My fingers hurt from typing.<br/><br/>If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.<br/><br/>If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema."

","If your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems almost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual humor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame satire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party.<br/><br/>Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators' desire to make the first ""adult"" 3D animated film. The interpretation of ""adult"" here seems to be the same as when it's used to describe porn--in other words, ""adult"" in the sense that you wouldn't want children to watch it but not in the sense that it shows much sophistication.<br/><br/>I have nothing against gross or low humor. But that's just it. There aren't really any jokes in this movie. Punchlines here are usually someone dropping an f-bomb. If you are not 11 years old, you may want something more. Visual gags are sometimes interesting, but do not induce laughter. The animation is well done and there are many celebrity voices involved, all of whom act well, but to what end?<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with the sort of movies Seth Rogen ends up in (toilet, sex, and drug humor) then you will have a fair idea of how this pans out. There are characters taking drugs and talking about ""getting baked."" HA! HA! Items from the grocery store make crude remarks and simulate sex acts. HA! HA! Many of the characterizations simply involve people yelling a lot. HA! HA! There's brutal violence. HA! HA!<br/><br/>News emerging since the opening suggests that the artists working on this project were treated cruelly and unfairly. That's how I felt as an audience member."
"gracerenaed","1","102","171","28 February 2017"," My brain. It bleeds.
","Have you ever seen a movie so terrible you create an IMDb account *just* so you can warn the rest of the human race? How, god. HOWWWWWWWWW does this movie have even one good review.<br/><br/>Sausage Party is that scrawny, rape-stach'ed white dude who struts into the bar with an exaggerated swag, dirty wife-beater, backwards snapback and sunglasses on who takes the mortified look on your face and repulsed ""no"" as invitation to continue grandiose-performing, flexing his lack of muscles in your face, and repeating the F-word ceaselessly (ground me now, mom!! lulz!!). Eminem did it once, so...<br/><br/>When you signal to the bartender and try to escape, he follows you around... For an hour and a half. And just when you finally sigh in relief that your friends have come to save you, he hops directly in front of you and pulls down his pants.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some good crude humor. Family Guy. American Dad. Archer. All fabulous examples of dangerously crass, raunchy humor being pulled off remarkably brilliantly.<br/><br/>But the word ""humor"" is more than a stretch here. (Wait, the douche is a douche? Is that what you said? No no, could you blatantly tell me that the douche is a douche? Because I didn't get that the douche is a douche.) Every racist stereotype under the sun is personified and paraded around as characters to make up for personalities that don't exist. The dialogue is flat and nauseatingly postured. The plot is predictable within the first five minutes and reeks of nuance-less anti-religious propaganda. <br/><br/>There is an actual, entirely unnecessary rape scene. <br/><br/>(Is rape funny to confederate-flag-sporting, sister-banging twats? Must have missed some memo.) I only made it up until the scene where a few of the characters come to a dirty Mexican bar (because, get it? Mexicans are dirty drunks??), but apparently the film continues its downward spiral right up to the point where they actually have an orgy. Take that, God.<br/><br/>I genuinely cannot imagine this movie being funny to anyone with an IQ over 20. Maybe to bro-tastic idiots with seven rape allegations and a hate-crime assault charge who only get by cause daddy runs a big corporation and knows how to throw a tantrum.<br/><br/>Please don't watch this bulls**t."
"BeatleNumber9","8","292","523","11 August 2016"," More clever than it has any right to be.
","I honestly didn't think I'd like this movie nearly as much as I actually do. I went in essentially expecting a typical Seth Rogan comedy, just random jokes and nothing else. But the rumors were true, it actually is more clever than it has any right to be.<br/><br/>I'll first say this, I don't think everyone will find it funny. If you aren't already a fan of Seth Rogan's movies, like I am, the humor probably won't do much for you. But I don't think anyone can deny that the movie's story is very smart, and I think might make up for some of the negatives you may have about the movie. The early reviews were right, it has a lot of clever things to say about religion, about taboos in society, about bigotry between cultures, and it's not lazy about any of these subjects.<br/><br/>Let me talk about the jokes for a second. Yes there are plenty of sexual jokes in it, a lot of which I found funny. But I think the majority of the laughs I had came from the different ethnic foods interacting with each other. I could watch the Bagel and Lavash argue with each other all day. If anything I think the majority of the sort of sexual jokes people expect from the movie happen at the very end, like the last 10 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>The voice acting is also top notch. All the voices fit well with every character in the movie. I would love to see all of the actors in this in other animated roles. Some of the actors play there roles so well I had no idea which character they were. I had no idea that Edward Norton was the Bagel, or that Paul Rudd was the main Grocery Store employee. They all give great performances.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong, there are problems. Probably the major one being that the villain really doesn't need to be there. He just kind of serves to be a slightly disturbing character, who sucks out other products' juice to become stronger. If they cut him out of the movie we wouldn't have missed anything, apart from a few jokes from him. Also the ending is very, well, an ending, in that it ends the movie. It's one of those endings I wouldn't really describe as ""bad"" or ""good"" it's just sort of ""I don't really know how else they could have ended it, so yeah I guess that works.""<br/><br/>The animation isn't all that great either, I mean it's not awful, but it really shows that this is this particular company's first animated film. One thing in particular that put me off was the designs on the human characters, they're so hideous to look at. I have a feeling that's part of the joke, but they really do look gross, and off-putting.<br/><br/>There is one more thing I have to say though. In the long run I'm a little worried about the impact this might have on other R rated animated movies. I'm a little worried that this might affect other movies in a similar fashion as how Shrek affected kids movies. Like how Shrek was funny and made a lot of money, so other studios, and Dreamworks themselves, tried to replicate the success, and we ended up getting really bad ""Self-Aware Parody"" movies like Chicken Little. I just don't want the same thing to happen with this movie.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call this movie ""typical Adult Swim fodder"" like I thought I'd be calling it. It's too clever to deserve that label. It's a movie that actually understands what ""Satire"" is, and in a day and age where we have people just posting racial obscenities and calling it ""satire"" when called out on it, I think it's great to see an R rated animated movie actually understand how to do satire.<br/><br/>I would recommend giving this movie a chance. I really respect that it doesn't just throw crap at the wall and expects you to laugh. I wouldn't go as far as to call this one of my favorite animated movies of all time, but I will say I'm glad I saw it, and I had a lot of fun watching it. I would give this movie an 8/10. It's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I do respect it, and I want to see more good R rated animated movies come out of it."
"thaileenaw","2","86","151","23 January 2017"," I hate myself for thinking this would be good
","Before I start this review I'm telling you that I generally love Seth Rogan's sense of humour and all of the actors that were voicing the characters I love as well, but this movie made me cringe. The entire plot of the movie sounded great and watching the trailers definitely caught everyone's attention, and it's not that often that an adult animation comes out and gets that much hype. It had a really good unique idea. The voice acting and animations were done really well. That's about where the positivity ends.<br/><br/>The first time I tried to watch it with my boyfriend, and we shut it off after the ""rape scene"" with the douche and the juice box about 15 minutes or so into the movie. I mean, I can get how it can kind of be comical because I mean, it's a douche and a juice box, but just the fact that they were trying to compare it to rape was a bit screwed up and made me uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The second time I tried to watch it was with one of my friends who swore it was hilarious and we just had to watch it so I was forced to watch it and finish it. The entire time she was laughing at every stupid and lazy attempt they made at humour and I was sitting there straight-faced wishing it was over.<br/><br/>I have a pretty good sense of humour but the constant sexual jokes in this movie weren't even clever at all and they were pretty pathetic.. the kind of twelve year old boys make when they try to make everything sound sexual. I was happy when I thought movie had finally come to an end when suddenly all the food randomly started having this massive orgy which was another 5 minutes of pointless ridiculousness.<br/><br/>Honestly, this had a good idea but just turned out to be complete trash, and not the funny kind. It was just pathetic and sad that people wasted so much time and money to create it. If you have this certain sense of humour that finds absolutely everything funny, you'd probably laugh a few times. If you're like me where it takes more than some weak sexual innuendos and over-the-top deaths to make you laugh then please do yourself a favour and skip this one. Everyone I know that has seen this (except that one friend) hated it."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","218","417","11 August 2016"," Vulgar, Crass and Incredibly Funny
","Sausage Party is a foul, crass, mean-spirited little film that pits grocery products against the horrifying realization that their use in this world is to be consumed and tossed away without a second thought. Centering on a courtship between a sausage named Frank (Rogen) and a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), the very fact that the discontented ten year old in all of us didn't just giggle at the thought of how they consummate their love is enough proof that this film is juvenile. Yet despite leaning, nudging and winking towards the least discerning of low-brow audiences, Sausage Party is funny enough to have people rolling in the aisles, smart enough to lend itself to cogent meta-commentary and vulgar enough to live in teenage-screen-hopping infamy. Make no mistake, this film is the brass ring, the real deal, the funniest film you're likely to see this year and given this year in comedy, I say it's about damn time.<br/><br/>Before the events of Sausage Party, Brenda and Frank live inside their separate packages; Frank being partnered with friends Carl (Hill) and the diminutive Barry (Cera) among others. Every morning, the denizens of Shopwell sing a song of joy while they lay in waiting for a benevolent god (human) to choose them and take them to the ""great beyond"". Failure to be chosen, or worse dropped on the floor, means produce is to be thrown away in a seemingly bottomless abyss of a grocery store garbage bin. Frank and Brenda however like their chances. It's a few days till red, white and blue day; what could go wrong? One returned container of Honey Mustard (McBride) who forecasts doom is what can go wrong. That and a particularly testy Douche (Kroll) angered by a grocery cart accident that sullies his chances to be useful.<br/><br/>As an animation, Sausage Party is artfully, colorfully and simplistically rendered. Each section of the grocery store lights up with a look and feel that compliments the local produce. After the doors close the Mexican food area resembles a rustic western cantina, the cookware section beams with the silvery glow of shimmering straight edges and the alcohol aisle is just one big rave. Environments outside the store are limited yet realistically depict the kitchen of a prim housewife and the dingy living room of a bugged out druggie. The less I tell you about the brief street scene, the better. Overall, it's obvious there were limitations in the budget yet if compared to the similarly themed Foodfight! (2012), this film's animation is an artistic triumph.<br/><br/>The embedded oddness of the story lends itself to some pretty unique and funny jokes. Ones that hit the funny-bones of all not easily offended or grossed out. Such highlights include a bagel (Norton) and a lavash (Krumholtz) arguing about having to share an aisle, a Grits (Robinson) package being misplaced by ""dirty good-for-nothing' crackers,"" and legions of sourkraut looking to exterminate the juice. Needless to say there are times when the film get's lost in the tall grass with over-broad ethnic stereotypes (A Native American liquor bottle named Firewater certainly ranks among the most egregious). But let's face it, if you're sold on the premise of a R- Rated animated comedy about food-stuffs you probably won't be too concerned.<br/><br/>Sausage Party is a funny, funny, funny movie that doesn't just hand in shock value laughs for the sake of shock value laughs. It's also a well-created hero's journey with something to say and avoids all the pratfalls of modern comedy by A: not relying on broad improvisational humor and B: lands that third act like it's its b***h! Speaking of which: don't take your kids to go see Sausage Party. This is not the film you can harangue ""cool mom"" points with, seriously. Keep those little tykes at bay at least until their old enough to purchase their own heroin syringes."
"mbraun5","3","73","131","2 December 2016"," An Obnoxiously Tedious Exercise in Bad Satire, Bad Parody, and Bad Humor
","Let me start off this review by saying I like Seth Rogen. I like low-brow, shock humor. I love biting satire. By all metrics, I should've been the target audience for this film. But I couldn't remember the last time a movie actually made me as angry as I felt watching Sausage Party.<br/><br/>Look, I *get* what this movie was trying to do. Really, I do. Its admirable ambition is the ONLY reason I give it a 3/10 and not a 1. But it fails in every place it was trying to succeed. Let me explain.<br/><br/>1. It fails as a send-up of saccharine Pixar animated films. Parody really is an art form of its own. To do it well, the medium needs to look and feel - at first blush - like something sincere, which allows the artist to invert expectations of the audience (thus, humor). Just look at the best satire: The Onion takes on the tone of a daily newspaper; Young Frankenstein feels like a classic horror film; Weird Al Yankovic sounds like the musicians he parodies. Parody requires a nuanced and keen understanding of whatever source material it's sending-up.<br/><br/>Sausage Party seems to think it's a Pixar parody because it a) uses inanimate objects as characters, and b) is animated. But that's not what makes Pixar movies Pixar movies. They have emotion, they have clever characters, and they make unexpected and subtle observations on humanity.<br/><br/>The closest Sausage Party came to giving us Pixar-inspired characters were the queer taco and the Stephen Hawking-esque piece of chewed up gum, and neither is on screen long enough to carry the film. The rest of the ""parody"" is dependent on the fact that animation as a medium is most commonly used for children's entertainment, and Sausage Party clearly isn't for children. If that's parody, then it's parody in its laziest, most artificial form.<br/><br/>2. It fails as shock humor. I get that this is subjective and everyone has their own meter for ""what is shocking,"" but I'm going to go out on a limb and say no one over the age of 11 thinks cartoon characters being vulgar is shocking. South Park busted down that barrier two decades ago. Adult Swim has been around for almost as long. In a world of Borat, 4chan, and There's Something About Mary, if you want to go for pure shock laughs, you need a lot more than f-bombs and sex puns.<br/><br/>That being said, for shock humor to actually be *shocking* it needs to come as a surprise. If the entire film beats you over the head with profanity, drug references, and wiener jokes, then by definition you can't be surprised. It becomes tedium.<br/><br/>3. It fails as commentary on organized religion. This was probably the most disappointing failure because the idea that humans are gods over food and food has to tell themselves the gods are bringing them to a ""great beyond"" to give their lives meaning is indeed a clever concept. There was an opportunity for Rogen n Co to make an anti-Veggie Tales that could've been something sharp and brilliant. They blew it.<br/><br/>Matt Stone and Trey Parker did the anti-belief message beautifully in The Book of Mormon. In it, the characters grow to question their faith, and their new-found skepticism pays off with a unique and clever spin at the end (with lots of smart laughs along the way).<br/><br/>In Sausage Party, on the other hand, instead of using religious skepticism as a vehicle for character development, it was more the bow that tied a bunch of juvenile jokes to some pseudo-intelligent theme. There was no organic transformation. It was a forced conclusion to justify ending on an orgy (because ultimately nothing really matters and all we have is joy and pleasure in this life yadda yadda ya get it?! GET IT?!?)<br/><br/>The fact Sausage Party had such potential makes the results all the more annoying. In more skilled hands it really could've been a fun, acerbic send-up of Pixar AND religion. Instead, what we have is an over-long, single-joke animated SNL skit with all the charm and brilliance of a jackhammer. Awful."

Being British, it's in my nature to swear unnecessarily every other word, but when will Seth Rogan and his mates realise that swearing constantly is no longer funny and people are just bored of it. This film could've been something so special that would sit forever in that group of amazing did-it-firsts that everyone tries to copy but fails at. But someone will do it better.

"Screen_Blitz","9","118","223","15 August 2016"," Animated Seth Rogen comedy is as funny and irreverent as you'd expect
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have reunited once again in this incredibly raunchy R- rated comedy following their success with 'This Is The End' and 'Neighbors', except what's different this time is this comedy is an CGI animated feature revolving around talking food products rather than human characters (though there are a few). For a movie starring and written by Seth Rogen, you would expect to see a straight forward raunchy comedy with no-holds-bar vulgarity and abundance of four letter words. This comedy however, manages to squeeze in a surprisingly thought-provoking allegory to religion along with the predictably irreverent humor, similar to what we saw in 'This Is The End' which followed a cast of characters trying to survive the apocalypse. Featuring the voices of Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, David Krumholtz, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and several others to name; this movie follows a wide of cast of food products at a local supermarket who live their lives awaiting to be taken away by the ""gods"" (shopping customers) into a world known as the ""great beyond"", a place of comfort and endless happiness. When they discover the ugly truth of what really goes on in the so-called paradise, Frank the Sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) must rally up his friends to help save from the unspeakable terror that awaits them.<br/><br/>A comedy about foul-mouth talking food? Yeah, kinda sounds like a dumb idea, right? Well, with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg behind the writing process, this movie unexpectedly manages to be much smarter than what you may anticipate while at the same time, being hysterically funny in blatantly absurd ways. Advertised with inventive marketing, this highly anticipated comedy delivers much more than just a string of raunchy R-rated humor and a no-brainer of a plot. Rogen and Goldberg accomplish this by formulating the plot that serves as a metaphor to Christianity, with the food being purchased by shoppers and taken into the ""great beyond"" which serves as a clear analogy to heaven. One line in particular is ""the gods work in mysterious ways"". This also includes some comedic dialogue and humor that falls metaphorical to references of the bible including a silly musical number in which the film opens up with. Yes, the humor has no reservation of being politically incorrect or downright offensive, especially with all the seemingly non-stop profanity. At the same time, Rogen and Goldberg know how to make it funny and subversive. Sure, some of the jokes do fall on the mean-spirited side, or under the not-so-rare circumstances push the envelope, particularly the massive food orgy scene. Though it is meant to be funny, it's necessarily clever or even charming in the slightest. On the other hand, the film as a whole knows how to be funny in a way that works, even without the constant vulgar gags thrown around here and there. <br/><br/>Sausage Party is a funny and irreverent animated comedy that shows Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg still have their A-game, even if their over-the-top humor isn't everyone's cup of tea. This movie is astoundingly hilarious and is worth seeing. However, although this is an animated feature, parents are strongly discouraged of bringing their children to this one. So if you are a parent, please hire a babysitter and leave the kids at home. This is not a film you'll want to expose to their young eyes."

"brchthethird","7","45","80","24 March 2017"," A graphic religious allegory (and not for kids)
","Nothing in the trailers will prepare you for this movie, including what it's actually about. SAUSAGE PARTY is an allegory about religion and how ridiculous it is, but also about how we can overcome our differences and learn to get along. Granted, there is no solution proposed nor does the humor rarely rise above obvious sexual puns and stereotypes (different foods represent ethnic groups, minorities, etc.), but the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach guarantees that at least some of it sticks. And importantly, for a comedy, there are plenty of genuine laughs to be had. Then there's the ending, which I will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it seemed oddly appropriate...and that you can get away with quite a bit more in an animated film than live-action. This wasn't the craziest or funniest thing I've ever seen, but it made for a few dollars and a couple hours well-spent."

I never write reviews but this movie was just to funny to see people on here claiming it's not. They just broke new ground for a genre with adult animation. Why not? I'm tired of all animation being just kid movies. Easily best comedy of the year. I hope they make a sequel because I think it will be even better knowing they did something outstanding. Every character has its funny moment. I loved nick roll as the douche and Danny mcbrides honey mustard. I'd like to see mcbrides with a bigger part in the next one because he is just too funny. Krumholtz as lavish was awesome. I believe it will be even funnier a second viewing. And the final 20 minutes there is a scene so bizarre and hilarious the fact it's animation is just awesome"

"polariskunn2003","1","67","131","22 August 2016"," Food Fight was better...that's how bad it was.
","Here's the thing about propaganda films. If they are bad when Christians do it (God's Not Dead 1&2, Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas) they are not going to be better when atheists do it. That's what it felt like watching this movie. Sausage Party is the God's Not Dead of an atheist propaganda movie. You are preached at for the entire run time on why it's bad to believe in a religion, while having to sit through painfully obvious jokes that don't land. (Oh the douche is a douche. Hahaha creative) Now before I'm accused of being some whack job fundamentalist let me say that I hate the other propaganda films. If I want to watch propaganda I'll go to the source and watch it. Sausage party is even worse because the trailer doesn't show how preachy it actually is.<br/><br/>It's sad too because the cast is super talented too. (Kroll, Whig, Cera, Rogan, Hayak) which means that the fault lies solely on the writing which comes off more as a summer camp sketch than a movie. It relies way too heavily on recycled racist tropes that were done better in a 50s Looney Tunes cartoon. That mixed with just yawn worthy sexual innuendo makes the film unbearable and leaves you praying that the film ends soon. Which is ironic because that's the opposite of what the film wants you to do."

","Surprisingly clever adult animated film. It is offensive, racist, crude, sexist, and low brow in the extreme - which is were its charm lays. Being a fan of animated Grindhouse films like Fritz The Cat, Heavy Traffic, Shame Of The Jungle and Hey Good Looking to name a few, it feels great to have something like this in theaters in this day and age. It gives a much needed middle finger to our atmosphere of enforced ""politically correctness"". It tries very hard to offend everyone equally in a manner that allows the audience to laugh at their own short comings and beliefs. On top of the low brow humor there is some very clever plot twists and gimmicks - which I'll leave you to discover. Solid animation, story, voice acting, and soundtrack - what more could one want in a movie that is just for an adult audience with an open mind and a broad sense of humor. Thanks to Seth Rogen perhaps there is hope for more adult animated fare, a Heavy Metal 3 or a Sausage Party 2."

What I mean by that, is that this is the most vulgar and xenophobic animated movie I've ever seen but in a good way. As obnoxious as this movie is, I can't help but giggle half the time when I'm watching it, even though how disgusting and indecent some of the scenes are, especially at the end. And mostly because of that, I will never see food the same way ever again(the animation is pretty good though).<br/><br/>Maybe my only true complaint about this movie was the ending, since it seems it was just tacked in there ""just because"" but to be fair, the movie was already weird as it is. So yeah, the ending for me felt kinda random and I feel that it should've ended in that particular scene before it but overall, I don't think it won't affect what most people thought about this film.

","What I loved about it was it's concept that can be only described as Toy Story meets Foodfight, where various food products and items live in a cartoonish world of gods, destiny, foul language and adultery. This is indeed a possible contender for Golden Globe nominations and if possible Academy Award nominations, especially for Best Animated Film (that's if Pixar can stand aside).<br/><br/>So much comedic moments from racial stabs, sexual innuendo, crude humour and one liners that will be a quote in your own life. There's so much on offer that it doesn't go tame or repetitive, especially towards the end that really goes 'over the top' and takes animation to a bold and confronting place where it should (I'll keep my lips sealed on this particular scene but let's just say it's a show stealer). The cast of comedic talents suck as Rogen, Franco, Hill, Wiig, Cera, Robertson, Rudd and others make the characters seem so likable, hilarious and entertaining, and the animation is both stylish and very cartoonish for an adult film.<br/><br/>Overall, Sausage Party is a party that you don't want to miss and no brains are required to get this, and no children should see this until they are over 18 at least, so make a date or go with your bro's for a fun time of hilarity.

The plot went from bad to worse, and then downhill from there. They scraped the bottom of the slime from the bottom of the barrel and decided that it wasn't filthy enough. Crass and vulgar are okay, but this was also artless. They left nothing to the imagination. There was no subtlety or room for audience interpretation of any of the dim, witless drivel they call humor. If you blew your infected-sinus nose onto the filmstrip it would be worth more.

I imagine Seth got the idea for anthropomorphic grocery during one of their weed sessions and then decided to make a film about it. The producers at Sony probably hurried them into making this so they could follow in the footsteps of Deadpool and profit. You can't just throw crass humour and expect it to come good always. You need to write a ton of jokes, pick the better ones and then improve on them.

Otherwise the movie itself, and I like to put it this way, is one long sex joke! Seriously. Besides a couple of morbid deaths of the food and other things that I was expecting more of, you get a lot of sex jokes. And most of the jokes bored me. It gave me a few chuckles but otherwise I was just not finding it funny. Believe they could have done better but I suppose with it starring Seth Rogen, I should have expected it to be a hit or miss and it was a miss. <br/><br/>Close to the end of the movie, not the actually ending, but close enough a scene comes on in which I basically knew was coming. And when it happened, it was the most annoying and least bit of funny to watch. Won't go into detail but its a build up and you will either laugh or just wonder when it'll be over. I can't really find much good on the film. <br/><br/>Animation was decent. If I had laughed more or didn't see that one coming moments I believe I would have rated the movie higher. But because I can't really think of much good from the film and how bored I was throughout it I truly believe the movie deserves a 4/10.<br/><br/>Think this movie falls into the stoner movies and that could also explain why I didn't find it as funny either. It did however make me hungry thinking of food but the movie itself didn't make me feel guilty about going into the grocery store and ""killing"" the food by eating it. <br/><br/>All in all I recommend finding another movie, I prefer This Is The End also starring Seth Rogen and a few others.

Well partly because talented animators have spent thousands of hours turning a puerile, witless, uninspired, humourless script into a film that has benefited from international distribution when it should not have left the grubby napkin I assume it was written on. (Though I read somewhere it took Rogen 10 years to write?!) Also because I feel obliged to add this brief review to warn others even though it does not deserve or warrant any further attention or time spent on it. Just so you know this is supposed to be animation for 'adults', Rogen throws in religion, violence,sex, sexuality,drugs,rape, constant profanity - indeed anything where he hopes offence can be generated. If you have nothing funny to say then Rogens' philosophy ( I use the term lightly) is grab all the taboos and chuck them back in the hope the audience at least react. It is a pitiful attempt. It tries so hard it falls flat. You would think the dialogue was written by an overexcited,immature, half-witted teen who had just discovered the word 'fuck' and every character repeating it is hilarious.

Instead of actually using real humor, the writers thought that adults would crack up every time someone dropped the f-bomb (which, btw, is every sentence).

I have never walked out of a movie but this was the first time. I walked out after one of the store products started sucking on another product. two thumbs way down"
"maurice_yacowar","9","39","84","20 August 2016"," Supermarket foods discover the falseness of human religion
","This film's unprecedented profanity points to its primary purpose — to reject and dispel the debilitating delusions of the supposed sacred. <br/><br/>The Shopwell supermarket products here express the human faith in some unproved heaven that will justify their self-denials in this lifetime. But when a honey mustard returns from The Great Beyond he reports his discovery: the supposedly beneficent gods are really violent demons bent upon consuming and destroying these gullible humans/products. <br/><br/>Hero Frank — the wiener who will take all — confirms that truth when he visits the liquor aisle and learns firsthand from Firewater that the Imperishables invented the myths that form the culture's religions. <br/><br/>Honey Mustard himself embodies the human conflict: Is he a honey or a mustard? The question doesn't bother him, just the naive Brenda who prefers simplicity so resists the reality as long as she can. Honey Mustard was saved by his ambivalent nature, but is so maddened by his discovery he kills himself.<br/><br/>It's a telling complexity. Are we flesh or spirit? The religious would have us believe we are spirits who should shun our earthly natures. This film asserts our meathood, our substance, our materiality in an unyieldingly material world, whose only fulfilment and service must be found on earth.<br/><br/>The only human to discover the truth is the doomed druggie who shoots up on bath salts. Only then does reality come clean to him and he realizes the character of the peripheral life he has been mindlessly and compulsively consuming.<br/><br/>And excreting. The abundant scatological humour provides Jonathan Swift's excremental view of humanity that no airy pretences can conceal. Hence Peanut Butter bemoans the death of his wife Butt Nutter and the Chinese take-out comes from Pu Ping. <br/><br/>As the narrative occurs on July 4 it points to America's Independence Day, when all the wieners and the hot dog buns they yearn to pop into expect to be liberated. But Honey Mustard has learned what we already know: the Great Beyond they so eagerly anticipate is a cover for their death and destruction. <br/><br/>The film's celebration of a real independence is the independence from religion, specifically the delusions, divisions and self-denials promulgated in its name. The characters come fully alive when they cast off their superstitions, overthrow their murderous gods (i.e., the humans) and abandon themselves to an impassioned orgy. <br/><br/>Even the Muslim pita, learning he won't get those 72 Virgin Olive Oils on the other side, discovers a fraternal and sexual fulfilment with his mortal enemy Sammy Bagel Jr (Edward Norton as his pal Woody Allen). So, too, the militarized sauerkraut is determined to eradicate The Juice. <br/><br/>Opposing hymns frame the narrative. The film opens with the morning prayer to The Great Beyond, celebrating the supposed gods of kindness and salvation. But it ends on an alternative prayer, Three Dog Night's Joy to the World. That hymn evokes the heady counterculture of the '60s, when OT prophet Jeremiah is replaced by a bullfrog, who was a good friend of mine, and salvation is to be found in this world, through wine, love, community, sex, and not delayed for some hypothetical afterlife.<br/><br/>This film's wildness is itself a celebration of the sensual, the forbidden, the indulgent, in the face of religious and any other prissy decorum. Good stuff."

","There is a message for people who condemn others for their beliefs. Unfortunately, those people would never watch this movie. And that's too bad. Just because you believe a certain way doesn't make others wrong. And it doesn't make those folks beliefs the right and only way.<br/><br/>That out of the way, I could not stop laughing at the action and animations. The art work was awesome. The action was well-paced. The dialogue was outrageous. There were a few lulls for me, but when the action picks up, its like a roller-coaster. <br/><br/>I hope there is a part 2.

"tomgillespie2002","6","33","70","30 October 2016"," The fact that this film was greenlit is a cause for celebration
","Sausage Party, the latest button-pusher from Seth Rogen and his usual crew, has so far grossed $135 million on a $19 million budget, receiving mainly positive reviews from critics and assisted by strong word-of-mouth thanks to a climactic scene which won't allow you to look at a hot dog in quite the same way again. Essentially a movie about anthropomorphic, sexually repressed food items who long to escape the confines of their supermarket home to reach the 'Great Beyond' - taken home by us humans - Sausage Party is a mixed bag. On one hand, it's a bold religious parable featuring some extremely creative animation, but on the other, at least comedy wise, this is on par with some of Rogen's most mediocre output.<br/><br/>In a supermarket named Shopwell's, the various tasty treats that line the shelves spend their days praying they will be picked and taken to the great unknown by shoppers, who they view as gods. Each morning starts with a sing-a-long, and they try to live their life by a set of rules they believe will led to them being chosen, including no sex until they're out of their packet. Hot dog Frank (Rogen) only allows himself to touch tips with the bun he's in love with, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), saving themselves for the inevitable day when they get carried off into paradise. But with the return of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who claims that he witnessed torture and horror at the hands of the 'gods' who devoured some of his friends, Frank sets off on a journey of discovery and awakening.<br/><br/>Similar in many ways to Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Sausage Party imagines what it would be like if the food we consume to eagerly could talk to each other and wonders what they would make of us. But while Woody and co. would flop to the ground whenever a human walked in the room, the characters here exist in the 'fourth dimension', unseen by humans. This allows more freedom for directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon to deliver as many outlandish set pieces as they would like, and two scenes in particular - one inspired by Saving Private Ryan (1998) and the other featuring an Irish potato being skinned alive while his friends watch - are actually quite terrifying. The film is certainly at its best during these moments, and there are scenes of real ingenuity amongst the carnage.<br/><br/>The first half whizzes by and is a blast, but then the film seems to lose direction and wander aimlessly from one scene to another. It also struggles to tickle the funny bone, and relies too heavily on tired food puns, familiar shtick from the likes of James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader, and outright vulgarity. Someone should point out to the writers - which include Rogen and regular collaborator Evan Goldberg - that using ""f**k"" every other word doesn't automatically make a film 'adult', but quickly becomes unpleasant and completely unnecessary, especially when the characters are otherwise perfectly likable. Also, the inclusion of Douche (Nick Kroll), the cavity-cleaner who holds a grudge against Frank, serves only a distraction from the more interesting central plot.<br/><br/>Still, despite its many flaws and irritating tics, I very much enjoyed Sausage Party for what it is, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before. If you haven't enjoyed much of Rogen's previous output, chances are you won't love Sausage Party, although there's plenty of visual splendour to savour in between the d**k jokes. At its best, it offers interesting parallels to real-world issues, such as the relationship between a lavash named Kareem (David Krumholtz) and a bagel named Sammy (Edward Norton doing a pitch-perfect Woody Allen impression), and their bickering over shelf space. Of course, this is the edible version of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and while it may embrace comedic stereotyping throughout, Sausage Party never intends to offend, and instead offers a surprisingly sympathetic message about the necessity of religion. Whatever your view, the fact that a film like this can be greenlit and unleashed on a mainstream audience is cause for celebration."

","Every negative review I've seen calls this movie ""insensitive"" and all, but if you actually loosened up you would find that this movie is actually hilarious. If you're looking for a movie to act offended by then congrats this is your movie. Fortunately, if you're someone like me who loves offensive humor then this is a perfect movie for you too<br/><br/>The movie has a deeper meaning to it if you really focused in on it and it really isn't about attacking different races, but rather showing that every race and religion has flaws and if we just stopped caring about it then we would be able to accomplish so much more. People are too quick to get offended these days that they miss the bigger picture. <br/><br/>The food orgy scene was definitely the most off putting part of the movie for me, but it overall does send a greater message than just that. There's so many levels of humor that it's hard not to enjoy. And if you're really educated, the arguments between the bagel and falafel are hilarious. <br/><br/>So ignore the negative reviews and the people calling this ""racist."" Watch it for yourself and just enjoy it. Some racist humor can be funny if you're able to take jokes about your own race."

","I came into this movie hoping that it would make me laugh at least once. I mean, it's Seth Rogen, co-writer of This is The End and Superbad. I regret to inform you that I didn't laugh once during the 89 minute run time. What started out as an odd but interesting premise turned into an honest bore of a film. Each joke was more predictable than the last. The characters lacked personality and wit. I couldn't for the life of me describe Kristen Wiig's character Brenda. She was only there to be the love interest in a forced romantic subplot. And all the cultural/racial stereotypes were just weak. A Native American bottle of booze named Firewater smokes weed and sounds like he came from the 1950's Peter Pan film. The Black box of grits played by Craig Robinson sounds more like a group of white people trying to write a black person. The whole ordeal was just embarrassing. You might be dismissing me as an ""Offended SJW"" by now, but let me tell you, I was not offended by this movie. I was bored by it. Seth Rogen can and should do better."

"Blogger66","10","29","61","24 November 2016"," Unwanted Nightmare
","I think I should be honest with you before I can explain about my comprehend of Sausage Party because it is, no doubt, the most controversial movie of 2016. It's a full density of references and analogies to carry on the message. It's a serious business, not a humor film.<br/><br/>I was surprised when I found out that Greg Tiernan directed this movie because he is known for Thomas & Friends. Conrad Vernon is one other director of this film that did not surprise me because I have always felt that he used animation as a tool to relieve the resistance of underlying messages. However, this is definitely an extreme that is for adults only. <br/><br/>The foods are personifications, and it's about their intentions of living by abiding the moral ethics. Each package of food is a case of its own race. The sausages obviously are men of its own race that are known as ""fancy men"" who are full of perverts that objectify things. They are motivated in doings for money or status solely around sex. The buns are obviously women of its own race (White probably). They desire to be desired. They exposed their facial and body features and mainly a behavioral statement as a ""chosen one."" It's the statement that boosts the attractiveness. Bottom line, both sausages, and buns ultimately objectify things and themselves for love and sex (Perverts and to be Desired). <br/><br/>Okay, now, this is about the sausages. Frank is the leading character of its own package of food. Like guys in general, he acts like ""p*ssy is just a p*ssy"" in front of his gang, but he secretly thinks worldly of Brenda (Bun). <br/><br/>Brenda, a bun, is like the women who want to be mainly desired by men. She would push other women down to be more desired than them. She would use moral ethics as a weapon towards other buns who quickly give up for the sausages. Her long working actions are to reach a lasting romance with Frank. <br/><br/>Frank and Brenda can be an analogy to Adam and Eve. They thought that they gave up by tipping each other too early may cost them the fates.<br/><br/>Kareem Abdul Lavash is a Muslim, and Sammy Jr. is a Jewish. Like Israel and Palestine, they dislike each other. <br/><br/>Teresa del Taco is a Hispanic who is also lesbian. Her confidence and street smart stand out the others. She made Brenda realized that she used moral ethics as a weapon to define herself and others because of the lacked confidence in herself. Brenda admired her, and at the same time, she wished that Frank has the same confidence and shows the desires like Taco did to her. It reflects what is essential for men to have.<br/><br/>Three Native Americans (Mr. Grits, Firewater, and Twink) are for the Id, Superego, and Ego. They worked together to find the truth and decide the proper acts for the truth. They were the ones who informed Frank about ""the Great Beyond"" is the idea is created to comfort them when facing death. <br/><br/>Douche is an evil character. He's a reference for people who didn't know how to cope with any wrongful situation. He was angry for being left out. Leaving him out had caused him to think that he's ugly and worthless. It led him to rape and destroyed others to make him a deserving person. <br/><br/>Darren is a human who was being manipulative by the society. He is being unhappy with what he's doing, yet he needs this job to support himself. The grocery store or the corporation uses people like him as a ""human puppet"" to do what is asked because he didn't have other choices. Therefore, in the end, it's a sample of being manipulative by assh*les. <br/><br/>Honey Mustard came back in the grocery store after it's mistaken selected instead of a regular mustard jar. It announced the fact that ""the Great Beyond"" does not exist. He would rather be committing suicide than working for something that is not meaningful in life. This character contains confusion in life. <br/><br/>The pink gum is a personification of Steven Hawkings who told the truth beyond the ability to comprehend for most people. <br/><br/>Humans are national disasters. They cause the ""earthquakes, hurricane, etc."" and kill foods. It's also the truth in reality because we cause a global warming. <br/><br/>Baby Salt is a drug that is seen food being alive. It may refer to why people ate other humans when they were in high of baby salt. <br/><br/>One moment where Frank bumped into a used condom at night time may refer to the fact sex is a taboo and yet people still secretly doing it. <br/><br/>""The Great Beyond"" is an outside of grocery store (heaven) where the life after death is beautiful and a dream for everyone because the God said so. But only God can control your fate, so you must abide by the moral ethics, or you won't get the fate you want.<br/><br/>God said marriage is part of the plan before death. Thus, it drives men and women to objectify things what are think to be worth for romance pairings. It's a creation of high in being the pervert and being desired. <br/><br/>In the last fifteen minutes, it's all about f*cking and sex to make fun of a sex taboo because it's what we strive to live for. <br/><br/>Think about it; what if we get rid of this taboo? Men don't have to be ""fancy, "" and women don't have to be ""glamor."" <br/><br/>F*ck what really are sexual ethics. Get over with these at one point, so, we can drive to do that is based on something more important than solely around sex."

","Observation manages to combine all of the stereotypes shared by different cultures of one another, intertwine this with raunchy humor, ultimately painting a portrait of how intolerable this the planet is becoming.<br/><br/>A few facts (for those whom would prefer NOT to hear the ramblings of a long- time film fanatic): The film has been estimated to have been built on a $19- million budget, grossing about $34-million opening weekend (USA). For your comparison: Finding Dori (2016) cost an estimated $200-million bringing in about $135-million opening weekend (USA). Whether a fan or not, there is clearly something to be said regarding the brilliance that is Seth Rogen.<br/><br/>One thing is clear: this was hand-crafted by Rogen and therefore filled extensively by his observations and humor from start to finish. The script was something he had in the works for nearly ten years!<br/><br/>I suspect many will turn away from this due to religious affiliation. I am an atheist but would stress that with all of the violence, racism, sexism, and every other ""ism"" in the world, that this was an attempt to address the way that many denominations and organizations are misunderstood by one another.<br/><br/>A female coworker at my office came by on Monday morning to exclaim that it was indigent humor, and I quote ""racist."" To those who would even have the slightest inkling of accusing this work racist, you have completely misunderstood. In fact, one of the messages that could be drawn from watching this would have to do with the necessity for removing the ""racist"" culture and indirect racism that can be created through attempting to group individuals by religious affiliation or any other characteristics.<br/><br/>DO NOT take your children. The entire run-time was packed with bad language, a ton of sexual innuendos, so you've been warned.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film, appreciate the message, don't take anything personally. It was not the intent of Rogen or any other Directors/Writers.<br/><br/>Oh, and just to make this ""review-worthy""... the film uses various Super Market foods, drinks, and items to represent humans incorporating the different stereotypes often heard of for numerous Religions, ethnic groups, and sexual preferences/identities. By using such simple characters, it attempts to put some of the world's problems onto the simplest of stages for the world to see and take in for themselves.<br/><br/>----- 5/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"

In between very childish humor and the word ""fuck"" there wasn't a whole lot going on. The taco was Mexican, and the bagel was a Jew. I personally don't agree that the movie was complex.<br/><br/>The racial stereotypes certainly got a ton of laughs from the younger audience at my viewing. As well as the food orgy at the end. Perhaps at the daunting age of 24 I am loosing appreciation for movies like this.<br/><br/>Some reviewers call the religion bashing ""subtle"" but it was what I noticed throughout most of the film. Trying to make fun of anyone who believes in a higher power, which is fine it's your movie. I had just hoped it would have been in a more creative way.

","Firstly, BIG fan of the Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill collective, especially since the first time I lost my **** at Superbad back in day. However, this is, in my opinion, one of the poorest films I have ever seen. The humour wasn't funny or original, and I usually root for the over-the-line, Family-Guy- esque jokes, believe me, but this was beyond off-colour - even with insinuations towards rape being presented as simple gross-out humour scenes. The characters were ridiculous and/or based on racist stereotypes that just aren't funny. I dunno...perhaps it's just that it's incredibly dated or that it's a film for American teens.

"gluedthescreenblog","9","32","69","22 August 2016"," Outrageous Brilliance Sausage Party / 5 Screens
","NO CHILD SHOULD SEE THIS FILM!!!! It was a rare stroke of genius that took the form of a cartoon movie. There have uproarious cartoons in the past i.e. Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park. (They are in filth order, from dirty to shocking) Sausage Party raises the bar to a new low. The aforementioned films and shows make use of modern themes while expressing them with outlandish gambits that live action films can't. <br/><br/>Sausage Party makes use of an all-star cast to bolster its theme. Seth Rogen, James Franco, Bill Hader, Salma Hayek, Jonah Hill, and Kristen Wiig are among a few of the celebrity voices used to bring these grocery store inhabitants to life. Deserving special mention is an actual Hollywood all- star Edward Norton whom lends his talents to this immaturity. Don't overlook the importance of having real stars behind the microphone. Remember that it was robin Williams that brought the Genie to life and made the character last. <br/><br/>Please do not mistake my intentions. I mean only to say that actors are important even in animation. I do not mean to suggest any of these characters will be as memorable as the Genie. <br/><br/>In truth Sausage Party is a discussion on issues such as Faith, Meaningless Human Divisions, and Sex. There are stereotypical depictions of various ethnicities and religions such as Judaism, Islam, the Germans, Native Americans, and Italians. As with any Seth Rogen picture there's heavy use of Jewish humor (whether it is tasteful or not is in question). One of the main characters was a bagel named appropriately, Bagel. Voiced by Edward Norton who was doing his best Woody Allen impression the character developed a friendship with Lavash, a Middle Eastern Flatbread. The two develop a bond on their journey finding common ground in their discovery of love, friendship, and humus! <br/><br/>Once Seth resolved the tensions in the Middle East he moved on to the crisis of faith. The movie revolves around the supermarket foods believing that once human buyers or ""gods"" choose them, they enter a heavenly great beyond. The immortal ""non perishables"" aka Twinkies, Grits, and Alcohol created this fiction in order to bring peace to the market dwellers. Before the genesis (so to speak) the residents lived in terror of the coming slaughter. After generations of this leap of faith a lustful sausage stumbles upon the truth, in the form of an illustrated cook book. <br/><br/>The sausage's attempt to convince his compatriots that their beliefs have been in vain results in a riot. His religious awakening comes after a particularly devout Bun named Brenda Bunderson claims that the misfortune befalling them is a result of their sinful ways. No Rogen outing is complete without gratuitous sex and this is no exception. Though they may be edible it doesn't prevent the cast from getting down and dirty. <br/><br/>The concept of this flick is absolutely genius. It is as simple as ""What if food had feelings""? Can you imagine the almost Psycho like reaction the public would have if this were done as a serious film. Countless viewers could not step into the shower after watching Perkins attack Janet Leigh in the shower. If Alfred Hitchcock or the late Wes Craven directed this picture then people would be in therapy after their last Barbecue. Apart from concept the execution was spot on. The jokes were obvious in places while being smart and subtle in others. The last ten minutes will scar you for life. <br/><br/>If you have scruples then stay home!!! But if you're in the mood for fun and willing to have an open mind then you'll have a great time. <br/><br/>This is a 5 Screen Film according to G2TS. <br/><br/>Stay Glued to the Screen Neil Carroll"

What we got was bored. There were no jokes that you didn't have to have a wasted mental capacity to enjoy. <br/><br/>Then there was a heavy handed subtext about religious freedoms that even the movie itself ignored.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the dick jokes.

It came to a horrific climax towards the end which just left me wondering if it was part of a joke I just wasn't in on. Then again, apart from our nearest neighbour to the north, no one else got it either. The audience started off excited and was led in nervously laughing at the abominable, grotesquery the heaved and lurched and vomited vile streams from it's noise hole but after a short while they fell silent and just stared as I did. <br/><br/>If you must see this film, make sure to get yourself a lobotomy or at least take an interpreter, say the fat idiot who sat behind us and literally NARRATED the whole movie to his moron friends.

I am dead serious....... o-o oh but if you are too young to get into this movie just tell your folks it's the latest from Pixar/Dreamworks :D no no don't do that....... but only if you really want to ;D<br/><br/>The long answer: Sausage Party if the latest haze of smoke from the drug enhanced minds of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and their usual crew; that is a bit of a spoof on the Pixar/Dreamworks animated films (The opening song is composed by Alan Menken even :D yeah the guy behind the songs from The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin just to name a few :D)! <br/><br/>It tells the tale of Frank the Hot Dog voiced by Seth Rogen and Brenda the Bun voiced by the lovely and funny Kristen Wiig and their adventure in their society that is the supermarket Shopwells. They live in a world where every food item views humans as Gods and to be selected to leave the store is a great honor because ""The Great Beyond"" awaits them. However, Frank and Brenda find themselves stranded in the supermarket and trying to find their way back to their aisle in hopes of being ""chosen"" again while unraveling the truth of what happens when food leaves the store and meeting some colorful characters along the way :D<br/><br/>And when I mean colorful I mean this film covered it's bases and effectively makes fun of I think every single race in the book (Irish, German, Native American, Black, Asian, Latino, Muslim, Jewish; I might have missed some) several religions and several communities and to tell you the truth; with how serious, depressing, and for lack of a better term PC the world has become in recent years this was a breath of fresh air that was just the laugh I needed XD<br/><br/>Was I offended and think they went too far sometimes; yes. Did I find some jokes more crude and disgusting then funny; yes. Is it immature; yes. But, those things didn't ruin the movie for me because they went all the way with their humor. My philosophy is that you make fun of everyone; or no one at all and that there is a time and place for humor and a time and place for no humor (but a movie is sometimes the perfect place for humor; it's escapism) and this film understands that. So the fact that some parts got to me showed that it worked; at least from my point of view :3<br/><br/>So if you are someone who is offended easily, doesn't like sex humor, crude humor, swearing humor, immature humor, you will probably have a bad time with this feature film :3 but the fact that we live in a time where an animated R film is possible is fantastic because there hasn't been one is a while (yeah there are more look them up I dare you o_o). <br/><br/>But, to wrap up guys Sausage Party is a brightly animated spoof on the typical Pixar/Dreamworks formula (think Toy Story but with food) fused with a stoner comedy, whose creativity comes from it's gloves off offensive jokes and great visual gags, and strangely has a few messages that might just ring true and resonate with some folks :3 Also, the last third act of this film might go TOO FAR like REALLLLY TOO FAR. I thought they would stop at some point; but NO they keep going and going and it gets MORE and MORE CRAZZZZY; I was stunned, horrified, confused, and laughing all at the same time XD the fact that last third is in this movie just might be worth the price of admission alone! <br/><br/>So for this wild ride I liked it better then expected and I gotta be honest I'm gonna give Sausage Party 41/2 stars out of 5. Or 9 out of 10 by IMDb so maybe 8.5 on there scale I'll just round up :3<br/><br/>As always thank you guys so much for reading my silly reviews it really brings a smile to my face to know you took the time to at least hear my opinion :) I look forward to doing more of these and who knows if enough people request something I might just have to see it ;)"

","Many people see this movie as ""extremely and excessively vulgar"", and I can see their point of view. I agree, it has all kinds of ""toilet humor"" (even literally), but when you scrape off some surface layers, it has a strong message.<br/><br/>The story is about food that is convinced there's a new life beyond the store's door. The movie itself is the satire of the current society we live in, mostly alluding on religious and racial prejudice. The main protagonist, Frank (this is obviously a ""Jesus character"", since both of them hide ""truth"" behind their name) discovers that ""god's"" are not the way they're presented. Although the fruit believes there's ""fruit heaven"" behind the door, and they talk about it religiously, they soon find out that they've been lied to all the time. Frank comes with the proof of it (although all other supermarket products are skeptical at first), they unite despite their differences, conquer ""god's"" (humans) and at the end have an orgy of a life-time. <br/><br/>Since they're basically obsessed with copulation, just like humans are obsessed with ""better life after death"", they prove that, if united, they can have their ""heaven"" before they go through ""great beyond"". I see this as a strong message to people to stop hoping for unknown tomorrow and enjoy life right now.<br/><br/>Humor itself, word play, wise nice.<br/><br/>F**k the Juice!"
"bowmanblue","7","2","2","27 April 2017"," No one should enjoy this film (and yet I did)
","There are some films which should probably come in blank DVD boxes. That way, when they're mixed in with your collection and you have friends or family round, they will never know that you really enjoyed watching an animated sausage discover the meaning of life in a supermarket by indulging in everything from murder to... I'll stop there when it comes to details (that's for the film's final act only).<br/><br/>Yes, seriously, 'Sausage Party' is basically the polar opposite to all those delightful Disney/Pixar movies we've been taking our kids to over the years. Pixar films are delightful fun for all the family. Sausage Party is something you want to keep your kids away from for as long as possible. As I mentioned in the opening, a hotdog learns the (awful) truth about his existence. This particular hotdog is one of many different food types, all living in a supermarket (where else?!). Every morning all the foods for sale cross their fingers (yes, most at least have arms and hands, if not legs, too) and hope upon hope that a friendly human will 'choose' them for a better life in the great beyond (basically through the supermarket's sliding entrance/exit doors). Naturally, our hotdog (voiced perfectly by Seth Rogan) soon realises that his 'perfect life' will ultimately involve being roasted alive before being ground up in a human's mouth and then pushed out through the afore-mentioned human's rear. Hardly an attractive ambition for a sausage in love.<br/><br/>Therefore, he – and his various buddies – set on a plan to escape this. At first it's a little hard to work out where this film will go. It's almost entirely set inside the supermarket and you may well wonder if this setting gives the film enough scope to really go anywhere. I'm pleased to say that that's an incorrect assumption. It never really lets up for a moment. The (very adult) humour comes thick and fast and, if you've seen any other recent Seth Rogan movie, you'll know to expect much profanity, sexual references and the – seemingly obligatory – getting high scene.<br/><br/>You may not be able to tell some of the actors who have leant their vocal talents to this film by their performances, but Edward Norton and Salma Hayek are both newcomers, along with Seth Rogan's usual bunch of suspects such as James Franco and Jonah Hill. If you're into their collaborations then you should enjoy this. It's hard to imagine it will ever be that successful as the concept is just too 'niche' to ever get a mainstream following. It's definitely not one to watch with your grandmother, but it is extremely gross and adult fun if you're in the mood for that sort of entertainment.<br/><br/>Oh, and as a Meat Loaf fan, I loved the 'Bat out of Hell' sequences, but that's probably just me."

","Not your typical animation, Sausage Party is a look into one of the modern world's obsession-food. It delves into the grocery aisles and tells the story from their perspective. Where the love interest of a particular hot dog and bun yearning for each other so intense that they delve into tip play. Raunchy at times, this adolescent humor is funny at times and as long as you enter with that in mind, the movie is pretty good. No stereotype is left behind as you discover a talking taco and whole cast of misfits. The hot dog through his odyssey discovers foods fate and uses it as a cause to warn others. The danger of the human gods and how food nourishes their cravings. There are tender moments where the foods come together for a united front. These horny treats leave nothing behind as the audience is left with there is not better to satisfy a craving that indulge in a little food play.

","I promise you that this review won't have any food-related puns. It would've been easy had the film not used up of every last one that you could think of.<br/><br/>Every now and then someone in Hollywood has the balls to make an animated feature strictly for adults. By every now and then, I mean whenever Matt & Trey feel up to it, which they haven't been in more than a decade... and how many years has it been since The Simpsons Movie? I already forget. Perhaps it's because of how hard it is to advertise. You just can't. It's hard to tell a child that they can't go see a colorful, friendly looking cartoon, of any kind, even if that cartoon contains an egregious amount of F-bombs, provocative religious/political satire and sex jokes.<br/><br/>But Seth Rogen took it upon himself to make one of his own, and after years of rejection from the major studios, we finally have Sausage Party. It is as outrageous, vile, demented, perverted and hilarious as we all dreamed it would be. It ranks with Blazing Saddles, South Park, Team America and Ted in the genre of films that push the non-PC envelope as far as it can go. This film takes no prisoners. The food products live in a racist world where nobody gets along, and worship every kind of crazy religion under the sun... yeah, kind of like our world. Behind it is a message of tolerance, and an even bigger message of the absurdity of organized religion. At this very moment, we needed something like this to come along. Even though I am a Catholic, I appreciated it's daring atheism. It seems like religion is the cause of everything terrible in the world right now. Nothing makes sense anymore. I understand where this little sausage is coming from.<br/><br/>But as deep as the film could be, it's as gross and as stupid as any Seth Rogen comedy in past. But even that's an understatement. It even pushes boundaries on that level. This film has the most hilariously gross ending of any movie I've seen in years. The food all get together and have an orgy. Once you see it, you cannot un-see it. You have been warned, folks."

"zardoz-13","9","22","47","13 August 2016"," The Secret Life of Groceries
","If you enjoy comedies loaded with rude, crude, and often lewd humor, the adult-oriented, computer-generated, supermarket saga ""Sausage Party"" qualifies as a delicious treat you may want to savor more than once. Seth Rogen heads a top-notch cast of voice performers, including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Harlan Williams, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, who incarnate grocery store items spouting obscenities about the validity of life after purchase. This imaginative but disconcerting Sony/Columbia Pictures' release lives up to its R-rating with more vulgar relish than most live-action movies dare. The last time I saw a movie as potentially offensive as ""Sausage Party"" was ""South Park"" creator Trey Parker's sarcastic ""Team America: World Police"" (2004) where puppets performed degrading acts of all kinds on themselves. Initially, ""Sausage Party"" reminded me of those popular Pixar kid comedies about cars and dolls that have acquired the power of reason and behave as if they were human. Mind you, parents should NOT take their children to see ""Sausage Party"" unless they want to contend with questions about theology, aberrant sexuality, and the abuse of bath salts as a recreational drug alternative. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg said that they sought to make the equivalent of a Pixar blockbuster but with a scatological spin. Actually, the whole thing looks like an extended California Raisins cartoon, right down to the white gloves that many characters wear. Clocking in at a lean 83-minutes, ""Sausage Party"" amounts to a clever Pixar parody from fade-in to fadeout unless its fundamentally blasphemous agenda alienates you. Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and the late Christopher Hitchens would likely applaud it for its atheism. Not since Woody Allen has anybody tried to ponder issues about life and death and the whole damn thing as much as co-directors Greg Tiernan of the ""Thomas & Friends"" series and Conrad Vernon of ""Shrek 2,"" along with scenarists Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg. While the animated supermarket products yearn to be purchased and redeemed by the gods before their shelf life expiration date, ""Sausage Party"" also contains a conventional heroes versus villains narrative. Ultimately, humor and good taste unravel toward the end when the filmmakers go overboard with an orgy to end all orgies. How ""Sausage Party"" avoided an NC-17 rating is a mystery.<br/><br/>Set during the Fourth of July holiday, ""Sausage Party"" unfolds inside a sprawling Shopwell's supermarket, but additional scenes occur in the suburbs, too. Everything is told from the perspective of supermarket items whether they be fruits, meats, vegetables, liquids, cookies, candies, and/or cleaning products. A hotdog named Frank (Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up""), cannot wait to snuggle up with the dame of his dreams, Brenda (Kristen Wiig of ""Ghostbusters""), a voluptuous Betty Boop-type bun with lipstick and eyelashes. Frank is stuck in a Fancy Dogs' package of frankfurters near Brenda's package of Glamorous Buns, and these two ogle each other like hormone-addled teenagers. Indeed, ""Sausage Party"" is an anthropomorphic allegory where frankfurters, buns, bagels, jars of honey mustard, cookies, cleaning products, and imperishables discuss their fate as if they were human. At the same time, humans dominate this skewered universe. However, the supermarket items and the humans cannot communicate with each other, unless the humans inject themselves with bath salts. At this point, things get hopelessly absurd. Of course, nothing about abusing bath salts is remotely facetious, but ""Sausage Party"" uses bath salts as a gag. Predictably, actor James Franco voices the anonymous individual named Druggie who discovers to his horror that he can converse with a hotdog after he shoots up with bath salts. Meantime, what is genuinely hilarious is watching various goofy food items nestled around a campfire smoking marijuana. When was the last time that you saw a frankfurter getting stoned in a movie? Anyway, our hero and heroine live in a warped world where they believe that the humans who shop for them are actually gods. Furthermore, our hero and heroine believe that if they are ripe enough and fresh enough these hallowed gods will choose them and literally take them to 'The Great Beyond' where they will attain celestial fulfillment. Everything comes crashing down when a human accidentally buys the wrong kind of mustard and brings his jar of honey mustard back to exchange it for regular mustard. The jar of honey mustard surprises everybody with his shocking revelations about what really occurs after purchase. Later, we are shown what happens after these happy items arrive at homemaker's kitchen. At this point, ""Sausage Party"" turns into an amusing but eerie parody of a torture-porn horror epic. Miraculously, one hotdog manages to escape this slaughter-house scene whereupon he encounters Druggie.<br/><br/>Unmistakably, ""Sausage Party"" isn't geared for everybody. Some scenes are so outlandish that you cannot help but laugh. At the same time, you find yourself chuckling perhaps at stuff you wouldn't ordinarily treat with such levity. The melodrama in ""Sausage Party"" concerns a Douche, female hygiene bottle, who dreams lustily about the woman who added him to her shopping cart. She has also chosen the demoralized jar of honey mustard, and it decides to commit suicide by jumping out of her shopping cart. Frank and Brenda struggle to save him, but fail when another shopping cart collides with them. Everything turns upside down. Frank and Brenda topple from the cart along with other food items. The scene is reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with a can of noodles scraping his noodles together and tucking them back inside his ruptured canister. Before it is all over with, Frank and Brenda lead a revolt against mankind while a pink, paraplegic blob of gum imitating Stephen Hawking engineers a ""Stargate"" escape archway out of a toilet rim trimmed with Christmas lights to transport them to friendlier universe. As sacrilegious as it is sidesplitting, ""Sausage Party"" provides summer moviegoers with a drastic change of pace from the habitual Hollywood hokum."

","It may not be an Oscar wiener, but you'll relish this raunchy yet smart film about one sausage, Frank (Voiced by Seth Rogen) quest on discovering the truth about his existence and what really happens when the food are chosen to leave the grocery store. Without spoiling the movie, too much; I have to say, I kinda glad, this movie came out. After all, it's seem like 2012's botch animation film, 'Food Fight' ruin the whole cool concept. This movie directed by Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernon went through a lot of development hell, in its way to being product. Pitch eight years ago by creator/writers Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg, it seem like nobody in Hollywood was open to the idea until producer, Megan Ellison and eventually Sony came along. However, the early draft of the script was leaked in the Sony hack in November 2014, further stalling progress of the movie. Still, even with that. The movie got made, because of two factors. One is the success of 2014's runaway hit, 'The Interview' and the second, being that it's been many years since the last good profanity fill Rated R completely-CGI animation comedy came to theaters with 1999's 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'. People were really looking forward to this film; as so was I. I like the blended of low brow gross humor, violent food deaths, silly food puns, with theologically religious dogma style debate that the movie is going for. It made for a unique watch. Parents whom accidentally take their kids to see the movie and complain afterwards are idiots. This animated comedy is decidedly not for kids; as its trailers, rambunctiously filthy in more ways than one. It also got NC-17, before being tone down. Nothing is sacred, here. Yet, there is only a few things that I didn't like, about the film. Some of the profanity in the film seem a little forced. Some of the curse words don't really match, the tone of the sentences. It somewhat lose its emphasis. The film rely way too much on the overabundance of foul language, and sexual innuendos to carry the film. Some of the language is creative, however, others are so groan-worthy. And while some jokes not exactly funny, it's at least consistently amusing and has a positive attitude. Also, the story is a bit off-putting when it's introduce other supermarket items ranging from feminine hygiene products to bathroom tissue into the mix. It's not, because the item come across as gross, but the fact that it's makes the story, somewhat jarring. It's weird that they can come alive, yet others items like knifes, cigars, plates, and cups do not. Honestly, it could be better, if they stick to the whole 'living food' concept. It's already a bit confusing. Throughout the whole movie, I was wondering if any of the previous ingredients to make such complex food, were sentient before being killed off. Is a fusion or reincarnation thing? Also, how in the hell does, the food, not know that they will be killed off? By the look at the place, this supermarket does have a deli and butcher. They would have to notice, something odd. I guess the limited intelligence sense is given, since many of perishable products can't be more than a few days old. Plus, I get the whole 'portal' idea toward the end as something to laugh at, for being ridiculous, but it really comes out of nothing. At less, the infamous 'orgy' scene made a little more sense to the story. Anyways, thinking too much of the logically of the plot will hurt your head. It's better off, just to turn your brain, off and enjoy the ride. Despite the confusing plot, I did like all the film references, this film got, ranging from 1998's 'Saving Private Ryan', 1991's 'Terminator 2' and 1961's 'West Side Story', even if some of the shouts out, were a little too out there like 1962's Twilight Zone's episode 'To Serve Man'. Despite that, the voice actors including Michael Cera, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Salma Hayek, and others are very lively in their performances, even if their characters are shallow, somewhat racist stereotypes. I have to give props to some of the actors as some of them, were playing multiply characters like Bill Hader and Harland Williams. However, I have to say, actor Edward Norton does the best, out of all of them. His impression of director/comedian Woody Allen was amazing with his Jewish character, Sammy Bagel Jr. You really didn't see that, coming at all from him. The celebs cameos were also fun to see. Singer, Meat Loaf playing Meat Loaf has to be, my favorite. The first-class computer animation from Nitrogen Studio is also clear and colorful. It just as good as the animation from big time studios like Pixar, Disney, DreamWorks, and Illumination Entertainment in the last decade. It just suck that many of the animators at Nitrogen Studios worked under poor conditions and were forced by Greg Tiernan to work overtime without pay; with results of many of the animators going uncredited if complaining. While that part of the production might not be cool; the work, they put out, were astounding, no matter what. The music by long ex-Disney composer Alan Menken was also terrifying. The opening number was very well-done and will get critical from some religious fundamentalism. Overall: It's a party worth attending more than once. The comedy about grocery store foods and products facing an existential crisis, is a must-watch for anybody looking for a good time laugh. That's if you can stomach, its menu style of humor. Highly recommended."

","Sharknado was a better movie, there is no humour other than the profanity and even the profanity isn't funny, it's taken to the point where it's just plain bigoted. The movie manages to insult and ridicule almost everything and everyone imaginable without actually being funny.It is waste of time and money I would not recommend. The only purpose of the movie is to further racism without really giving any laughs. It's like watching your drunk racist uncle trying to be funny but it just makes you cringe and laugh awkwardly because he's a bigot and you don't know how he gets invited to anything. I would rather watch every Sharknado film in a continuous loop than ever watch this movie again."

","Yes, this movie is very raunchy and filled with sexual innuendo, yes, it uses many stereotypes (racial or otherwise), but it's not stupid. OK, it is stupid, but it's stupid in a smart way.<br/><br/>""Sausage Party"" starts with a raunchy song condemning religion, and basically continues on that note. The film argues that if there is a God, he is indifferent to our well being. It states that our vision of God and the afterlife was simply invented to rid us of our constant fear of death. It does contain many stereotypes of all kinds, and it even has a rape scene (yes, a rape scene), but it's a film that actually condemns hate, and all of the pointless rules religion gives us that prevent us from doing what we enjoy, or even inspire hatred. The film says that since death and hatred and racism and violence are rampant among the human race, we should stop hating others for their differences and rather unite as one human race, and just have one big orgy. Okay, that last part is only partially true, but that's basically the point. We focus so much on our separate beliefs and versions of the afterlife and how to get there, that maybe we forget to just enjoy our life on earth.<br/><br/>Aside from that message, it also has some seriously detailed animation, and some clever visual humor, which is something we don't get enough these days, and one of the strongest arguments for the fact that anything can be funny in certain context. To top it all off, it's an incredibly original idea, and probably one that can never be replicated again, and in the sea of reboots, remakes, and sequels that are thrown at us, this stands out, in all of its absurd, raunch- filled, excessive glory. And, yes, it genuinely made me laugh. Hard."

I'm not against foul language or crude humor, but there still needs to be some context with it. When a f-bomb is used every other sentence, it really waters down the effect when language like that could, as Spongebob would say, act as a ""sentence enhancer.""

","I enjoyed this movie, it doesn't purports to be something it's not, a very direct ""straight to your face"" movie which is not afraid to slay certain cultures and criticize them at the same time, as an a Jew and an Israeli I find Seth Rogan's humor towards Jews very funny, loved when the so called ""Nazi"" Mayonnaise sang about killing the ""juice"" (Jews) for example and I can testify that the entire crowd in the movie theatre shared the same reply of laughter after this joke.<br/><br/>I loved the way they reprimanded about the Israeli- Palestinian issue, the Israeli is represented by a begal and the Palestinian is represented by a láfa (taboon food), the Israeli was described as a vulnerable pacifist while the Arab was described as an aggressive and arrogant food.<br/><br/>The Mexican tacos and tequilas were expressing their willing to start a new life in another aisle. But most of the criticism were obviously pointed to the American culture of nowadays where the sausage and the bun just can't wait to finally have an intercourse, the bun is very judgmental of her shape and body and always wonder if she is not as pure as she was when she was in the packing.<br/><br/>In summary, I love racial and cultural jokes and that's what I was laughing about in the vast majority of the movie and I can't say that one of the last scenes where the foods, alcoholic beverages and the hygiene products had sexual intercourse didn't leave me traumatized, it took my innocence away.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie as it gives you a decent break from reality and life and just let focus on the struggle of the living supermarket products to exist."

The only thing I find offensive is how unfunny and dull I found this movie to be. I will concede that maybe this movie was never for me. Seth Rogan tends to be hit or miss for me, and his hits usually work for me because of the other actors. This is shock humour: the movie, and frankly, it doesn't even do that right. LOL, another food pun/sex joke, and don't forget to drop plenty of F-bombs. That is the extent of the comedy. For f*cks sake, you can do better than that. South Park and Team America come to mind.

","As a parent, I see more than my fair share of animated features. To be honest, I love movies so I don't really mind. Still, 'Sausage Party' is a refreshing–and long overdue–change of pace. Finally there's an R-rated, full-length animated feature for adults. OK, maybe it's for adults with a somewhat juvenile sense of humor–but adults nonetheless.<br/><br/>I spoke with the directors--Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon--about the experience. As I suspected, the initial concept was pitched by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I imagined Rogen was high and started pondering how the food on the shelves feels, and then BOOM! Artistic genius. It was interesting to learn how much raunchier the movie COULD have been, and how they had to cut scenes to bring it down to rated R."

","Animation has never been such a fantastic blend of fun and dirty as seen in ""Sausage Party"" from Sony Pictures. Created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can't help but love him for it, the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer.<br/><br/>Directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan helm the ship that was written by Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen, Kyle Hunter, and Ariel Shaffir with a steady hand as they play off social and racial stereotypes in the vein of something we would have seen on ""South Park."" Trickle in a talented voice cast that includes Rogen, Oscar nominees Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, and you got a formula for something downright hilarious.<br/><br/>""Sausage Party"" takes no prisoners as the profanity and graphic nature makes an educated film-goer wonder ""how the hell did this just get an 'R' rating from the MPAA?"" Shock value will bubble to the brim and likely spill over as we see food make sexual advances, dirty and used condoms interact with a smaller hotdog, and an orgy that might manage to trump any movie in the last 15 years.<br/><br/>Taking the ""Toy Story"" premise and asking the question, what if food could talk? ""Sausage"" gives its characters a dynamic range of emotions as they mix in the very questions of today that marry the ideas of religion, purpose, and tolerance. I'm sure somewhere deep in the bones of every Pixar writer in the world, they've wanted to make THIS kind of movie. Why wouldn't they? The animation is tenderly bright and vibrant, creating a world of chaos but clarity. They work through the material with a bold and fearless nature that the Academy Awards would feel so lucky to be included among their Animated Feature nominees in 2017.<br/><br/>Stepping outside the box with a raunchy song, Alan Menken's compositions and work stand just as high as anything delivered this year so far. Vivaciously alive in every beat, you can't help but smile ear to ear as the party rolls on. I'd surely say Menken is the hunt for an Oscar nomination in Original Song.<br/><br/>The rest of the voice works of Bill Hader, Michael Cera, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd, and ESPECIALLY Nick Kroll are purely delightful.<br/><br/>This is not the movie for Mom, unless your mother is awesome in every way.

This is not the movie for your sophisticated movie friend because he or she is probably going to call you dumb for laughing at the jokes.

"subxerogravity","8","21","46","14 August 2016"," So hilarious, So so funny, great, great comedy!!
","Not the strangest animated movie I've ever seen as far as the animation is concern. It's very straight forward. What Seth Rogen does with this film is take the traditional archetypes of cartoons and animation and puts a hard R spin on it, with some of the most out there jokes you could only get away with by animating food. No sexual undertones, everything was pretty out in the open.<br/><br/>Truly from the makers of This Is the End as it stars most of the cast of that movie (minus Jay Baruchel) and adding such voice talent as Ed Norton, Salma Hayek, and Kristen Wiig.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen plays the voice of Frank, part of a pack of sausages, Frank's world is no bigger than the isle he lives in. He spends his life waiting for the moment when the gods will select him to travel to the great beyond so that he can finally ""enter"" Brenda, a hot dog bun that happens to be his girlfriend. however, Frank discovers that the great beyond is not the paradise that was described.<br/><br/>It's a bit disturbing. I'm use to Disney's anthropomorphic ducks, and got use to talking cars in Pixar's Cars, and even though I was raised on Duck Tales, It has not stop me from eating duck. This is different. This movie is basically telling me that bread and vegetables are alive, which means I can't eat anything. It's weirdly hilarious watching a a half eaten cookie cry because someone took a bite out of it.<br/><br/>Like a typical cartoon, Sausage party has a hidden agenda, with all the foods being separated in isles that represent the culture that they belong to, the different food has to work together and get past those differences in order finish their quest to discover what the great beyond is all about, which is the second agenda as the movie does point out the oddities of religion in a cleaver way. <br/><br/>It's so funny, there is far too much to point out cause it all made me laugh so hard (Although, Nick Knoll plays the voice of a Douche, and it was gut busting).<br/><br/>Not since This Is the End have I laugh so hard at a Seth Rogen movie, It's definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com"
"Quinoa1984","8","21","46","12 August 2016"," a full course meal of a very dangerous comedy!
","Some of you may be too young to remember (or maybe too old, who knows), but once upon a time a man named Ralph Bakshi made hard-R rated animation that was decidedly not meant for simply for families to gobble up, so at the same time Disney put out something like Robin Hood, he had Heavy Traffic, which was an semi-autobiographical, ""X-rated"" look at life in Brooklyn with all the rough edges showing, or in 1975 (his masterpiece to me) Coonskin, which took off from Song of the South to make a scathing satire on race using black caricatures, blaxploitation and other characters like a naked woman with red-white-and-blue body paint. But of course times have changed and now animation is practically never even made much less released at a wide scale (when was the last time, South Park, maybe, or by extension Team America). So, with this in mind, and ironic to say given the subject matter, but thank God for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg for Sausage Party.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect movie? No, but who the f*** cares? This is one of the smarter films of the summer, if not the year, and surprising in that it delivers one thing in its marketing - a parody of all of these talking-whatever movies (you know from Pixar, ""when the lights go out X is actually alive and talking, and there's an adventure story where one or two characters get separated and have to find their way back etc etc"") and with the kind of ""explicit"" language that Rogen-Goldeberg and company have put out there since Superbad nine years ago. However if you see the movie it delivers something deeper, subverting expectations that come with something that looks so goofy (the film's directors have credits ranging from Monsters vs Aliens, with Rogen did a voice for by the way, and Thomas the Tank Engine videos!) but is about... religion and the power and susceptibility of beings towards faith.<br/><br/>That may sound like blowing hot air like, how can this be anything more than its surface-level crude comedy and stereotypes? But right from the on-set, where the characters refer to the ""Gods"" and the opening song (the only main one so it's not a musical) where it's all about praising the Gods and the ""Great Beyond"" which is, of course, the Great Lie of being chosen by humans to be taken away as what they're meant for, the writers of the film take an opportunity and don't settle only for the gross-out... this is not to say this is not a filthy, raucous, ludicrous film that includes such things as, well, bath salts that make people hallucinate to the point where they can SEE THE FOOD TALKING (is that what they do, I wouldn't know, haven't tried it, sorry), and stereotypes of every thing you can think of from Irish potatoes to a Jewish bagel and a Muslim falafel and a Mexican (Lesbian!) taco to a Firewater Native American alcohol can (and Craig Robinson... well, see the movie to know about that). <br/><br/>Because, yes, they're here in spades! What makes Sausage Party impactful is that it takes a leap to be *about* something, even if it ends up being rather gruesome and very, horrifically, violent (yes, for an R-rated movie this is one of the more violent pieces of escapism - perhaps in its way more honest than something like a PG-13 Suicide Squad despite/because of things like decapitated heads or exploding organs and so on). It even has a point about what it means to be an inspiration to people, that to change minds you can't simply show the ""truth"" right away and that different factions can't process that information. If that sounds odd, well, this climax is especially odd and totally insane. But it's also a brilliant conclusion to a very good movie, full of balls-to-the-wall action and a don't-take-no-prisoners attitude towards the food vs the humans. It reaches Inglourious Basterds level catharsis.<br/><br/>Again, it's not totally up there with This is the End or Pineapple Express, the landmarks for this duo and their collaborators. On a first watch the Jew/Arab duo were a little one-note as a joke (so are a lot of the characters, which are fine, but these are here for longer period), and it also didn't make sense completely what could or couldn't talk (i.e. why the food AND things like a d**che or toilet paper or so on, what about the shopping cart or a television, where's the line drawn?) But these are relatively minor complaints in a movie that gets by by being so harrowingly hysterical in how it delivers its comedy - these guys have the opposite of fear, which is what you need for comedy. They have confidence in their vulgarity, so who cares if it has like 400 f***s? It has zero of them to give! Add on impressive voice-work (Edward Norton as the bagel! And James Franco gives one of his best performances in a while as ""Druggie"") and you got yourself a winner, and a fine successor to people who used animation as a mechanism for delivering hardcore, drag-through-the-mud satire like Bakshi or Mike Judge."

A silly animation movie full of raunchy jokes and laughs. If you take this movie for face value, it will still be very goofy and funny. There were times were I could not stop laughing. The pun game is out of control. Some of them will probably go over your head if you are not paying close attention.<br/><br/>The thing that put this movie over the top for me though, is that it is almost like a Pixar film for adult themes. The most common and blatant one is God. The movie makes a lot of comparisons to modern religion raising the question, ""Does God exist?"" They even through in a lot of references to how the Bible came about, and how many people believe the Bible has been changed throughout the years. <br/><br/>The also bring up many cultural problems with race. The different foods don't always play nice with one another and it makes for some intrigued insight on modern society. <br/><br/>Finally, they make a strong point about how women are punished and judged much more harshly in society. The main point is that women should not be judged harsher for being sexual when men are the same way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think the point of the movie was to not hold back and enjoy life not worrying about consequences that may or may not exist.

"meshjoy","8","19","41","15 August 2016"," What Foodfight Should Have Been
","Firstly, to any parents looking at this page, DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THIS. It may look like your typical kids' movie, but trust me, it's NOT. If you know this is rated R, and think your kids are mature enough to handle what Sausage Party has in store, oh boy, you are WRONG. I was barely even able to handle it, and I'm 21! <br/><br/>Anyway, when I saw the trailers for this film, I was beyond excited. I was thrilled to know that an animated adults film would be in theaters. The animation looked great, the story had promise, and the humor especially got my attention with how funny it seemed. So, what did I think of Sausage Party? Well, it was great! The animation was almost up there with Pixar. Almost. Some of the characters looked a bit generic, but I wasn't expecting Pixar quality. I was just expecting a good film, and indeed I got one. Not only is the animation good, but the typical story of things coming to life when humans aren't around was taken to a whole new level. I liked how the food really was alive in front of humans, but they couldn't see the food alive unless they were on drugs. Bath salts, to be more specific. The humor.....it's definitely not for everyone. If you're easily offended by racial jokes or sexual jokes, this is NOT your movie. They throw almost every racial stereotype at you, and there is A LOT of sexual content. A lot of the jokes the movie had to offer had me and my boyfriend laughing hysterically. We've already seen a few of Seth Rogan's movies, so we're all too familiar with his comedic style. Most of the characters were enjoyable to watch. My personal favorite was Barry the deformed hot dog. While I'm not too big of a fan of Michael Cera, I noticed that he wasn't his typical, awkward self in this role. He wasn't as soft spoken, and delivered some pretty hilarious scenes. Teresa Taco is a close second. She brings some funny lines into the film, and we see that she's not that soft of a taco. XD I was surprised to find out that Alan freaking Menken did the music for this film. ALAN MENKEN! The man who wrote the songs for The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Tangled! Disney MOVIES! The very first scene in this movie is a musical, and boy, does it give off a Disney feel. Only, a more adult Disney feel. The song is hilarious, and does a great job of giving off the tone of the movie. The violence in this movie is done HILARIOUSLY. The way the food is torn apart, and the battle with the humans toward the end nearly had me rolling on the floor with laughter. I also admire how smartly written this film was. Yeah, this isn't just a raunchy movie. This movie tackles some serious topics, mainly religion and beliefs in general. Some of it can be subtle, and some of it is obvious and in your face. But overall, the message is strong, and needs to be heard within today's society.<br/><br/>I don't have too many issues with Sausage Party. The cursing becomes stale after a while. It was funny hearing a talking piece of food say ""fuck"" after a couple times, but then it started to get a bit annoying. Almost every sentence in this script has ""fuck"" in it. I get that this is an adult movie, but not all adult movies rely on curse words to be funny. I found the main characters of Frank and Brenda to be a tad bit generic and boring. They weren't terrible characters, but I've seen them done to death in other movies. I personally liked the side characters more than them. The humans had odd designs, and I didn't feel they were creative enough. But then again, we're supposed to focus more on the food than on the people, so I can forgive that. The ending, however..........was cringe-worthy. I know people often say it's the funniest/unforgettable part of the film, but for me, I felt it was unnecessary and was only there for shock value. I was definitely shocked, and I found it difficult to watch. I guess since I'm not as into sexual humor, and it came out of nowhere for me. I wasn't expecting a taco to lick a bun's p***y and have three guys around them jacking off. I kid you not, that's what happens, and there's more that I will not mention. I will say that I cannot look at a bagel the same way again.<br/><br/>So, while there are a few nitpicks I have with Sausage Party, I found it to be a very enjoyable movie. It was fun, and very well written. There haven't been many good animated films out this year. But ones that were good, like Zootopia and Finding Dory, didn't provide as much humor. It was very nice to see an animated film this year that was not only good, but very funny as well.<br/><br/>By the way, if you're not sure what the title of this review is referring to, Foodfight is a CGI animated movie that also takes place in a supermarket, but instead of talking food, it's talking food mascots. It's considered to be one of the worst animated films to ever be made. Foodfight and Sausage Party have a bit in common, particularly the ending scenes with the characters from the market battling the villains. Only, Sausage Party did it a WHOLE LOT BETTER. If you're curious about Foodfight, I'm sure you can find it on YouTube. But be warned. It may be a lot more tamer than Sausage Party, but it is seriously a bad movie. A REALLY bad movie. It's a fact. I have yet to hear ANYONE say that it's good, well, without being sarcastic."

","Say what you want about this movie but at the very least acknowledge that this is a creative story. Sausage Party is about a sausage that learns the true fate of all the food that resides at Shopwell. He must convince his girlfriend as well as everyone else the truth before it is too late. While all of this is going on a douche wants to seek revenge on the sausage and his girlfriend. <br/><br/>There is not much of an intriguing plot to the story. What the movie does have is many funny gags and jokes to keep the viewer entertained throughout. These jokes are however pretty dirty and vulgar and will make you think ""did he just say that?"". This movie is certainly not for kids or adults who dislike heavy amounts of violence and sex in their movies. This movie also really focuses on religion to the point where you are about to say enough, we get it. It didn't get under my skin like so many other reviewers on this site. I still found myself enjoying most of the banter though. <br/><br/>This movie will offend a lot of people much like Seth Macfarlane's projects. If you enjoy shows like Family Guy and American Dad you will definitely really enjoy this movie."

","Sausage Party is an adult CGI animated comedy film. I'm a big fan of Disney Pixar animated movies and this film is a fun and enjoyable parody of them. Even though the humour sometimes felt forced, the film's message of self-discovery is what I believe holds it up.<br/><br/>At ""Shopwell's"" supermarket, all the anthropomorphic groceries on sale dream of one day being picked by customers to be taken to their new homes. However, some of the groceries soon learn the terrible truth of what happens to them once they have been purchased by humans. A sausage named Frank (voiced by Seth Rogen) attempts to warn his fellow Shopwell's grocery items of their inevitable fate before it is too late.<br/><br/>Filled to the brim with crude jokes and political incorrectness, Sausage Party is an enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films. The animation was nice to look at and definitely on par with most of today's CGI animated features. The jokes didn't always work, but the ones that did had me laughing out loud. This film is not for the easily offended and definitely not for children, but if you enjoy the comedy of Seth Rogen and his stoner buddies, then I recommend seeing it.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10."
"jellyneckr","Null","17","36","13 August 2016"," Ridiculous in the best possible way
","The R-rated movie for adults is a rare treat. While Ralph Bakshi made a name for himself with a series of adult animated movies (some of which were actually rated X) in the 1970s and 1980s, very few film directors are willing to produce such crude material in an art form that is most commonly viewed as for kids only. This may be partly due to fear over what the impact such a project could have on the trajectory of one's career, but it probably has more to do with the fact that R-rated feature films don't make any money at the box office, with the exception being amazing South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. With a budget of only $19 million, the Seth Rogen produced Sausage Party may not be an expensive endeavor, though it certainly seems like it could have been a risky one for his career. Lucky for him, the results are a pretty strong success. An absolutely filthy, incredibly juvenile, and intentionally offensive romp, Sausage Party is just about as bizarre and bold as any movie released by a major studio this year. But more importantly, it's also very, very funny.<br/><br/>Sausage Party is not a ground-breaking comedy classic like the South Park movie, but it's also unlike anything one is likely to see in the next decade. Sausage Party can be seen as a not completely subtle satire of the Disney/Pixar pictures of the past two decades, though even for someone who has never seen a Disney/Pixar film, Sausage Party is probably guaranteed to create hysterical laughter at least a few times, especially for fans of any of the cast members. Seth Rogen voices somewhat of a typical Seth Rogen character, albeit one that is a sausage. As one might expect from a Rogen picture, Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are put in as the best friends, also sausages. James Franco is Druggie, whose character name is pretty self-explanatory. Meanwhile, Kristen Wiig is Rogen's romantic interest, a hot dog bun. All of this is twice as outrageous and stupid as it sounds. However, it's also more clever than it should be most of the time, and always fun to watch, even during scenes that are rather gross and violent. Those scenes, as much as they might seem be in the film for shock value, are also highly effective. I never knew what was coming during Sausage Party and frequently found myself surprised by what would happen next, which is something I can almost never say about studio comedies.<br/><br/>As great as Sausage Party can be, it unfortunately can't sustain itself completely for its short 89-minute running time. While never a chore to watch, the last 15-20 minutes aren't quite as good as what came before it, and the movie kind limps to its conclusion. The ending could have been a lot better, although it by no means destroys the overall enjoyment of the film. Just like most animated features these days, the end of Sausage Party hints at a sequel. Sausage Party will no doubt be successful given its small budget, though I hope there isn't a follow-up. There is no way Sausage Party 2 could feel as fresh and surprising. Sausage Party itself may not hold upon repeat viewings as so many of the jokes are based on shock value. But based on my one viewing so far, Sausage Party is ridiculous in the best possible way, and one of the most entertaining movies of the summer. 7/10"
"Amari-Sali","7","17","36","13 August 2016"," This is the story of how food learned the truth of their fate and when they fought back.
","It was all just a dream. One day, in the great beyond, the place outside the supermarket doors, Frank would finally be between Brenda. Oh, he has dreamed of it so long, being between her buns, and she has dreamed of having him inside her. But then Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) ruins everything. He plants the idea in Frank's head that the great beyond is a lie and as he attempts to commit suicide Frank saves him and Brenda tries to save Frank from falling. Alas, Honey Mustard falls to his death and alongside Frank and Brenda, many other food items meet end up on the floor and fear that now they may never meet the great beyond.<br/><br/>But alas, there is hope! All Frank and Brenda need to do is stuff themselves in another package. Nevermind they have to trek the floor and will likely be dirty because they must meet the great beyond by any means necessary. But Honey Mustard's last words live on. In fact, they haunt Frank so much that he seeks out Firewater (Bill Hader) to learn the truth. Something he, nor his fellow food items, are ready for.<br/><br/>Commentary<br/><br/>43 times. I laughed 43 times during this movie. I laughed to the point is hurt a little bit. Yet, at times I felt bad about laughing for while the food puns, like the one Douche (Nick Kroll), did were hilarious, most of the jokes were at the expense of food with various ethnicities. Jewish and Arabian jokes were in full force, alongside stereotypical Black jokes, Native American jokes, and there is even German food which has a Hitler-esque leader.<br/><br/>To say the least, while Rogen and company have always been vulgar, it does seem this movie kind of was digging at the bottom of the barrel. Especially since, while there was some attempt at social commentary with the war between Jewish and Arabian food, for the most part, this movie is just about making you laugh at stupid things. Which there is nothing wrong with, but is a bit disappointing since films starring Seth Rogen usually seem to attempt to be about more than just that.<br/><br/>Things To Note<br/><br/>Prepare to have your jaw drop as you watch a food orgy.<br/><br/>Low Points<br/><br/>One of the main things I've always liked about Seth Rogen films is that alongside a guarantee of laughter, there is usually some heart. You feel for the characters, see them grow, and it makes it so a sensitive soul may even get a little teary-eyed. With this film, though, the main objective is to make a funny, R-rated animated comedy. Yes, the food is being eaten and they look at it as murder. Yes, there is some attempts with the food to try to speak on racial and ethnic tension and how we should all work well together. However, you can't even say working in those topics and ideas was a secondary objective. If anything, it is like the thought came up, there may have been some discussion on how to pursue the complexities of all these different cultures, but at a certain point there was a deadline and they just decided it isn't worth exploring. After all, why ruin a politically incorrect movie with a bunch of kumbaya nonsense? <br/><br/>My point is, the film meets its expectations of being funny, but I felt slightly disappointed by the lukewarm attempt to make this film about more than jokes. Something I feel is part of Rogen's signature style when it comes to films he stars in.<br/><br/>On The Fence<br/><br/>As offensive as this can come off, one can argue that this goes by the Seth McFarlane style of comedy in which everyone is going to be aimed at and laughed at. Be it Mexicans and Hispanics, Black people, Jews, people of central Eurasian descent, Asians, gay people, and probably more, everyone is an equal opportunity target. Which doesn't necessarily takeaway from the tired stereotypes used in this movie, but who watches a comedy nowadays expecting them to be clean and inoffensive? Such a thing requires more effort and talent than most modern comedians have."
"reelopinionated","8","17","36","12 August 2016"," Sausage Party
","Sausage Party is the latest Seth Rogen project that has been on my radar since the concept was announced. Imagining a raunchy Toy Story with the brain of Rogen behind it was quite appealing to me, and this movie delivered on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Not only is Sausage Party hilarious, it is also oddly philosophical. Following the journey of Frank (Rogen), the film delves into topics such as the afterlife and sacred texts. At times the film is as downright preachy as the fiery evangelicals that Rogen and Goldberg skewer, causing the film to get bogged down toward the third act due to Rogen obsessing over every flaw of organized religion. Overall Rogen ends the film on a more open minded note, redeeming the message he is so adamant on sharing.<br/><br/>The true star here is the writing, as the film cleverly uses every food pun imaginable all while balancing it with a solid story. Inventive is the greatest compliment one can give this film due to its hilarious cast bringing to life a wide array of characters, withe Nick Kroll taking the cake as the most fitting voice casting choice. Although falling flat on a number of jokes, the film picks itself back up quickly for a doozy of an ending that anyone watching this film will never forget."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","7","12","29 August 2017"," A lot of rawness but nowhere near enough sauce
","The concept was a pretty intriguing one and unlike any other concept personally seen before. Reading the very polarising reviews, mostly from audiences that had people defending it and others hating it with a passion, and being aware of what kind of humour there'll be and what to expect, there was no trouble knowing what to let myself in for.<br/><br/>'Sausage Party', after seeing it, is not as bad as has been made out by those who hated it (understandably), there are redeeming qualities here and there are far worse animated films out there that are much more cheaply made, poorly conceived and offensive in their lack of quality. 'Sausage Party', with that being said, also could have been much more, an intriguing and unique concept with severely under-cooked and muddled execution. Crude, juvenile humour doesn't always offend me and am constantly saying how annoying the constantly spouted ""it's a kid's movie"" cliché needs to be nipped in the bud.<br/><br/>It's wholly dependent on how the crude, juvenile humour is executed, 'South Park' is as crude, as bold and as controversial as one can possibly get but executes its very satirical, daring and takes-no-prisoners humour much more sharply and cleverly. How 'Sausage Party' executes its crude, juvenile humour is instead excessive, repetitive and gratuitous.<br/><br/>Certainly there are good things. Have no qualms about the animation, which is rich in detail, colourful and quite inventive in places. The soundtrack is catchy. The voice cast is good, and even they alone are reason enough for anybody to know what to let themselves in for (Seth Rogan and Kristin Wiig are no strangers to the humour seen in 'Sausage Party').<br/><br/>Nick Kroll and Edward Norton, the latter's dead-on channelling of Woody Allen being the most inspired the film gets, are particularly good. Rogan and Wiig also bring personality to their roles. There are parts that are inspired and equally horrifying and hilarious, like the scene with the can of spaghetti spoofing 'Saving Private Ryan', and some witty dialogue but it's Norton's Allen channelling that provides the biggest laughs.<br/><br/>However, too much of 'Sausage Party's' writing falls flat. The cussing and sexual raunchy innuendos epitomise excessive and gratuitous (some of it is very out of place as well), while the vulgarity is not as witty or as clever as it likes to think and some of it is very repetitive. The dialogue makes one cringe more than laugh and completely lacks wit or fun, it's just dumb and insipid.<br/><br/>For all the voice cast's best efforts, the characters are either bland or annoying with little personality or development. 'Sausage Party' started off well but wore thin quickly and felt very over-stretched. It's not a long film, but the thinner the concept got the more of a long haul it felt. The story does not have enough to sustain the length and apart from a few moments of genuine inspiration it's dull and under-cooked to the point of rawness and with not enough fun to give it sauce.<br/><br/>Overall, not that bad but rather lacklustre and could have been so much more. Loved the concept, no matter how silly it could easily have been, was underwhelmed by the wanting execution. The low rating is with regret, and with knowledge that, along with the other less-than-positive reviews, will be blasted by those vehemently, ignorantly and condescendingly defending the film (thinking that only their opinion is right and everybody else is wrong). 4/10 Bethany Cox"

","Okay, first off, I'm not a prude, and honestly a few politically incorrect jokes here and there doesn't cause any harm. The problem with Sausage Party is that it's trying to be edgy and innovative by being so excessively low-brow and offensive that it just becomes annoying. Watching it was like reading the comments section of a YouTube video. The ""humour"" in this film consists mainly of sex jokes, a rape joke that really crossed the line, swearing non-stop, non-stop jokes about the correlation between sausages and pen!ses, and this more or less sums up the whole film. It's nothing we haven't all seen before, but it tries to pass itself off as some groundbreaking animated comedy masterpiece when in reality, it's just repeating the same stuff we've all seen time and time again. If you've watched Family Guy, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've watched Eating Raoul, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've ever read the diary of a nerdy junior high school boy, you've seen Sausage Party. I will concede that it had one or two genuinely hilarious moments, but these were so few and far between that it simply wasn't worth the time. I'm not the biggest fan of low-brow humour, but if they had at least been more creative with it I would have rated this piece of garbage much higher. There were also some bizarre atheist undertones that I'd rather have not had shoved at me. I didn't go to a comedy film to get a lecture on religion or lack thereof. At least animated films like Fritz the Cat were creative and witty when it came to satire, instead of just blatantly rubbing it in viewers' faces. I am completely shocked that Sausage Party has a current 7/10 overall rating on here. I find that fact itself to be more laughable than the film."

","In the supermarket of 'Shopwelles' the food is alive and they all believe that once they are taken by customers, they pass the great doors of the supermarket and they are brought in a paradise for food were humans are their gods. By a left turn of events Frank (Seth Rogen) discovers the truth about food's existence and once he does he takes it onto his own to spread the word to everyone and rebel against the gods.<br/><br/>As I have now said probably an unhealthy amount of time, I am the biggest fan of this comedy group there is. I've seen almost every comedy Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Jonah Hill, Judd Apatow and Bill Hader have done and have loved the majority of them, finding great joy and inspiration in their comedy which has never left behind character. With ""Sausage Party"" these people have just added a crowning jewel to their body of work and have made a completely insane film that still manages to stick together and make for a compelling ride.<br/><br/>The premise is absolutely fuc*ed up as described by Rogen himself, it is totally crazy, but these guys don't simply stop at that, they build around it a world, characters and dynamics that are even more bat-sh*t crazy. This movie is simply not holding back and that is why as an audience member you do not feel cheated by it. Every gag is rewarding in its own way and whilst some of them might fall a little flat, there are so many thrown at you, you don't even realize the ones that aren't hitting.<br/><br/>Be it raunchy, grotesque, outrageous, slapstick, stereotype, sexual, druggie, abusive, dark, satirical, parodist, musical or light-hearted humor, this film hits all of them and it hits them right multiple times, which is ultimately why it is such a success of comedy. Can you think of another film that hits every single one of those notes? I certainly can't and it is definitely a great merit this feature has. All of the comedic brilliance these incredible individuals have managed to muster in all their years is brought to the screen gloriously and it is a joy to experience.<br/><br/>What is also something that managed to really surprise me and ultimately keep me pleasantly engaged is to see how this story unfolds. I did not know what to expect and what I got was incredibly intelligent from a filmmaking point of view. There is an incredible variety of characters that you follow and they are all handed to an inter woven narrative that is solidly crafted, but even better is just as insane as the film's content, which really gives the whole product an even bigger comedic value.<br/><br/>Of course there are a couple of stumbles along the way: some of the secondary characters aren't really well developed and sometimes the filmmakers push for you to feel something that you aren't actually feeling, some of the chemistry between the characters doesn't really gel together. This also makes some story points fall flat and occasionally pull you out of the film for a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>But there's really not much of a point in trying to dissect any negatives of this picture. ""Sausage Party"" is an immensely dense comedy that is as irreverent and funny as I could have hoped for it to be."

","Sausage Party is a CGI-animated film that centers on a Sausage named Frank who discovers the awful truth of what happens to food when they are taken home from the supermarket.<br/><br/>First of all, I will start off by saying that this film was extremely smart to heavily market this film as an R-rated cartoon. The commercials are broadcasting late at night or on predominately adult-oriented channels, the MPAA rating is expressed throughout, and just in case any of that happens to go over the heads of any inexplicably clueless parents, the commercials end with a giant ""RATED R"" label written across a black screen, as to say ""for the thousandth time, It is rated R! Get it through your thick skulls!"" which - I promise you - will not be enough to stop ignorant or neglectful parents from taking their naive, impressionable young ones. But, as my father always told me ""Those who don't listen, will feel"".. Which brings me to my next point; This film is off-the-wall, no-holds barred, profanity-laced, comedy gold! If you seen any previous Rogen/Goldberg films and you say to yourself ""I kind of know what I'm going into"" trust me; you'll be pleasantly surprised. Everything from the hilariously cheesy food-related puns to the brilliant depiction of food deaths, you'll wonder why a movie like this hasn't been made several times before. My favorite aspect of the film in particular is how every produce in the store belongs to a specific group of cultures and religions - just their human counterparts, such as Native Americans depicted as Firewater, Hispanics as Tacos, Tequila, etc., Homosexuals as Fruits...<br/><br/>It is really just one very long ""Ha Ha, I see what you did there"" kind of thing and it works! What makes ""Sausage Party"" such a amazing gem is that it can so easily be confused for an innocent Disney-Esq film. The beautiful cinematography, the colorful characters, the opening musical, the moral lessons - everything that you can find in a kid-friendly cartoon, ""Sausage Party"" is bringing to the party (no pun attended) as well. There's enough spirit and wonders in this film to convince impressionable children to stop eating - I'm not even joking. So if you like your comedies offensive, daring, risqué, smart, while still attempting to endure the magical world of PIXAR that you would feel if you were to watch ""Toy Story"" or ""Finding Nemo"", then ""Sausage Party"" is definitely not a party you want to miss."

","Sausage Party, Seth Rogen's appropriately named Pixar-spoof/raunch fest, is here and it is actually pretty entertaining, if you're a sarcastic adult who enjoys shitting on everybody. Much like Deadpool did to the comic book genre earlier this year, Sausage Party takes aim at the animation genre, finally making an animation for adults. Sausage Party is as funny as it is clever, gleefully filled with profanity, but is also surprisingly thought provoking. Sausage Party never quite reaches the level of quality, of that which it pokes fun at, but does manage to do everything it set out to do.<br/><br/>Watching this film it's incredible the ensemble cast that Seth Rogen was able to gather for this film, featuring James Franco, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and so many more. The plot of this film is actually a fairly entertaining one, but the real strength of the film is it's humor. That isn't surprising, considering the group behind it, but the film in essence jumps from one joke to another never leaving a dull moment. The main reason that the film is so funny is that the film is clever in how it pokes fun at the world of food.<br/><br/>Another reason that the film is so funny is that instead of trying to be politically correct, the film almost revels in it's ability to insult whoever it can. Animation has, over the years, proved to be a genre mostly directed at kids, besides a few exceptions (South Park, Family Guy, the Simpsons.) That being said the use of excessive profanity within that genre is so rare that it often elevates a raunchy animated comedy. Seeing a bunch of talking hot dogs, and buns that are animated to look like sexual images, and then swear non-stop ends up being one of the funnier elements of the film.<br/><br/>It seems surprising that Pixar didn't beat Sausage Party to this story though, because it could've been an even better Pixar film. By that I mean that the story of this film is actually quite clever and thought provoking, when you say to yourself, what food think if it could talk. The plot is not as focused as a Pixar film and the characters are not as emotionally involving, so Sausage Party feels more like a cheaper, raunchy Pixar film. However, this film does manage to attack a fairly thought provoking and deep storyline.<br/><br/>In the end, Sausage Party is a really good and often entertaining spoof of the animation genre for adults above a certain age, and of a certain mindset. The film tries to remain clear of racism, simply by insulting every group of people, without prejudice, we'll see if that method works. The film is clever, funny, thought provoking, and gleefully profane. It should be stated that not everybody will enjoy this movie, but that's partially the point."

The voice acting was on point, the jokes for the most part were creative although I felt they overused sex jokes(the ending is basically 10 minutes of food porn) and the plot was a bit all over the place. If you enjoy adult cartoons such as Family Guy or South Park then you'll get a kick out of this movie. <br/><br/>When you think ""this is a Seth Rogen movie"" you should think of Pineapple Express, This Is the End, The Night Before etc.. just like those movies, this movie includes a lot of swearing, sex jokes and drug jokes.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this a friend that isn't overly sensitive and can keep an open mind, and was worth the $12.49."

","Now, don't get me wrong. I love adult cartoons. I love shows like the Critic because of their wit and class, and I like shows like Drawn Together because of their sheer self awareness. However, I feel bad even putting them in the same paragraph as discussing Sausage Party.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, I will say what will make the rest of this review make sense. This movie wasn't funny. At all. I actually did not laugh once the entire time. And that's something considering that I laugh at Drawn Together. Not a single joke hit home. That is by far the biggest sin a comedy can make. Not being funny. It doesn't matter what your theme is, or even what terrible message you're trying to get across. If you are a comedy and you are not funny, you have completely failed. And this movie completely failed. <br/><br/>Something that I shouldn't even have to say, but unfortunately apparently I do, is that it helps if some of your characters are likable. None of them are. They are all idiots. I was not rooting for a single one of them. That's another problem you can have with your movie. Complete audience disconnect. If you don't care about the characters you don't care about their plight. <br/><br/>It's at this point I feel I should talk about the elephant in the room. The moral\theme of the movie. Look. I am not the most religious guy in the world, but even I felt incredibly disgusted by this film. It was like they were channeling Seth McFarlane at his worst and using it to give the middle finger to the majority of America. The atheistic message was so blatantly in your face that it really felt like they were insulting people for being religious and honestly, even 'I' was offended. And when it comes to religion, that's hard to do. <br/><br/>They were obviously trying to push some boundaries and limits they were allowed, especially with that....last scene (anyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about) and it just caused me to facepalm and feel uncomfortable throughout the entire scene. I could forgive this movie a little if it was even the slightest bit funny. But it wasn't. There was no charm, no wit. No chemistry. No nothing. So why does this movie get a 2 instead of a 1? Because, while it was stupid and terrible, at least i can look back on it and not be angry. I just feel sad that so much talent, time, and money was wasted on a useless piece of garbage. <br/><br/>From what I heard, this film was made in an attempt to make adult movies that rival Pixar or Disney. And honestly, if THIS is what you come out with, please leave the adult animation to the adults. Not the large children that think they're being funny by throwing in sex, atheism, and bathroom humor. <br/><br/>Hopefully this will be this company's last film. Normally I am all for companies having not so good first movies and getting better, but I have never seen a first movie that was THIS terrible and then them going on to make decent level quality. I think it's time to close up shop. I would say you had a good run, but I would be lying.<br/><br/>2 out of 10."

","I'm not sure how I'm going to write a review for this. It seems natural just to describe its main points and personal opinion on those points but that's more an extension of the movie summary, isn't it? So I'll try to review it in film terms.<br/><br/>Well the plot is quite simple and the humour is basic distaste sort of humour. The message is very clearly anti-religious and yet the alternatives presented are either negative or questionable. I'd go so far as to say it is aimed at viewers of the anti-religion, anti- morality persuasion... If you are not such a viewer you may struggle to enjoy the movie, unless you are the thinking kind, in which case you may well find it challenging.<br/><br/>The idea of food being alive (unlike toys) is actually incredibly disturbing from an eating point of view and could put you off eating ever again if you are 5 and watching this. It is a 15 in Britain so that's unlikely, and R-rated elsewhere. For some of the end content I'd only recommend it to adults really.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure what to say. It was OK but a lot of the stereotypes were typical. I don't want to spoil a lot either but it has its trippy moments. The horror movie factor seen in the trailer was quite minimal and more sexually explicit part was brisk, probably all for rating/release issues. Certainly had its funny points and definite;y hits the smut-meter."

","'SAUSAGE PARTY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The first R-rated CGI animated movie! The film comes from the vulgar minds of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir and Jonah Hill (who all co-wrote the movie); and it was directed by Greg Tiernan (a veteran director of the animated kids' TV series 'THOMAS & FRIENDS') and Conrad Vernon (who also co- directed 'SHREK 2', 'MADAGASCAR 3' and 'MONSTERS VS. ALIENS'). The film stars the voice talents of Rogen, Hill, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, Edward Norton, Bill Hader, Salma Hayek, Danny McBride, James Franco, Paul Rudd and many others. It tells the story of several sentient beings, that are food living in a grocery store. One sausage sets out to learn the truth, about their deadly fate. It's of course a raunchy adult- themed spoof, on popular CGI kids' movie blockbusters. The film's received mostly good reviews from critics, and it's also performed surprisingly well at the Box Office (although exit poll rankings haven't been that positive). I think it's somewhat clever and funny, but not nearly as much so as Rogen's, and company's, best.<br/><br/>The food, living in Shopwell's Grocery Store, all believe that when they're purchased, they'll go to a heavenly place; and live happily ever after. This is something they've been taught, all of their short little lives. Just when a sausage, named Frank (Rogen), and his girlfriend, a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), are about to leave the store; a traumatized honey mustard bottle (McBride), who was previously bought and returned, commits suicide. This causes Frank and Brenda to fall out of their grocery cart. Frank then sets out to learn the full truth about their fate.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat funny, but it does seem a lot like a 'one-joke comedy'; it's a clever idea, but almost all of the jokes revolve around the same gimmick (with a lot of vulgarity thrown in as well). The animation is well done; and there is some insightful criticism on religion, and how people mostly prefer to believe what they want to believe (instead of hearing the harsh negative reality). Still, Rogen says his idea for the film was based on the concept 'what if our food had feelings'! Our food does have feelings, because most of it comes from sentient animal life! He could have made an honestly insightful movie, with clever comedy as well, about how immoral (and unhealthy) the average human diet is. Some people just need to believe what they want to believe though (like obviously Seth Rogen does); and they refuse to listen to the harsh negative reality.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois"
"author-92382","1","14","29","20 August 2016"," ATHEIST EVANGELISM - Possibly the WORST Propaganda Movie I Have Ever Seen :-(
","This movie was little more than an atheist propaganda piece and was simply abhorrent.<br/><br/>It cracks me up when I read reviews of Christian movies like ""God's Not Dead"" and see comments like, ""If I wanted to go to church, I would go to church, not to the movie theatre"", or, ""Preachy to the extreme and mere propaganda"", etc., yet reviews of this piece of cinema garbage known as ""Sausage Party"" are, for the most part, rating it highly.<br/><br/>Let me be clear. Sausage Party is not a funny movie. It is not an entertaining movie. It's dull, rather humorless, boring and little more than a badly done propaganda piece of atheism evangelism in cinematic form. It's sort of like an atheist version of some of those rather horrid ""Christian"" films that have poor writing, are of poor quality and do little more than ""preach"".<br/><br/>What is really sad is that Sausage Party could have been hilarious, and when I saw the previews, I thought it would be. Had the script stuck to telling an interesting and entertaining story rather than going on an anti-Christ, anti-God, anti-Bible, pro-hedonism idiotic rant, it could have actually been an entertaining and interesting movie.<br/><br/>However, the entire point of this movie is to mock religion, blaspheme, offend religious people and try to ""convert"" everyone to being a pro-hedonism atheist.<br/><br/>However ... I wouldn't even have as big a problem as I currently have with the movie had the actors and executives simply made it clear that this movie was made to mock religion and convert people to pro-hedonism atheism. In fact, I still would have went to see the movie, or at least rented it, just to see what was being promoted through cinema these days. However, all the previews I saw for this film made it seem like it was simply supposed to be a funny, scary and rather adult cartoon.<br/><br/>It would be like Disney running previews of a new version of Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs that show it in a scary light and with an ""R"" rating. Many people would still go see that movie. However, if when they saw the movie they found out that the movie's actual goal was to promote homosexuality and hedonism by showing portraying the dwarfs as homosexuals who engage in wild orgies every night and Snow White as a lesbian who fornicates with witches, you better believe the masses would flip out and leave 1 star reviews until the cows came home.<br/><br/>The simple fact is that this movie was dull and boring and that the actors and producers were extremely deceptive with the audience, thanks to the extremely misleading previews of this film.<br/><br/>However, I will say one good thing about the movie. The script is so poorly written that while it's obvious the entire point is to ridicule God and religion and to convert people to pro-hedonism atheism, by the time one finishes watching it, it is so abundantly clear that pro-hedonism atheism is not only disgusting and something to be avoided like the plague, it is also idiotic and only a self-worshipping and prideful loon would actually choose to reject their divine Creator in favor of a hedonistic lifestyle and atheism.<br/><br/>Of course, anyone who believes that ""everything came from nothing"" is scientific and more plausible than the Biblical account of creation, has abandoned sense, logic and reason long ago, in a quest to live for self and without rules. I pity such a person.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Author Repen T. OrBurn"
"holycrabs","7","14","29","20 August 2016"," Very Funny
","I was shocked how much I had fun with this movie. I usually don't enjoy Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg comedies, but this movie was much more unique. While there was still raunchy and drug humor throughout the movie, the combination of this and the animation made it even more hilarious. The voice cast was surprisingly great. Even though the voices are noticeable, it fit well with the character they were playing. One of my favorites was Bill Hader voicing a Native American –type alcohol bottle. The things that happen throughout the movie are so strange that I could not believe what I was witnessing. The ending of this film was easily the most I've laugh this year. Anyways, this movie is not for everyone. The film is a bit stupid, but that's intentional. The film did not have as much laugh-out-loud moments as I wanted, but that is not really the movies fault. The trailers gave away so much funny bits in the movie, that the hype for the movie would have never been met. But, overall I had a great time with this movie."
"tjsdomer2","7","14","29","11 August 2016"," Food Fights
","No one will ever confuse Sausage Party with Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or Gone with the Wind, but nevertheless, it is a lot of (very mature) fun. I still prefer Superbad and the Interview to Sausage Party, but this new release is an improvement of other Seth Rogen works such as Pineapple Express and the Neighbors.<br/><br/>One thing Sausage Party that I enjoyed is how it handles the idea of faith and religion. There are surprisingly profound tidbits intermingled between all the hot dog and bun jokes. As for the jokes, not all of them are original and some of the ones that are become a bit overused and forced. At the same time, I think some of the point of the good jokes is to poke fun at bad stereotypical jokes.<br/><br/>Overall, Sausage Party succeeds due to its sheer absurdity and the outrageous originality of its initial idea and deserves 3 out of 4 hot dogs."
"hvnorris","10","24","55","13 November 2016"," Hysterically Crude, Clever, and Heartfelt
","Comedy films are a special breed. While the main criteria for them is to be funny, I believe they should also strive to be actually good narratives. Comedies are still films and deserve to be taken just as seriously as any drama, thriller, or what have you. They are films all the same, all just with a different agenda of what emotion they want to elicit from the audience. Comedies may arguably be the most challenging type of film to make, as not only do you need a good script to keep the audience interested, but you also have to make them laugh. When that comedy film is also animated and totally R-rated, it becomes an ambitious and interesting project all its own. Sausage Party, the new, crude animated film from the deranged minds of Seth Rogen and his entourage, absolutely succeeds in every respect.<br/><br/>In the drab and depressing real world, food takes on a life of its own in the ever so vibrant and colorful Shopwell's. Every morning, the entire inventory of food and various other supermarket products break out into a song, claiming that one day the Gods (humans) will come and take them to Paradise. Our hero is a hot dog named Frank (Seth Rogen), whose main goal is to get all up inside his future soulmate, the hot dog bun Brenda (Kristen Wiig). Luckily, they are both chosen by the Gods, but unfortunately for them, a shell-shocked jar of honey mustard that has returned from the great beyond and reveals the horrifying truth: the Gods love torturing them and devouring them. After a catastrophic grocery cart spill where Frank, Brenda, and other foodstuff characters are stranded in the closed grocery store, they all embark on an epic journey throughout the vast supermarket in order to find out the truth and hopefully save their brethren from certain doom.<br/><br/>There's something to be said about films that completely shatter your expectations, but this one doesn't just shatter them. It keeps rebuilding them and shattering them over and over until you're absolutely numb; numb from laughing so hard. I honestly can't remember that last time a theatrically released comedy film has put me into tearful hysterics. While the premise initially seems it will wear itself thin, as they really open the flood gates of vulgar and raunchy humor from the beginning, the film keeps sucker punching you with hilariously clever visual gags coming from all angles. It does absolutely everything it can with the unique premise and puts it into overdrive until the end credits finally role. A lot of great comedies over the past few years have had some great laughs throughout, but they were usually somewhat spaced out. With this, I felt like I was laughing throughout every frame.<br/><br/>Not only is the film hilarious, but the script is actually very tight and well written. However, this doesn't come as a huge surprise to me, as I think Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are the best working comedy screenwriters in film today. With the help of Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, who both had a hand in writing last year's fantastic Seth Rogen vehicle The Night Before, they are all smart enough to know that outrageously raunchy humor isn't enough to keep audiences completely invested. The characters actually have their own distinct motivations and arcs, the plot keeps going in crazy, yet logical directions, and every single joke and aspect to the movie has a great set-up with an even better payoff. There's even some commentary on religious and personal beliefs thrown in there, that really make the novel concept feel even more unique and rich. Everything about how this film was written and executed was pretty much flawless. I feel like Rogen and his entourage don't get enough credit, as people usually say their films are nothing but ""pot humor"". While their films always have that content, there's still always that humanity and sincerity to it, and the characters always feel somewhat relatable and real. Who knew I would ever actually be invested in the plight of a cartoon hot dog? Credit must also be given to the fantastic directors and animators who brought this film to life. Everything is just so beautifully detailed. Cereal boxes with concerned eyes line the shelves and observe characters arguing, bottles of alcohol are all throwing a crazy party in the middle of the night, and many other clever visual gags throughout that I don't want to spoil. The world felt so alive. I can't wait to watch it again to see all that I missed. There's a visual dichotomy between the grungy, almost black and white real world, compared to the bright and colorful world that food experience, which was a great touch in order to differentiate the two worlds. Everything is supremely detailed, especially during the amazingly visceral sequences of violence. I think personified food getting gruesomely murdered is quite possibly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>Humor is completely subjective and this film is certainly not for everybody. There is a lot of humor that many would consider offensive, but for my sick sense of humor and the way the film handled it all, I couldn't get enough. Personally, not only is Sausage Party the most clever, unique, inventive, and hysterical animated film I've seen all year, it's the best film I've seen so far this year, in general. Nothing but laughs, beautiful animation, fantastic voice acting from the entire cast, and a carefully well written script to hold it all together. Congratulations, Seth Rogen and company, you made a film about a hot dog and a bun getting horny for each other my favorite film of 2016. Hats off to you."
"ajb8487","1","22","50","15 August 2016"," One of the worst movies I've seen in my life
","And Seth Rogen is one of the most one-dimensional ""comedians"" I've ever seen in my life. All the guy has is jizz and fart jokes to go along pot humor and an excessive use of the F word.<br/><br/>I have an open mind for any form of media that critiques religion as I'm agnostic. But if you're going to take shots at something at least do it in a clever manner. Making obvious stereotypes of Christian, Jewish and Islamic dogma isn't witty or sharp; it's just making obvious and shallow stereotypes. Same goes for the portrayal of homosexuality in the film, which could have worked if the gay men weren't portrayed as lispy and effeminate while the lesbian was portrayed as sex obsessed with a one track mind.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I was just trying to figure out what the point was. If the whole idea was just to get to an overly long to the point where it gets uncomfortable ""food orgy"" then the movie didn't have to take as long as it did to get there.<br/><br/>There's no ""heart"", lessons or humor to be found here. It's straw man, shallow interpretations of religion and sexuality rifled with unfunny lowbrow humor that's become the norm for Seth Rogen films.<br/><br/>Avoid this one like the plague."
"seige-hound","7","17","37","11 August 2016"," Prioritizes Crude Humour Over Plot, But Does Crude Humour Well.
","Sausage Party is a prime example of doing Crude Humour right, in that it's not necessarily the jokes themselves that are funny, but the source of said jokes. The creators were onto something when they decided using food and condiments as the characters, as due to this separation from reality, the creators could get away with creating one of the most incredibly sexual, crude, violent and drug fuelled comedies I've ever seen, all with just an R-Rating. The crudeness of humour, while different stylistically, is definitely on par with films like Team America or the South Park film, perhaps even more so.<br/><br/>My main issue with this film is the plot structure. The first trailer to this film (the one that first drew my attention) is structured very differently from the final product. The trailer implied a sudden and almost unexpected ramp from kid-friendly romp to food-related horror. However, the film showed us the violence and sexual innuendos from the get go, making the scene from the trailer less impactful and shocking than it could have been.<br/><br/>The film also relies heavily on racial stereotypes. I personally don't mind this in particular, at least within this film's context, but it's something to keep in mind. Each respective food-type represent a very stereotypical member of the culture of origin (Taco=Mexican, Bagel=Jew, etc.). This film is very irreverent and unforgiving in this regard, so if you are particularly sensitive to such subjects, you won't like this film.<br/><br/>I personally also had a problem with a couple of scenes that could be interpreted as 'rape'scenes. These scenes aren't particularly made fun of, but the mere fact that its food and condiments that are doing these things makes it perhaps less serious on the get-go than it should be.<br/><br/>Overall this is a really good comedy, and I enjoyed watching it. However, it's a film that is deliberately trying to offend your sensibilities, and it won't pull any punches. Take that as you will."
"kapotts1","9","9","17","6 November 2016"," A comedy for those who don't take religion too seriously
","The majority of people offended by this show are going to be highly religious people or people who take religion very seriously. The vulgarity of it is on par with other similar rated R or TV-MA material IMO. <br/><br/>Contrary to the impression that its just going to be a sex jokes movie, the general theme involves poking fun at religious beliefs on the basis of blind faith. If you are someone who brings a critical eye to religion or doesn't take religion too seriously and you don't mind sex jokes (that poke fun on all kinds of relationships), this movie will be a fast favorite. We haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Sam Harris would be proud."

","I was moderately interested in this film just from looking at one trailer; I was open to the vulgarity of the film, but I didn't think it would be as good as it was.<br/><br/>The theme of the film and the delivery is genius by my rating.<br/><br/>The base of it's humor is sexual jokes, blunt insult and passive aggressive sarcasm; so if it isn't in your taste then you clearly won't enjoy it. I highly suggest to avoid taking younger viewers. The film delivers to both those that enjoy the immature types of humor and those that like the sophisticated hidden humor (you have to have some base knowledge to understand the jokes). <br/><br/>The reason for the high rating is the films use of personification; if you're well educated in the sense that you understand different cultures then you'll definitely laugh at some point.<br/><br/>The plot isn't all that great as it's a search for knowledge type so the searching part is what is typically hard to illustrate in films.

I wanted to leave after just 15 minutes but my husband wanted to give it a chance and unfortunately it just didn't get any funnier. Just gross. Story line seemed lost throughout, not much direction and a really poor ending. It could have been so much better. Found most main jokes were in the trailer so when seen in the film it was just disappointing. Quite a few others in the cinema also walked out expressing the same level of disappointment. If you really wanted to see it I'd recommend buying it on DVD when it comes out rather than forking out £11 odd to see it at the cinema. The teenagers in the screening found it hilarious, I think it definitely appeals to the teenage audience more."
"rfinnct","7","11","22","15 August 2016"," Funny, but kinda bi-polar
","I personally think any spoilers contained in this review are slight, but wanted to mark it as containing spoilers regardless since I wouldn't want to ruin anyone's viewing experience. <br/><br/>Within 5 minutes I understood exactly why some people who'd paid good money to see this film decided to walk out. There is absolutely nothing subtle about Sausage Party. The foul language, the archetypal (and often wildly racist) characters, the crude humor, the overall theme of the movie -- everything is amped up to 69. And if you even cracked a smile at the suggestiveness of that number, then you'll probably at least partially enjoy Sausage Party. <br/><br/>Almost instantly the viewer is assaulted with the humor device of cute, Pixar-like animated characters swearing like sailors and spouting x-rated puns and innuendo. It's funny to an extent, but after a short while it loses its novelty and punch because it's used to such a ridiculous extent. It didn't offend me in the slightest, but it made me worry that it might be all the movie had to offer. So for many audience members not expecting such language and low- brow sexual humor being hurled at them consistently, I can completely understand them being quickly turned off and wanting to leave. Even though I'm a guy, I can see why women in general might be offended by both the visual representation of females, and the fact that they're written fairly shallowly while the males have more depth and character development. One can certainly tell that it was written by ""bros.""<br/><br/>And then there is the odd juxtaposition of all this cursing and innuendo over a plot that is clearly a ham-fisted discussion about religion, the possible pointlessness of it, and the sure destructiveness it has inspired by those who take it to extremes. Many people who weren't offended by all the cursing will probably take umbrage at the plot that almost immediately paints followers of pretty much all religions as clueless, automaton-like zealots who follow the ""rules"" and oppress their feelings and desires because they feel it's the only way to secure their place in an abstract and glorified afterlife. Once a few characters become ""enlightened"" to the fact that heaven is an illusion, the ""gods"" are monsters, and religion in general was something a small, shadowy group dreamed up as a way alleviate fears and essentially keep the population in line, Sausage Party seems to become an attack on all spiritual beliefs. Again, I can definitely see why people of any religion would take offense to the extent that they would walk out of the theater.<br/><br/>However, much like the movie Dogma, ((here's where there's a potential spoiler, although I don't think it factors heavily into the overall plot)) there is an eventual realization that religion isn't inherently bad; and even an atheist can't claim to be smarter or superior because they don't have all the concrete answers and cannot completely disprove the notion of a higher power. But by that time, many viewers will have tuned out because of what will surely (and understandably) be construed as mocking anti-religious propaganda. In addition, there are copious displays of drug-use which, in themselves, many might find offensive; but also being portrayed as portals to knowledge and enlightenment could be thought of as dangerous and irresponsible. <br/><br/>And as a final, button-pushing display, the movie suddenly discards all the heavy-handed theological discussion for a scene that is astonishingly graphic -- even given the fact that the main characters are a sausage and a bun. This constant veering from juvenile humor, foul language, and over-the top stereotypes to a social and religious commentary seems like two entirely different movies mashed together. Both of those movies have huge potential to alienate a large percentage of audiences, so seeing them layered on top of one another seems like an enormous risk... especially when the trailers seemed to promise just crudeness and violence towards grocery store products. <br/><br/>All that said, I personally found it generally funny and entertaining. I openly admit that I find a lesbian taco and a Stephen Hawking-like character portrayed as a deformed wad of used chewing gum to be amusing... even though they're silly and offensive. Thankfully the film tries to make fun of pretty much everyone, so it's not really an attack on a specific group. It even makes fun of itself and its own writers and producers by pointing out their childish and crude humor, so I found that refreshingly self-aware. Is it for everyone? Most definitely not... not by a long shot. But there is an audience that will enjoy it. I just suggest doing some research on it beforehand to see if any of its facets will make you regret spending $30 on a ticket and popcorn"

","I've been to my local cinema on Friday this week and ever since I saw the trailer I was rather interested in seeing this film with its concept and creativity. You could say 'What if food have feelings!' which is based upon the meme when 'Inside Out' came out in 2015 by Pixar. <br/><br/>The movie is both funny with its R rated humour (or MA 15+ here in Australia) and crazy as well. It's a typical Seth Rogen film with his jokes about sex, drugs everything you see in one. Although I'm glad it's not about a sausage having sex with a hot dog bun and now he has to be a father, since there were two of those made by Rogen in the past; 'Knocked Up' (2007) and 'The Night Before' (2015) although for the latter it wasn't the focus but it still has that Rogen element. Although with that idea with food it would be pretty disturbing. <br/><br/>The structure of the story was very good and the use of the characters were good too, they had a purpose to be part of the feature and they don't come off as pointless. The douche character was funny within the story with his jokes but I think they should've cut him out. The orgy scene though was very disturbing but as I said before it was a Seth Rogen film but it was also funny as well. The fourth wall joke at the end too was kinda pointless and didn't add much. Maybe it opens up as a sequel I don't know. Maybe they should've kept it as a post credit scene. It's funny though that the director, Greg Tiernan, in the past had directed the episodes and CGI specials of Thomas the Tank Engine. How funny is that! <br/><br/>In the end the movie was good but I don't consider this to be the best animated film in comparison to other ones. It's funny, it's clever and it has messages about racism and different beliefs. Maybe this could lead to other CG Adult animated films but who knows."
"pere-25366","6","19","43","13 August 2016"," Hilarious, raunchy and, yes, cleverly written
","After watching Sausage Party, one thing is certain - You will never look at your food the same way again. In this film, Rogen and Co. employ all their humorous tricks in the book to bring to life a highly original idea. Along for the ride are fellow comedic gems including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Kristen Wiig to boot.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a world of anthropomorphized food in the fictional grocery store Shopwellers. Life is great for all the food items, whose dreams are to meet the ""gods"" and to (relish?) the life outside their confined shelves. But when Frank the sausage learns the truth of their fate as human meals, he must warn the rest of the food items and find a way to escape and find their elusive freedom, free from humans.<br/><br/>The plot sounds ridiculous and it is even more over the top than one might expect it to be, especially those last 30 minutes or so. The amount of crude humour and constant innuendos keep its free flowing story a hilarious one. But for a film that centres around food, there exists a great level humanity embedded in its plethora of characters, who are as endearing as they are vulgar, filled with the same urges, ambitions and fears that any normal person would have.<br/><br/>With its constant food puns and raunchy humour, it certainly isn't for everyone. But Sausage Party is special - it offers both humour and substance, some food for thought if you will. It has an extraordinary charm stemming from its lovable characters and occasional nuanced moments. A seemingly shallow storyline delves much deeper into the concept of religion, hope and perspective. The idea is highly original and provides a surprising dose of pathos and provoking moments.<br/><br/>An 'ate'/10 for me."

I can imagine kids wanting to watch this movie, and parents wanting to watch it, but I can't imagine either of them wanting to watch it together.

In addition to stereotypes there was a ton of sexual double entendre and crude adolescent humor and swearing. The film also incorporates non-sexual humor exploiting the Israeli-Palestinian problem and even Hawking. Movies were also spoofed for jokes.

After most of Hollywood movies being religious crap, here the other side of the argument is presented. Most of the time you don't even need to read between the lines."

","I thought the movie was funny, love all the actors. But I have to say, I was pretty disturbed and as soon as I left the movies I went home and they made tacos which was even more disturbing then I originally thought. So as I am eating my taco, I wanted to throw up but laugh at the same time. I don't really know how to feel about this movie then say it was interesting. Not something you see everyday. Still can't look at food the same way just yet but you know, I'm getting there. Hot dogs were already ruined for me when I ate a moldy hot dog one time. No harm done there. It was quite an interesting movie.. Thanks for the laugh and the vomit still coming out of my mouth. You're the real MVP."

","I recently seen this hilarious comedy piece at my local theater and i would say that i didn't regret it. Seth Rogen( as well as most of the cast list) is already well known comedians. The movie was never a bore to me (there were some slow parts, but there was always surprises) and it's a great movie if you've ever watched The Night Before, 50/50, or Super Bad. What i found interesting was that Greg Tiernan (Directed Thomas & Friends) and Conrad Vernon (directed Shrek) made this film look so kid friendly and delighting to watch at the start, and then just really made it raunchy, disturbingly obscene, and utterly hilarious that it was without the doubt the best change-up for a beginning of a rated R animated film. It really does deserve a rating of 7, without a doubt it's as funny as it looks on TV previews, but it's even more shocking once you watch it. Now, there is many parts where it did get a little slow and not all of the jokes were funny, nor did everything run its course like other ""kid-friendly"" animated films, but it did do a good job at explaining the question, ""What would it look like if food had human personalities and were conscious of their surroundings?"" So in the end would i recommend this film to watch at home with your eight year old child? Hell no i wouldn't, but when you're at home or want to watch something funny and new then this is the movie."

","I saw ""Sausage Party"", starring the voices of Seth Rogen-The Neighbors movies, Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy; Kristen Wiig- Ghostbusters_2016, Anchorman 2:The Legend Continues; Bill Hader- Trainwreck, Pineapple Express and Salma Hayek-The Grown Ups movies, Wild Wild West_1999.<br/><br/>A lot of people will gripe about movies, saying there are too many super hero movies or too many sequels......basically that there isn't anything original out there to see. Well, your gripes have been heard because this movie is really different and completely original. First of all, just because it is animated, doesn't mean it is for the little kiddies because it's NOT for kids. There is language, violence, drug use and even sexual content. It is from the mind of Seth Rogen-I read that he has been trying to make this movie for years. Seth plays a hot dog named Frank that has been led to believe-as well as all the other foods in the store-that when he is picked to go home with a human, it means he is literally going to heaven. Kristen is a hot dog bun, Salma is a taco and Bill is a bottle of liquor named Firewater-he is an American Indian. Circumstances happen that lets Seth discover the truth, that they are taken to be eaten by the humans and so he feels he must spread the word to all the other foods. A lot of the humor is crude and not for everyone but if you are looking for something a little different, you might be pleasantly surprised. It's rated ""R"" for language, violence, drug use and sexual content-there is even an orgy-and has a running time of 1 hour & 29 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."

Of course there are many parts in the movie that you can find amusing and just laugh, yet the overall point is to make you realize that most people are scared of an unknown source of power that is going to punish them unless they 'act' in a way that this hidden power commands.<br/><br/>It certainly worth to watch it and just ignore these religious people, who give it a low rating on purpose.

The animation is good, but still need to improve on some of the detail. The thing I don't like is the still dialogue.

They spend 60% of the movie preaching about how heaven is a lie made up to comfort the feelings of the food and that the rules set in place to allow the food to enter heaven are pointless (do you see where this is going?). 27% of the movie is making fun of the different cultures of the world (each food is it's stereotypical culture). And 3% of the movie is gore scenes. Compare that to the trailers which are 100% gore scenes. False advertising at its finest.

"CANpatbuck3664","8","11","23","20 August 2016"," Sausage Party was Never Boring and Decent Throughout but the Funniest and Craziest Stuff is in the Ending
","As disappointing as the summer has been (some good and some bad, fewer truly great movies than I wanted) Sausage Party was one of the movies that I was holding out hope for. The marketing made it look like something completely different, it had a voice cast full of actors that are funny and likable and the focus on presenting a big animated R rated movie was intriguing. I went into this completely ready to love it and ultimately came out happy and ready to sing it's praises.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Sausage Party begins at the local Shopwells grocery store. The products/food in the grocery store awake ready to join the ""Gods"" (human beings who shop at the store) and enter ""The Great Beyond"" (heaven for the food, outside the store). They sing a song to honour the gods and to thank them for the opportunity to take them there. We focus in on a particular package of sausages and a particular bag of buns. Frank (Seth Rogen) is longing for the day where he will be able to slip into his girlfriend bun Brenda (Kristen Wiig). He's in a package with other sausages Carl (Jonah Hill) and Barry (Michael Cera) and they cannot wait to get to the great beyond. In a surprise move, the two packages are picked together and they celebrate by touching fingertips.<br/><br/>In a surprise move, a jar of honey mustard that had been returned earlier that day has been ranting about how the gods are monsters and that he will not go back under any circumstance. He gets thrown in the cart with them and tries to commit suicide by jumping out. Frank and Brenda try to save him but it triggers an accident that leaves a bunch of food falling out of the cart. This includes a douche (Nick Kroll) who blames Frank and Brenda for his nozzle being bent. Their friends have been taken and they urgently need to get back into some packaging. Frank and Brenda who have now been joined by a Lavash (David Krumholtz) and a bagel Sammy (Edward Norton) need to get back to their respective aisles so they can join their friends in The Great Beyond.<br/><br/>Most of the reviews for Sausage Party have claimed that it's revolutionary and that it will change animation. I wouldn't go that far but I would give the movie credit for having an interesting message to try and get across. Sausage Party isn't subtle about it but the point of Sausage Party is that it's okay to question widely held beliefs like religion. The food in the supermarket blindly believe that their journey out will lead to wonderful things without having any proof and even when Frank tries to convince them of their impending doom, they don't believe him. There's nothing wrong with believing in a higher power and it's not right that atheists believe that they should just call believers idiots. The movie does the right thing and takes the high road in saying that you need to respect different beliefs and I appreciated that it had the decency to not just jam the atheist agenda down the public's throats. There's also some commentary on the affairs in the Middle East which was a nice added touch that not every movie would have had the time to include.<br/><br/>There's a pretty varied voice cast, a lot of them are Rogen's friends that you see in most of his films and there are some newcomers that do good work. Seth Rogen is pretty typical Seth Rogen (I like Seth but he's basically playing himself) and people like Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, James Franco, Paul Rudd and Danny McBride are good as they are in most of their collaborations. I thought Kristen Wiig did a really good job, I laughed at her stuff the most actually. Nick Kroll's character was really annoying but they were going for your typical jerk ""bro"" and he nailed it. I actually didn't recognize Bill Hader at all and even though some although people called it racist, I could see why Salma Hayek was cast and she did a decent job. On another note, the animation was also decent, I didn't think it was anything special but it was more than passable.<br/><br/>Most of the way through this movie I was laughing and I was enjoying myself but I was a little disappointed. It hadn't lived up to the hype (at least to me) and I was starting to come to the conclusion that it was more of a solid film than a great one. I have to say though, by the time the climax happens, they really kicked it into high gear. There hadn't been a lot of action but when you hit that last 20 minutes, there's plenty of it and it was weird enough to give it the kick in the @$$ I thought Sausage Party needed. After that, there's a 5 minute scene that was among the most bizarre and funniest things I have seen in a long time. I won't spoil it but if you're like me and were waiting for that jaw-dropping moment, don't worry it's coming.<br/><br/>If there's anything that I think Sausage Party deserves credit for, it's trying something different and going the whole nine yards with it instead of just dipping their toes in. They wear their subtext on their sleeves, they aren't afraid to be crass and they aren't satisfied with a generic payoff. I didn't think the plot, the voice work or the animation were revolutionary or even special but luckily the ending was. Much like The Purge: Election Year, this movie isn't going to be for everyone and also like that movie, it doesn't seem to care. I would have probably been giving Sausage Party a 7.5 halfway through but because the finale is so insane, I feel like I have to respect that and give it an 8/10 instead."

","Should Seth Rogen Write Children's Movies? Let's Take a Look at The New Raunchy Comedy Sausage Party!<br/><br/>IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET STONED WHILE WATCHING CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS?!<br/><br/>Life is good for all the food items that occupy the shelves at the local supermarket. Frank, played by Seth Rogen (Knocked Up, Neighbors) is the hot dog, Brenda, played by Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids, 2016's Ghostbusters) is the hot dog bun, Teresa Taco, played by Salma Hayek (Frida, Everly) and Sammy Bagel Jr. played by Edward Norton (Fight Club, American History X) can't wait to go home with a happy customer, because they see human beings as Gods. Soon, their world comes crashing down as poor Frank learns the horrifying truth that he will eventually become a tasty mouth watering meal. After warning his pals about their similar fate, the panicked perishables devise a plan to escape from their human enemies. Sausage Party is raunchy, rowdy, completely insane, and an animated blast at the theater. <br/><br/>Once again, we have the entire Seth Rogen entourage returning in this movie. We have James Franco (Fly Boys, Pineapple Express), Jonah Hill (Superbad, 21 Jump Street), Michael Cera (Superbad, This is the End), Danny McBride (Your Highness, This is the End), Paul Rudd (The 40 Year Old Virgin, Ant-Man), Bill Hader (Superbad, Trainwreck), Craig Robinson (Knocked Up This is the End), David Krumholtz (The Santa Clause, The Judge), and Nick Kroll (Get Him to the Greek, Dinner for Schmucks) . They all do exceptional voices, especially Bill Hader. <br/><br/>From the opening scene, you are already on edge, smiling, giggling, and you soon find yourself busting your gut and spilling laughter. It was such a funny and clever opening. Especially if you know how a majority of children's animation movies open. The directors of this movie are Conrad Vernon (Shrek 2, Puss in Boots) and Greg Tiernan. So these two know how to craft an exceptional animated film, and once again, they proof to us they can do it again. <br/><br/>LET'S SPOON! FORK OFF!<br/><br/>Even though this film is offensive, foul, use a ton of profanity, it actually is thought provoking, entertaining, funny, and has a message to its audience. The movie actually does get a little emotional and mentally deep. For instance, how is peanut butter made without the death of peanuts? How is jelly made when you murder grapes? What makes us who we are? Etc. This movie had me laughing aloud when I first saw the trailer. On the other hand, the actual film is trying to show us a message. A message about religion, God(s), race, politics, history, war, separation, poking fun at Disney movies, stereotypes, how and what we consume in our bodies for fuel, health, and I'm sure there are a lot more I may have missed. You gather all these themes, put them in an R rated animated film and you get Sausage Party (even though our main character Frank is a hot dog). <br/><br/>TOO MUCH MUSTARD ON THAT ONE<br/><br/>The movie was not consistently laugh aloud funny as if I thought it would be. After a while, the profanity got a little stale. Yes, I understand a hot dog saying f#ck is funny, but they could have toned it down. In addition, the movie gets a little too wrapped up in the message it wants to share with the viewer(s) at times. One thing I personally found awkward, was it felt like the movie kept reminding us we are in an R rated animated film. FOOD FIGHT!<br/><br/>Accordingly, the film starts to show us more of this world. We start to realize it's not just food that is alive. Condoms, bathroom supplies, and other objects come to life as well. I really felt bad for toilet paper. In the film, a hot dog asks toilet paper, ""What do they (the humans) do to you?"" Toilet paper responds, ""You don't want to f#cking know."" At this point, this is when the food and other objects get together to fight the humans, and fight for what they believe in.<br/><br/>So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Sausage Party. I enjoyed the film, I thought it was smart, had a message, and made for good entertainment. Some of the jokes do fall a little flat, and get old. Nevertheless, they make up for it in so many clever ways. Please if you have children do not take them to see this movie! Unless you want your child to have a panic attack in the middle of a Publix. I believe Sausage Party earns<br/><br/>7 Sausages Out of 10!<br/><br/>his review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)"
"lachiesholl-86054","5","14","31","16 August 2016"," The Funniest Film of the Year
","Sausage Party is fine work from the usually funny Seth Rogen as he and an extremely talented voice cast work their way through a hilarious script who bring laughs the entire length of the film, cleverly playing on the Pixar Formula that if something other than humans could have emotions or feelings (in this case: food). The jokes hardly ever fail and the writers provide very relevant social commentary which they deliver it in an amusing, fast paced script. Where the film falters however, is in the non-human antagonist who becomes old and worn out after a while. Also, there is an unfunny running gag between Kristen Wigg and her character involving nervous singing which lasts way too long. All in all though, Sausage Party is an exuberant watch with great characters and an ending that takes it way too far perfectly and hysterically (bare in mind, the final scene doesn't feel like it has to be there at all and probably would have worked better as an end credits scene)."
"littleging12","7","7","13","17 December 2016"," A Raunchfest with a lot more on its mind then sexual jokes and juvenile humor
","Seth Rogen's latest comedy is the first CGI animated feature length film to be rated R. And boy does it earn its R rating. The film's humor relies on the shock value of cute little food products cursing for the first two acts, which wears off quickly. The film doesn't really take off with the laugh out loud a-minute hysteria promised in the trailers until the third act. The introduction of the gum, the battle against the humans, and the climactic food orgy scene were brilliantly, shockingly, and outrageously hilarious.<br/><br/>Now aside from the raunchiness and vulgarness rooted in this film, it had something meaningful to say about religion, social classes, ethnicity, and believing in things without any concrete proof. The film takes a somewhat atheist stance of the film's subjectivity, but recompenses it with a surprisingly well thought out message. The message promotes integration by saying that people should put aside their differences to work together regardless of race, class, religious or other firm held beliefs.<br/><br/>On the surface, ""Sausage Party"" may seem like a stoner's dream with raucous and perverted humor but against all odds justifies those obscenities with thoughtful remarks."

","Unfortunately if you watch the YouTube clip with Rogan commenting on the last sex scene Rogan says it's vile. That applies to the whole movie. The unfortunate part is that he's actually admiring his own work. What does that say about him? It's a known fact that pedophiles show badly made cartoon character porno films to children to entice them into sexual relations. A copy of this highly polished professionally made cartoon porno film is a pedophiles dream. Putting it in the hands of those people is criminal. If you know someone who you think is a little suspect and you know has bought this film do not allow your children alone in their home. The cartoon promotes IV drug use as mind expanding, depicts anal assault, oral sex, multiple partners, suicide and much, much more. I know it's an adult rated film but the fear is that impressionable children will find a way to watch it if it's accessible. Believe me your children will hear about it from school friends who's parents don't care about their children and there's plenty of those. Please, if you buy this film please lock it up like you do your guns. As a society we admonish and stop retailers who use the cartoon format to target youth for cigarettes, alcohol and other damaging products. But our modern Hollywood ""censors"" allow this trash to be made and distributed. It's no wonder other nations see the U.S. as morally bankrupt. Yes I saw it. From the previews I thought it would be a funny movie spoofing scifi concepts. Once I realized what it was I ended up staying for the entire film because I wanted to be able to write about this stinker from first hand knowledge. BTW it's not even funny."
"valen060","8","9","18","26 August 2016"," An Adequate R-rated, Vulgar, CGI Comedy
","Realizing this is the first full-length, CGI animated R-rated flick, I just had to see it for myself. Since Seth Rogen and his crew admitted this movie is an intentional spoof of Pixar and DreamWorks films, it left me further curious on what was to expect. When it ended, I thought to myself, ""Past animated movies went the R-rated route before, so is this a step further?""<br/><br/>The story revolves around Frank (Seth Rogen), a sausage along with his friends wanting to be chosen by human shoppers or as the foods call them ""gods"" to find a new life in what they call home. Though it's not all what it seems when they find out the horrific truth of their fates, so he and his fellow foods must band together to follow their own destinies.<br/><br/>The concept of personifying inanimate objects is something that existed many times before, but by giving it the R-rated treatment, there's no holding back with sexual content and foul language. My nitpicks of it were the lack of proper depth in the human characters (save for the druggie) and the excessive cursing just to be funny wears thin easily after a while, though the food puns sure had me laughing especially its shock value in the various predicaments each of the food characters face (albeit forced and a tendency to be predictable that I sometimes turned away out of embarrassment).<br/><br/>In the past, I've watched a handful of R-rated animated films of different genres whether of domestic or overseas origin (some of which were milestone pieces that broke ground or shaped the medium much differently compared to the ones for younger audiences), but marking the first CGI-animated in this category is something that's not often done. Story-wise, it toys with themes of existentialism, religion and even reality-bending material. Among the various Seth Rogen comedies I've seen (""Paul"" still one personal favorite), it's like ""This Is The End: Food Edition."" With the voices of Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, and other Judd Apatow regulars, they sure sounded like they had a riot lending their voices to these characters on screen, not to mention the irony of involving Disney veteran Alan Menken composing the music and the opening number. On another note, it's like it's trying to follow in the footsteps of the last R-rated, animated box office success that was South Park back in 1999 (which coincidentally parodied Disney animated musicals of the 90s). Although it wouldn't be fair to compare Rogen's brand of humor to Trey & Matt's South Park, I'd say it's wanting to reach similar ranks in terms of violent, vulgar humor if not exactly high standard. This is a rarity in this current era of CGI animation, check it out and don't expect your kids to watch it anytime soon since it's obviously not for them."
"chasereynolds-85734","1","15","34","15 August 2016"," This was terrible
","I walked out of this movie 30 minutes into it. Every other word was a swear word. There is only so much endless swearing I can hear until it just becomes irritating. The sex jokes were not funny and became old. The movie tried to take a turn to the Jewish and Palestinian problem, but really ... like I'm going to ponder anything deep about this movie when an actual douche is one of the main characters? It was just animated porn and trash. The trailer did not give a clear indication of how low in the gutter this movie was. The movie theater was filled with teenagers. I kind of felt bad this is the garbage they are being taught and found funny. I cringed until I couldn't take it anymore and then left."
"rgkarim","Null","12","26","12 August 2016"," Crude Comedy, but Original Spin. It hits the target audience
","The mission, write a review. The movie: Sausage Party. Robbie K here, and I'm back with another assignment to give you the 411 on the latest movies to hit the theater. Tonight the latest animated ""masterpiece"" is my subject, one crafted by the masters of raunchy comedy. Let's get started.<br/><br/>LIKES:  Originality  Clever writing with wit  Killer Soundtrack  Short run time<br/><br/>If the trailers weren't enough to convince you, then let me assure you that Sausage Party certainly is a more unique film than most. The idea of food coming to life and navigating a supermarket is not something we get these days. Add on the sexual characteristics and personify to add depth to their characters brings even more shine to the movie. I mean making an antagonist who is an actual douche is new to me. <br/><br/>And with originality often comes cleverness, which this movie manages to bring to the mix. There are plenty of movie references and stereotypical humor integrated into the movie, much of which is well times to have you laughing in your seats. I myself enjoyed seeing warzones unfold in Saving Private Ryan manners, or seeing science fiction movie plots breaking into the spot light. But most of you are probably looking for the sexual innuendos promised in the trailers and to your relief it delivers on its promise. The focus of the movie is certainly on promiscuous side with so many descriptions for sex jammed into the 90 minute run time. So many people lost it to the aggressive insults and descriptions for genitalia that it was sometimes hard to hear the movie. There were also plenty of cheesy puns thrown into the mix to relieve some of the dirtier comedy. And for the moments where they broke the fourth wallthat too was a very good choice.<br/><br/>While you certainly don't care about soundtracks in a comedy movie, Sausage Party gets points for the songs they chose. Various classics over the last few decades grace the speakers such as Three Dog Night's Joy to the World, Meatloaf's song (sung by a meatloaf) and a few other tracks to fit into the deranged mood. It's fun, flashy, and a nostalgic twist to only amplify the comedy of this film and well placed throughout the movie. And did I mention that it is only 90 minutes long. A perfect run time to get the message across before going into the overdone territory. <br/><br/>DISLIKES  Disturbing  Jokes that cross the line  Some lazy dialogue  Some tactics that went stale<br/><br/>If you didn't catch the trailers you might have missed some of the more graphic scenes of the movie. Seeing perishable characters be brutally dismembered while hearing screams of despair, anguish, and suffering drowning the theater certainly wasn't the most enjoyable thing to see. Some might find the destruction of food laughable, but the presentation was a bit more disturbing to me than anything. But these fail in comparison to some of the violent fates other characters fall into. Despite the corny, comical theme, those who cringe or feint of heart might want to steel themselves for the chaos at hand. And as for the orgy scenes, well seeing food do it really isn't my cup of tea. But if death and violence aren't enough to cross the line, then perhaps some of the more inappropriate jokes will do it for you. Our writers certainly set out to poke various snakes, making fun of various cultural references that had me sometimes laughing and other times wondering who it will set off. Surely many people will find this movie offensive, especially when customs and traditions are adulterated with sex and monogamy. I won't lie I laughed at it sometimes, but some of the things certainly hit below the belt. Throw in some lazy dialogue moments and you add further insult. Why cursing must become the key ingredient in a comedy, I don't know, but nevertheless Sausage Party doesn't hesitate to haphazardly add swearing to the point of getting annoying. As for jokes growing stale, surprisingly it doesn't happen much in this movie, but there are some gags that lose their punch. Random food popping up at their mentioning is one example, arrogant bragging of the douche was another. To their benefit though, the jokes were pretty well spread out and the short time prevented them from going too overboard with some of the jokes. <br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>It's hard to score this movie as it isn't the comedy I might prefer. However, keeping in mind its intended audience and joke style, I have to say the movie certainly delivers on its promise to be sexually slanderous and mind numbingly stupid. The story certainly isn't the greatest (or that strong to be honest), but this tale is certainly original in many ways and so creative. However, all the insults and disturbing moments, not too mention the cheaper, low key dialogue moments, take away things for me. So who do I recommend this movie for? Fans of Seth Rogen movies, those who can't get enough raunchy humor, or those who want to see food do it. Worth a trip to the theater? I have to say it is for the audience it delivers for, but hold out until the RedBox if you can wait. <br/><br/>My scores: Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5 Movie Overall: 5"

","*Possible Spoilers!*This movie will be emotionally rejected by highly religious people without a thought. Although the language can be quite shocking, the movie reveals the real nature of humanity and survival instincts. I like this movie because it was a different and brave show of cultural references like Freudian psychology, racism, antisemitism, the new look at modern science, and has connections to Stephen Hawking, and even critiques the distant spirituality in our consumerist society. The movie gives us a twisted view of the question ""What if you can be consumed"". With small pop culture influences and a great finale in reference to the world-recognized book by German author Patrick Süskind, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, this movie turns out to be a great message to people who are real literates. The higher rating users give to this movie, the larger and more diverse is their library."

I usually like Seth Rogen but as a victim of sexual assault for years and having been trying to treat my Post traumatic stress disorder for my entire child and adult life, this movie was an insult, I don't understand how sexual assault is funny or how people can reenact it for entertainment. I understand that it is just cartoons but that doesn't change the meaning of the action. I was excited, at first, to watch Seth Rogan's new movie because he has had some funny ones but this one was very cruel and seemed to glorify some less than reputable actions. Had to turn off the movie and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. Please no rude comments, it took a lot for me to post this."

","Now it is certainly unsurprising that Sausage Party, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's latest film collaboration originally struggled to get financial backing as it is one hell of a weird watch.<br/><br/>What is most interesting about it is not particularly the shock value humour that the film plentifully employs (too much one could say) but the underlying commentary on social aspects in U.S. society including themes of the political & racial persuasion & most prominently the role religion or non-religion plays in society.<br/><br/>Now who in their right mind would of thought that I would be coming out with a comment like that in reference to this film?...not me for sure.<br/><br/>It must be said that given that this is a film that is supposed to be a comedy I actually thought it was lacking in out & out comedic moments, in fact the commentary/message that the film seems to channel actually overpowers or even takes over what I would consider to be the films lack of humour.<br/><br/>Like I said previously in reference to the shock value level employed by the film, too much of said humour is left to that device and given that the film is constantly employing it it only then lessens the effect of it, don't get me wrong I did laugh at quite a few of those moments but there is a point where it did start to wear thin with me.<br/><br/>The film itself is kind of a curiosity purely from its place in the cinematic landscape, I mean how many adult animated comedy films can you think of?...You could literally count them on one hand.<br/><br/>It's interesting me mentioning the above given that a film or even TV series that goes by the name of South Park is surely the godfather of adult shock humour and surely of great inspiration for this film yet what their cinematic exploits featured was not just a message but some ingenious musical routines and most importantly humour that never seems to let up on the viewer.<br/><br/>However the film does have to gain credit in doing something that I never thought possible as given that I'm a South Park veteran viewer it really does take something extraordinary to shock me and the apparent mutilation of food in a variety of ways really did have me grimacing with some regularity and they certainly didn't hold back on the 'adult' nature of the animated comedy.<br/><br/>It's certainly an interesting film project but it doesn't quite fulfill its purpose/potential given the ideas the film has to offer."

The premise of this film sees food in a supermarket as they prepare to be bought and taken to their great future with them unaware of there dark future. All the characters in this film are fantastically funny that really make this film great. Seth then, Kristen wigg, Jonah hill, bill hader and Edward Norton all provide voicework in this film and they are all great. There are some pretty offensive characters in this film but I you can accept it then it I completely hilarious. The story provides really funny moments as the food attempt to come to grips that they are possibly destined to be eaten. However, this film's story is a little messy at times and jumps over a few different locations that I believed not necessarily was for the best. The script is really funny and I was laughing throughout with the jokes working. Also the fun drama in the film works for this fun film. The style of this film is a cheap fun animation that gives this film really nice charm to it. Also this film Is pretty offensive to major religions and if you are easily offended then you shouldn't see this film but I found it pretty funny. This film about half way through loses some of the fun to it and it actually hurts the pacing of the film as more characters are introduced. Overall this is a great comedy that if you have any interest in you should see."

"BillSims28","7","6","11","2 September 2016"," Five-Word Review: Dumb, Funny, Sometimes Cleverly Subversive
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have carved their own niche of American comedy films close to the Apatow brand but more crass. The roster that includes Superbad, Pineapple Express, and This is the End now adds Sausage Party, a decidedly adult-oriented comedy designed to offend and shock, insulting just about every race and belief imaginable. Little would you expect it could also make you think at times. A starry cast supports this animated riff on Pixar stories such as Toy Story, with the likes of Rogen, Edward Norton, Michael Cera and Kristen Wiig lending their voices to the story of sentient foodstuffs discovering that their 'gods' are actually humans who kill and eat them.<br/><br/>Sausage Party often feels like two films in one. On the superficial level it is a dumb, crass, raunchy sex comedy with talking, orgy- loving food characters to appeal to the same stoner crowd as Pineapple Express. On another level, it is an intelligent and well- observed social commentary with witty takes on current social issues related to religion, race, sexuality, and world conflict. This is the film's strength and flaw. The worst of the film is when it is being too dumb and juvenile, with punchlines extending to nothing more than a blurted profanity, a lazy racial slur, or a sex joke that would make a 13 year old laugh. Too much of the film is like this, and a probable sequel would be much improved by focusing up and being less immature.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there's a lot that's funny in Sausage Party. Some of the parodies are on the nose - including excellent riffs on Saving Private Ryan, The Terminator, and, in one grotesque scene, Ratatouille. The situations the foods find themselves in are often very clever - a bagel and a lavash personify (foodify?) the Israel- Palestine conflict, and the main hot dog bun wants a bigger role in life than to just be filled by a sausage. Meanwhile, the voice cast is superb. Nick Kroll (Parks and Recreation's Douche, in a similar role) expertly plays a rapey gymbro character. Norton is unrecognisable as the Jewish 'Sammy Bagel Jr.', while Rogen, Cera, and Wiig are all stellar.<br/><br/>Overall it's a funny film that is worth a watch, and is a nice counterpart to similarly plotted animated films aimed at kids, such as Toy Story. It just feels like it could have been better at times; hopefully the sequel can combine this film's strengths with some improvements. 67/100"

","First, i respect others way of thinking but the movie deals with some sort of a vague analogy from the social interaction of the many cultures that make our world, regarding the main issue i for one have read this on books but don't have the reference at this moment, but some how the center idea goes out something like in reality we do not perceive beings that are in higher or lower levels of existence, therefore we are oblivious that the higher beings form a chain of predator nature, feeding on the weaker more simpler beings, this has a strong relation to the esoteric philosophy of the early postmodernism of the 70's, that there are cosmic gators, or lions or other animals depicted by ancient cultures that some way are blah blah blah gods... this is just as a watermelon milkshake, but it speaks of the collective interest of that peculiar group of artist that make movies, and get hooked by them and sough out to express their thoughts, the way they do it is most representative of them self's, by taking that crap in to the movie theater... but to me, i have to say that they need to smoke less herbs, read more, and grow an opinion of their own, and by that you have to consume your life to endless lectures about the development of philosophy and logic, what can i share in simple words is that in some point it begins to add up, and only then you star to realize where is God, and Who he is, unfortunately the are too busy having amazing prosperous lives to care about reading Imanuel Kant, Hegel, Heidegger, Levinas, Habermass, and many many more, that add bits and pieces to a far far greater than life story, that corresponds to math and physics and all that, but the main point is that the don't read as much as the should, otherwise the movie here should be less stupid, and the resources taken by this production better spent."
"mounirrmaged","1","8","16","30 December 2016"," A complete waste of garbage.
","Sausage party is the latest film of Seth Rogen. A film that might have potential in the beginning, but completely lost. The story focuses around food market who desire to be ""chosen"" by the humans, who are regarded as gods in the eyes of food. But, through a pretty much predictable twist, the food discover that humans are monsters who devour food. So the story could have had clever satire on the extreme sides of both religion and atheism, but sadly this is non-existent. Instead of having a thoughtful, clever and relatable commentary, we get extremely one sided and biased view on religion that is offensive and offers no insight. The film's basic message is that if you believe in God, then you are wrong or living a fantasy. That's it. Nothing clever or remarkable in such a message. It is a pure propaganda to shove atheism down people's throats without even giving any reasons whatsoever. The characters are extremely dull and one dimensional. In fact, they are down right racist stereotypes. It seems this is due to lazy writing, because the characters completely have no chemistry or any funny situations. Another thing is that the animation is very bland, generic and dull. And it is hard to believe that this is a style of animation, because there is no style to it. The comedy in this movie is pretty much nothing but shock factor without any soul or heart. This film is a complete waste of time. For some reason, people praise it for its clever commentary and having some brilliance hidden, yet i saw no such thing. And this movie has also one of the most unnecessary, stupidly insulting and one of the sickest (in a bad way) endings ever: food porn. Seriously? Food porn? What kind of sick minded human being thought this was funny or clever or had any sort of importance at all? It is only bizarre, weird and just uncomfortable. A terrible film."

","After seeing previews of this film, my 12 year old daughter said she wanted to see it because it looked funny. So as with all films I previewed it before permission was given. I was simply amazed at the number of F' words used in this film among many other disturbing things. This brings up an issue of advertising. I really believe there should be a specific and separate warning for ""cartoon"" films that say ""not suitable for children"", kinda like Camel Joe for the tobacco industry. The R rating just isn't enough. No one pays attention to those anymore because there is not always a definition to the warning. So which is more harmful, violence, nudity, drug use or perverted behavior, etc. I believe my daughter would have been traumatized by watching and ""listening"" to this movie. Fortunately my daughter is very good about accepting my guidance as to what is appropriate and would not watch this without my permission. But I worry about other kids that might be drawn to and get access to this film, and you can't always dump it off on the individual parent. It takes a village. This type of film has no business being advertised like any other animated cartoon movie. Its a crappy movie and the humor is only funny if your a deviant. Of all the talent that was used, I am disappointed that of all topics that could have been made into a film, so many participated in this piece of trash."
"mattiasflgrtll6","8","8","16","27 August 2016"," Seth Rogen gets animated
","To say the least, I was excited when I heard Seth Rogen was gonna make his first animated movie, about foods as well. This was long ago though and it felt like it would take forever before I saw it, but now I have and all I can say is...<br/><br/>It's a very funny movie, and well put together as well. The voice acting is top-notch from everyone in cast. Not just Rogen, but practically all of the voice actors brought something of their own. Of course, Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Edward Norton (Yep, he's actually in there) bring their fullest as they usually do, but names I'm less familiar with like Scott Underwood (his acting debut) and Nick Kroll did solid jobs as well. As for the characters, there are so many great ones, most of them have their own quirky personalities and their memorable one-liners. But my favorite has to be Teresa El Taco. I loved how she just kept hitting at Brenda all the time, and was so adorable as well. I rooted for her throughout the movie, and Brenda and Frank's romance didn't really feel that believable anyway.<br/><br/>Most of all though, I was either laughing or at least had a smile on my face for the majority of the time. Every scene had near-impeccable comic timing, and all the food puns I wanted were definitely present. Sometimes the silly puns were even funnier than the sex jokes they went with. Every time a new character was introduced, opportunities for new kind of jokes showed up. You gotta love when a poor almost used-up roll of toilet paper speaks with a frail shaky voice about the traumatizing s'hit he's been through. Or the war-esque sequence where every piece of food is dying, like the jelly for the peanut butter (easy joke, but still got to me). And I won't spoil what happened in it, but the talked-about food orgy which occurs at one point... It's a little gross and yes, really, REALLY stupid, but I laughed my ass off nevertheless. It's not *that* graphic however, not the NC-17 material Rogen & co. thought of it as, but still stands as one of the craziest scenes I've witnessed in an animated movie. Jesus.<br/><br/>There's a present undertone about religion as well (with the foods thinking they'll go to The Great Beyond, but it's really just a load of crap) which I think they handled well. Yes there are jokes which will bother some people (like most around Lavash, an Islamic stereotype), but I just loved them, not to mention Lavash wasn't such a horrible stereotype. He's been brought up on out-dated values, but isn't depicted as a crazy, deranged lunatic. I didn't mind the movie being atheist in nature either, and everyone believing in The Great Beyond weren't depicted as stupid, just misinformed.<br/><br/>If I have any negatives, it's only that despite my praise, my expectations were still too high. I almost expected The Interview levels of funny, but it didn't really reach that bar. Some parts of the movie felt a bit slow (like the fire circle scene) and a lot, but not *all* of the jokes hit like they should've. The ending is not a problem for me though, I freaking loved it. I know it has resulted in mixed opinions, but I didn't see what was the problem with it. You ask me, that's the best possible one they could have used.<br/><br/>Sausages, sausages for everyone! Big fu'cking thumbs up to this movie."

","The animation is easy to watch with its unique look and feel, and the grocery puns are usually very clever and well thought-out, but besides that, Sausage Party is more gag-inducing than funny. And you can't help but think that it's merely for shock value.<br/><br/>As thought-provoking as it intends to be, it's mostly in vain due to its irreverence. The items in a grocery store are all brainwashed to believe that humans are their gods, and that they must be ""chosen"" to reach the Great Beyond--which is unknown to any of them at the time.<br/><br/>It's led by a sausage, Frank (Seth Rogen), who is slowly discovering the truth--that humans aren't gods, but monsters set out to murder all of them--but no one will listen to him. The storyline has promise, but much of the time is spent on extraneous sex jokes, for the sheer purpose of having sex jokes made by pieces of food.<br/><br/>It has its moments, but you spend too much time cringing or laughing out of discomfort. And even within the ridiculous logic of the film, certain things still don't always make sense.<br/><br/>Certain characters are enjoyable, like a chewed up piece of gum who cannot die because he's a piece of gum. But on the other hand, there's a villain (besides the humans) whose motives are foggy and entirely unconvincing.<br/><br/>Honestly, the film's strongest aspect is making us truly want to know how it will end.

First, 30 minutes the movie has horrible pace and the story is not gradually built but after all, pace is not bad. Animation quality is very good and the plot also holds some good point.

Frank (the main sausage protagonist) embarks on a quest to find the truth about the gods (us) and what lies beyond. when he discovers the horrifying truth, he attempts to inform his brethren of the reality of the world only to be mocked insulted and generally dismissed. it takes his friend Carl (another sausage who figured out the horrible truth), who makes him realize that its not about the message but how its delivered. if you insult peoples beliefs,how then, can you expect to get people to see the truth? the movie also utilizes a variety of racial and sexual stereotypes to prove its point and I found the utilization to be very effective in order to promote the message the movie was trying to promote. all in all I really enjoyed the movie, but I realize, that where the movie fails, was in going against what the movie was all about. discovering the truth and finding a respectful way to spread that truth. a lot of people will find this very disrespectful and very vulgar. in that since it failed, because the message will be lost within the whirlwind of foul language, sexual innuendo and racial stereotypes. then there is the ending...you will never see tacos, hotdog's, flatbread's and bagels the same way again. all in all I really enjoyed the movie and i'm glad it was a financial success, because I want to see the sequel."

While that's been done many times before, this film goes out of it's way, sometimes so desperately, to show you how ""not for kids"" it really is; in short: it tries too hard and because of that the dialogue feels forced and awkward at times. While it attempts to touch on real world issues like the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, religion and belief in the after-life, conservative vs liberal beliefs on sex, etc. It doesn't really work and all of that is just seems like the writers siting around going ""haha, what if we did THIS? Wouldn't that be so cool, you guys?"" in between puffs of ganja. There are some scenes that are genuinely funny but they're far and few in between an hour and a half of dumb unfunny prepubescent jokes fired off in rapid succession for shock value and again to reinforce the idea that the viewer is watching something controversial and adult despite it's colorful cartoony polish. After 45 minutes of this mess, you'll be praying for it to quickly come to an end and when it finally does, it's dumb and uneventful. There's no great climax here. It just sorta ends.

DOES NOT MAKE IT A GREAT FILM! the reason Disney Pixar movies are so great is story telling,music orchestration etc.. Seth is now the new Adam Sandler just more pot head Jews making god awful movies. I wouldn't see it again. also, why did they all break away from the store and go on a rampage on humans? why stay there and attack people in the store? it was so stupid and pointless. get your money back."
"TheMovieDiorama","3","10","22","22 September 2016"," There are sausages, but no party in this offensive bore.
","With a deliberately inappropriate name, Sausage Party is about food items from a supermarket wanting to be purchased and taken home...only to find out that we eat them, and so they most warn others of this revelation. This was heavily marketed as inappropriate, offensive and ridiculously funny...heck even critics have rated this highly, so it must be all three right? Wrong. It's definitely inappropriate and offensive, but funny? Hardly. Let me start off with the good points, the voice acting is great with many comedic Hollywood actors being involved (particular praise to Kristen Wiig and Seth Rogen) and it brought bit of life to the characters. The animation was OK, nothing spectacular but it did the job for the most part, it did look bit clumsy and unfinished in certain scenes. Right, now for the negative aspects. Oh my word this film is offensive! It has everything from racial stereotypes, religious backlash, extreme profanity (as extreme as food profanity can get), a ridiculous amount of innuendos and to top it all off, encouraging drug use. Now I might be pushing it with the last part but seriously when a script is so forced to be offensive in every line, it grows tiresome after the first 5 minutes and this is where the problem lies. With an 89 minute runtime the 'jokes' become old fast and with thinly written characters it just means its extremely difficult to care for them and the story as a whole. The last 15 minutes of the film was actually funny and enjoyable (not to mention it has scarred me for life, if you've seen it then you know what I mean) but at that stage I just didn't care for it. The film would've benefited from some clever dialogue...where were the puns? Instead all we got was sex jokes and racial stereotypes from food items, because apparently we all laugh at Salma Hayek voicing a taco because she's Mexican or noodles impersonating Japanese people. I see what they were attempting to do, portraying the supermarket as a smaller scale version of the world and the different cultures, but it was just plain offensive and completely misused. Then there was one scene attempting the whole ""religion is just belief as there is no proof that God exists""...it got under my skin, the screenwriters weren't even trying to hide what they were doing, they might as well have got the food items to say ""science beats religion!"". The last 5 minutes of the film sealed its fate, what was the point!? What would they have gained by revealing what they did? Apart from the potential of a sequel (please...no no, don't even!). Alright...I'm calm, I'm done. Overall, Sausage Party had the potential to be offensive and witty but instead chose to use racial stereotypes, extreme profanity and innuendos in attempt to gain laughs from this borefest. I shan't be watching it again.<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","I truly regret we wasted our time and money on this vulgar, pointless hour and a half of idiocy. If this had been cast with real humans, it would have been rated X. Even though it was animated, the blatant sexual acts should have required a different rating than R. It is so disappointing that movies like this don't come with a warning label that those with any degree of intellect should refrain from viewing. It was obviously strained to push an agenda. This review will never be able to describe what could have been a funny movie; it was nothing but a series of expletiives and filthy innuendos. Are there Hollywood Jackass Awards? There should be and this would be the clear winner."

","This film is the first movie in a very long time that has renewed my belief that you can challenge social boundaries head-on.<br/><br/>Some of the characters are hilarious, some of the dialog, while not clever, is great because it's willing to confront social taboos.<br/><br/>WARNING! No matter how open minded you are, this movie is not for children. This is totally an adults only movie. There is some violent and gruesome imagery, many explicit references to sex and homosexuality. If you heed that warning, you will be spending a lot of time explaining adult references.<br/><br/>The stand-out performances were from Seth Rogen and Kristin Wiig as a hot-dog and bun. Kristin is so true to herself and her comedy helped the movie shine.<br/><br/>The animation is mediocre. It's definitely not bad. It reminds me of Toy Story 1 in its simplicity.<br/><br/>If the movie has faults, it has profanity for the sake of profanity and it is about 10 minutes too long. The movie became tedious toward the end and I was a little too eager to see it finished.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie that challenges social norms and will certainly offend anyone Politically Correct, this is your movie. However, it's not quite the clever movie it could have been. If you had the likes of Mel Brooks on the writing credits, he would have provided the secret sauce to take the film from funny/profane to comic gold/social commentary."

","I was actually thinking this might be a good cartoon. I enjoy a good cartoon like like all 3 of the kung fu panda movies, the Ice Age movies, Toy Story, etc etc. I found I could be entertained by them. They had a good story, whit, comedy and great animation. This one had none of those. What it did have in it was F bombs and expletives in just about every sentence. And it was clear that was the main focus of this movie to keep that pace all the way through. It got really old after about 5 minutes. I guess they all thought that was going to be the comedy by just using those words over and over and over again throughout the entire movie. I can imagine them sitting down over a script to see how of them they put in the shortest space possible. In high school I could cuss with the best of them but even then there a lot of people who took it to the extreme where they could not talk without cussing. Always irritated me a bit to talk to people who were like that. Many of them had almost no vocabulary at all without the cuss words. I downloaded the movie to watch and couldn't bring myself to finish it. I lasted probably 20 minutes hoping it would tone down a bit but it never did. I guess everyone involved in making this junk movie just thought it was going to look cool to be able to cuss all the way through the movie with no restriction and thought that would be enough to carry the film. This movie was not a bit funny to me despite the over used f bombs. Then they got all these actors to fall in this nonsense. I guess a bucks a bucks cause I sure can't see a higher calling than that. This movie was just bad, and they actually tried pretty hard to make it bad."

","'Life is a supermarket, we are the items within'. You get this notion immediately from the opening scenes. The whole film is based on that premise. I'll leave the rest for the movie to tell. <br/><br/>First off, I have to admit I would have loved this film if I had watched it at 15 (am 30)...the humour is juvenile and explicitly vulgar and caters best to a teenage audience. However, I can appreciate that humour even though I am way past it. Some vulgarity was hilarious, but some moments were overdone and stretched out too long. That was my only (personal) gripe about the film. <br/><br/>That being said, I appreciate that the movie tried to address numerous issues (sex and sexuality, patriarchy, religion & religious conflict, the afterlife, politics) and some moments were incredibly smart and funny. And I do like the writers' outlook on life.<br/><br/>I'm sure many will use the movie's vulgarity to bash it but I thought the writers did a good job, and to be fair we knew they were making a vulgar film (the name alone says it all). I'd probably see it again in time. I'd recommend you see this if you're looking for a fun film to watch with the guys, in a sausage party of your own."

"matthewssilverhammer","6","8","17","19 August 2016"," Zootopia...with Sex Jokes
","The element of surprise is the cornerstone of comedy, and Rogen's crew has proved more than capable of catching us off guard with their brand of childish-adult humor (ie Knocked Up, This Is The End). Their latest venture, a bawdy animated-food comedy, finds them in an undeniably original medium. While much of the surprise in the individual jokes is gone in favor of broader concepts, Sausage Party still works, thanks to its comedic thoughts on faith and prejudice. It's a mixture of foody and racist puns that, while far from consistent, provide plenty of easy laughs. Sausage Party is the story of a gang of grocery items who go on an adventure of self-discovery and terrifying revelations. Its surprising main ingredient is its interest in social pigeonholing; think Zootopia without the cute animals and family-friendliness. Thoughtless religion and selfish bigotry are on abundant display, including a hilarious opening song (akin to the worst of modern evangelical music) and a straight-up explanation of our tendency to compartmentalize people with religion and race. Even with that self-awareness, its stereotypes are pretty tired (the bagel is a scared Jew, the taco is a sex-crazed Latino). Its racial typecasting isn't the only thing that pushes the envelope in this hard R. Cartoon parodies of violent horror and war films, drug-trip scenes, and a finale so hilariously / offensively vulgar I'm not sure I can even mention it; it's like these guys knew they could get away with more in an animated world. So while Sausage Party's inventive ideas never quite cook the jokes to their full transcendence, it's still pretty dang funny."
"namashi_1","6","8","17","15 August 2016"," Fun In Parts...
","Seth Rogen is a man with funny ideas & his latest animation-food-based-comedy 'Sausage Party' is another mad attempt by him & Co. And to give this food-talking film its due, its fun in parts & has sequences that genuinely make you laugh. But, the writing is erratic & hence the impact isn't entirely enjoyable.<br/><br/>'Sausage Party' follows a hot dog sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) who tries to discover the truth about his existence, and goes on a journey with his friends to escape their fate.<br/><br/>'Sausage Party' is vulgar, offensive & also funny, no doubt. But the narrative ranges between fun to ordinary. I enjoyed the camaraderie of its central characters & also their love for foul language. The first-hour starts well, but dips considerably in the middle, especially when the food-goons make it out of the store. The laughs shorten & the sequences aren't amusing enough. However, 'Sausage Party' comes to full-power in its final-act, which is fun as well as funny. A post climax-sequence involving the food-goons going crazy in orgy-mode, is Laugh-Out-Loud Funny. But, that's the deal, 'Sausage Party' is erratic, and that's its only minus.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter & Ariel Shaffir's Screenplay is innovative & funny, but could've done better, giving its potential overall. I wanted to laugh more! Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernn's Direction is quite good, as the animation is spiced up. Kevin Pavlovic's Editing is crisp, as the madness is wrapped up in 88-minutes.<br/><br/>Coming to the Vocal-Performances. Seth Rogen as Frank, the heroic Sausage, is tops, as always. Kristen Wiig as Brenda, a hot-dog bun & Frank's love-interest, is excellent. Bill Hader as Firewater, an old Native American bottle of liquor, Tequila, and El Guaco, a guacamole gangster, is a riot. Edward Norton as Sammy Bagel Jr., a bagel & Salma Hayek as Teresa del Taco, a lesbian taco shell who develops a lustful friendship with Brenda, steal the show. Michael Cera as Barry, a deformed sausage who is one of Frank's friends, is cute. Danny McBride as Honey Mustard, a grocery who was returned to Shopwell's and tries to warn Frank of their fate, is loud. James Franco as the Druggie, a junkie drug addict who is the first known human to see the foods as sentient beings, brings the house down. Jonah Hill as Carl, a sausage who's packed with Frank and Barry, is effective enough. Paul Rudd as Darren, the manager of Shopwell's, who the food-toons are frightened by, is first-rate. Others lend superb support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Sausage Party' has flaws, but it isn't without its moments."

Basic story is, a couple of snacks get angry when they realized we eat them, and want some revenge. It's actually pretty boring, I didn't like the scene where Frank sexually assaulted the California Raisins, it's like a ten minute scene. Seth Rogen yells while the mildly racist raisins were horrified and one died. This movie is totally screwed up, there's a part where the Bun Lady slices off a human man's member and puts it in the bun for a gag. I didn't appreciate all the racism in the movie, I disliked how it made the foods racist. it was pretty racist. <br/><br/>But I liked the one scene where the characters watch The Simpson's parody of Toy Story with food products from over 10 years ago, and send the idea to Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg to write it into their next movie, as Rogen ran out of reefer and needed a fresh idea. I also loved Judd Apatow's cameo as Bill the Banana, who habitually yanks his chain to posters of Mr. T.

Their song describes the joy of the moment when the ""gods"" will take them to the ""great beyond,"" and the movie is mainly concerned with the horrific truth that the great beyond is where food goes to be sliced, boiled, and eaten.<br/><br/>Deaths are both clever and horrific, as when a jar of jelly lies on the floor, its life-jelly oozing out, while a jar of peanut butter weeps. I mean, the people who made this movie are really sick.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of jokes about sex. It's possible that sex jokes make up 50% of this film.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, even though the movie is full of sick humor and cheap sex jokes, this is a surprisingly smart movie. The story is well designed, the characters are relatable, and the movie has interesting takes on religious belief and approaches Mid-East tensions . It's well animated and voiced and often really, really funny. This really is the movie Pixar would make if they decided to make a really tasteless movie about sex between hot dogs and buns.

A stranger next to me just couldn't stop laughing and was crying his eyes out - so was I. Especially near the end there is a scene (no spoilers) where I found myself in shock with awe and I just couldn't believe my eyes. And I am not easily shocked, I can tell you. The animators most have had the time of their lives, creating that scene in particular!<br/><br/>Apart from this hilarious experience I happily got to share with the rest of the viewers, the story was good, steady and filled with jokes. The voice-acting was brilliant, (what a cast!) and the animations were well done. Okay, three points of criticism: the evil Douche is not really adding to the story or necessary for the actions of the main characters. The biggest antagonists are the humans already. He does have a few good jokes. The second is some irregularities because e.g. in the street scene - without spoiling - that is not food talking, so that is simply not correct. Deadly funny though. Same counts for Douche or toiletpaper.And the biggest reaction of the audience. The last thing is the ending. But how can you end a movie that has that huge 'ensemble- scene' at the end. If you'd end it there, that would leave the fate of the characters unanswered. How they make it end now feels a bit too fabricated. But okay, after this hysterical roller-coaster ride, it doesn't really matter anymore.<br/><br/>If you are easily offended and are a big fan of little house on the prairie, don't watch it. If you like a cleverly written, acted and animated adult animated movie which is also confrontational at times and has many layers underneath the ridiculously hilarious surface - this is for you. A solid 9/10."

","Before watching Sausage Party, I read a few articles about the movie, as I do before I watch virtually any new movie. What struck me most was my finding that the movie originally earned an NC-17 rating. I wondered how a movie about cartoon food could possibly accomplish that.<br/><br/>As it turned out, I only needed to watch the opening few minutes before I understood. After the remaining 90 minutes passed, I wondered how the movie in its current form managed to escape with a mere R rating. I saw an abundance of reasons no one under 17 should watch the movie, including the avalanche of explicit sexual descriptions, graphic drug use (apparently food can use drugs, who knew?), and sins against humanity committed by a douche. And that's not all. Not even close.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, Sausage party will disgust you. It will appall you. It will make you never look at tacos the same way again.<br/><br/>The entire movie is a gigantic f*** fest. By that I mean verbal f-bombs are dropped left and right, and (minor spoiler alert, but who I am kidding—you should know what's coming) all the foods literally take part in a gigantic f*** fest.<br/><br/>The filmmakers save this for the end, of course. In the final scene, the store's foods erupt into an all-inclusive, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, interracial (at least, as much as cartoon foods can have races) and wildly creative orgy that would make a progressive citizen of 2016 proud. Or just really grossed out.<br/><br/>As repulsive as that may sound, the movie isn't all bad. Somewhere along the way as you view all that lewd, pornographic material (at least as much as cartoon foods can be pornographic, which as it turns out, they can be jarringly pornographic), you will laugh. Maybe it will only be a confused, disbelieving, uncomfortable laugh. But you will laugh.<br/><br/>Even after reading this, the depths of unhinged sexuality in this movie will still surprise you. I laid out in no uncertain terms, what you should expect, and the sexual content will still surprise you. And that's not the only surprising aspect of this movie, which is a cartoon. Did I mention that? Even if I did, it bears repeating.<br/><br/>The other startling aspect of the movie is the volume of racial stereotypes unleashed through the portrayals of food. At first, this struck me terribly distasteful and unfunny. Soon I realized that these stereotypes were so grossly exaggerated that they actually functioned as a sort of self-aware jab at racial jokes made in typical R-rated comedies.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm just now realizing that the entire movie is essentially an ironic depiction of the typical R-rated comedy. They turned the sexuality up to 11 to poke fun at the other movies that fall back on obvious sex jokes to create laughs.<br/><br/>On many members of the audience, this intention may have been lost. It likely only became evident to some of the most discerning movie-goers as they watched (it may also have dawned on some of the less discerning viewers days later as they wrote about the movie).<br/><br/>So there you have it. I didn't bother addressing any specifics of the movie, such as, character names or plot lines. If you want that stuff, fine. One hotdog is named Frank and the foods freak out when they learn that humans eat food. Not quite as complicated as Inception.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're looking for a crass comedy to supply a few laughs, this could be the movie for you. If you desire something self-aware that takes a subtle jab at the average raunchy comedy, this movie could also be for you. (It's odd to realize that there's a subtlety to this movie, considering that most of the sexual jokes contain absolutely zero subtlety.

","At the end of the movie it felt like watching it was a complete waste of my time. The two times I laughed were the two situations that were also in the trailer which made me want to see the movie in the first place. I felt like they were trying to be funny by too much swearing and all the sex talk instead of coming up with some real jokes. Maybe its just me, but to be honest the only time the full audience in the cinema made a loud reaction was when they were appalled by a used condom that came into the story at one point. Besides that, there was no laughing or giggling whatsoever. It came to my mind that if the trailer painted a more accurate picture of what the movie was like, the cinema wouldn't be filled with people that tumbled in looking for a regular comedy."

","Sausage party is a concept movie - and once you get past the main concept there needs to be a story to carry the other 99 minutes - unfortunately here that is the missing ingredient.<br/><br/>Once you get used to groceries swearing, and talking about sex, and toilet humor there is no content here worth seeing - it's as though a third grader wrote the movie. Seriously- one of the characters is a douche who talks endlessly about getting ""up in there"" which while it made me grin the first time made me want to cry the 50th time.<br/><br/>There is swearing for the sake of comedy which is always a sign of terrible writing - if some character says ""Let's f$&kin' do this!"" instead of ""Let's do this!"" And you find it funny then this is a movie for you. <br/><br/>I think the main actors who also are responsible largely for ""This is the end"" (another awful movie) are one-trick ponies who only talk about sex and getting high and think it's funny. <br/><br/>There was laughter for the first five minutes in the theatre, then it died down and when people were leaving there was a sense of relief that the movie was over.

","This is my review of Sausage Party (spoiler free)<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>Cast: Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Bill Hader, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Paul Rudd. <br/><br/>Plot: Shopwell's supermarket is full of happy groceries, waiting to go to the 'Great Beyond'. But one day they discover evidence to suggest there is a much darker future in store for them.<br/><br/>In the original Shrek, the Gingerbread Man is tortured by the malevolent Lord Farquaad. Dunked in milk with his legs ripped off, he's threatened with even worse bodily harm. ""No, not my buttons!"" he squeals. ""Not my gumdrop buttons!"" It's apt that Conrad Vernon, the man who both created and voiced 'Gingy', is also one of the directors of Sausage Party. Because, like the scene described above which is arguably the most violent that movie can get apart from the beer fight. This unlikeliest of summer-season animations is a weird hybrid of cutesy cartoon and horror flick, a tale in which awful things happen to sentient food products. It may be a weird hybrid between the two but it's both very very rude but very very funny in its use of random rudeness but that particular influx of randomness pulls through in what could be the greatest animation ever. It's arguably an intended spoof for the creators of Superbad Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen to make a mockery of all the animations that they love/loved as either children or adults. Our hero Frank (Rogen) who has unimaginable feelings for his bun-friend Brenda (Wiig, on top form once again, and also more confident than ever) and he shares his packaging with Barry (Cera, in his bravest role ever), and Carl (Hill, in possibly his shortest role ever as he doesn't last very long) see that life in the supermarket isn't quite what it seems, as Frank goes off in search for the truth. There is one point in this cutesy animation that makes it a creepy horror flick, because this also uses violence not the slapstick you normally get in films like this but guts out violence, in what could be described as the most violent scene in any animation ever. Beyond all the Pixar-like feelings this film will give it is nowhere near child friendly but with its charm and vulgarity it shows that adults can love animation too. <br/><br/>What if the premise of a film like Toy Story, in which inanimate objects come to terms with the meaning of their existence, was pushed to its logical dark-as-hell conclusion? There is an increasing amount of glee in Sausage Party (a tale about pork that is more sex-obsessed than Porky's) as it heads towards its demented denouement. Brought to life by sub-Pixar but decent CGI, as it bustles with anthropomorphic edibles. There is a tomato voiced by Rudd, a sultry taco with the tones of Salma Hayek and even a Hitler-esque sauerkraut shouting ""exterminate the juice."" In case how man food based puns there are; the answer is a lot. At first though it seems that, that is all this seems to offer, with enough raunch to make a beetroot blush. Gradually, though, this reveals itself to be a bold piece of work with some rather big ideas. The return of a panicked jar of honey mustard (Danny McBride) to the store, raving about the abuse meted out to food items by humans, triggers an existential quest for Frank to go on and he goes to extreme lengths (pun intended) to search for the truth. There is a concept of organized religion that is explored, as the lone sausage tries to convince his blissed-out companions they not be headed for a glorious after life, but rather a knife-assisted oblivion. Even the Israel/Palestine conflict is riffed upon, through the unlikely medium of a relationship between a lavish (David Krumholtz) and a bagel (Edward Norton, doing a big, goofy impression of Woody Allen and just about stealing the show). <br/><br/>There are smarts to Sausage Party that are well-concealed between layers of utter filth, which ramps up and up until a late set-piece that will likely make you choke with laughter: think Caligula re-enacted by condiments. Bringing to mind a go-for-broke vibe of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, the final reel unleashes debauchery and mayhem of a kind that makes you wonder if a studio exec ever checked in on the production. There are some barren bits – there is a villain that is an actual douche (Nick Kroll) who's more loud than funny, and some of the gags have the feeling that the writers got them from a box of Christmas crackers – but Rogen and Goldberg have succeeded in cooking up something truly original. Also in its incredibly short run time it delivers laughs out the whazoo, rudeness and food related violence and sex. The finale, meanwhile, suggests yet another Meta sequel could be on its way. It leaves us to believe what these sausages could get up to next. You may even forgive it for being incredibly short. It's nice to see Seth Rogen on top form once again.<br/><br/>Verdict: It sounded like the dumbest movie of all time, but it's actually smart, subversive and packed with famous voice, saying wonderfully unspeakable things. In fact, it's a banger.<br/><br/>8/10 balls out entertainment."
"KristianZacc","8","7","15","31 August 2016"," Seth Rogen Brings The Raunch
","Minor/Vague Spoilers<br/><br/>Sausage (but really Hot Dog) Party is a satirical, non-family friendly, animated comedy film directed by Greg Tiernan, his feature film debut. It was really interesting to note that Tiernan has swung in the completely opposite direction from his previous works on Thomas & Friends where he introduced CGI into the series. Tiernan and his wife founded Nitrogen Studios Canada, Inc. in 2003, and he used his studio for pre and post-production in this film. <br/><br/>Lead star and writer, Seth Rogen, has been working on this film for eight years and has said that studios were scared to pick it up because of its R rating. Eventually Sony Pictures and Annapurna Pictures would partner and co-finance the film and fast forward to August 2016 and here it is. <br/><br/>First thing's first, if you are not a fan of Seth Rogen's comedy then this might not be the movie for you. This is very low brow and way over the top and considering he called all his buddies (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Danny McBride) for roles in the movie his style of comedy shines bright like the entrance to The Great Beyond. <br/><br/>On a basic level the film could be described as Toy Story with food, the same way The Secret Life of Pets could be described as Toy Story with pets. It clearly is going off past Disney/Pixar films that use this concept and posing the question, ""what if our food had feelings?"" <br/><br/>From the trailers I had thought there would be more involved with being at the woman's house and trying to escape The Great Beyond and get back to Shopwell's, the films supermarket where all the food resides. The Great Beyond is the world outside the supermarket and that is what the food items perceive to be a Heaven and the real life people are Gods. <br/><br/>What really took me by surprise, in a good way, was how the film used satire and social commentary to talk about real things such as religion, politics, and war all portrayed by stereotypical food items from their respective countries. <br/><br/>While, there were moments that showed it was self-aware (specifically one scene involving cheese) and smart, it did not shy away from being EXTREMELY raunchy. One of the final scenes was especially raunchy and while I was shocked to be watching what I was, I couldn't help myself but laugh my ass off. The scene just kept going and going but didn't get old, it just built upon itself and made it more hilarious. <br/><br/>The film also has many different elements to it (Horror, meta, raunchy) such as the scene where the food items find out that The Great Beyond isn't what they thought it would be and it turns into a horror comedy. Even though most of the scene is shown in the trailers it still plays out quite well, just not as hilarious as if I hadn't watched the trailers 10 times over. <br/><br/>There is a bit of a lull in the middle where they take the time to do some world building inside the shopping centre where each aisle is like another country. The jokes do come to a halt here but I see it as necessary for the film because it enables us to get introduced to a whole world instead of just the hot dog and a bun. <br/><br/>The ending to this film could open it up to a sequel if they choose to make one (heres hoping they do)! It gets very meta and for a moment I thought the movie wasn't over but instead the credits hit and Sausage Party Two is left as just a twinkle in our eyes. Hopefully, it doesn't take another eight years to get it into theatres."

","The best thing I can say about this movie is that the animation was really good for a second rate studio. It was very expressive and the designs were mostly great. And that just saddens me to imagine how much effort and many days of their lives the animators wasted making this. I also had no idea that Paul Rudd or Edward Norton could voice act. And then the positives stop. <br/><br/>Every joke, literally every joke is either a pun about sex, or the punchline is, ""Oh wow! An animated character is saying the F word! That's not supposed to happen! It's a cartoon! And that's not supposed to happen in a cartoon! It's just like...what?!?!? It's a cartoon! They aren't supposed to curse!!!!!!"" Personally, I prefer jokes. I didn't laugh, chuckle, grin, or even sneer the entire duration of the movie. I held the exact same disappointed look from the second the first trailer started (Resident Evil 6), to the end of the credits. What you get in this movie is uncomfortable silence. I only heard one person laughing the entire movie, and my theater was full of about 30 other people. The only reason I can fathom people laughing at all the sex puns or the cursing is because they grew up being told those things are wrong. Turning it into a joke undermines its value in a story telling purpose. Even in Bojack Horseman, where almost every time the main character has sex it is turned into a joke, it is still used to tell or show things about the characters. It isn't used for shock value. It's used in a shocking way to build a character. And that brings me to the story. The plot has the exact same structure of every generic kid's movie. Making fun of said plot does not make it any better then the movies that are actually doing it. Maybe if it made fun of those types of movies better, and then vastly deviated from their typical structure it would have been interesting. But in the end, this movie plays out exactly like every Pixar, Dreamworks and Aardmon picture. However, the reason so many of their movies work is because they have characters you care about and an interesting setting. This has neither. A supermarket where nobody eats anything inside? Unlikely. A jerk hot dog that is trying to tell everyone faith is a lie, and a vapid bun that just wants to get back home so she can sleep with her man? I don't care about either of those motivations enough to latch onto the characters. A world were food, toilet paper, and a douche is alive, but napkins, pillows, table cloths, doors, books, clothing and kitchen cutlery aren't? You lost my suspension of disbelief. I'm aware it's a cartoon. I'm aware of the argument ""cartoons don't have to follow logic."" But every cartoon has some sort of logic, some sort of consistency, some sort of cutoff. What is it in this one? Food and Bathroom products? Why wasn't anything else in the bathroom alive when they showed the toilet paper? Anything sold in a grocery store? What about napkins and kitchen cutlery? It's just lazy writing so they could make a joke about how ""it's so effed up that if toilet paper was alive it's entire life would be wiping poop out of butts!"". If this movie was written by someone else they might have been able to catch these things. If this movie was reduced to a PG-13, it might have had value in being a really good introduction into questioning faith. But as is, especially for a film aimed at ""mature"" adults, non of it's political, social, or religious commentary is very deep. Every instance I can think of is just ""hey, crackers pushed the native American stereotypes out of it's display"", or ""hey, Arabs and Jews like hummus! Why do they hate each other so much??"", or ""hey, you don't know for sure if you're gay until you try it!"" and then theirs nothing more said. It is a reference to a subject. It isn't saying anything deep or meaningful about the subject. It's just bringing it up for the sake of a joke. That isn't funny, mature, or intelligent. There is no value to this movie as long as it is aimed at early to mid 20 year olds. The entire thing treats it's audience as if they have the mind set of 14 year olds, constantly referencing really deep and philosophical things, but never actually discussing them beyond that. This is the equivalent of Soul Plane."

","I'm a huge fan of both Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill. The pair have delivered some of my favorite movies over the last decade. The thought of an R rated comedy also appealed to me. I'm a big fan of 'Family Guy', 'American Dad', 'South Park' etc. and would happily watch a feature length film of them with an R rating (the 'South Park' feature film is one of my favourites of all time). So all the signs were positive going into 'Sausage Party'. Then the movie started and it got off to quite a clunky, awkward and stunted beginning. That's okay though I thought, they'll ease into things as it goes along and the jokes will start to flow. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. At about the halfway point I realised I hadn't laughed once, didn't care in the slightest about the story, and was frankly bored out of my mind. What was this nonsense? What part of this exactly was I supposed to be finding funny? <br/><br/>Did they think that the concept alone, of food being alive, could carry an entire 90 minutes of film, and that consequently they didn't have to write any real jokes? That's how it came across. I read that Seth Rogen had a hard time getting this picked up by film studios because of its dark nature. I now suspect they were just being polite in saying that was the reason, and truthfully they just knew that it was an incredibly weak script. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. It won't put me off anyone involved, but I do hope they steer clear of the animated genre from now on. Stick to what you do best. You're brilliant at that."

In fact, it becomes borderline offensive to the viewers intellect.<br/><br/>The film is nothing more than stale toilet humour that was never funny in the first place, jokes about genitals, and don't forget the racism.<br/><br/>Although the makers imply that its winking at the camera humour, the fact that Salma Hayek plays a taco, and other ethnicities play foodstuff from around the world, doesn't mean that it's okay to do it. It's like Rogen has been watching British seventies sitcoms and referenced these in the writing.<br/><br/>Comedy is supposed to invigorate and energise you from all the fun you are having, not make you feel depressed and angry, much like this film made me feel.<br/><br/>And just to top it all off, they mock the disabled, and end the film with an food orgy.<br/><br/>Talk about all you can eat.<br/><br/>The cinematic equivalent of finding a rotten cabbage in your fridge.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In a big American supermarket, some foodstuffs including a talking sausage, secretly come to life when no one can see them, and dream of being chosen and taken to the 'great beyond.' It seems like their time has come, but then they all get separated by accident, and learn of the true fate that awaits them when they're taken away.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen spreads his brand of adult humour further with Sausage Party, expanding in to animated territory and turning the Disney/Pixar trend on its head with something apparently innocent looking that seriously isn't for kids. Its a subversive idea, that runs on the premise of being an animated film with loads of swearing and sexually explicit references, but it's a one joke premise that wears thin pretty quickly and doesn't really have the durability to sustain a feature length production, and would probably have worked better as a sketch.<br/><br/>The whole film sees food products re-imagined in humanistic form, which makes for some subtle references to real life people, and dutifully leaves political correctness to the side lines. And so we have the Israeli/Palestinian conflict re-imagined as a bickering bagel and taco, a permanently drunk bottle of Mexican tequila, as well as a whole parading army of Nazi sauerkraut (that want to exterminate 'the juice.'). It certainly pushes the boundaries, but has no great plot to guide in, and so ends up being just a pile of occasionally funny set pieces, rounding off with a big, massive 'food orgy', for want of anything more fitting.<br/><br/>Toy Story for adults, then.

I was looking for something simple, stupid, and low-brow to just give me a laugh or two, just enough to keep me awake. I like Seth Rogan, so I choose Sausage Party, a film I'd never normally see, and while it had what I was looking for, surprisingly, it also had a lot more. I was expecting nothing but the typical drug and sex jokes, but in addition to that, there was a cleverness there that I wasn't expecting, the kind of thing you'd normally get from Family Guy. It's hard to say more without spoiling it, but one such element seen in the trailer and used through out the film, is the use of ethnic foods to represent the real life conflicts and stereotypes of the people associated with them. There are also plenty of food related jokes through out the film that seem so obvious for a movie like this, but you didn't think of them, and that's why Seth Rogan never has to pay for his weed.... The bottom line, I'm not saying this film is going to win any awards or that's it's going to become some huge cult classic or anything like that, just that it's far more clever, intelligent, and entertaining than I ever assumed it could be.

","The raunchy comedy about grocery store products comes from the minds of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen who also voices the main sausage, Frank. The story explores the belief in benevolent gods that are human shoppers. The food products believe that these gods take them to a great beyond where they can live out their greatest pleasures and be taken care of by these gods. The movie uses the metaphor of a sausage in buns as sex to the greatest extent possible. <br/><br/>The animation boasts an impressive voice cast of all of Rogen's crew including co-creator Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Salma Hayek, Kristen Wiig, Nick Kroll, Danny McBride, Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Bill Hader, and plenty more. The story follows the adventure of Rogen's Frank and Wiig's Brenda Bunson, hotdog buns, encounter an enlightened by a raving Honey Mustard (McBride) who was returned after seeing the true story of what really happens when the products are purchased and taken home.<br/><br/>The exploration of the grocery store relies heavily on racial stereotypes that are both amusing and insulting simultaneously. The gimmick of talking food is funny at first but runs dry as the movie progresses with an odd story about bath salts. There are plenty of laugh out loud jokes and silly humor, but the story about false beliefs and warring groups of religious zealots is the most interesting part of the comedy. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

I mean it literally referenced the Holocaust in the first 40 seconds... The jokes were the types of jokes middle school aged children make and they were really not that funny. The last scene of the film was not needed as well. In fact it was quite awkward for everyone in the theater. Nothing like a group of adults watching an orgy of our favorite foods. All in all, I do not recommend this movie to any one. Do something better with your time. See a different movie."

","From the looks of things when I first saw the trailer for SAUSAGE PARTY I thought it could end up being a funny movie. Sure I knew it was from Seth Rogen and that it could end up being off the wall and a bit crude but I'd seen enough of his films to expect that. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the trailer I suggest you do so before watching the movie. You'll see some of the best gags that way. And then you won't have to bother with the movie itself. If you do decide to go ahead, be prepared for one of the most offensive movies you'll ever see. My guess would be that of Rogen and his friends ever read that sentence they would consider it a badge of honor. They shouldn't.<br/><br/>The movie is an animated film about the lives of food in a grocery store. Each morning they wake and sing a song about how wonderful it is to be there and with any luck be chosen by the Gods to be taken out of the store. The song has that cheery Disneyesque feel to it but when listening to the lyrics not quite so since about every 4th word is an F bomb or variation of that word.<br/><br/>Our story focuses on two food members. Frank is a hot dogs in a package of the same and Brenda is a curvaceous bun in a package located right next to Frank and his group. The two are star crossed loves who have never met but who have ""touched tips"" meaning reached across from their various packages to touch fingertips. Their dream is to one day be picked up at the same time and finally united in the great beyond.<br/><br/>Circumstances result in their falling out of a shopping cart and left stranded in the store. Along the way to finding their home they get separated. While Frank's journey results in his learning what actually happens when you reach the great beyond, Brenda is pursued by a bottle of douche with a broken stem intent on wreaking havoc and destroying Frank. High humor, right? The two reunite and Frank tries to tell Brenda that it is all a lie, that there are no beneficent Gods out there and that the great beyond is nothing more than a death sentence for all who leave the store. The two part ways and Frank is now more determined than ever to find proof to show the rest of the store that his discovery is true.<br/><br/>Up to this point the off color humor has been fairly tame with a few exceptions going what some would consider too far. And a few of the jokes found here are actually well thought out and funny, in particular the food puns. But the movie isn't over. It gets much much worse.<br/><br/>To begin with there is the none too subtle concept on display here involving the Gods and the great beyond. Depending on your beliefs this will either make you laugh or offend you greatly. In essence the story is that God doesn't really exist, Heaven is a myth and you should live your life as you want to now doing whatever you want to do. And I do mean whatever. Of course all of this is done in good fun. Sorry but as someone who does believe I found no fun in the ridicule of those who have faith.<br/><br/>If that wasn't enough there are a ton of off color sexual jokes found in here, everything from A to Z. If you think one inanimate object performing oral sex on another is hilarious then this movie is right up your alley. And if the periodic jokes weren't enough as the film gets to the final segment every food or item in the store joins into an orgy the likes of which are not seen outside of the most extreme pornographic films made. If there is a sexual act known to man you will see it performed by food items during this segment.<br/><br/>I have little doubt in my mind that pre-adolescent boys will find a way to get hold of this movie to watch together, giggle and then laugh out loud at what they see. They have no idea what it is that goes on between two people so this is their dirty joke, the kind that you laughed at until you were an adult and then realized wasn't funny. Those who are stuck in that age bracket mentally will enjoy it as well or will try and tell you that you aren't ""enlightened"" enough to appreciate the humor on display here. They won't care who it offends and won't care that it is bottom of the barrel humor.<br/><br/>The most disturbing thing about this film is that there will be some parents out there who won't pay attention to the rating or consider looking at what the film is about who will rent it for their children simply because all they will see is that it's an animated film. I can't imagine what the affects seeing this would have on those children.<br/><br/>I've seen adult animated films before from FRITZ THE CAT to SHAME OF THE JUNGLE. As an adult I could appreciate the things they were trying to say, the standards that they were trying to poke fun at and understand where they were coming from in their method of talking about the topics. This film has no motivation other than to talk dirty, be nasty and slam anyone who believes in God. The level of humor is Beavis and Butthead on steroids, where simply saying a dirty word makes those involved laugh (watch the extras and you'll see that actually happen). The sad reality is that they are laughing all the way to the bank."

"TheVictoriousV","5","3","5","20 January 2019"," Get it? They're cartoons but they say the sex
","When I reviewed The Little Prince, I named some things that don't automatically make you or anything else ""adult"". For instance, you don't need to let go of the whimsy of imagination and you don't need to conform to a system that dictates the entirety of your existence. When it comes to movies, meanwhile, there's a lot more to being adult than dropping F bombs and referencing the human mating ritual. This is where Sausage Party, which brags about being the rarity that is an R-rated animated movie, comes in.<br/><br/>The thing with the R-rating is that you can always tell when the rating is a byproduct of the film that got made, versus when the film that got made set out to be rated R. Much like Deadpool, which was a purposeful attempt at an R-rated superhero movie, Sausage Party has just the right amount of forced sex jokes and crude language you'd except from a purposeful attempt at an R-rated animation. Does that make it dreadful? Not necessarily. But it does make it obvious.<br/><br/>Speaking of obvious, every character in the film is some sort of grocery store item and their gender seems to be determined by which ones are phallic and which ones look vaginal. The voice cast, as usual, is all stars and no voice actors but some of them do an ample job. Seth Rogen leads the film as a sausage who is brought from the supermarket to ""The Great Beyond"" (the average human home), and his co-stars include Johan Hill as yet another sausage, Kristen Wiig as a hot dog bun (get it?), Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd (as one of the few human characters), Edward Norton, James Franco, Salma Hayek (as a taco shell that's also a lesbian), Bill Hader in a dual role, Danny McBride, and Nick Kroll.<br/><br/>The plot, naturally, is that all the items come to the realization that The Great Beyond isn't all that great and that a fate of getting eaten, or worse, awaits them. There are some laughs and sparse moments of cleverness throughout the movie but nothing about it wowed me the way it has evidently wowed movie-goers. I got a good chortle out of watching these guys gaze in horror as their friends got turned into dinner, though not only did the shtick seem familiar to me, but it also would have worked better as a short sketch on YouTube. Even the mind-screw ending reminded me of certain parts from The Lego Movie.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Greg Tiernan with a little help from Dreamworks' own Conrad Vernon. The writing was done by the likes of Rogen himself and his good friend Evan Goldberg, which goes without saying if you've seen any of their other films prior to this one. They've had some legitimately great and smart films, but you can always tell that they love to throw in their t-ttyf-ck jokes and drug humor when they concur that it's getting a little slow. When you get used to the formula, you kinda stop being impressed.<br/><br/>Certain jokes are Foodfight-level food product puns except dirtier (somehow). There's also the occasional ""douche"" pun in the form of a character who is a douche both literally and figuratively. If you don't get it, in spite of the fact that even the most toddling of toddlers would, then don't worry - the joke goes on for a while. There is also music, and whenever it's not ""whatever the kids are listening to on the Spotifies these days"", it's a score by Alan Menken. Your guess is as good as mine, dear reader.<br/><br/>Although the animation isn't technically anything remarkable, it's worth mentioning that almost half of the animators weren't paid for their work. As I'm writing this, they're even looking to take one of the production companies, Nitrogen Studios Canada, to court for wage theft. When a movie gets made under such inexcusable circumstances, it's hard for me to be appreciative of it. And independent of this unhappy behind-the-scenes fact, the film still ain't especially great. I'm rating it 2.5/5 douches.<br/><br/>At least Rogen and Goldberg and the rest of the crew can rest easy knowing they made the world's first animated feature film that isn't meant for kids. Except for Heavy Metal, the South Park movie, Waltz with Bashir, Anomalisa, Mary & Max, Down and Dirty Duck, Fritz the Cat, Beavis & Butthead Do America, Felidae, and The Killing Joke, which came out just a few weeks before Sausage Party even. But other than that, though..."

There is an attempt by Frank the hot dog and Brenda his girlfriend bun to save the mustard.

There is graphic depictions of what food goes through as a dinner is being prepared. There is the douche bottle who becomes a villain. There is more cursing than I have ever heard in a film, drug use, outright racism and an orgy scene that would make a porn producer proud and had my wife and I hollowing with laughter. <br/><br/>Folks I have not seen this kind of cartoon since the classic Fritz the Cat.

"dmartinez-52655","6","3","5","27 February 2017"," What I expected
","The Movie ""Sausage Party"" is a animated stoner comedy by Seth Rogan, the same man behind ""Pineapple Express"" and ""The Interview"", with the main setting in a grocery store called Shop-well with our main characters as sausages and Buns(no joke). When i first saw the trailers months before it came out in August of 2016 I wasn't pretty surprised with the violent horror movie fashion and repeated swearing of ""Fuck"" and ""Shit"" with the whole plot explained briefly in under two minutes. The store is where the movie mostly takes place with a sausage ""Frank"" (Seth Rogan) and his girlfriend Hot Dog Bun Brenda (Kristin Wig) with his friend Carl (Jonah Hill) the store's food are always alive and talking but humans can't notice their body parts and human-like movement Most of the food men are designed with cute cartoon gloves and eyes instead of realistic eyes and limbs, but most food woman are designed with realistic eyes and limbs which feels a bit sexist. The food believe the Humans are all gods that choose food to be sent to heaven and give them the chance to do some actual food porn (Again, no joke) Yet, the same day Frank, Carl, and Brenda are chosen, Something Goes wrong with the three being separated and we are greeted to new and ""interesting"" characters while Frank has to uncover the truth behind the ""GODS"" that actually eat them when they are chosen...<br/><br/>That's all i will explain because of spoilers but this movie is what the trailer was swearing, Horror-themed food violence, and some other movie references. The movie has it's usual Seth Rogan stoner humor with some impressive animation, I will admit the animation is great. With some moments that could easily scare an adult with some gross moments I had, and that really did get me.<br/><br/>Overall, Sausage Party is pretty funny film as what you expect from Seth and his other celebrity friends.It is not the best Animated Film despite some controversy that went on with the animators working unpaid overtime. The animation is both dark and impressive that has that real-world concept you can enjoy, and still be a bit sick about. We are also given that illusion where it is what if this object was alive and talking and this movie executes it well with how they describe background characters despite some other films with a similar concept.This adult film was pretty impressive with vulgar humor you might think is too much but it is better to forget. i will recommend this film for a couple of laughs and appreciate the acting, animation, and how it is executed like other Rogan Films."
"ferdimension","7","3","5","15 February 2017"," Sausage Party, nothing great from Seth Rogen but is just good
","I wasn't excited for this movie because i'm not for see a lot of R animated movies. But even i saw it, i liked it. There's a really fight between this movie if is good or terrible. The first thing of Sausage Party that the best of this movie is the voice cast of the movie who makes a great job in the voices of the characters like Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Nick Kroll, Micheal Cera, Jonan Hill, Edward Norton and others. The movie has some likable characters like Frank, Brenda, Barry and the villain Douche who has some of the most funniest moments of the film. The humor is a miss or hit. Sometime it can get hilarious moments, some others a funny moments and sometime really bad bad jokes like Kristin Wiig improvisation or so many insults. The score and the song ""The Great Beyond"" is great and they do have some of the best themes that i ever heard. And the last good thing of this movies are some thing of the animation like some of the takes are really good, some of the designs are decent and the backgrounds are great. But, it doesn't mean that everything of this movie is great, it has some problems. The animation is one of those. Even that is not the worst animation of all, the designs of the humans and the rest of the products are terrible. The jokes like i say, sometimes fail and when they are not funny, they suck. And all the orgy scene was the most boring scene of the movie. Is not funny or interesting so it doesn't have a purpose to be in the movie. So yeah, Sausage Party is not the best animated film of all, but is just good. I hope the animators get some justice for the idiot director Greg Tiernan who his role as a director of this one is terrible. Conrad Vernon makes a better job that him. For those who are interesting in this, i tell you that this is good for you if you are more that 16 years old to see this. For those who think is a kids film, don't be so idiots. This is a RATED R Movie. So don't show this for your kids until they have 16 years.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

"nooodahl","1","8","20","21 August 2016"," This is Absolutely Horrible
","I wanted to like this movie, but I was horribly disappointed. There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. The ""comedy"" in this is purely profanity and terrible attempts at innuendos. This seems like it was written by a bunch of 5th and 6th graders who just learned what sex is.<br/><br/>Also, a plot, an actual plot would have been useful. The ""plot"" this movie has is more of a plot device to allow more uses of profanities and sex jokes.<br/><br/>Then there's the problem with the suspension of disbelief, which just is down right impossible in this movie. Food items can move and exist in the real world, but their movements are completely imperceptible to the people unless the people are high on bath salts? Then, suddenly, food can maim and/or kill them? How does that even work? Shouldn't the food have been able to do that either way? As for the food itself, some items are individually sentient (like the buns, hot dogs, and baby carrots), others are sentient as the collective (a bag of chips), and others are sentient in both stages (the Mentos and possibly pizza). Why does a bag of chips die but only individual carrots do? Also, at what point does the food become sentient? And how can items be pre-packaged, yet have no understanding of what happens to them in the outside world? Moreover, how exactly do they ignore what's going on in the deli or bakery? Do they ignore people ""taste testing"" grapes as well? I just don't understand how they can live in this ""utopian society"" where ""everything is perfect on the outside"" if they live in a place where they can witness their kind being destroyed.<br/><br/>Beyond the suspension of disbelief, we come to the problem of sex. If you took sex out of this movie, you'd have a bunch of characters swearing and some ""war zone"" scenes. Everything else in this movie is about sex. I mean, the douche rapes 2 different characters, there's an all out orgy at the end, and every interaction at least hints at sex/rape/the ""archaic beliefs surrounding purity."""

The animation is very well done even if I feel sorry for those poor animators. Their sanity will be missed. The voice acting is pretty good even if some voices felt weird over their respective characters. It was interesting to see how lip syncing worked with food. Each and every single character is fun and unique and while they fall into stereotypes they still do great job making you laugh and driving the story. I love the contrast between what humans see and what the food sees. It showed the bland tastelessness of reality and the bright colourful world the food believes it to be. The villains is amazing. I love the satirical outlook on out world and religion, politics and cultural conflicts.<br/><br/>Bad: Obviously, it is a comedy so many will not like it especially if very vulgar dialogue and actions are not your favourite thing ever. I wasn't a huge fan of the music and it just felt like a punchline rather than a soundtrack. Despite this, I can not deny the awesomeness that is Meatloaf. I also hated the ending and though it was sequel baiting. It may have been a joke but I still hate the prospect of any movie sequel baiting. You NEED to shut your brain of because if you even think for a second about the movement, the plot and some moments you would turn it off instantly. The plot wasn't bad perse however it made no sense in the terms of the movie. The main humour in the movie is hearing food curse.

They, along with thousands of other foods, live a happy and carefree life in the store, believing that one day, a human will pick them up and take them to food heaven where they will be set free and all will be well. But when a few food products who managed to escape the carnage that awaits food in the hands of humans comes back to the store and tells of the horrors they experienced, panic quickly spreads, forcing the foods to either deny what their true fate is, or fight the humans in an all out war for survival.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Sausage Party"" is the scene when the food products that have been bought by a shopper get a shocking and brutal reality check of what the purpose of food is.<br/><br/>As with most Seth Rogen movies, this is not just about gross-out, crude jokes. ""Sausage Party"" does have a heart, too; and makes some commentaries on prejudice and tolerance and acceptanceit just does it in mostly disgusting, but funny, ways.

Well it is, but this makes this animation, which is nothing else than a filthy mouthed and erotic parody, an enjoyable watch for almost any adult. Be aware though, this movie should never be seen by any child as is content is way beyond what he or she would be allowed to see until they're 18+. Although it uses the F word as it was trying to break a record, it has a stupid plot and some idiotic characters and almost every scene features something erotic, it manages to be enjoyable until the end. It is also very funny due to its stupidity, grabbing very often a laugh from your amazed figure.<br/><br/>You have two options when it comes to this movie. Either you have some expectations from it, case in which you'll be very disappointed and you will hate it no matter what, either you'll treat it as a laugh like I did, and enjoy it overall. I cannot recommend it to anyone unless we're talking about an adult who doesn't get easily offended by swears, who is able to take a dirty joke and find something funny about it. In case you're this type of person, you'll find it quite enjoyablesomething like a guilty pleasure!"
"charliep14","8","4","8","13 November 2016"," This is NOT a kid's movie
","I went into the movie cold, with no idea what to expect and... wow. Sausage party is offensive, it's lewd and... it's also very very funny.<br/><br/>Most people expect a certain level of decorum when watching a cartoon and this movie just goes completely against that. It's shocking more in what the movie chooses to show rather than what it says and it is shocking because, yeah, it's a cartoon.<br/><br/>It's a rare thing to laugh so much. You will need to switch on your teenager stoner sense of humor but, it is funny. Honestly, it just is! It is incredibly immature and yes it is somewhat offensive and hardcore but it's funny. When was the last time a movie made you laugh and go ""WOW I can't believe they went that far"" straight for 90mn?<br/><br/>Super star cast, Salma Hayek as the lesbian taco is the best - just keep the kids away."

","Nonetheless it is a fascinating watch because it brings common food items potatoes, sausages, buns, juice cartons, bagels etc., etc., to life with a voice and mind of their own. <br/><br/>These days people are sexually open so we see references to homosexuality and lesbianism in the film. There are also graphic sex scenes played out at various points in the film. The use of the ""F"" word is predominant throughout the film alongside other use of slang. There are also few scenes of gore.<br/><br/>Plot in brief: In a supermarket called Shopwell's, the foods and other grocery items who live there worship the human shoppers as gods who take them to the ""Great Beyond"" when they are purchased. Among the groceries in the store is a sausage named Frank (Seth Rogen), who has dreams of living with his hot dog bun girlfriend, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), in the Great Beyond, where they can finally consummate their relationship. Frank lives in a package with his best friends Barry (Michael Cera), Carl (Jonah Hill) and Troy (Anders Holm), who also look forward to life in the Great Beyond.<br/><br/>Frank and Brenda's packages are chosen to leave Shopwell's, but their celebrations are cut short when a returned jar of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who has also been chosen, claims to other groceries in the shopping cart that the Great Beyond is not what they were led to believe. Before committing suicide, Honey Mustard tells Frank to visit a bottle of liquor named Firewater (Bill Hader), who is purportedly knowledgeable about the Great Beyond, so he can learn the truth.<br/><br/>Watch the film to find out what happens next...<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the animation is brilliant and there are many hilarious scenes in the film. But all this is overshadowed by the vulgarity which could have been watered down.<br/><br/>Better animated films to watch(non CGI): Watership Down(1978), The Secret of NIMH(1982), The Plague Dogs(1982), The Great Mouse Detective(1986), Grave of the Fireflies(1988), The Secret World Of Arrietty(2010 based The Borrowers written by Mary Norton).<br/><br/>I also recommend Mary And Max(2009) which is a stop-motion animated movie and a short animated film The Snowman(1982)."

"ericstevenson","8","4","8","9 September 2016"," More than just cartoon characters swearing
","This movie was advertised as the first R-rated CGI movie. It wasn't done quite as blatantly as something like ""Fritz The Cat"", the first X-rated cartoon period. I was hoping they might toss in some reference to that, but they didn't. It's probably just as well, as this film is enjoyable in its own right. It did set a new world record for most swearing in an animated movie beating out ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut"". I seriously wonder if Trey Parker and Matt Stone want Jonah Hill to die. A few people who worked on the film were actually mad they weren't in the credits. No wonder there was so much swearing.<br/><br/>The biggest appeal for this was that it was an anticipated movie not based on anything or a sequel or remake. The door IS in fact left open for a sequel, albeit in the strangest way possible. What you appreciate about this film is that the animation really IS very well done. I couldn't help but be reminded of one of my favorite shows ""The Amazing World Of Gumball"", another cartoon version of talking objects. It seems like every cartoon nowadays has talking inanimate objects and/or lesbians. Yep, this has both! I knew they'd do the obvious joke of the taco being one.<br/><br/>What's good about the movie is that a lot of creative ideas are really put out well. We see the different kinds of food and personalities and how they interact with the world. This is a movie that does all it can with its creativity. Now, I will admit that I don't like the ending that much. It features the food fighting and killing the humans. The thing is, the humans were just trying to eat food. I mean, that's what ALL living organisms must do in order to survive. Are humans just supposed to starve to death in this movie's universe? It seems like they could have resolved it better, with some compromise. Still, this is a movie worth your time. ***"

"davispittman","6","2","3","13 April 2017"," Never seen anything like this before....
","Prepare thyself. Sausage Party is unlike anything anyone has ever seen. This animated comedy is HARD R rated. By far the most explicit adult animation ever made. So please if you're going to watch then don't allow the children to be in on it. The movie starts off at a supermarket where we see all kinds of food items singing a song praising the ""gods"" (humans), because they believe the ""gods"" are good and nice and will give them everything they've ever dreamed of in ""the great beyond"". They all believe that ""the great beyond"" is when humans purchase them and bring them home with them. They soon find out though that this fantasy is completely false. The main characters are Frank the sausage (Seth Rogen) and Brenda the Bun (Kristen Wiig). They are in love and I liked wiig and rogen voicing them, good casting. All the hot dog wieners want to ""fill"" the hot dog buns in the great beyond. Fancy way of saying they want to have sex and lots of it. The comedy in the film is pretty hit and miss lots of the time. The movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes and I laughed three times. That is why I say it's hit and miss. The majority of the comedy stems from extremely crass/crude material, and very sexually explicit material as well. Sexual jokes and potty humor abounds. And so does profanity. F**k, s**t, c**k, c**t, absolutely nothing is left unused as far as cursing goes, so just be prepared and know that that's what you're in for with Sausage Party. I didn't mind the cursing at all, I never really do with any movie, although I did mind the unoriginality to a lot of the comedy. A lot of the comedy is just very middle school, I think a lot of the times the writers just injected extreme cursing to get laughs. And that just wasn't very funny. I liked the characters and I thought the movie was funny a few times. Another thing I liked was how they handled the plot, it was surprisingly thought provoking. It's all about questioning what you've been fed as far as religion goes, actually looking into things for yourself, not just believing something blindly. And that's a good lesson. But then.... after a good message at its heart is displayed, there's a full fledged food orgy. Complete with thrusting, moaning, masturbation, BDSM, oral sex, and other stuff.... With all of this considered I give Sausage Party a 6/10. A few funny moments and some good characters, but there are better options."
"ragpap93","8","2","3","8 February 2017"," Climax!!
","First of all never going to look at food the same way again. So its racist and offensive to everyone but it is hilarious. Some may say that it is immature. Hell yes it is. Seriously you should be at least 16 or 18 to view this. The ceiling is 30 as it may seem too crass and vulgar for those who watch 'Downtown Abbey', there is no problem in that because it is quite a good show.<br/><br/>A man-child like myself, would want some crackers with my cup of tea. I have watched 'Food fight', which is in the IMDb bottom 100. This is far superior than that garbage. The puns were better here. Some puns were misses. <br/><br/>Parts where I cringed were like the scene that may portray rape. One should hope that the audience is educated enough and not easily influenced by what they watch on TV. If someone does get influenced in the belief that 'rape is okay' from an animated movie about food items then he was a pervert to begin with. It is similar to the belief that 'women wearing provocative clothes are asking for it' and those who think that are medieval misogynists.<br/><br/>The other part was the bagel and falafel scene (but that is just me, I maybe slightly homophobic), the orgy at the climax and most importantly gum.<br/><br/>If Stephen Hawking gets offended by it then I would take his side on the lawsuit. A perfect description as per wiki is 'Gum, a Stephen Hawking-esque bubble gum wad in a high-tech wheelchair'. However it is a perfect metaphor for his condition, like being chewed up and spit out by the gods. If it weren't for that I would be giving this a ten but that is my opinion. So it is okay if people hate it or think it is a ten."
"paul-allaer","8","2","3","6 February 2017"," Zany, irreverent, and foul: an all-star voice cast more than delivers
","""Sausage Party"" (2016 release; 88 min.) brings the story of a group of grocery store food items. As the movie opens 9with a glorious opening song), we get to know Frank Wienerton, a sausage, and his friends. They are all hoping that today will be the day that a customer will choose them, so that they can 'go to the great beyond"" (i.e. leave the grocery store). Then one day, indeed Frank and a bunch of other food items are picked and tossed in a grocery cart, only to see things go wrong at the last minute. Is Frank stuck in the grocery store? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie is the brain child of Seth Rogen, who has for years been trying to bring this story to the big screen. Now finally a studio decided to fund it, and Rogen and his circle of friends came up with this zany, energy-jumping, extremely raunchy adult cartoon. ""We keep our wiener in our packages"", screams one of the sausages, and that's one of the more benign sexual double-entendres that pepper the movie. I assume you know yourself better than anyone else, so if this is going to bother you, do yourself a favor and stay away from this. I don't understand the many screaming headlines in other reviews that this is not for kids. The movie is rated R, so why would anyone even think about having kids watch this? The movie sports an incredible all-star voice cast: besides Rogen himself (in not one but two voice roles), there are Kirsten Wiig (as Rogen's girlfriend Brenda), Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, James Franco, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and many more. I mentioned the rounding opening musical number, and as it turns out the music is from none other than multiple Oscar and Grammy award winning composer Alan Menken, as well as Christopher Lennertz.<br/><br/>Bottom line: ""Sausage Party"" is not for everyone. But if this is something that you think you might enjoy, it doesn't get much better than this this. The movie did much better than expected at the box office, and Rogen has already been quoted as saying he's been thinking about a sequel. Can't wait for that: ""Sausage Party 2: The Wiener Works""?"

Like a compilation of subconscious repressed thoughts unleashed into the wild. Food porn gets onto a new meaning here, or perhaps not.<br/><br/>The idea is ingenious, albeit irreverent, the animation is fun and perfect for the story, the dialogues are witty (plenty of puns!) and some of the scenes and dialogues are hilarious.<br/><br/>This came out of the mind of some 'sick' people, for sure, thank you guys! It is very funny, gross funny. Not for children, not for sensitive watchers, not for people who don't like gross humour a priori.<br/><br/>A truly enjoyable film if you are the target of the movie.

"ktnguye","8","2","3","13 December 2016"," Really good movie if you are into crude and immature jokes.
","As the movie title and cover clearly portrays the type of film it will be, it succeeds in showing many inappropriate jokes throughout the movie. Although the jokes are not all about sex, it pokes a lot of other topics too. If you think about the script, they've been able to make fun of many topics and they should be applauded for that. They make fun of religion, drug users, men, women, Indians, gays and much more. Although the humor isn't for everyone, the plot is rather interesting by deciding to present what food would be like if they were alive is an interesting path to take. The characters are all distinct and are remembered. The main antagonist is surprisingly not one of the humans but actually another inanimate object which is a douche and ironically he is quite a douche in the movie which I found to be quite clever on the scriptwriters.<br/><br/>With all of the good things said, the movie isn't perfect. In the near end of the movie, they take the literal use of the term ""food porn"" and it can be quite cringing especially of how long they drag out the scene. While there are plenty of inappropriate jokes throughout the movie, they are not afraid to be a bit controversial in some sections of the movie. Two scenes stuck out the most and one involved with the debate of reality verses religion. While the other scene can lead viewers to have uncomfortably witness a murder and rape. In terms of any sexual jokes, they seem to be really written by a 15 year old and it can push some of the mature adults away but the movie seems to really target young adults that seem to love sex jokes and are more open minded about everything. In fact I believe this movie is really intended for a small minority as the writers have essentially put up jokes that can offend anyone. If you have seen the trailers, you should know what to expect from the movie but for those who haven't, you'll be very disappointed and worse if you brought children to see this movie under the assumption that animated movies are meant for kids and that is the worst mistake that some one can make for a movie like this. In the end, if you've looked into the trailers and realize that it is a rated R movie you should know what to expect out of this movie"

","Ok, with Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg involved you should be more than well aware of what this could and might be like. Imagine that and then times it by ten, twice for good measure. Sausage Party is funny, offensive, unbelievable, racist and downright not morally correct, all rolled together into a crazy animated film where anything goes (literally).<br/><br/>Within Shopwell supermarket (and perhaps everywhere else?) the food is all alive (unbeknownst to us, ala Toy Story) and they are all waiting to be picked by the God's (us) to be taken out into the great beyond. There apparently is no greater thing in life for our dairy, vegetables and other food products. Well, except maybe for sex, and lots of it for hotdog sausage Frank (Rogen) and vagina shaped bun Brenda (Wiig). Next to each other on the shelf due to a promotion, they can think of nothing else but finally being able to slip into each other...anyway.<br/><br/>When a product is returned and speaks of the terrifying truth about the great beyond, it is up to our band of heroic food products to find out the truth. Add in a sex starved lesbian taco, two racists in the forms of a bagel and a lavash, pot smoking non-perishables and you can probably see where it is all heading. The story itself along with the animation quality would be worthy of Dreamworks or Pixar, if it was aimed at kids. Which it is not. Definitely not.<br/><br/>The script and voice acting are reasonable if nothing exciting, with very few star names in my opinion. The use of the f-bomb repeatedly in the beginning of the film grows old very quickly and if toilet humour is not your thing (along with the language) then I'd suggest steering clear. If you wish to see something quite unlike anything you've ever seen before (and keep watching out of amazement at what they included) then sausage Party will most likely tickle your funny bone.<br/><br/>Overall Sausage Party is funny in places. It is also highly offensive to pretty much everyone, implies every stereotype under the sun and has some form of sex joke every few minutes. Some of these work and some miss the mark due to repetition. Vulgar, crude and very stupid, at times you will be open-jawed at their sheer audacity. Not a film for everyone.<br/><br/>The Sage's Rating: 6/10"

","This movie really took food to a different level. I really appreciate this, because my own personal beliefs have dictated that everything has a living space within our lives. This movie elaborated on that, in the essence that, all of what we do and think and feel within a supermarket is within a grasp of reality that is not easily obtained by sheer logistic measure. I'm not saying that things in the supermarket are alive or dead. But what I am saying, from a consumer point of view, is that we are all much better off with our ability to just grab and go then we might realize. This cartoon is original, and you haven't seen anything like it before. It contains adult context and the ability to entertain at the same time. Was it meant to be a movie on your shelf? No, but it was meant to appeal to you as an adult. Children should not watch this movie, and you should make it your mission to make sure that they don't! This was made for us, as adults, by an adult, who is a stoner, and literally appeals to over 28 of the 50 states in America. I thought it was hilarious, I thought it was original, I thought it was really bending the ideas of reality through pure artistic expression through the staircase that is ""adulthood,"" and that expression might have been very ""adult"" at the time, but it mimics our captivity as adults in life as we know it; Constantly struggling to find comfort in the situation at hand-as is ""Life."""
"thescholar22","6","1","1","30 October 2019"," It was okay, sad how the animators were mistreated behind the scenes.
","As kind of excited at the concept of this movie since there isn't many adult animated movies anymore now. Even the animated movies for kids can feel like they're not trying at times. People say ""It's just for kids!"" but just because it's for kids doesn't mean you don't have to try. Also saw this pitch meeting sketch from Screenrant just to see what I'm getting into and it feels like this movie is pretty basic for a adult animated cartoon. Onto the review now.<br/><br/>The movie starts with this supermarket and the food sing this song to start the day about going to ""The Great Beyond"" when they're chosen. There's also this sausage named Frank and this bun Brenda who want to have sex but can't until they get to the great beyond. Then there's this jar of honey mustard saying that the great beyond is a lie and the gods eat them.<br/><br/>There's also this douche that's basically a jerk or a douche as people would put it. Then they meet a bagel that's Jewish and a falafel that's Arab and they all make it to the liqueur section of the store. There they meet a Native American whiskey called Fire Water, some grits that's black and hates crackers, and a Twinkie that's gay. The fruits are also gay as well and later in the movie there's this toilet paper and a condom that talk as well. There's also this taco played by Selma Hayek and she's a lesbian and likes Brenda. Also this piece of gum that's kind of like Stephen Hawking too.<br/><br/>Around the end the food find out that the people they thought were gods can die. So they end up killing the people in the store and after that the food has this big orgy. It does't look that graphic, then again I've seen hentai so it felt tame to me. At then end they make this stargate to try and go to the human dimension, maybe hoping for a sequel.<br/><br/>This movie felt okay but I heard behind the scenes the animators were mistreated and forced to work overtime without play. Hearing that it just makes me wonder about the animation industry in general now since people seem to rush this all in. Also seem to rely more on nostalgic cartoon reboots and intellectual properties. The reboots then just feel like they are the exact opposite of when the original or what the cartoon was about and that's kind of sad. Anyway give this a watch if you want but it doesn't seem to be TO deep like other adult shows now. There's just so many food puns and curse words you can say until it gets real old too fast."

","...to be edgy or offensive, and it shows. A lot of it flowed naturally and worked fine. But closer to a quarter of the film was A Bit that was specifically sexual, or racist, or whatever, never meshed with the rest of it, interrupted the action, and usually wasn't even especially funny.<br/><br/>Also didn't like any of the Explain What Is Happening. 4th dimension? And people high enough can see them then? No. Bad idea.<br/><br/>Wish I could just hate it, but the core was pretty good. A sort of fully-horrifying version of Toy Story 2, with a secret life under our noses, and a terrible truth to it. Liked the premise, liked the parts that stuck to telling that story.

","Frank (a sausage) and Betty (a bun) are looking forward to finally getting more than just tips together when they are purchased, and get to go to the Great Beyond. Yet there are rumours that the Great Beyond is a lie, and that horror and death await. And, worse, it turns out that the rumours are true!<br/><br/>Sausage Party is a CGI movie which combines a story based on a pleasing and very silly ""what if?"" (""what if your food was actually alive?"") and Seth Rogen's crew of the usual suspects, both writers and performers. This means that is delivered with a healthy (or perhaps unhealthy) dose of pure filth - toilet humour, profanity, drugs and sex.<br/><br/>Let's make no bones about it: much of what we see is infantile, and designed to shock and outrage, as anyone who was seen any of Rogen's work will already know. Having said that, it's pretty funny stuff, well animated and voiced, and a much needed antidote to the mostly squeaky-clean CGI features which come out from Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks et al.<br/><br/>And it has a bit of substance, too. Lavash (Arabic unleavened bread) and Jewish Sammy the bagel are at odds, what with being stocked next to each other. When Lavash is confronted with the unpleasant truth that he will not be presented with unlimited virgin olive oil on arriving in the Great Beyond, why, the obvious solution is masses of joyous gay sex, isn't it? I'm not sure if this is the most profound commentary on the Middle East problem I've ever encountered, or the most ridiculous and depraved. It is possibly both. But it also shows that there is more to this silly, silly, crude, crass and very funny film than meets the eye.<br/><br/>The film finishes with a comprehensive orgy with much imaginative comestible copulation, and a final metafictional resolution, and I walked out chuckling while wondering what the hell it was I had just seen."

"gavinp9","6","1","1","2 January 2018"," Crazy - in a mostly good way
","'Sausage Party' is... well, just plain nuts! Probably the best description is ""absurd"". It's certainly unique, being the first 'adult' GCI film (not just a cartoon like the 'South Park' movie) and it does all it can to push the boundaries of making sure you remember it's not a kids film (even though it starts with a song), with so many swear words, racial stereotypes, sexual innuendo and drugs in the first 30min that you can't forget it's a Seth Rogen film. Frank (the sausage, Rogen) and his girlfriend Brenda (the bun, Wiig) can't wait to get out of their packages and be united in the ""Great Beyond"" outside the supermarket.<br/><br/>When Barry (Cera) and Carl (Hill), Frank's sausage buddies, are bought and find out the truth of what happens to food, they try to return to warn the others. The voice actors are great - Sammy (bagel, Norton), Lavash (Krumholtz), Teresa (taco, Hayek), Douche (Kroll), Firewater (Hader), Grits (Robinson), Honey mustard (McBride). It's part road trip, part action/'Die Hard' and part stoner rom-com. The ""human world"" vs ""food world"" distinction is done well, with faded colour vs vibrancy. Some of Rogen's almost-sermons on not following the religious crap you're fed without proof is good, but the anti-religion message is lost in the chaos.<br/><br/>It's not as uproarious as I was hoping - it's certainly funny and has a lot of chuckles, but there wasn't many truly hilarious moments for me. Part of that is my expectations being too high - I've been waiting for this film for three years and it's nowhere near as good as 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' or 'Pineapple Express'. Some of the best bits are the morbid/violent bits, not necessarily the dialogue. The last 20min or so didn't really work for me - a bit too much. There's so much going on and so many things to look at and listen to that some jokes are lost or skipped over."

I just found the film a tad boring overall, the jokes are very blatant and predictable, though I feel they missed a few ways to improve some of the jokes in the script. Overall, the composition, framing, colour palette and music in this film are great and stereotypical, but it does provide an opponent to an animated Disney movie if the script was more interesting but for adults, obviously. Not quite up there with Pixar though!"

Another reviewer correctly called this out on its ""jokes"" and obscenity. Although if you are offended by the first couple of minutes and innuendos, than you better not watch until the end. The last 10 minutes or so went places ... all at once. Even though it wasn't being soft before, this really went way overboard. So if you can lower everything down (pun intended) and just let yourself slide into this ... experience, you might be able to have fun with it.

","Sausage Party was something I wanted to see for a long time; an R-rated computer animated (CGI) movie. It involves food products in a supermarket who believe that they are taken by ""Gods"" (human beings, shoppers) to the ""Great Beyond"" (which is paradise for them).<br/><br/>A sausage named Frank is in love with a bun named Brenda, they (along with friends, quirky Carl and the small and short Barry) are taken to the ""Great Beyond"" by a woman named Camille Toh... but a returned Honey Mustard warns the disbelieving foods (with the exception of Frank) that the Great Beyond is not what they believe it to be. This culminates in Frank failing to save the suicidal Honey Mustard and him, Brenda, and a few other foods falling out of the cart. What goes on from here is strange, intense, and on the occasion funny.<br/><br/>The ending... I don't want to get into the ending.<br/><br/>The movie is admittedly funny as I do laugh at some of the jokes here and there and the kitchen scene in which the remaining shopping cart foods are most certainly screwed. But the excessive swearing (the first couple of lines remind me of the beginning of South Park's first episode, which is a bad thing mind you) and lame food puns ruin the comedy for me and the plot could've been amazing if Frank and Brenda were with Barry on the way to the house or otherwise.<br/><br/>The movie is okay and great, but it could've been improved with less language and more mature themes. The ending was also weird, disgusting, and strange but I can't really criticise it."

If you're going to try to take this movie seriously in any way, you're going to hate it and feel like you wasted your time and money.<br/><br/>So, the movie is quite clever, oddly charming at points, extremely unique and the baseline of the story, however absurd it may be, continuously flows.<br/><br/>As far as the rating, it's a tough one because it can't really be compared head to head with any other movie. It's uniquely entertaining to the right person, its comedy is in its own realm, surely it's not worthy of a rating reserved for truly exceptional movies (7 or higher), but surely it's not worthy of a rating reserved for utter garbage (3 or less).

","When I saw ""Knocked Up"" in 2007, I became a fan of ""Seth Rogan humor"", as I consider that film to be hilarious. Ever since then, I've usually had an ear or eye open when one of his projects comes down the pike. It was that thought process that got me into the theater for ""Sausage Party""...and experience that I sincerely wish I could take back. While perhaps not the worst movie I've EVER seen (but...maybe), it is easily the worst I've ever reviewed here on Amazon.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Sausage Party"" begins like ""Toy Story in the grocery store"", with all the different foods wanting to be ""chosen"" by beings (humans) they believe to be Gods. Frank the hot dog (Rogan) and Brenda the bun (Kristen Wiig) want to be chosen together (for obvious reasons) and that seems to be exactly what happens...until the plan goes awry and they become separated, having to decipher the mystery of ""the great beyond"" for themselves.<br/><br/>I could spend oh so much time painstakingly going over why ""Sausage Party"" is truly an abomination, but I'll boil it down here to three main areas:<br/><br/>1. It's wildly offensive, both in language and tone. I'm not terribly sensitive to the f-bomb being dropped in movies, but when it happens every couple words it is clearly just lazy dialogue. The whole ""we don't have anything really interesting to say, so let's just curse a lot"" sort of mentality. It is also one of the raunchiest films (in terms of content) that I have ever seen. Again, I'm no prude, but every single joke is of the most crass or sexual nature possible. 2. The whole thing wants to work as a critique of organized religion, but it falls flat (again, I think, because the crudity and profanity overshadow everything else). 3. The plot is completely and utterly pointless. It is mainly just these animated characters wandering around and finding themselves in bizarre and gross situations.<br/><br/>Put it this way...as a person who thoroughly enjoys quality cinema, I am able to find not an ounce of redeeming value in this movie. Call me a snob if you will, but I enjoy shows like ""Family Guy"" and other low-brow pursuits. ""Sausage Party"", however, is what happens when you let Seth Rogan take ""stoner humor"" to its maximum (and then beyond).<br/><br/>With the possible exception of ""Dumb and Dumber 2"", this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in the past 2-3 years. Maybe I've seen worse in my lifetime...but maybe I haven't, either."

","As entertaining as it is to watch food be voiced by Seth Rogen's squad, Sausage Party becomes increasingly grotesque and uncomfortable with every scene. Though I will say the ending may be one of 2016's greatest treasures.<br/><br/>Along the same lines as Toy Story and Secret Life of Pets, we just had to know what every type of food and drink were thinking as we grabbed them off the shelf at a market. On paper, this is exactly what I would want Rogen and his writers to tackle. There's something about a sausage and a bun try to escape a market that seemed to fit what Rogen has done in the past. To be fair, they take it in all the directions you would hope they would go and tell all the jokes and innuendos you would expect, but sometimes it's just a little too much.<br/><br/>Filled with endless amounts of talent both voicing and behind the camera, Sausage Party always keeps you entertained. There's never really a dull moment on screen, but as the film progresses, those moments just become overdone gags and jokes that tend to take things just one step too far. It's not that I ever wanted realism with this type of premise, but I would have hoped for a little more subtly in certain areas.<br/><br/>With all this said, I pretty much got out of it exactly what the trailer sold me. Putting aside the amazing Saving Private Ryan tribute that was shown in the trailer, there's plenty of other pop culture and movie references that put a smile on my face as well. Plus, getting Academy Award level talent like Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and composer Alan Menken to come on board this ridiculous romp is pretty dang awesome.<br/><br/>If you liked the trailer, I think you'll enjoy Sausage Party. It's fast paced and has several insane moments that make the theater experience all the more surreal. The gags go on for too long and the story suffers, so it isn't the most even Rogen pic, but it's worth watching for sure.<br/><br/>+Always entertaining<br/><br/>+Movie references and tributes<br/><br/>+Voice talent<br/><br/>-Keeps pushing the same jokes and gags<br/><br/>-A little bit too grotesque<br/><br/>6.5/10"

When I eventually got to watching it through I was not at all entertained but was angry with myself for letting myself watch it through. It went from being plain offensive to absolutely vulgar just for the sake of pushing how far they could go with this movie. Very distasteful and pure garbage.

There are very few actual jokes, and mostly just inappropriate and crass lines of dialogue that feel very, very forced.<br/><br/>The movie relies on the exploitation of racial, religious, cultural and sexual stereotypes that are harmful to their respective communities. There are ways to satirise and poke fun of certain groups that can be done in an amusing and intelligent way... this is not one of them.<br/><br/>The reference to drug use just seems painfully shoved in, and unnecessary. In fact, this whole film is unnecessary. I was waiting for something remotely funny or amusing to happen and I sat through an hour and a half of pure profanity and mindless sludge until the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>Visually I guess the film is impressive- but the character models seem odd and unnatural. I can't fault the animators for this though, given they have to make literal cans of soup into characters. This film should have been stopped as a bad idea on paper long before it proceeded to also be badly executed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I hate myself now. This movie has made me hate myself. I can often laugh at Seth Rogen's comedies; Superbad is a very good film, This Is The End had it's moments and even The Interview had one or two moments that made me smile. This film offers nothing.

"ThatAnimeSnob","8","3","6","25 December 2016"," vulgar, and still makes a point
","Western animation is divided into three types. Most of it is the kid friendly variant with a moral message, some of it is super dark and violent without a message, and there is also this tiny part which finds a way to be dark and have a message. Sausage Party belongs in the third category.<br/><br/>It's easy to say it stands out because they swear a lot and everything is about sex and cartoons are not supposed to be that shocking because they are for kids. That is a superficial quality to attract the casuals, but it doesn't stop there. It's also a social commentary of sorts, expanding to religion and the state of the world today. It sugarcoats it to make seem it's innocent while at the same time not shying away from being vicious about it.<br/><br/>So essentially it's an adult movie, pretending to be childish, pretending to be about adult themes. It's meta squared, shows the middle finger to anything that is politically correct, or afraid of irritating certain groups of people, while at the same time making a point.<br/><br/>There is so much subversion going on in it when it comes to classic story templates, that if you are a pretentious overthinker it's easy to write long essays about it. Starting with the premise which is essentially a parody of utopias turning dystopias, with talking food. Said food is all about food jokes based on where they are produced. And they swear, talk about sex, and wish to find salvation by worshiping the gods that are their creators. Us humans. Who of course do nothing but eating them. And we do not see them talking unless we take a lot of drugs, meaning drugs expand your horizons instead of frying your brain. And then it becomes about homosexuality, and saying no to all social norms. And just about you think it's done, it goes even more meta by openly saying they know they are cartoons, created for entertainment.<br/><br/>Holy hell, that was brilliant. Every time you think the movie ran out of things to show you, it proves you wrong. You are constantly kept engaged without getting the same thing all the time or jumping to something completely different. There is uniformity amongst the various themes, the characters are funny, the food puns are creative, it gives you food for thought without turning the cast into lifeless mouthpieces, the stakes are high, there is no stupid reset in the end to undo the whole conflict with zero repercussions, and for a CGI movie it's well animated. How can I not love it? There is not a single thing I didn't like about it.<br/><br/>This is one of the best animated movies I have seen in my life, it's highly recommended, and it goes instantly into my top cartoons list."

","The makers of the movie proudly proclaim it the first R-rated computer-animated comedy and do not mistake ""Sausage Party"" for a kids' film, regardless of how cute the advertising may appear. The film is not quite smart enough to overcome the clichÃ©s and stereotypes it acknowledges but can't entirely dismantle. A violent, sexy, crazy action about supermarket products that rebel against their human consumers, Sausage Party is one of the funniest and most deeply offensive movies of the year (it's obscenely funny).

"alfiemachin","7","3","6","6 October 2016"," Completely out there comedy
","Good:Sausage party is a completely out there, extremely offensive and hilarious comedy. It takes the innocent feel of a toy story like animation in which food is brought to life. Yet is twisted with adult jokes and some forms of deep relations to real life, especially involving the stereotypical theme of continents each food originates from. The idea itself is genius and brings a new, exciting and different type of comedy we haven't seen. The type of comedy in this film is extremely offensive and doesn't hold back on bad language, sex references, stereotypical forms and utterly weird scenes that leave you thinking how on earth did they come up with that. Admittedly this film definitely wouldn't be enjoyable for everyone but for people like me into dark and over the top humor. Many scenes left me losing my breath from laughter (especially towards the end) and shocked in a brilliant way as to how they came up with such creative and unique jokes. I particularly enjoyed the small backstories as to what the supermarkets were originally like and how they were very much linked to real events such as sauerkraut (a typical German food) being portrayed as Nazis in their past reign.<br/><br/>Bad: Although Seth rogen did a brilliant job at creating this story and hilarious jokes. For me him and many of the other voice actors were not fitting well with their characters. I felt like the larger stars such as Jonah hill were not assigned the right role for their usual style of character. I also felt as if there was very little attention added to the other hot dogs and buns closely involved with the story seeing as they were friends with the two main characters and shown being taken to the customers house to meet their fate.Aside from the comedic scenes created from the plot, i found that the story was very slow going and dragged on a while but was fortunately excelled in the big finale which was brilliantly executed.<br/><br/>Summary: this film is worth the watch unless you are easily offended and will gather a large amount of laughs throughout the film."
"lesleyharris30","7","3","6","10 September 2016"," Though Slow Moving, a Bizarre Plot makes it a Winner,
","Sausage Party is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific voice cast. It is a very strange movie, without a doubt the weirdest one you will see all year, as we follow a group of talking food in a super market who soon learn the truth about their existence, it certainly was special to see an R rated animated film. <br/><br/>The cast is the highlight for me, Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig shine in the lead roles, there is some great, unrecognizable, voice work done by the likes of Edward Norton, Bill Hader, Nick Kroll and Jamee Franco. <br/><br/>The film was, on the other hand, very slow moving, it is mainly set in the supermarket, which can make it feel a bit tiresome, and it tends to go back over the same points over and over again. <br/><br/>It should have been more outlandish, the only scenes that truly deliver the absurdity you would expect was the musical number and the scene at the end, other than that it a bit flat. The humour relied too heavily on sex and drugs, it should put more emphasise on parodying animated Disney films, something that Rogen said the film would do, although the only thing that really did so was the song. <br/><br/>I do feel that this film's success will bringer better projects now that people can see that it is profitable, there is a sequel set up at the end with a plot line that is very meta and exciting, I look forward to seeing what Rogen has up his sleeves. It is more flawed than I would have hoped, but Sausage Party is wildly funny and unlike any other movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>A group of food in a supermarket, waiting to be chosen by the Gods, soon discover the shocking truth of their existence."

","I recently saw a video on YouTube titled "" Werner Heisenberg VS the New Atheist"" and the content of that video summarizes my problems with this movie's take on religion and the Human condition. Anyone who finds this movie to be intellectual or thinks its commentary on religion is ""deep"" seriously has to lay down whatever substance they are on and actually read the history of religion.<br/><br/>In terms of quality, this movie looks like the project of wealthy teens from the Hamptons tasked with making an animated movie on (new) atheism mixed with juvenile humour. The jokes in the movie are plain not funny and just made me cringe throughout the entire movie time. The humour is largely based on less than subtle dick jokes that one would hear in high school emanating from the class clown. I really find it amusing that grown adult film makers wrote and produced this ""comedy"" movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend buying a ticket at full price at the theater to watch this ""comedy"", just wait till it is on Redbox and rent it for a day or two.

","It's not very easy to find words to describe this movie. What is obvious, the World would be a better place without it. In general, I find Seth Rogen as some sort of Anti-Midas. Everything he touches turns into excrement. I read a few reviews of the movie (mostly very negative) but I decided to give it a fair chance. I'm not disturbed about jokes about religion nor am I very uptight about being politically correct. Maybe it's one of those misunderstood movies that are actually really good? Fat chance.<br/><br/>What I, like many other reviewers, noticed first was the excessive use of curse words. Not that I have a problem with strong language but if it doesn't serve any other purpose than shock value, it's just lame. And truly lame it was in this movie. Then came the absurdly bad taste in jokes. Not bad taste in the sense of being vulgar or improper but childish, clichÃ©d and simply stupid. I found penis/gay/racist jokes funny when I was twelve years old but not anymore, sorry. If you're an adult and watching this movie makes you laugh, I warmly suggest you take a good, long look in the mirror.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, there was supposedly a deeper message in the movie about being open-minded and not believing what you're told at face value. It's just as bad as Damon Lindelof's sad dabbling with religious themes. Trying to make a very bad script have more depth by heavy-handedly inserting aspects about religion makes it only cluttered and worse.<br/><br/>I did sit through the movie, mostly because I wondered if there would be even one thing that would make me laugh out loud. There wasn't. I snorted once or twice and that poor a reward is just not enough for the pain of tasting through the whole smorgasbord of absolutely untalented directing.<br/><br/>By idiots for idiots, avoid at all costs."

"MaximumMadness","8","2","4","27 November 2016"," ""Sausage Party""- Clever scripting and amusing high-concept satire overcome the consistently hit-and-miss gags.
","I'm honestly surprised it's taken so long for such a high-concept satire as ""Sausage Party"" to hit the big screens. A hardcore R-rated take on the incredibly popular works of companies like Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks Animation, the film is very much a timely sort-of parody of modern pop-culture giants while at the same time serving as a more broad and biting commentary on concepts like religion and bigotry. It's a film that's surprisingly far more clever than it's raunchy and suggestive title would imply, with plenty to say beneath the bodily function and drug- related gags that take up much of its screen time.<br/><br/>Frank (voiced by co-writer Seth Rogen) is an anthropomorphic hot-dog living a seemingly idyllic existence in a supermarket, where the food view human customers as gods that will take them to a heavenly ""great beyond"" once they are purchased. He is also insanely devoted to his ""girlfriend"", a hot-dog bun next to him on the shelf named Brenda (Kristen Wiig) with whom he hopes to consummate a sexual relationship once they are ""chosen."" (Although it is strictly forbidden for them to do so before they ascend.) However, when a bottle of Honey Mustard reveals to Frank that the ""great beyond"" and indeed their religion as a whole is a lie, and a shopping cart accident flings he and Brenda out onto the floor, the two food items (along with a small supporting cast) go on a journey to learn the truth...<br/><br/>The strength of the film lies in its clever and often shocking use of the computer-animated feature format to tell a fairly relevant and even troubling story using the most unlikely of characters. The film's commentary on blind religious devotion and conflict is actually quite well-developed and very amusing, raising many good points despite the cast being made up of foul-mouthed food-stuffs. Particularly uproarious is an ongoing dig at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict revolving around a lavash and a bagel respectively voiced by David Krumholtz and Edward Norton. (Yes, Edward Norton.) While some have bemoaned that the film- a glorified stoner-comedy filled to burst with sex gags and lowbrow humor- has tried to delve into more subversive and societal commentary, I actually applaud it. Yes, it's treatment of serious subject matter is quite broad and not particularly complex, but I found that it still worked very well and definitely gets you thinking about these matters. And that's nothing to sneeze at. If a talking hot-dog who drops f- bombs like it's nobodies business can actually get an atheist and his religious friends into a healthy and friendly debate as did indeed happen to me and my friends after viewing it, you know the film is doing something right.<br/><br/>The cast and overall production is fairly top notch for the budget level and somewhat notoriously troubled production. Rogen is a capable and very charming lead in much of his work, and that continues here. He gives Frank a likable personality and you want to see him succeed. Wiig is a good bit of fun, particularly when her character is given a great deal of self-doubt as the film reaches its second act. Supporting roles by the likes of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and the aforementioned Krumholtz and Norton are just a blast and add a lot of flavor (bad joke, I know) and laughs to the proceedings. And a surprise supporting role by Salma Hayek as a lesbian taco is a treat all around. Animation is smooth, fluid and nicely stylized, with a good visual aesthetic that is very reminiscent of early CGI animated features. Character design is very simple but elegant. And the limited but highly important song numbers are very tightly written and generally quite amusing.<br/><br/>However, there is one issue that I have to mention, and it's where the film loses major points. And that is the humor, which I just unfortunately found to be a bit too hit-and-miss. When it works, it really works. And there are definitely enough big laughs and soft giggles to make it a worthwhile watch on the whole. But it does falter quite a bit, particularly early on. I know I can't be the only one to find the villain (a literal douche) to be grating and completely unfunny, which is troubling given his amount of screen time. (And yes, I understand that he's supposed to be unlikable... but he should still be able to get a chuckle out of the audience here and there.) A bizarre gag involving the song ""I Would Do Anything for Love"" seems very forced and out of left field. And it does take a bit too long for the major laughs to set in.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film's wonderful satirical elements keep the audience invested long enough for the story and the humor to hit its stride, and eventually the laughs do start to come at a mile-a- minute once the first act wraps up. And once it gets going, there's no stopping it. ""Sausage Party"" might be a bit of a troubled comedy due to a number of flat jokes early on, but its easily elevated thanks to the clever writing and bizarrely complex commentary that the script so excels at. While it might not go down as one of Seth Rogen's funniest films, it's still a great addition to his ever-growing body of work, and has a lot to say about the world behind all of the zany gags and foul jokes. And so I give it a good 8 out of 10. Definitely worth checking out."

If not that, the desire to experience what it's like to see the world through Stephen Hawking's brain when really f'k'n' high.<br/><br/>What's wrong with it?

If someone starts talking about how it's too offensive or doesn't find it at least somewhat funny. Well, that's how you know who you want to hang out with. It is funny to see how the reviews for this movie fluctuate so much, and that is not a coincidence.<br/><br/>The plot feels loose. Seems like it was never very important. The makers had a few scenes or dirty jokes they wanted to make and they loosely wrapped them together with a single premise: what if food products didn't know what happens to them after a human buys them. Mostly, this movie is a vulgar racist d*ck joke, and what sells the said d*ck joke is the creative animation and good delivery.<br/><br/>The humour is a bit hit and miss, yes, that is true. Mostly it's blunt. The largest part of the entertainment value is in the degree of the vulgarity and bluntness. If you do not think that this extreme can be funny on its own then this is movie is probably not for you (and I'm sorry, but we can't be friends).<br/><br/>Is this movie worth watching more than once? No. Is it funny? In the case of this movie, it really depends on your sense of humour.<br/><br/>By the way, I don't understand how The Interview got the same score as this movie.

","How many R rated animated films have you seen? This is not a hentai, but the Hollywood's rare animated-adult-comedy. Most of the big names are here, especially the young generation. The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product.<br/><br/>If you check the last two decade's records, the animation films tore apart the live-action films in the box office clash. It is shocking, but the fact that animations make good revenue. This film is a trend setter in animation genre that targets the adult audience. Like Hollywood found its counterpart from the Japanese hentai. It just cost only $20 million to make and the production quality was not very standard, but acceptable. Hope there will be more like this in the future, but I would seek a sequel for this.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen was the main man behind this film. The rest of the cast too was good. Nothing but theirs voice lending made all the difference, especially you would know who were who, while a watch, that kind of familiar it was. The story of supermarket products from all the categories who fight for their freedom.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed, it was short too, as well as a fast narration with some good adult jokes. There are a couple of negatives about it, like the first one was there's no innovation in it, like it is very familiar, but a different kind of comedy. And the next one was all the characters, I mean the supermarket products are American. So if you are a non-American, nearly 90 per cent you won't get what those items are. The adults should watch this, because I don't know when you will get another one like this in the future. So I definitely favour it.<br/><br/>7/10"
"taryllsbaker","7","2","4","19 September 2016"," Truly shocking in the best of ways.
","Sausage Party is directed by Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernon and stars Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Michael Cera, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd & Edward Norton.<br/><br/>A sausage strives to discover the truth about his existence.<br/><br/>Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are one of the best duos in comedy filmmaking. Their humour is focused heavily on gross-out situations, over-the-top performances and somewhat relatable characters. Having watched their movies - Superbad, Pineapple Express & This Is The End, for example - many times, I knew I had to see this. I was not disappointed. Sausage Party features all of the crazy stuff you'd come to expect from the duo, yet packing in moments that will genuinely surprise you.<br/><br/>The writing is ridiculously fun, fast-paced and outrageous. I think partly what makes it so much more enjoyable is the animation. It's supposed to look and feel like a children's movie, but you couldn't be more wrong. With the ecstatic performances from all the cast throughout, it delivers for the most part. Though a majority of the jokes are brilliant, there were moments were it seemed unimaginative, almost bland in taste. That said, seconds later another character will jump in to save the scene. So although it's not completely fluent in translation, it's a fairly decent comedy flick.<br/><br/>Music by Christopher Lennertz & Alan Menken is pretty average, though you couldn't ask for more with such a movie. The opening song/theme is tightly written and composed, introducing you to the world our characters live in very nicely. Overall, an unnoticeable addition to the feature, but by no means a bad one. Lennertz is actually one of the best composers in the comedy genre, so whoever was in control and made that decision did a good job.<br/><br/>Highlighting Seth, Kristen and Jonah for their seemingly 'off-the-cuff' portrayals, absolutely stealing the show and bringing the laughs. From the beginning to end, these characters truly shocking in the best of ways. I advise against watching the trailers, as a few of the better scenes are featured, however this won't completely ruin the surprise. There's still a lot of crazy, disgusting, vulgar writing by Seth, Evan and Jonah that must be experienced. I use those descriptive words in the 'pre-eminent' sense.<br/><br/>This movie definitely isn't for everyone, but fans of Rogen & Goldberg will almost certainly approve.<br/><br/>Verdict; Sausage Party is an extremely unique take on the comedy genre and while sometimes the humour may lack, the story, somewhat ostentatious animation and shocking pay-off will leave you with some confusing afterthoughts whilst grinning.<br/><br/>Sausage Party, 7/10."

You and me.<br/><br/>Brenda: I'm so happy, the Gods put our packages together.<br/><br/>Frank: Because, we belong together.<br/><br/>Brenda: It's like, we were made for each other.<br/><br/>I want to start out by saying those who have not liked Rogen's films in the past will not find anything to like in this film, but those going into the film with an idea of what to expect will probably enjoy this film thoroughly. With that said, I would not pay to see this movie but I know a majority of movie-goers would pay to see it twice.<br/><br/>Rogen tops many of his other films in the past when it comes to vulgar, profanity, crude and just plain gross out comedy with this film. You must know that this will be one of the most sexual elicit films you will see, topping Rogen's past film Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Their were plenty of jokes that were funny on every level, it just so happens I'm not on most of those levels. The homages to Saving Private Ryan and other films was great to see. Although the animation was not the best, it wasn't distracting or bad overall and doesn't take away from the film. Rogen Incorporated segregation, racial stereo-types, cultural differences and human history in genius ways here.<br/><br/>The things I couldn't chew on was a scene where the douche ""gives head to a juice box"". This scene looked way to much like rape and murder than it did sucking the juice out of a juice box and that resonated with me in a terrible way. Another thing, the beginning song had so much profanity when it had so much creativity. It seemed like the song writer Alan Menken known for songs such as ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" tried to hard to fit in profanity just for laughs and it didn't actually add to the music. The profanity used in this film just seemed like lazy script writing or an attempt in getting extra laughs from the audience from food cursing so much. Which is disappointing because the script was overall well written. Lastly, the end scene was just way over the top for me. Without giving much detail, it was a sexual orgy that I didn't find funny or want to see.<br/><br/>Like I said when I started this review. If you have liked Rogen's films before than you will laugh a lot, but if you are not into raunchy comedies, then stay away from this one because it is one of the most throw it in your face kind of raunchy films that I've seen. I would've given this film a higher rating if these last few pointers were omitted from the film. But then, that wouldn't be the film they were trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>Hence the rating, not based on how much I liked it but based on the type of film that it is supposed to be."

","When I first saw this film being advertised in the cinema I simply wrote it off as being another one of those animated kid's films. It's not, and I certainly wouldn't be recommending people take their kids to see it. In fact when you see Seth Rogan's name attached to such as film, along with the actors that tend to congregate around him, then you sort of can sort of expect what it is going to be about. In fact, the innuendo in this film comes thick and fast, and honestly, looking at the title, I probably should have expected it when I first saw the poster. Oh, and the film is also full of expletives, particularly in the first couple of minutes.<br/><br/>Yeah, this film could be considered to be a send up of all of those animated kids films that float around the cinemaspehere. Basically it takes the concepts of giving inanimate objects life, and does it with food. That doesn't sound too odd, except the main character is a sausage, and the heroine is a bun, and if you look at one of the posters you might actually start to realise what they are suggesting. Honestly, I'm quite surprised that it went right over my head at the time, because that poster is pretty suggestive (and I suspect that there were a lot of innocent kids wanting to see the film, without knowing what the poster was actually referring to).<br/><br/>So, the film is about a sausage named Barry and a bun named Brenda. They are sitting on the shelf waiting to be picked up and taken to the great beyond, where they will live in harmony. Mind you, we all know what happens to food when they get taken out of the store, but the food doesn't, having been given this religion to keep them in hope. Mind you, there are also the ones that end up in the bin because they have gone stale, so there is that as well. However, what happens is that they are picked up, and there is a shopping trolley accident and Brenda and Frank end up on the floor, and thus go on a quest to return to their shelf in the hope that they can get into another package and go to the great beyond.<br/><br/>There is so much in this film that pokes fun at literally everything. Like you have this bagel named Sammy Bagel Jr, and this Havash. Now, these characters are implied to be Jewish and Muslim, and of course there is this argument over the fact that the bagels have taken over the part of the store where the Havash and his ilk live (no doubt a reference to the ongoing Israel/Palestinian conflict). Further down the track we have this firewater, which is supposed to be an Indian due to the comments of his land being taken away. In fact, he hides in this cave with other imperishables, that appear to represent oppressed minorities.<br/><br/>Yeah, this film is actually pretty clever, and offensive as well. It certainly does poke fun at religion, especially since I would be one to agree that religion is used to control people. The idea in this film was that the food were always terrified when they were taken because they knew that they were going to be killed, so the religion of the Great Beyond was created to calm those fears. Of course, when people end up coming back from the Great Beyond, they have stories of what is really going on.<br/><br/>Mind you, the end scene certainly does suggest that religion is pretty restrictive, but I guess they do have a point, especially when you do consider some of the denominations out there. I, obviously, have my own thoughts on the matter, but in the end I also suggest that if the whole idea comes down to being nice to people, and helping them out as opposed to simply living a self-centered life, then that is the problem. Of course, it does work both ways, but it certainly does give us some things to think about."

","Given the participation of many onscreen stoners, it's not particularly difficult to make the stretch and a suggest that this movie was conceived while its creators were baked out of their minds. That would explain the one-joke premise the movie is based on, although it doesn't take away from the fact that there are plenty of genuinely amusing, if not outright hilarious, moments peppered throughout. From beginning to end it's defiantly juvenile and offensive to the point where there are few social groups or religious associations left unscathed, but there's enough good will for the audience to just sit back, relax and go with it. Seth Rogen's vocal performance has the same manic energy he brings to his live-action appearances, while Kristen Wiig matches him beat for beat every chance she gets. There's a limited audience for this and I suspect a hazy cloud is necessary to entirely give in to the movie, but as it is, it has its moments."

Seth Rogan must be one of the most untalented people ever to participate in the Hollywood greed machine, because that's all this film is.<br/><br/>The plot is so juvenile, that it can be summed up in a sentence. Food thinks humans are Gods and then realize humans eat food. Yep, that's it. Food is represented by stereotypes, for example a bagel is Jewish, whites are crackers etc. Yeah, nothing racist about that. I'm sure some self aggrandizing Hollywood type that made too much money with too little talent, thought this was clever. It's not.<br/><br/>This is literally one of the worst films I've ever seen. Seth Rogan and the rest of the people responsible for this film must have been high when they came up with the plot and dialog because viewers would have to be stoned out of their minds to be able to summon a single small inside smile throughout this whole debacle.<br/><br/>This film really feels like it was made by someone with the intellect of a six year old. Perhaps the six year olds that are making fart sounds with their armpits might smile once or twice, unfortunately, due to the pointless orgy at the end, the unimaginative sexual innuendo and the gratuitous language the children that might muster a smile, won't be able to watch it.<br/><br/>For adults, it's like watching that kid make fart sounds with his armpits. You just roll your eyes at how simple and immature it is and go about your life. If any critics actually gave this disaster a passing grade, take note. You know who to ignore for the rest of your life.<br/><br/>Aside from having zero plot, being extremely boring and trying to make up for these faults with swear words and sex, this film is just another propaganda piece by Hollywood. The anti-religious bigotry is blatant. Perhaps if someone is a close minded atheist that proclaims there positively is no God...perhaps if they spend their sad life spreading the gospel of their faith in some eternal, magical, mystery matter that one day just created the universe for no reason, perhaps that guy might pretend to like it. This seems to be the breed of person that might see this and give it a good rating. I doubt even that kind of douche bag would find it funny. But if they're like that pathetic guy we all know that dedicates their existence to bashing other people constantly on Facebook for thinking there might be more to all this than we understand, they probably wouldn't care how horrible this cartoon is. From what I've seen of such people, they'd probably be happy giving their money to a bigot just like them...only a lot richer. <br/><br/>As an agnostic and someone who is over the age of seven, I can't honestly find any redeeming value in this film. As a country we once set standards for ourselves. It's clear to see that those in power are ripping those standards down and we can see the division, corruption and insanity growing on a daily basis as they take us down the sewer with them. The makers of this fecal matter seem to think that food having an orgy, making every other word the f-bomb and sexual innuendo is clever and groundbreaking. It's not. Anyone since the beginning of film could have made this type of film, it's just that they had the talent and character not to.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this film even two stars, was because the poor animators that were unlucky enough to be involved in this project, put out a perfectly status quo product. The animators are probably the only people associated with this crap fest that actually displayed any talent. Keep in mind, the animation was in no way spectacular or groundbreaking, but it was average and anything average about this movie, is without a doubt, it's highlight. <br/><br/>The highlight of this movie for me was eating the $6 mini bag of Twizzlers I got pocket raped for. Some people say, ""wait till it comes out on video"". I'm not saying that. I'm saying don't see it. It's a complete waste of time. You only have so many hours in your life. Don't waste two hours on this. Do something more productive like watching ""The Infiltrator"", cleaning the top of your cabinets, flossing your teeth, talking to your cat, or cutting your grass with scissors. Pretty much any activity is time better spent."

","If you like Seth Rogen's brand of humor, then you'll most likely like this movie. Think of Superbad in animated form, but with more sexual innuendo...maybe.<br/><br/>For people who like comedies that are actually funny and don't rely on their crudeness and foul language as the punchline to the jokes, then this probably isn't for you.<br/><br/>The movie tries to be funny by simply being crude and foul. Crude and foul can be funny when used in the right context, but not AS the comedy of a movie. The ""comedy"" arch of the movie is in simply being crude with loads of cursing and references to sex and drugs.<br/><br/>There is cleverness in the story, but it's just too bad that it got lost in what seemed to want to be the ""shock"" of being able to have an ""R"" rating.<br/><br/>Overall, it's just an unfunny pile of garbage of a movie unless you are of the people who find funny in Rogen, Jonah Hill, and their brand of ""humor"". Then you'll probably love it."

","The trailer for this film looks brilliant and was looking forward to watching this adult comedy. So i sat down cracked open a can of beer and lost 81 minutes of my day with sausage party. I lost time because the film is just awful the only funny parts are the parts shown in the trailer, from start to finish its such a massive let down and feels lazy. It has a decent cast but thats about as much as i can say positive about it, the plot and story is simple its about the secret lives of items in a grocery store from hot dog sausages to buns and everything else you can think of. They all live in hope of being picked up and took home not realising they will be killed and turned into a meal. They go on a adventure of trying to survive, the jokes are pretty desperate but i will admit the CGI is good. I would not rush to watch to watch this film, seth rogan has a certain type of humour and 1 in 4 films he does turns out to be good, but sausage party is not one of them."

","If your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems almost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual humor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame satire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party. good tip, don't watch with your sister and father like den Toni... it makes for awkwardest situation (like that one where the bagel covers his eyes ;) ) Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators' desire to make the first ""adult"" 3D animated film. The interpretation of ""adult"" here seems to be the same as when it's used to describe porn--in other words, ""adult"" in the sense that you wouldn't want children to watch it but not in the sense that it shows much sophistication. holy buckets! salaam Hank is the this! she makes all other lesbians look like garbage. 10/10 would ""flap"" again."

","You see, I understand this is a parody of religions and religious people, but the one thing that bothered me most of all was how they depicted the conflict in Palestine as being between Muslims and Jews. It's not a religious conflict, you so-called writers who wrote this long, lame joke of a movie, and it's not about having enough ""room on the shelf"" for everyone, it's about Zionists stealing the lands of the people who have lived there for centuries, Muslims, Christians or whatever, and mass-murdering them for the past 70+ years. Yeah sure you seem to think it can all be solved if everyone f***** each other, but I assure you our leaders have been doing that for years, they are making sweet love to the racist, criminal Zionist leaders and it seems to be going great for them as they are getting richer and richer while the people continue to be killed, their houses continue to be demolished and their lands occupied. So disappointed to see that none of the big names who have written this movie bothered to check out the political background of the conflict and just fell into generalized, ignorant stereotypes about the Middle East."

","It is a very entertaining movie for adults, but not that funny. There's about a total of 15 minutes of comedy spread out during the entire movie, unless you like vulgar and obscene comedy, which I don't. It's not funny like Family Guy or American Dad, and that was what I was expecting. It's more like The Simpson's or Seinfeld funny, and I don't think either of those sitcoms is that funny. The plot is as good as it gets for an animated movie about talking food. I would give it a 7 out of 10. Please do not take your kids, or even a person under the age of 21. There are some very insensitive and offensive things and acts done all through the movie.I could have waited for this movie to go to the $1.00 movie theater."
"secretzfan","6","3","9","13 September 2016"," A very smart film that sadly misses some laughs
","When the first trailer for Sausage Party came out I was shocked by both the name and the trailer. The concept sounded so amazing that I knew I had to check it out and so I did and while I enjoyed it a lot I also found myself not laughing a whole lot. Which was strange to me. The cursing and the violence started to blend into the rest of the film and in the end just left me more intrigued by what the movie was trying to say than what the jokes were. <br/><br/>Sausage Party is a idea that was came up by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. This idea however came along while they were doing a little AMC show called ""Preacher."" Coincidence? I think not. Preacher is a TV show based on a comic about a man named Jesse Custer who gains the power to basically make anyone do what he wants them to do. This comic book is highly renowned for its commentary on the state of Religion at that time. It talks a lot on the idea of God and him being more of a dictator than anything else. <br/><br/>Sausage Party does the same thing in this film. It makes a religious allusion that ""God"" is the humans and the food is us in our world today. We see God as the amazing figure and don't ever question why he was put there in the first place, and I love that about the film. <br/><br/>Its social commentary was so good and fun that I had to give this movie a 6/10.<br/><br/>Now if only we could get more jokes that hit"

But later in the movie, roughly half way through or so, it took a drastic turn to human decapitation, mutilation, and killing. Also, towards the end of the movie there was a celebratory orgy scene between the various foods that was quite depraved, not to say the earlier stuff wasn't. I expected some of this with Seth Rogen being the main star, however nothing to this extent. Apparently I need to write a few more lines, I don't see why a short, concise review is frowned upon."

"Rstein926","7","2","5","8 January 2017"," The best R Rated comedy since Ted
","Sausage Party is arguably in my opinion the best R Rated comedy film since Ted. In fact I actually think this film is more of a Seth MacFarlane movie as this movie has all the kind of things you would find in Ted, American Dad and Family Guy such as violent slapstick, adult humour, crude stuff and drugs. At first glance the film looks like a typical Disney/Universal animated movie for kids but once Frank says 'Shit!' it turns out to be an adult movie.<br/><br/>In the movie Frank a frankfurter, his girlfriend a bun roll named Brenda and the other foods hope to be chosen by customers to go to the 'Great Beyond' not knowing in reality they are in danger and are meant to be eaten alive by humans. Once the truth is found out Frank and his friends decide to protect themselves as well as get revenge on the humans. However a rejected douche named Douche wants revenge on Frank after he accidentally prevented him being used by a female customer for her vagina.<br/><br/>The film wasn't the funniest comedy but if you love Ted and Family Guy you will probably love this movie. Only wish Seth MacFarlane was director."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","5","8 January 2017"," Better than expected
","The case for Sausage Party is a strange one. Although it got mostly good reviews, it seemed like many audience members really disliked it. All of the criticisms of it made me lower my expectations greatly. Perhaps that's why I found it to be a sort of fun, sort of entertaining, decent film. I think the jokes to go too far. The writers are interested in being progressive by a lot of the dialogue, yet by the same token make fun of a large group of people by using the same types of stereotypes. It comes off kind of conflicting. The narrative itself is the best thing about it, even though there are a lot of questionable jokes and scenes played simply for laughs. Not sure if to recommend it to everyone, but I do think there's a good film hidden underneath it all."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","5","21 December 2016"," Simultaneous the most clever and stupidly obscene movie you might ever see
","Only Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Jonah Hill could come up with something as ingenious and totally stupid as an animated film that imagines what would happen if food was self-aware and learned of its true purpose.<br/><br/>Rogen and Goldberg – along with Hill and all their other pals, you know who they are – have long owned the the stoner comedy market, and ""Sausage Party"" is their most ambitious means of pedaling drug and dick humor to their audience yet. At least the sheer amount of creativity required to bring this film to life provides a satisfying balance to its excessive and pointlessly foul parts.<br/><br/>In ""Sausage Party,"" all the foods at the ShopWell supermarket believe their destiny is to be chosen by the gods (humans) to be taken to ""the great beyond"" past the sliding glass doors, where they'll be loved and cared for. For hotdog Frank (Rogen) and bun Brenda (Kristen Wiig), who sit next to each other on the shelf, the opportunity to be chosen together means they can  yeah. But when a returned jar of honey mustard (Danny McBride) starts screaming that it's all a lie, he sends Frank and Brenda – and some other food friends – on a quest for the truth.<br/><br/>The supporting characters include a constantly bickering Bagel (Edward Norton doing his best Woody Allen impression) and Lavash (David Krumholtz), whose arguments dip a bit far into Israeli- Palestinian conflict territory, a deformed hotdog named Barry (Michael Cera), a sexually questioning Taco (Selma Hayek), a Douche in the literal and figurative sense (Nick Kroll) and a few non- perishable foods who take hits from a kazoo to numb them from the truth. Our heroes journey to various aisles from the nightlife in the liquor section to a saloon full of Mexican foods.<br/><br/>Rogen and Goldberg, who co-scripted with ""The Night Before"" writers Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, are clearly after a parody of Pixar films, which often build clever, unseen worlds. (There are even a couple direct references to the animation giant.) In many instances, ""Sausage Party"" manages to capture that same degree of imagination, only they twist it to their perverted purposes. <br/><br/>A key component is matching the level of visual artistry as those films is the hiring of animation directors. Conrad Vernon is one of the trusted names at DreamWorks Animation (""Shrek 2,"" ""Monsters vs. Aliens""), while Greg Tiernan has directed a couple dozen ""Thomas & Friends"" videos. The two know the techniques that create the look and feel of a film on this scale and can sell this kind of concept to an audience. Doubtless they enjoyed employing their skills to delinquent ends. <br/><br/>How one can be so simultaneous impressed and disgusted by the cleverness of a film is easily the crowning achievement of ""Sausage Party."" It's as relentlessly creative as it is relentlessly abhorrent. It even has a feel-good message as it descends into obscenity. Ultimately, however, most movies this outrageous don't even have half as many good things that can be said about them, which makes ""Sausage Party"" among one of the better ones by default. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.

","I do not know what to say or think. Crude sex jokes. Endless profanity. Violence. Drugs. Movie references. Nazi jokes. Racial stereotypes. Anti-religion metaphors. Vulgarity. And most memorably of all, a food orgy. Those are the elements that make up this shocking animated movie, where supermarket food items discover that humans aren't gods taking them to the 'Great Beyond', but are actually going to eat them. This one features a huge amount of swearing, tones of puerile and offensive jokes and it's by a studio and director best known for making Thomas the Tank Engine. You have to see this one. Sausage Party works well in some ways but not in others. It's a very clever and thought- provoking film, and its metaphors and social commentary are shockingly clever. The trouble is... it's not actually that funny. Essentially, it's like a group of 5 year olds saying rude words to make each other laugh. It's far too reliant on crude dialogue and sexual jokes, and it sags massively in the middle. However, the storyline remains interesting even if it's not that funny, and the food orgy at the end is something you will never forget. Someone in my screening said out loud ""That is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life"". That should be a fairly standard reaction to this film. It's nuts. It's uneven. It's bonkers. It's definitely one to watch, to see for yourself what you think. Even if you don't like it, you won't forget it. <br/><br/>6/10"
"uhuhuijoi","4","4","14","27 August 2016"," A pretty good movie ruined by a blatant anti-religion message
","(Bear with me here and don't downvote this just because you disagree with the title)<br/><br/>In terms of comedy, this movie was good. It was gruesome, but that was funny and occasionally done to perfection. Aside from the humor, I strongly disliked some of the messages this movie sent. I agree with the ""have fun and live your life"", but the religious overtones were done horribly. The sausage says there's no proof of God's existence (and I get that this is a comedy that pokes fun at society) but the writers completely ignore that fact that nothing disproves God's existence either. I'd argue that just the fact that we're here suggests that something created us. I think my biggest complaint about Sausage Party is that it depicts people who believe in God as stupid or in denial of what's wrong with the world- as people who choose to believe that God exists because they don't want to bear the ""truth""- and I think that's disrespectful and just stupid. I get that the writers are trying to make fun of society, but they blatantly disrespect the very large portion of the population that believes in God and has concrete reasons to. I fully respect atheists and agnostics, but I just can't help but notice that this movie felt like it's purpose was to push Rogen's anti-religion agenda but add some fantastic humor to try and make it less noticeable, and that just rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or some lunatic that believes everything they hear, and I hope I don't come off as one, but the fact that this movie has such a blatant anti-religion message just ruined the humor for me. Thank God that this wasn't a kids movie- I wouldn't want to bring my children to watch this and then have them come out semi-brainwashed by the overall theme. I agree that you should have fun with your life, but that doesn't mean having sex with everyone all the time, using drugs, and not caring at all about yourself besides your sexual desires.<br/><br/>PS: Although it was a bit unnecessary, that food orgy at the end was hysterical."

Huh huh huh how clever HAHAHA the hot dogs are penises, and the buns are vaginas HAHAHA holy sh*t go kill yourself.<br/><br/>This is a propaganda movie that just vomits a nihilistic, crappy view of humanity in our faces. I'll save you the trouble: -sophistication means watching an animated movie with cuss words in it -belief in God is unconditionally backwards -recreational drug use is acceptable -sexual immorality has no consequences -homosexuality is acceptable and not weird or inappropriate, ever -humans are little more than their reproductive organs, -profane horse-sht makes a good movie because we're, like, breaking the rules.<br/><br/>I remember when I was young and thought that Atheism and Subjectivism was the neatest thing in the whole world.

Yeah boo God and absolute morality... retards.<br/><br/>I'll say it now. I don't like most young people because they are the kinds of shallow-minded idiots who watch and enjoy crap like this. They bitch about how religion is brainwashing, but then they totally see the media as a religion. They never use their minds to question the f@ggot-assed bilge being foisted on them by ""entertainment"" like this.<br/><br/>This is propaganda.

","Sausage Party is the newest addition to the ""Animated Movies For Adults That People Mistook Was For Kids"" list that includes films like Team America and literally every animated movie above a PG rating. With a cast filled with funny comedic actors (and Edward Nortan), this toy story like film about food items journeying to discover the truth of the ""great beyond"", should be a laugh a minute... But sadly the cute cartoons doing and saying R rated things gets old really fast.<br/><br/>The main issue with Sausage Party is that I don't know if it tried too hard or didn't try hard enough. The film completely overuses its profanity especially the F bomb which in tern weakens the impact of the word both in shock value comedy and as an insult of any kind. The dialogue is basically what you would expect to hear in a Call Of Duty lobby on xbox, a barrage of nonsensical swearing that's only funny due to how completely pathetic it is. The film also heavily overuses food sex jokes and puns which, like swearing, is funny in moderation... Not every God damn sentence. Also the puns aren't exactly original or creative, some of them are but when the film is 89 minutes of food sex puns not every joke is going to work. Also may I add the food orgy scene at the end wasn't funny its just traumatising.<br/><br/>What I did find interesting though with this film was its symbolic approach to homosexuality and religion... OK the homosexuality implications became less than subtle as the film went along and ended up a little disturbing just like the rest of the film, but the religion metaphor was good. ""The great beyond"" being the food version heaven and the humans being... well... God's, as the food refer to them as.... OK nothing about this film is subtle I'll just admit this now. For me it isn't the symbol of religion that I liked, SPOILER ALERT, it was when Frank confronts and questions the food belief and how this as well in a way challenges Christianity in both their belief of a God and heaven as well as their beliefs of homosexuality. This to me is the redeeming quality as I liked how the film had an underlining meaning that, although not executed brilliantly, still got me thinking.<br/><br/>Overall, Sausage Party is a mentally scarring animated picture that attempts to make a statement about religion and homosexuality. It completely overuses the humour of watching a cartoon swear and have disturbing CGI sex but some jokes are actually quite funny. Is it as good as other animated films for adults like Team America? No, but I would say its worth a watch.... Just don't bring your kids along... Unless they play a lot of xbox"
"Whingewood","4","3","10","2 September 2016"," To use their vernacular, ""f*****g spooge!""
","Personally, I have found Seth Rogen's previous efforts to be very hit and miss. I quite liked The Green Hornet, but absolutely hated This is the End.<br/><br/>With a title like Sausage Party, my expectations weren't set high. Just as well really, as it was extremely lowbrow (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). but unlike Matt Stone and Trey Parker efforts (South Park & Team America), it offered little in the way of intelligent commentary to counterbalance it.<br/><br/>I know that humour is subjective, but to me this wasn't funny. I'm not even sure that my twelve-year-old self would have found it funny. If you find animated food saying f**k and c**t amusing, then this is the film for you. For everyone else, spend your ticket money elsewhere.<br/><br/>The film's 'message' was not smart or original, and their attempt at shock factor (""haha, that vegetable said f**k!"") fails because it's been done before, bigger, longer, and uncut (South Park movie).<br/><br/>(Originally published on my blog, whingewood.wordpress.com)"
"ybenhayun","4","3","10","22 August 2016"," Funny, but not nearly as funny as I wanted it to be
","The biggest problem that I had with this movie is that while there were plenty of jokes that landed, they were few and far in between for much of the movie. There are big stretches of the film where characters are saying really shocking and raunchy things, but none of them got laughs. It would essentially feel like I was watching a hot dog and a bun just talk about sex in really grave detail, and when it wasn't funny, it just kinda felt weird to watch. It takes up until the last 20 minutes of the movie for it to be consistently funny, and when it got there I was laughing pretty much non stop until the end, but up until then it would be like a laugh every now and again. The jokes that do land are really funny, and this movie is incredibly creative and clever in a lot of different ways, and I think the way they depicted food being killed was genuinely hilarious, but if you're going to make a film this raunchy and dirty it needs to be hilarious through and through, otherwise it just comes off as immature and stupid, which is how a lot of the film felt to me."
"RforFilm","5","3","11","15 August 2016"," Sausage Party has it's delicious moments, even if the crass novelty becomes repetitive
","Animation has the ability to give live to things that we previously would have never considered. Disney and Pixar in particular have brought cars, toys, rats, bugs, fish, and robots a humanized life and a study on what their purpose is, now with thoughts and feelings. There's a magic within that, so it's not uncommon for other things we could explore to see what their perspective of the world would be like. For toys in Toy Story, it's a joy land of children and imagination, but with a dark side of childhood eventually ending. For bugs in A Bugs Life, it's more of a survival of the fittest as their several kinds of insects out there. How about food?<br/><br/>Today's movie shows that food may have the worst when it comes to their purpose. Writer and actor Seth Rogan not only wanted to explore what that world of humanized food would be like, but to do in his adult context. R rated animated movies are a rarity, but it's nice to see a studio like Sony take a chance on a risk. You could even argue that because adult cartoons are more popular on television now, R rated animated films could have a bigger opportunity. Let's see if Sausage Party invoke more adult animated stories. <br/><br/>In a market called ""Shopwells"", each morning opens with the food signing (it's made clear in the beginning that people cannot see them move or talk) about their desire to be chosen by the ""gods"" to be taken out of the store into the ""Great Beyond"". One area with all the forth of July food, contains sausages and buns. One sausage, Frank (played by Seth Rogan), along with Carl (played by Jonah Hill) and Barry (played by Michael Cera) are hoping to be chosen with a set of buns next to them, which contains Frank's girlfriend, Brenda (played by Kristen Wiig).<br/><br/>When a jar of honey mustard commits suicide, this causes the shopping cart where the sausages and buns were chosen to collapse. This causes Frank and Brenda to slip out of their packaging, leaving them behind in the store while everyone else goes to the ""Great Beyond"". Frank and Brenda are told to go to a set of imperishable foods to learn the truth about their existence. Along the way, they encounter a taco lesbian Teresa (played by Selma Hayek), a Jewish bagel Sammy Bagel Jr (played by Edward Nortin) and bottle of Liquor Firewater (played by Bill Hader).<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough of how important it is to understand that Sausage Party is not for children. I'm twenty-nine and I'm not old enough for this. I'm not even sure if my parents are old enough for this. There is so much swearing, violence, and sexual content (including a three minute food orgy somewhere), that Sausage Party has earned it's R rating and them some. Within all the crass is a well-written script that is sort of an analogy to real life religion. While I wouldn't call this movie an atheist story, I can understand that many people would be turned off.<br/><br/>I can defiantly say it's a smart script, though I'll admit that the constant crass does wear off after a while. It's funny, but when your dialogue is almost nothing but swears, it makes for a repetitive attitude that I doubt the film is aware of. Story wise, it does feel a little stretched (and this is an eighty minute movie). Part of me thinks this might have worked better as an hour long special on Netflix, but you can still tell by the number of comedians in this along with some great animation that Sausage Party has it's moments.<br/><br/>I'll give this five hot dog sausages out of ten. Sausage Party is an acquired taste movie, and though I might watch it once more, I can see a lot of people playing this at parties. Speaking of which, Sausage Party is an ADULT PARTY ONLY. LEAVE THE KIDS AT HOME!"

","I wanted to give it a 9 But I gave it a 7. First of all its a great R rated comedy and more often its a great animated movie.

This animated is not for children with over 150 uses of 'f' word. The whole movie is funny , some comic moments stand up from the rest as they are very well executed.Script is funny and my God all the Characters are Hilarious.In this way if you love a dark comedy which includes sex references and foods killing people and performing various sexual acts on each other , its a good movie but on the other hand it feels a little too much and that's why I could not go with a 9 but I gave a 7.At many points I felt all the sex jokes were a little too much .Even then I loved the movie as how it throw so many ironies .I loved the Characters of Taco , Bun , Sausage, and Most Importantly Gum.Its also political in its own right which I suggest is bad.Honestly I could easily compare it with The Wolf of Wall Street but just a little less silly and way more more funnier.Still As an R Rated Comedy it does what it should do , it will make you burst out with laughter only if you consider the jokes as funny and not gross.

","The main aim of a comedy is to try and make the audience laugh. Well, this film certainly did that! I saw this at the cinema and I can't remember the last time I heard such loud roars of laughter throughout the entirety of a film. It is a witty, smart and ludicrous film that works perfectly. Each character is brilliantly thought out and they all fit together which makes the story very engaging. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that if you are already a fan of Seth Rogen's style of comedy you should absolutely love this. In addition, there are various actors in this film who have previously worked with Seth Rogen which makes it even more enjoyable and gives it that edge. I won't mention names though as it is quite fun trying to work out who is doing the voice for each character. <br/><br/>The film is super offensive and in some parts disgusting but if that's what it takes to make a comedy masterpiece then so be it! I have no problem with the content of the film and I love a bit of shock value but I do understand some people will be offended because people are people and people suck. <br/><br/>Seth Rogen has proved once again that he is a stoner genius who knows how to write, act and truly make people laugh.

","Sausage party tells the story of foods in a supermarket imagining life on the outside of the store. Their mission is to get chosen by the humans to begin a new life on the outside. After viewing the trailer, this film was automatically on my to watch list. Unfortunately i was disappointed.<br/><br/>I am just going to mention that the swearing is very often and over used. In fact most sentences said by the characters contain at least 1 swear word. I know this is an adult humor title, but they could have calmed that down!<br/><br/>The story is pretty good however. There were moments where i couldn't stop laughing on some parts; other parts tried to be funny but failed. I did enjoy the beginning song that introduced some of the characters, it added a warm and funny start to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Sausage Party definitely has the most messed up and disturbing ending scene out of any film i have watched. It dragged on for a while which made me just want the film the end quicker. The whole of the last scene went on for ages which just got boring and very strange towards the end. <br/><br/>Overall this film was alright. If you enjoy films that are over the top with attempted comedy and sexual references then I would say maybe rent this title. I just think you would be disappointed in my opinion. I love animated comedy titles but this one just didn't really make me laugh as much as i hoped for."

Even the humor in it is on some low level. As some people would say, it isn't made for intellectuals. I don't know why the writers used so much vulgarity, as they did not know what else to write?! Probably it is their ordinary language.

","Im giving 5 stars in comparing this animation to other good animation with good stories. First, the story is just mediocre, like an adult version of low budget toy story. Is not a breakthrough story, more like emoji movie kind of story. Second, I appreciate the idea of matching the story to nowadays issues, like religious and racial issues. I get the messages that they want to tell us about god and creation, human relations and love. Third, There is so many things that cannot make sense like how the foods walking, (while toy story make it more logical, like the toys is 'play dead' when there are human around.) Overall, this animation is not so bad about the meaning, but I can't really enjoy the jokes, really just flat emotions throughout the film."

"leonblackwood","6","1","2","9 January 2017"," Quite funny in places! 6/10
","Review: What a crazy film! I really didn't expect this movie to have such foul language and sexual content, especially as it is an animation film. The concept was definitely original, and I doubt that the top studios, like Pixar, would ever make anything in this league but I can't see this film getting a wide audience, like some other animated movies would. Anyway, the movie is based on a hot dog type Sausage called Frank and a hot dog bun called Brenda, who are dying to go into the outside world, so they can get it on. Whilst on the supermarket shelves, the whole store believes that humans are gods, mainly because they take them into the outside to be free but a honey mustard jar returns to the shelves, after being mistakenly bought, and he tries to tell everyone about his bad experience in the outside world, which no one believes. During Honey Mustards outburst, the packet of Hot Dog buns and Hot Dogs, with Frank and Brenda in, are taken off the shelves by a consumer, and while Frank is trying to save Honey Mustard from committing suicide, the basket tips over, causing the contents to fall out of the basket. One of the baskets items, Douche, damages his nozzle, which falsies the manager to throw him in the bin, so he makes it his mission to destroy Frank and Brenda, who caused the basket to tip over. Whilst separated from there packets, Frank and Brenda join forces with Kareem Abdul Lavash and Sammy Bagel Jr. to make there way back to there department in the store but Frank wants to find out more about the outside world from Firewater, whose in the stores liquor aisle, so they take a quick detour and they wait for Frank to get his information. While Frank is smoking weed with Firewater, the rest of his crew are on the run from Douche, who has used his wicked ways to hunt them down but with the help of Teresa, a small taco, they manage to escape from Douche, and finally catch up with Frank, who tries to convince them that the outside world is pretty awful. Nobody wants to believe Frank about the so-called gods, so he uses the information that he got from Firewater, to get some proof and then he goes back to the market to show everyone what happens when they are taken off the shelves. Crazy but true! The movie then goes down an avenue of drugs, violence and an outrageous orgy, which is quite shocking if your not used to Seth Rogen's type of comedy. I did find the movie quite funny and the crazy plot was well put together but I did think that some of the scenes went a bit too far. It will change the way that you buy and cook food in the future, in a funny way but it's definitely not for kids, and some adults who will be offended by some of the jokes. If you don't take the movie seriously, you will find it fun, and it's one of those films that you can watch, to put you in a good mood but I doubt that it will go down as an all time classic. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: With such a huge amount of actors supplying there voices to this risky comedy, I'm not surprised that the various characters brought different styles of comedy to the big screen, which made the movie work. It's directed by Greg Tiernan, who has directed Thomas and Friends cartoons since 2009, and he was the animation director for Happily N'Ever After. The other director, Conrad Vernon, 48, directed Shrek 2, Monsters vs. Aliens and Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, so he was the perfect choice to bring Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Jonah Hills story to the big screen. The animation was quite impressive, for a movie about food, and the expressions on the various characters faces, were spot on but the orgy scene really took it to another level. I personally can't a sequel in the near future, unless they name it Burger Party, so for a stand alone film, I would say that it was a decent achievement, which made a healthy profit.<br/><br/>Budget: $19million Worldwide Gross: $140.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Craig Robinson, Edward Norton, Danny McBride, Salma Hayek, Bill Hader, James Franco, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, David Krumholtz and Anders Holm. 6/10"

","Sausage Party is unlike any animated movie I've ever seen. Having seen the trailer before I had a hunch of what was to be expected and yet I wasn't prepared. Being familiar with Seth Rogen's work the humor wasn't too vulgar for me. <br/><br/>The idea of talking food is brilliant and the setting for the story to evolve is a good one. What makes this movie special is not the story itself, but the satire and twisted humor that follows. Had it been told among humans instead I don't believe it would have been as special.<br/><br/>This is definitely not suited for kids! From an adults point of view it's a hilarious film that rather makes you question yourself why you watched it in the first place. The last twenty minutes was anything but leaving you in a state of shock. <br/><br/>I'm not going to recommend everyone to watch this movie, since it's humor won't definitely suit all. But, if you're keen on satire, twisted plot and a killing spree among food you should have a look!<br/><br/>I like it, but not sure if it's worth a 7/10 rating."

","I love Seth Rogen movies for the most part (Pineapple Express is one of my favorite comedies ever), but what the f*** was this? I had seen the trailer months ago and was really looking forward to this, but me and my wife were more disappointed than anything.<br/><br/>The premise for the movie is a great idea and that's a huge part of what I figured would make this funny and different. You have a secret life of food story essentially, that has some pretty damn good animation, is a riff on Pixar movies and is made for adults. HOWEVER, this did not end up being all that funny or original unfortunately.<br/><br/>It seems the creators just wanted to act like they were the first people to ever make an R-rated animated film......I guess they've forgotten about South Park and tons of other adult animated cartoons that have come before them that did it better? I think they wanted to try and rely on shock value, but this move wasn't shocking. Saying ""s**t"" and ""f**k"" in a cartoon isn't shocking and it's been done by South Park for a long time now. Hell, the South Park movie made fun of that years ago. If anyone remembers Conker's Bad Fur Day, they basically borrowed from the concept of having cute things saying and doing disgusting and sexual stuff. Again, not shocking, all been done before.<br/><br/>The jokes for the most part were so predictable and just kept revolving around the same thing over and over again. You could see most of them coming a mile away. The ending food orgy scene would've been funnier if it wasn't so over the top. It just seems like most of the jokes were written for teenagers who think swearing is funny. Swearing within a joke can be really funny, but just swearing isn't funny or original or creative at all.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh, have fun and just forget about the outside world for 1.5 hours (or however long the movie is); not be preached at or have theological bulls**t thrown in my face left and right. I'm not a religious person, but I also don't give a s**t what Seth Rogen does or doesn't believe in and I certainly don't want to hear about it in something that should be lighthearted and entertaining.<br/><br/>I could keep going, but if you're reading you get the point. I will say there were a few positives. I did think the whole bath salt scene was really funny and that it made humans interact with food was also amusing. The opening song was really funny and there should have been more moments like that. Oh and Nick Kroll as a Douche was really funny too! I couldn't help thinking that after Parks and Rec he STILL ends up being a douche ha ha. He made me laugh the most and Seth Rogen just played Seth Rogen per the usual. The movie was mostly boring and not funny, but there were some funny moments. Not really worth watching though."

"tyson-hunsaker","3","1","3","31 July 2018"," The adult animated comedy that goes too far.
","""Sausage Party"" has a fantastic premise: Food items in the grocery store are excited to be purchased by humans who they believe to be gods. When they are chosen, they believe they go to food paradise and enjoy heaven but when they realize the truth, all hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>The premise alone is enough to watch the film with great anticipation. It's an adult-humor animated comedy not afraid to go all the way while also providing fascinating perspective commentary on society, politics, and religion. The film ultimately does say what it wants to say but by the end, I found myself spiting the film for how it said it. <br/><br/>First of all, the humor. This film has garnered a reputation for being a hard 'R' film for it's strong crude and sexual content and language. As the film progressed, I noticed that the language was so frequent that the humorous shock value had disappeared by the middle of Act II. For the sake of going ""all the way,"" it's obvious that the writers wanted to take it even further which made the film less funny. In this case, over the top was a strong asset until it became so much that I just felt sick watching it. It didn't become humorous anymore and it just became obsence and vulgar for the sake of just vulgarity. At that point, I believe the target audience has changed from intelligent adults ready for some raunchy humor to teenagers trapped in adults bodies. Not to be rude myself but the film lost its intelligence and appealed to much more basic and rudimentary tastes of entertainment.<br/><br/>Second, the message. Along with the humor, there is such thing as over the top and while the premise promised an intriguing critique of previously listed themes, the script's dialogue, characterization, and overall delivery became quickly heavy handed and in your face. Not long after Act I was over that I realized the message of idiocrisy of religion and religious-based beliefs and ideas were being forced down my throat in an offensive and distasteful way. <br/><br/>Major complaints aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the animation style. Lots of work went into the aesthetics of the film and I think the animation is, by far, the movie's greatest strength. The cast also boasts some very talented actors and actresses that make talking hot dogs believable. What humor was present and landed well, I think not only goes to some saving graces in the script but in the talented people voicing the characters. In particular, Seth Rogen and Kirsten Wig did a great job as the story's leads. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked the talent and animation and several jokes landed really well. However, due to the inherent flaws in the script's vision and the humor getting ridiculously over the top and just gross, I can't and will not recommend this to anyone. It's obscene just because it's bored. If you're interested in animation films for adults, I would recommend high quality works that having something to say while retaining the intelligence and goodwill that the audience should demand. <br/><br/>Recommendations: Fantastic Planet (1973), Perfect Blue (1997), Akira (1988), Anomalisa (2015), etc."

"aaronlbacks","2","1","3","26 March 2018"," Unparalleled sin
","I think devout Christians don't inherently hate atheists, or even if they were touched by the Lord's word, they would never hate a fellow brother, but content like this must at least make them shake their heads and search for points where that atheist ""took the wrong path in life."" This movie was an embarrassment. It's an ostentatious crazy man, dressed only in robes and sporting sporadic hair and long, chipped fingernails, yelling slurs at people on the street as they quickly shuffle by him with groceries clutched closely to their chests so that he may not grab an apple out of their bag, take a bite, and then proceed to harass them, spittle and apple juice flying onto their face as they weep for their dignity. That man is Seth Rogan, and the victim is me. In short, this movie made me feel sad, depressed, lonely. And very uncomfortable I might add. The animation felt off in a really gross way. In a way, the animation reminded me of those like animated pornography videos where it takes the Family Guy characters and they have sex. Like it was that cheap, creepy, and unnatural, and a few parts here and there made my skin crawl due to how uncanny they looked. But the worst part, regarding animation, was just the character designs; not only is the theme presented to you like you're a dumbass, the jokes are presented to you that way too. Wow, that bun was oddly anthropomorphic; was it supposed to make me horny? Its limbs really creeped me out, like they come out of nowhere and they sort of just like disappear into the bun's ass, but they don't really mold at all? I guess all of the limbs in this movie were kinda weird and gross. Weird and gross things also reminded me of all of the racist stereotyping in this movie? Like wow the Jewish bagel has a big nose and it doesn't get along with the Arab lavash. Idk it just felt really distasteful, especially in a day and age where everyone gets called out on their BS. Generally however, I think it's good to poke fun in this way because it reminds us that nothing really is sacrosanct and everything is on the playing field as far as comedy goes, but this edgy humor offended me more because it was bad more than any of the wide variety of controversial topics it brushed (religion, abstinence, race, Stephen Hawking? (RIP)). I will admit however, a few got through my cracks, for I am not impervious!, and they gave me a chuckle, and if it can at least intentionally entertain me a little bit, it's not a perfectly awful movie. Anyhow, the most offensive piece of this whole movie was the atheist ""WAKE UP SHEEPLE"" point of view. Hey Catholic over there! You're blinded by God's semen in your eyes! One, this sort of statement is incredibly preachy and just generally offensive, and it would just push the wool further over the eyes of that individual. (To be transparent, I think I would identify as an atheist, depends on what side of the bed I wake up on). And they address how atheists shouldn't be as preachy as religious people and then they aren't and it just solves the problem? Providing a rational dogmatic argument in a debate on religion, WHERE YOU CAN'T BE DOGMATIC, against a holistically brainwashed opposing community is not going to sway anyone whatsoever. No one will give a damn. But of course, this movie just has to follow a beat by beat generic movie structure where all the sad parts have to be resolved really quickly because this animation is super expensive and we can't afford to make an actual reasonable ending and the villain has to be defeated even though he wasn't really the main antagonist and was more of just a nuisance, but you know, whatever I guess. Another positive thing I have is that while it hits the sad part where the characters divide up (because they always have to!), it brought this about in a way that just makes sense. And even though it's a really clichéd move, it executes it very soundly. But back to the theme, I think the movie would have been much better if a character came onto screen and just read a very extensive (well, not too extensive because most of these ideas were pretty thin and were exhausted waaaaay before the 45 minute mark) monologue expressing the opinions of the writing crew rather than just writing a script where the characters are talking to each other, but they're always actually talking to you. Any line could have been taken out of context and just stated as a fourth-wall breaking statement to the audience and it would make sense/wouldn't feel out of place. Also, it felt they really wanted to get this message across so they dumbed it down like even below the common denominator. Below the common denominator in math doesn't even really make sense, but somehow this movie managed to do just so because it just that stupid. And I wanted to add that I really hated most of the transitions between the two main story arcs - a lot were really corny and they always came at awful times and interrupted whatever flow this movie had going for it. Idk I can't really sum this up other than just simply saying it's a mess, a stain on the movie industry, the eight deadly sin, and generally just an embarrassment to the entire human condition."

I can't believe I even lasted that long, but for review purposes, I left it running (so I heard the dialog while I was doing other things useful with my time).<br/><br/>I picked this up at the local library, not completely sure what to expect, but I knew of the origins of its writers and so I expected some crude sexual humor, a few laughs or maybe at least lightly amusing, mindless entertainment.<br/><br/>I even thought that I might count how many times the ""F"" word was used in the first 5 minutes. It seemed like every single sentence. Hmm, couldn't think of any actual comical dialogue, so I guess they thought that by using the ""F"" word at least twice in ever sentence would add value to their pile of doodie ~ WRONG.<br/><br/>There were so many opportunities for humor, but instead it was an animated waste infested with so much cursing, crudeness and so little thought and creativity that I am ashamed to continue play of this waste that included a cartoon rapist, drug pusher and racists as basis for laughs - not funny?<br/><br/>I am mostly disturbed to see that over 130,000 individuals believed that not only did they think this was worthy of existing, but thought it was very good! What horror! The best part of the movie was the ending - because it was great music. Three Dog Night? How did such a good song end up in such a repulsive piece of garbage film?<br/><br/>Did I mention I got this for free at the library? Remember, if you watch this it is not only an hour and a half of your life that can never get back, but a greatly regretful one. I'd rather have had someone smash my fingers in a car door and spent an hour at the emergency room than have watched this. At least while in pain waiting for care, I'd be entertained by the crackheads or meth-heads that wander into the ER for medical care.

"fegamer","2","1","3","20 July 2017"," Do These People Know Anything About Good Comedy Writing?
","When I saw the trailer, I thought this was going to be a good movie. At first, it would seem like a kids film but then trick the audience later on. But once I got to actually see the movie, the jokes were nothing but swearing and sex references. Basically, within the first 30 seconds, you hear constant F bombs and sexual imagery. Heck, even some of the characters are shaped like genitals to further display the sexual imagery.<br/><br/>Another thing that's a huge turnoff for any movie goer is that most of the characters don't even have well-written personalities or any personalities for that matter. Instead, they just use walking stereotypes such as the bagel being Jewish and the lavash being Muslim. Not even the main characters have anything about them that makes them likable in any way. All the main characters want to do in the end is have sex with each other. Sure they want to know the truth about what happens to food, but the whole entire ""plot"" for our main characters is based on sex.<br/><br/>I forgot to mention that during the film, one of the scenes involves a douche raping a juice box to drink its fluids. Why would they feel the need to add in a rape scene like that? And then comes the ending scene where everything is having sex in a huge food orgy. I'm dead serious. Good writing for comedy shouldn't be based on just sex and vulgarity. I mean look at South Park, it's not all about sex and vulgarity in each episode, some of the episodes have an actual plot, heck even the movie had a plot. True, it was based around swear words but, not every character swore in every single sentence to try and make it sound funny.<br/><br/>This film was not even written with understanding what makes adult comedy funny, I feel as if this was written by a 12-year-old boy who just discovered what porn is."

","Even for a movie called ""sausage party,"" it is incredibly nasty. I knew, with no doubt, that this would be, even for a rated-R film, a risqué showing, for obvious reasons, but my god...this is our comedy today? Seth Rogan did okay in ""The Interview"" and from what I know, that's about it. I do not know where to start, it's just wrong in every single way, the moral (and the way they taught it), the sex scene in the end, the rape scene with the douche and juice box, the lack of logic in the plot, the abundance of (extremely) boring and repetitive sex jokes, most of these jokes in general, the random weed smoking scene, the highly extreme liberal bias (I'm a liberal myself, and I do not appreciate Rogan giving us such a bad rep with this propaganda, nor the one-sided ""lesson"" that ""religion sucks, lets just f*** each other"" with this terrible comparison with this plot and actual religion, nor do I like you over-generalizing religious people as all being these brainwashed and ignorant bigots, who you just so happen to not agree with.)<br/><br/>I love offensive humor (guilty pleasure lol), I believe that non-pc humor can be fun to watch or listen to, for there are ways of taking a very sensitive topic and bring the humor out of it, however, in most cases, this movie doesn't do that. There were a few clever jokes I liked (""exterminate the juice"" ""72 extra virgin olive oil (quoted from the lavash, who of course represents the Muslim/Arab community, I just hope the people who had written that joke is aware that the '72 virgins in paradise is an Islamic belief' myth isn't even mentioned in the Qur'an anywhere. I'd like to hope that they were just making fun of a common stereotype/misconception of Muslims and their belief, but from the movie's message exclaiming that, 'religions are bullcrap' I feel as though these gullible and misinformed writer actually legitimately thought that this is actually a thing that they believe in. Idiots. At least it was funny though, would be more clever if it actually true.)"" ""baby carrots"" ""bath salts exposing the fact that the food can talk"" and a few others I can't think of) But the rest is predictable, unoriginal, and immature.

It's kind of funny seeing a pixar-looking movie filled with this content (sex, drugs, profanity), but after a while you can tell they are going for strict shock- value, and the jokes really hold no meaning (after seeing a hot-dog say F*** 100 times, it loses its luster). This movie has moments where I laughed, but was not as funny as the trailer made it seem. In fact, it got stale real quick, and is much more political than I would of preferred. The ending, was actually gross, and not really funny at all. I am all for crude/tasteless-humor, but the **SPOILER** orgy at the end was strictly for shock, and had no context whatsoever. Honestly, if they made some of the funny scenes in the trailer as long as the orgy scene, it may have gotten a better rating from me. ""Foods engaging in sex hehe""...3 minutes later...""okay how much longer is this going to go on for?"" Overall, this movie was marketed brilliantly, but did not serve up to my expectations.

","Imagine a crude and explicit version of Toy Story, but swap the toys for food, and you've got Sausage Party in a nutshell. Frank the sausage and Brenda the bun can't wait to get picked up off the shelf, taken home, and shoved inside one another in the most sexual fashion. Like most foodstuffs of this particular supermarket, they believe that the gods (read as: us) live in a place of paradise just beyond the automatic doors, and they come in every day to select the lucky individuals to liberate. Of course the reality is that they get cut, cooked, eaten, and thrown away, but the hope of a better afterlife is enough to keep the store's atmosphere bright and hopeful for it's many denizens. It's a world that's promptly shattered when an item is returned ranting and raving about the horrors he's seen, and a suicide leads to Frank and Brenda out of their packages and alone on the shop floor.<br/><br/>Being a Seth Rogen movie, you simply cannot be surprised at the sheer depravity of crude this movie devolves into, but I kind of was. There's no sugar-coating here, and not an awful lot of subtext either. When they mean sex, they say it and describe it in the most over-the-top, innuendo way. I mean if the whole concept of a sausage wanting to insert himself into a bun for pleasure doesn't clue you in to the depths this movie will go, nothing will.<br/><br/>With what freedoms the animators were accorded due to the characters all being food, there are some pretty graphic sequences. Even when it doesn't use innuendo or metaphor, it doesn't hold back. Banana's have their faces peeled off, sausages are sliced in half, carrots are eaten alive, cans of spaghetti have their 'guts' spilling out over the floor, and there is a literal bloody eyeball rolling around. I can handle my gore, and while this wasn't exactly gory, it still hit me as a little disturbing.<br/><br/>While it's far from subtle in it's approach to just about everything, Sausage Party isn't all shock and explicitness. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it a clever movie, it does have it's moments of wit. A big theme of the movie is religion. The foodstuffs worship the gods that pick them and take them to 'The Great Beyond' and when met with the realisation that all is not what they imagined, they deny it and carry on in ignorance. It's like a Christian being shown proof of Evolution. All the same arguments are there. There's also a great exchange between a hebrew bagel and a Muslim lavash who have found themselves sharing an aisle. They're asked if they could just share it; it's big enough, and they just look at each other and laugh. Palestine in a nutshell. There's also the sourkraut who want to wipe out the juice, and a group of non- perishables (one native American) who sit around a marshmallow fire smoking weed from a kazoo.<br/><br/>These religiously tinged jokes were probably the ones I found the funniest (plus the toilet roll). But a lot of the jokes are typical Seth Rogen affair, relying maybe a little too much on crass sexuality and language to appeal to your inner teenage boy. Hurr hurr the sausage looks like a penis, so lets put it inside a vaginal-looking bun, and dangle it between a human's legs. Hurr hurr, douche's clean out vaginas, so lets make this douche (played, humorously, by Parks and Rec's own The Douche) obsessed with cameltoes and putting himself in holes.<br/><br/>I like a good Seth Rogen movie every now and then, and I figured Sausage Party had enough of an original concept to mark it with some of his best. Unfortunately it just tried too hard. It went too far with the freedom and pressure a cartoon offers for an adult audience. I'm sure they had a lot of fun making cute little carrots swear, or imagining what sexual intercourse between a taco and a bun would look like (spoiler: they use a sausage as a strap-on), but for me I feel they could've concentrated a little more on the satirical element built-in rather than falling back on the same dick and stoner jokes Rogen's movies are always rife with. A very adult and graphic cartoon about food is a fresh idea, but the jokes that flesh it out are the same jokes we've heard a million times before. It did get a few audible laughs out of me though, so it's not a complete failure. I give Sausage Party an above average 6/10. Would I watch it again? No, probably not. Maybe I'm more of a prude than I thought?!"

","Sausage Party was one hell of a great movie. It just wasn't for me. <br/><br/>Sausage Party is like Toy Story, but with food. The food live in a grocery store and look forward to when gods come and take them out of the store to the Great Beyond where they'll live out their wildest dreams. However, they're about to learn the horrible truth about what the gods plan to do with them once they leave the store.<br/><br/>This movie is raunchy as hell. Possibly the dirtiest comedy I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The biggest surprise to me was how intelligent the film was. The entire movie was a giant metaphor for religion and the dangers of blindly following a belief system at the detriment of those around you. But, in film hell bent on offending everybody, I actually feel this was handled rather tactfully, and rather than coming off as anti-religion, it managed to properly convey a message of pro- tolerance, and pro-knowledge, and comes to a conclusion that even if you can't agree with someone's belief, you won't accomplish anything by shoving your beliefs down their throats, which is a message many people need to learn.<br/><br/>It's certainly funny and thought provoking, but amid these moments, the movie is glued together with the same tired weed jokes you come to expect from a Seth Rogen film, and these just aren't funny anymore. <br/><br/>Also, funny the first time, is seeing a cute piece of food swear. However, the writers failed to realize that this shock humour really only works once.When they made the decision to pointlessly insert expletives into nearly every line in the movie all they did was take their intelligent writing and made it come off as juvenile. <br/><br/>Sausage Party would have probably been better off as a short film.

","There are very few major Hollywood studio animated movies made for adults, so it's a double shame when one of them does not work, since the failure probably won't encourage more to be made. ""Sausage Party"" is unfortunately one of those failures. What makes it even a sadder failure is that you see a better, cleverer, and funny movie seemingly being held back by a creative team that has the wrong idea of what an adult audience would like. I will admit that the movie is fairly well animated for what wasn't a mega budget. And occasionally there is a gag that will make the viewer smile or even chuckle a little. But unfortunately, the level of humor for the most part is pretty wrong-headed. We get offensive racial stereotypes, questionable attempts at humor (such as a ""rape"" sequence involving food products), and the belief that characters constantly uttering foul language is the stuff of hilarity. I wasn't bored, but all the same I sat in my TV chair pretty stone-faced throughout. If you are looking for animation made for an adult audience, look for an offering from Japan instead."

Personally, I'm not a big fan of movies that only exist to be raunchy (as you may be able to tell), but this movie is different. The way they try to sexualize food, and build sexual tension between food items hits every nerve in the human body that evokes disgust. <br/><br/>Now, that's one reason to dislike this movie, but that's not why I dislike it. The reason I dislike it, is because it takes itself too seriously. The minute they tried getting preachy, or incorporating social commentary, I couldn't stand it. Imagine someone walks up to you, Jacks off in your face, and makes a bunch of crappy jokes about rape, and then suddenly tries to talk politics with you, and expects to be taken seriously. That's how it felt watching this movie. As an audience member, I felt insulted that this was the mental standard I was being held to. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if I were to use one word to describe this movie, it would be 'pretentious'.

Although due to their lack of maturity, 10 to 12 year old children will find it hilarious, especially the soft core porn scenes towards the end.<br/><br/>I could not recommend this movie to anyone unless you have scrambled, or regularly scramble, your brains with drugs as this is the only way you would find it entertaining.<br/><br/>The worst thing abut this movie: Everything from the opening credits to the final scene.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie: The closing credits.<br/><br/>The copyright warning is the funniest moment which made me chuckle, because who in their right mind would even consider copying this garbage?"

","This might just be one of the stupidest movies I've seen this year. There were just way too many lame jokes and too much profanity in the movie. And most importantly; it just wasn't funny. I seriously couldn't laugh at any scene in the movie. The humor was just too one- dimensional. How any person with an IQ over 100 can find this funny is beyond me. At least 90% of all the jokes in the movie were sexual innuendos that I saw coming a mile away. There were also no memorable scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>I like Seth Rogen but this movie was utter tripe. He shouldn't have taken part in this abomination of a movie."

The jokes were not really there and there was not really a memorable scene in the movie other then the food orgy that was really unnecessary and seemed out of place. The ending was very disappointing as well I won't spoil it for anyone but lets just say it missed its mark."
"dragonslayer-87950","4","1","4","7 March 2017"," Subject: An Immature Movie With A Mature Message..
","WARGING POSSIBLE SPOILERS: OS= Not my usual type cup of tea, if it wasn't for the mature message I would have shout it off.<br/><br/>Pros = 1. The opening song is a little amusing so say the least for me.I guess that is the a positive considering it's not Frozen or Moana or any kind of Disney film after all, far from it.<br/><br/>2. I absolutely loved the animation in this it is shiny and glossy considering the type of message that they are trying to convey, I found the colour way too bright and cheerful in the light. And even in the dark it was still a little too bright for my tastes. I almost felt like I was watching a Toy Story movie. But as I have said the colour bright and vibrant, I some time like it and some times hate it.<br/><br/>3. The metaphors to which the message this movie tries to convey are clear, the reason I added this to 'Pros' is because the movie doesn't force you to look really hard and try to catch every single one of those metaphors. And take you out of the movie experience and at the same time it's tell you that it's more than just a movie where things happen and you the audience supposed to laugh your but off at those brainless things. But in the end I feel that is exactly what it is a brainless movie where stuff happens and you are supposed to laugh your butt off at it. This isn't The Matrix after all, and I guess for that reason alone should earn it on the 'Pros' list. But at the same time feel that they think that we the audience are too dumb to look for those metaphors and figure them out. But I forgive it considering it's not supposed to be that way as I have said NOT The Matrix.<br/><br/>4. Even this movie isn't my usual cup of tea I still found it funny in some parts when I had my brain turned off. More on that a little later..<br/><br/>5. The Cultures of the ethnic products that they are supposed to represent I feel are very accurate, spectrally for the Mexican products.<br/><br/>6. As before I feel the message of the movie is very clear, they literally spill it out for us the audience, the reasons for this to be in the 'Pros' is the same reason for the metaphors.<br/><br/>Cons= 1. I feel they purposely go out their way to be crud and at time offensive, in the first five minutes alone after the opening song I have at least counted a swear word in every sentence. Just because it is an 'R' Rated film and a film that is targeted at young teens and Adulations DOESN'T mean that you have to be rude and crud every chance that you get in the film. Hare is a clean version of what I heard for most of the film if not all. ""What are F F. talking abut? I will F..ing F..you up. you M..Fer F..FF.."" I think you got the picture? And I felt it was like that through out most if not the whole movie.<br/><br/>2. Be warned it is a little offensive to Mexicans, sorry I can't be more clear that that. I didn't specify in my notes. I think it's just for one scene I think? The following are either Hit (PROS) or Miss (CONS)= 1. It takes a while for the humour to kick in, for me at least. I didn't really start laughing until the 20 to 36 minutes into the film. And everything before it was like ""HA.HAHA.HAHA.HA..HA.HA.HA.HAHAHA..HAHA."" for me. Which brings me back to the humour thing, (Reference 'Pros' 4) 2. This movie to NO SURPRISE LACKS LOGIC, and what I mean by that is some things in the like a knifes do not move and are NOT alive, and other objects such as a Roll of Toilet Paper are. I wished they set a rule or a standard of what's alive and why and what's not and why. I don't know I guess that's a little nip pick I just have.<br/><br/>3. This movie is rattled with 'Parodies' all over the place for NO apparent reason except in attempt to be funny and clever. Such as Stargate at the end or Terminator 2's T-1000 etc. If it DIDN'T work for Reboot well guess what? it DIDN'T work hare.<br/><br/>4. The 'Calibration' after when the food products 'Defeat' the 'Gods' or the humans is what you expect for this type of Immature Movie. Well lets just say it's a type of group celebration you wouldn't take your kids to.<br/><br/>CP= Overall at it's core it's still targeted at Immature Audiences ONLY! If you're looking for s thinking than just like me this IS NOT your thing. Like me I suggest you look else where for that because you won't find it hare."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","4","2 December 2016"," What You'd Expect from a Sausage Party Movie
","Sausage Party (2016) <br/><br/>** (out of 4)<br/><br/>From the pothead mind of Seth Rogan comes this adults only animated feature that takes place in a grocery store. The basic plot is that the food has been led to believe that if they are chosen and taken to the outside then they have a great life ahead of them. They do realize that the Gods (humans) are actually taking them out of the store to eat them. A hot dog and a bun, madly in love with each other, must try to convince people of what's really going on.<br/><br/>You know, I didn't hate SAUSAGE PARTY but at the same time you can tell that a bunch of stoners wrote it. I can just imagine the group sitting around a table, passing a joint around and once their minds are blown they begin talking about weird stuff and the idea of talking food comes up. I can see them grabbing the various foods in the house and acting out what would eventually come the screenplay. All of that is fine and good. Back in my younger days when I smoked I came up with some pretty funny and weird things.<br/><br/>This movie would have worked a lot better had it been a thirty-minute short film because clocking in at 87-minutes there are just way too many jokes that don't work and on the whole the film just really seems to drag. After all, there's really not much of a plot or any sort of character development. You're basically watching talking food carry on and say a bunch of dirty words and sexual innuendo. Again, some of it is funny but for the most part I just didn't think enough of the jokes worked. The vocal performances are fine. The animation is great. It's just not funny enough to really be worth watching."

","Frank is a sausage who has always wanted to be purchased and ""go home,"" but he does not yet know the truth. What he does not know is that his kind is used as a snack and he strives to find the truth of his existence in this cruel food-eating world.<br/><br/>From the trailer, I figured this was going to be 90 minutes of profanity. And for the most part, that is accurate. The cursing is excessive, far beyond what should ever be in a movie. (I'm not opposed to profanity, but at a certain point it goes beyond the way any real person would talk.) What saves this film from just being curse words and mediocre animation is its social commentary. Maybe it does not say anything original, but it says the unoriginal in an original way. And, more importantly, it explains that beating your point of view over someone's head -- even if you're right -- is never the wise move.<br/><br/>Great movie? Hardly. But there is something of a silver lining to this ridiculously juvenile film."

","Can you imagine this and Food Fight as a double feature? You'd get two times the laughs even though only Sausage Party's were intentional.<br/><br/>While not perfect, sometimes clichéd and relied heavily on swearing to fill in aimless writing zones, this was a hoot and worth the whole trip. Speaking of which, in three days we Phoenicians will find out if we can, in fact, watch this while trippinglegally, anyways.<br/><br/>I digressThe movie was clever for the most part and got progressively funnier until the climaxclimax. Sausage Party basically is an atheist story and yet still promotes personal beliefs. That's mostly hard to do, so well done, guys.<br/><br/>The film's grocery store is filled with fourth dimensional living beings we gods, er humans, refer to as products. They believe once they're selected, and not expired, they'll go to the great beyond and live happily. Well, no. But, they don't know thatthey can't possibly start to doubt their religions<br/><br/>There's much more to the plot as I gave the briefest of synopsizes. Fill in the gaps with multiple subplots, cussing, sexual innuendos, hope and even bun-curious behavior. It's cute, NOT for kids and while it doesn't add much to your life, it's a freaking fun ride that sometimes barely lets up. Totally worth it.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I wish I had seen this in theatres. I would probably laugh just as hard seeing the parents leaving abruptly with their children five minutes in as the movie itself. I mean, reallynot all cartoons are for kids. Much like not all adults should bear children."
"franzkowmaxwell","Null","1","4","4 October 2016"," Sausage Party review
","Sausage party brought in a whole new kind of movie into the film industry. It is the first ever R- rated CG-animated film. Because of this, it created much hype around the country as many people were dying to see this movie when it first came out. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. As matter of fact, it didn't even come close. Not only is the movie disgusting and corny, it's just not very funny.<br/><br/>The movie opens with all the items in the store singing a song dedicated to the gods. These gods are humans who arrive every day to shop and buy these items and supposedly take them to ""The Great Beyond."" Seth Rogan stars as Frank, a hot dog in a package of eight. As all the items start singing in the morning when the market opens, one can hear Rogan's horrifying laugh to start off the movie on a bad note. The tone and enthusiasm in Rogan's voice in the first scene indicates that the whole movie is going to be the obnoxious laugh of the sausage Frank. As the movie progresses, it only proves this point to be correct. Towards the end of this movie, Franks laugh is like hearing nails on a chalkboard repeatedly. It's hard to have bad acting in an animated movie, but Sausage Party accomplished that. <br/><br/>Yes, swearing food is humorous at first, but the 100th time a sausage curses in a ten-minute scene seems to be a bit excessive. The language chosen in this movie loses its originality after the first two scenes when cursing food becomes the ordinary. By the time the movie hit the last scene, I was worn out of food items cursing and having sex, praying the movie will finally be over soon.<br/><br/>The overall plot of Sausage Party had some potential. Making a movie of this degree though is asking for failure. With this plot, the movie would have had to have been directed and produced brilliantly to make Sausage Party worthwhile to go see. This did not happen. The whole movie is a herd of food items swearing at each other while a hot dog and bun go on a quest to make love. One can tell at the start of the movie that the film will end with them eventually being together, making the movie very predictable and not suspenseful. It's a rare site to see a movie like this nail it, and you can add another check mark in the loss column. <br/><br/>So ask yourself. Should you go see this movie because of it's one of a kind nature? I would say no. The film was put together by two people who live in the same fantasy. The film wants you to see it the way they do and live in the fantasy with them. I can tell you from experience that this is a very hard task. The acting, language, and plot scared me away from liking this movie. A faulty movie is not made better by cursing vegetables or horny sausages'. It's still simply an inadequately made movie."

When they realize we eat food and do not take it to heaven, they begin a revolt, which includes animated scenes of brutal human deaths including decapitation and anal sex with inanimate objects until people die.<br/><br/>The movie is full of profanity, more than any movie goers would ever want to hear and almost every scene of full of violence, sexual innuendo and homosexual innuendo, all ending in an orgy of different foods having sex, giving fellatio and doing anal sex with each other.<br/><br/>Aside from needing an X or maybe a double X rating, this movie is just plain disgusting in general.

I cant deny that some parts had me laughing out loud but after the first act is when the horror started kicking in.<br/><br/>To start off with the good i have one main thing that i actually enjoyed and it was the satire about modern day view on religion and the many view points that can be had for religion. Basically the food sits in this grocery store waiting for the ""Gods"" to purchase them and take them to the beyond which is basically heaven. All this food sticks to a set of rules that they must obey if they which to reach this beyond aka commandments. Unfortunately one bottle of mustard gets returned to the store and after seeing the horror that is done to all of the food, he then suffers from food PTSD. The main character Frank (Seth Rogen) then goes on a journey to find out whether or not everything they believe is true or false. honestly this is an extremely raunchy comedy about a hotdog/person trying to figure out if god is real and if all the rules are necessary. By the end everyone learns it is all crap and that they can do whatever the hell they want thus bringing me to my negatives.<br/><br/>Negative #1: i nearly puked watching a douche basically rape a juicebox. the music in the background and watching a douche go down on a juicebox sucking out all its juice and then proceeding to crush it to smitherines.<br/><br/>Negative #2: food orgy at the end of the movie.......... how high do you have to be to think of creating an animated orgy with any food that you can think of......<br/><br/>Negative #3: I feel that because they wanted to ""change"" animation for adults that the profanity was just WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! over the top and unnecessary<br/><br/>Negative #4: animation is nothing special in this movie<br/><br/>Overall it has some laugh out loud moments but i cant even remember them because of how disgusted i was with this movie. i still give Seth rogen props for the whole satire on religion but that is it with this movie. nothing else is good about it."

Am I offended by the jabs at religion in this movie hidden in its horribly hidden attempts, or lack thereof, to create a thought-provoking story? No, I'm not particularly religious, and if I were, I would've appreciated a movie that was thought-provoking and made me question what I believe. What offends me is how the movie's premise promised a juxtaposition of thought-provoking commentary and funny adult humor, but I came to find that it completely and utterly fails in both regards.<br/><br/>Sausage Party tried so hard to be funny, with food puns relating to sex peppered throughout that would have been worth a chuckle if they were presented in literally any other manner. The execution was horrid, especially when you consider that the movie promised a fusion of raunchy comedy and profound commentary, but instead provided potentially somewhat-funny jokes ruined by being told akin to an 8 year old who forgot how the punchline was worded.<br/><br/>The supposed attempts at thought-provoking religious commentary reared its head maybe once or twice during 2 minutes total of watchable segments of this atrocity, but were pushed to the back- burner as means to make way for sex jokes and racial stereotypes for particular ethnic food that are not funny in the slightest because, disregarding how these stereotypes have been played to death in adult comedies, there's hardly any joke behind any of it besides ""Haha, look, the taco is Mexican.

I like the fact that religion is also part of the discussion etc. <br/><br/>There were more than one times during the first half hour of the movie that I was actually impressed by the metaphors and the plot.

I think that this was one of these movies that kind of aims to go into depth with things and till a certain point it does, but in the end it goes too deep for anyone's taste. <br/><br/>I would watch it again cause it seems like a movie I wouldn't want to miss, but the feeling in the end is that the movie promised more than it could deliver, or to be on the same context as the movie, it bit more than it could chew!"

","My first experience of an animated movie aimed at adults was South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut, it has been some time since I remember watching an adult cartoon with loads of swearing and crude humour, so I was looking forward to this one, probably the first computer animated adult movie, from the makers of This Is the End. Basically in a supermarket called Shopwell's, the foods, drinks and other groceries come to life, they see the human shoppers as the gods and long to be taken outside to ""the great beyond"". Frank (Seth Rogen) is a sausage, he dreams of going to the great beyond with his hot dog bun girlfriend Brenda (Kristen Wiig), they are chosen by a consumer to leave the store, but a returned jar of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) warns that outside is not what they have been led to believe. An accidental collision heading towards the checkout counters occurs, Frank, Brenda, a lavash (flatbread) named Kareem (David Krumholtz), a bagel named Sammy (Edward Norton) and an aggressive (vaginal irrigation device) Douche (Nick Kroll) fall out of the shopping trolley, Douche being damaged and thrown away by store employee Darren (Paul Rudd) swears revenge. With the rest of the groceries going through the register and taken to the great beyond, Frank, Brenda and the others decide to journey back to their aisles, but Frank fears the warning from the honey mustard, he leads them to the liquor aisle to meet the knowledgeable (moonshine) Firewater (Bill Hader). While the others meet lesbian taco Teresa (Salma Hayek), who expresses a passionate lust for Brenda, Frank learns the truth about the great beyond, all groceries taken are to be eaten by the humans, Firewater invented the story of the great beyond to maintain calm, a Twinkie (Scott Underwood) encourages Frank to visit the store's freezer section to find proof. Meanwhile the rest of the groceries that were purchased discover the truth for themselves, many of them are killed, cooked and eaten, sausage Barry (Michael Cera) manages to escape and wanders the outside world, before finding a Shopwell's bag, belonging to a human junkie (James Franco), to jump into. The junkie injects himself with bath salts, becoming intoxicated, he is able to see Barry and other groceries coming to life, the items realise that humans can only see them living while under the influence of bath salts, after sobering up the junkie assumes he experienced a dream, an accident occurs when he tries to throw Barry into boiling water, he ends up decapitated, the other groceries are free. Frank reunites with the others and tells that he intends to travel to the freezer to learn more about he what he learned, Brenda questions his motives, and rejects Teresa's advances due to the ""rules"", Frank manages to find a cookbook, he has proof of the truth of the fate of the groceries, using security cameras he warns the rest of Shopwell's, there is initially panic, but soon everyone doesn't believe him. Brenda is rescued by Frank from being purchased again, he is then reunited with Barry who has returned to Shopwell's with his new friends, he reveals that the humans can be killed and can be communicated with when under the influence of bath salts, Frank gives the store a sense of hope, apologising for not respecting their beliefs, and gives an aspiring speech. The foods devise a plan to shoot all human customers with toothpicks laced with bath salts, they can they see them for what they are, the humans are panicked and a battle ensues, meanwhile Douche gets control of Darren, inserting his nozzle into his anus, the foods overpower and kill all humans. Finally free, all foods of the store engage in a massive celebratory orgy, later though they are informed by the Stephen Hawking-esque wad of chewing gum (Scott Underwood) that he and Firewater have discovered something greater, they do not exist and are merely cartoon characters created for the entertainment of humans, and voiced by celebrities another dimension, a portal will allow them travel to this dimension, the foods decide to go there. Also starring Jonah Hill as Carl the sausage, Bill Hader as Tequila and El Guaco and Craig Robinson as Grits (hominy grits). Rogen, Wiig, Norton, Kroll and the others all voice their characters well, complete with a witty script containing plenty of food and drink based puns, I loved meatloaf singing Meat Loaf, and the over-the-top near pornographic orgy of foods doing everything from intercourse to oral and anal, it is funny, also slightly disturbing with living food being munched, it is slightly longer than perhaps necessary and the swearing is a bit samey, but overall it is humorous animated comedy.

","The trailer used to promise a lot but then when it came out the reviews suggested that this film hasn't quite set the world on fire, so I was watching it with zero expectations but looking for some laughs. If you think about the idea itself, the fact that foods, drinks etc. have lives, they talk, see etc. and are like humans or animals, one can't resist being fascinated by it, but the application left a lot to desire.<br/><br/>The first 20-25 minutes were a total headache really, with every phrase filled with the F-word three -four times - it was beginning to drive me mad but then once they get out of the market the film gets better and finally funny. The Arabic Sheikh style lavash was the funniest character, as was the physically disabled chewing-gum on the motorised wheelchair. Some jokes were really funny during that particular phase of it.<br/><br/>BUT!<br/><br/>Then the film-maker seemed to end the film in a fashion that made it resemble to a drawing by a child who does his job neatly but then draws random lines on the paper to ruin his work just because he has set his eyes on the toy lying next to him.

","First of all, I am not some new parent complaining about how inappropriate it is. I am a young adult, which is their target audience. To be honest if you muted this movie 90% of it would PG. The only reason it was R was due to swearing and a graphic animated sex scene that could easily be taken out without affecting the plot. The jokes were cliché and predictable, which was a huge let down for an adult film supposedly filled with good humor. I have no problem with swearing as long as it has a purpose, this movie had no purpose for swearing. It was not used for humor, dramatic effect, or a sense of power. The swearing felt more like a small child constantly over using the same word until it just makes them seem dumb and obnoxious. The plot was the exact same thing as the trailer. If you watch the trailer you have seen the plot and the only funny moments. It felt to me like it would have been a good child's movie, but it was incredibly redundant and boring as an adult film."
"jordanhuntgeneral","Null","1","6","31 August 2016"," The most unorthodox comedy in recent history.
","Striving to offend as many minorities as possible without so much as a hint of subtlety, the Seth Rogen masterminded 'Sausage Party' is a razor-sharp animated feature that proudly competes with 'South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut' for the title of most distasteful R-rated cartoon. Everything from homosexuality to the Holocaust is targeted in this unashamedly disrespectful, though at times somewhat profound, mockery of Disney and Pixar's finest.<br/><br/>Likely originating from the dulled neurons of a particularly stoned Hollywood actor, this film wears its influences proudly with its constant riff on the animation format, right down to the Alan Menken musical number. The result is a bizarre, surreal experience that somehow manages to exist as both a racial commentary and a religious allegory.<br/><br/>Much like Pixar are consistently able to get so much mileage out of a single premise, 'Sausage Party' wastes no time in reeling out pun after pun, meaning that for every joke that doesn't impress, there is one mere seconds away that is bound to stick the landing. There are far too many visual gags to appreciate in one sitting, and chances are you'll be laughing so much that you'll miss many a good line.<br/><br/>Rogen's associated acts, as per usual, are on board either as an effort to establish a stellar billing or merely because its convenient, and this reviewer is inclined to believe that it's the latter. Ultimately there is no real charm to the casting; whereas the relaxed nature of these performers essentially playing themselves worked in 'This Is The End', here it is more of a distraction. It speaks volumes that, apart from Edward Norton's standout as a Jewish bagel, the only other player seemingly having fun with their role is one of the storyboard artists.<br/><br/>In a bold effort to be thoroughly crude and overly offensive, 'Sausage Party' succeeds in abundance by throwing everything including the kitchen sink at the wall and watching what sticks. The end product is the most unorthodox comedy in recent history - a simple barrel of laughs that still manages to leave you scratching your head at the end - but it's also some of the best work that Rogen and his contemporaries have ever put out."

","Lining up on a Saturday night with my good friend at the Ward Theaters, a young couple no later than their thrities walked up to the counter and the man asked, ""May I have two tickets to Hotdog Party at eight o'clock?"" His company, a good looking lady, slapped him playfuly while laughing, ""It's Sausage Party hun.""<br/><br/>Following the comical acquisition of movie tickets, my friend and I barley made it into the theater right when it was about to start. The amount of young couples was abnormal. Sausage Party invites many viewers for its possibly fun and entertaining plot, but presents a horrifying and tasteless humor to potential young audiences.<br/><br/>Most people who watch the movie have no idea what they are doing, much less what drama they're getting into. The couple infront of me who didn't even know the title of the movie doesn't care about the movie. No one cares what the movie is or what it's about, their friedns told them it was good, thus they go to the theaters.<br/><br/>The content of the movie was funny while watching, but in hindsight I find that there are large parts of the movie that are potentially too politically incorrect. It is not a movie for everyone, but if being a frequent visitor of the internet sounds like you, this movie will be amusing."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","5","1","7","5 September 2016"," 'Sausage Party' relies too heavily on one key joke: the animated food swears. And this goes on for eighty-nine minutes.
","'Sausage Party' is an animated comedy conceived by Seth Rogan and crew, a supposedly subversive satire centred on a single premise: the anthropomorphised animated food swears. A lot. The flick should have used its R-rating to its advantage by telling a more adult, nuanced story that appeals to grown-up sensibilities and issues. Instead, all we get is a preposterous PG plot peppered prominently with plenty of profanity. Seriously, the only jokes in the film revolve around the characters cursing and that gets tiring after mere minutes – I personally was tired of it from the multiple times I have viewed the trailer. Once you accept that the food are all adults and will therefore say adult things using adult language, there is nothing to laugh about as no actual jokes are being made. There isn't subtlety here, with immature crudity perforating the picture and seemingly replacing actual comedy at times. It is a missed opportunity, one with few surprises and even fewer laughs, which comes across as severely under-cooked. <br/><br/>The plot, as I said, is like something ripped straight out of Pixar's 'discarded ideas' pile. Instead of breaking down and circumventing the traditional Disney-esque formula, the film panders to it indefinitely. As such, the story is very by-the-numbers and predictable. The central premise is also inconsistent; some of the characters aren't actually food-stuffs (i.e. a condom or a toilet- roll) but still appear alive, whilst other similar objects aren't sentient at all (like shoes and shopping carts etc.) The other issue also comes when it is shown that cereal boxes and bags of crisps are sentient themselves, as opposed to the individual fillings, but the hot-dogs are shown to all be alive despite being contained in a packet similar to the aforementioned items. This hurts the credibility of the piece and, though it isn't a huge issue, it did take me out of the movie on more than one occasion. The actual narrative seems like it could be a kid's film, with a number of the jokes feeling ironically childish, so the added sexual humour and frequent cursing almost seem like an afterthought. Instead of using the R-rating to its full potential to craft an adult tale, in the vein of other animated features like 'Anomalisa', the creators simply throw juvenile jokes and immature crudity at the proverbial wall and hope it sticks. This means that the feature seems like a one-trick pony, riding entirely on the premise that was funny in a 2 minute trailer but can't sustain itself for a full feature. It culminates in an outlandish third act that's a little too out-there even for a movie about talking sausages. There is a scene towards the end that is very vulgar and over-the-top, but it isn't funny and goes on for ages. I can see why this would make people uncomfortable as it kind of comes out of nowhere and is very unnecessary. Plus, the final revelation is unearned and ridiculous – so much so that it leaves a sour taste in your mouth after the flick ends.<br/><br/>The most glaring issue with the picture is that I didn't find it funny at all. I cracked a smile maybe once, which means that it sort of fails as a comedy. Like I mentioned, the food cursing gets old fast and starts to become a little obnoxious. Other than that key premise, there isn't much to laugh at aside from a few tired and oddly childish food-puns. I'm not going to lie though, a gag about 'meatloaf' and a reference to 'T2: Judgement Day' were both subtle, fairly amusing and well-done. The other main element to the piece is its satire; a hyper-stylised view of religion, as well as a push towards blatant atheism. It culminates in a pretty positive message of acceptance, teamwork, hope and respecting people's beliefs but is half-baked on the whole. The allegory doesn't gel properly with its real-life counter-part, meaning that it lacks in impact and ends up going around in circles. Every character is a stereotype, too, which some people may find offensive. There are no real character arcs and none of them have any depth; they mainly exist to illicit a chuckle at the expense of the culture, race or religion they represent without actually making a joke. The flick seems to think that stereotypically portraying a culture as a specific food-type is enough to count as clever comedy. <br/><br/>The voice acting is all fairly good here but, aside from Edward Norton, the players aren't doing anything special; they are convincing though, giving off the appropriate emotions at the appropriate times, and can be quite nuanced occasionally. The animation itself isn't the best, but is competent and convincing despite a clearly lower budget. The actual CGI looks rubbery and the character designs, especially those of the humans, are often flawed. The people are pretty poor here, looking disproportionate and generally weird, but luckily there isn't too many of them. The music is generic and unnoticeable, with an opening musical number coming across as out-of-place, nonsensical and overly-cheesy. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Sausage Party' is an under-cooked disappointment that relies too much on a joke that was only moderately chuckle worthy to begin with; the animation is decent but not outstanding, the character designs are odd, the narrative is generic and the flick isn't funny. I don't hate the film, it isn't egregious and not the worst of the year, but it could've – and should've - been much better: 5/10"

","Animation geared toward adults can be enjoyable. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut comes to mind, along with the show that it is based on. But when the quality of the animation far supersedes the quality of the script, characters, and story...then you've gone terribly wrong. Such is the case with Sausage Party, Seth Rogen's first foray into the world of theatrical animation. As with many of Rogen's outings, this one falls short in a number of areas.<br/><br/>But, as always, I like to begin with the positive, and this movie did have a couple. For one, the antagonist in the movie is always making an admittedly funny food pun, followed by the appearance of the product he's referring to. This product will then ask why he was calling them, to which he gets progressively frustrated as the movie continues. There's also a pretty good scene where a literal package of meatloaf arrives and sings, ""I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),"" and there's a nice analogy of the conflict in the Middle East when the Jewish and Islamic foods cannot learn how to share the same aisle.<br/><br/>Other than that, this movie was a travesty from beginning to end. The script is one of the worst I've ever heard. All of the profanity and ""adult humor"" is forced and contrived beyond belief. The difference between South Park and this is that pretty much all the swearing in South Park comes from immature fourth grade boys who don't know any better. In Sausage Party, it's coming from characters we're supposed to take seriously. Throw in a lot of Rogen's ridiculous jokes in support of getting as high as possible, and you have the makings of a terrible film.<br/><br/>The story is absurd. A sausage having an existential crisis? So...what about the pig, beef, and/or chicken he came from? Did they have existential crises before him? What about the packaged foods? Also, how the heck did Firewater and the rest of the non-perishables manage to get their story of ""The Great Beyond"" to every item in the store? Do they tell it to the new items when they come in on the supply truck? The entire thing leaves you with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>I won't be watching this ever again. It's stupid at its best and diabolically asinine at its worst. Sure, there's a semi-clever food pun every now and again, but when your dialogue is 95% curse words, weed jokes, and sex puns, then you've gone terribly wrong somewhere. So yes, this is a Seth Rogen film...and it's made me realize that the greatest character he's ever played was that little mantis in Kung Fu Panda."

","Sausage Party is based on a singular premise. ""It's a cartoon but they swear and do sexy things! Isn't that crazy?!"" You needn't delve any deeper, because the writers evidently didn't either. And they also evidently have never seen any cartoon from the 90s or 2000s, or they would know that this style of comedy has been done to death by so many others that we, the audience, are no longer shocked or amused by the simple utterance of a swear word. If they were intending to pander explicitly to 13 year olds who have just learned the full array of swear words available to them, or to youths too high to formulate coherent thoughts (and let's be honest, these guys are no stranger to these audiences), then they've done their job, but at the cost of dumbing it down to the level of pure cringe inducing, over-the-top idiocy.<br/><br/>This is quite disappointing coming from these writers. Rogen, Goldberg and Hill have certainly been around the block when it comes to stoner comedy. Superbad (2007), Pineapple Express (2008) and This Is The End (2013) were all goofy and ridiculous, but they were able to pull it back just enough to leave room for something else besides swearing and sexual innuendo. And that's important. You can make a movie where swearing and dick jokes are the only source of humor (and they did), but it's going to suck. I won't mince words here. This humor is puerile, idiotic and takes no skill or effort.<br/><br/>This movie feels the need to constantly bash you over the head with it's comedy and it's metaphors. ""Do you get it? The sausages are penises! Do you get it?!"" This is what it felt like watching the movie. It wasn't an enjoyable experience. It was a chore to wade through the overt and pointless exposition. Does every character need to be extremely horny, drunk or a babbling moron? The song at the very beginning could have been gold, but they chose to go the easiest route of literalness, with not even a hint of subtlety. It seemed like they weren't sure that people would get the religious metaphors, so they made sure to slap you in the face with it. There is no trust in the audience to get anything not spelled out in giant glowing letters. It's not only childish, it's insulting. I mean, the evil character, the one that is a huge jerk the whole movie, is literally a douche. Come on.<br/><br/>Where do you go from here? It's seems like the writers and directors have exhausted the very limits of low-brow. You cannot get lower than this. The brow has sunk below the feet, under the earth, burned in the core of the earth. The same place where every copy of this movie should be, lest anyone suffer as I and many other have. The creators need to rewatch some Cartoon Network, brush up on how to do raunchy animated comedy, and then try again. Or better yet, stick to live action."

","Sausage Party is a Seth Rogan film, indeed, in the closing credits he appears several times, and that's the problem. Even though the animation is as clever as anything you'll see out of Dreamworks or Pixar, this is still a Seth Rogan film with, now, very familiar style of humour. I did laugh out loud once, and to be fair, the animation (if not the humour) was sufficiently inspiring for me to see the movie through to the end. Hollywood as well as Britain has a similar problem with comedy that is does with sci-fi, in particular superheroes, zombies and anything initially successful, in that it will endlessly repeat such successful themes. From America come Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell comedies, one after another, which to some of us appear more of the same. From Britain come huge sex-based comedies such as Little Britain. Seth Rogan comedies follow a similar pattern, although his movies This Is The End (2013) and The Interview (2014) did represent something classically different. In the same way Sausage Party represents something different again. It's still basically powered by massive sexual innuendo and stoner culture however, like almost all of his work. Much as I'm sure that that is exactly why people love him, for those that find such humour immature, then I think it important in a review to point out that that is still very much what one is getting into when you elect to see this show."

Granted, there are a few clever elements that are extremely funny (Gum as Stephen Hawking), but for the most part it's a senseless sex comedy that tries really hard but ultimately falls flat. The plot is ridiculous, humans being evil gods for eating (or rather ""killing"" the food), and they can enter the 4th dimension and understand and interact with the food when they get high on bath salts. The main character Frank the sausage wants to find out the truth about what actually happens when food leaves the grocery store. Is it paradise, or will they die? The other villain besides humans is the douchebag. LOL. I tried to enjoy it, I really did, but I was just sitting there asking myself WHY? What is the film trying to achieve? I get that the different foods represent different cultures and ethnic groups. So what? The climax is nothing but a fight against the humans in the grocery store. How dare the humans eat (kill) food? This is a movie, yes. Completely implausible, yes. Pointless? Absoutely. It would have been way better as a 30 minute short.

","Living in blissful ignorance, the food products at a small supermarket consider a revolt after learning that humans buy them to eat them in this animated comedy that purposely pushes the boundaries of good taste (pun intended). While it raises unanswered questions galore, the basic premise is not half-bad and touching on issues of racial intolerance, religion versus atheism and sexual repression, the film even has a couple of good ideas. Most of the intelligence is, however, obscured by the film's penchant for gross-out gags and so much sexual innuendo that one can only wonder the biological purpose of food copulating. The high amount of swearing and obscene language does not feel natural either. With a swear word inserted into almost every line, it often feels as if the filmmakers simply thought that the idea of food swearing was funny in itself. Same goes for the excessive long scenes of the food products getting high. The film is not a total waste though and it is actually rather funny in parts with some very good vocal work. Top credit goes to Edward Norton for a spot-on impersonation of Woody Allen, with David Krumholtz equally as effective in his banter with Norton. There is some neat fourth wall breaking towards the end too if one can make it through without being deterred by the filmmakers trying (often too hard) to be as politically incorrect as possible here."

","Since most animations are targeted to children, it's always exciting to see an animation that is targeted to adults. While some adult animations like Anomalisa use an R rating to create a very serious and adult movie that seeks to send a message to viewers, others such as Sausage Party use an R rating to fill a generic story with vulgar language and sexual innuendos. While some aspects of Sausage Party are interesting, the comedy is very repetitive and gets old very quickly. So let's begin by addressing some of the better parts of Sausage Party:<br/><br/>1.Animation: Since Sausage Party is made by a big studio, it is no surprise that the animation is pretty good. The various environments as well as the characters are very interesting and can be clever. However, there is one scene in the movie where it is clear that the animators reused another scene from the beginning in the movie, which seems really lazy. <br/><br/>2.Characters: While the characters themselves are pretty bland, it is interesting to see how the animators made characters out of food. Other than that, the characters are pretty generic and are a stereotype of certain races or cultures that are connected to the food item. Perhaps one of the best character in the movie would be Douche. The idea behind the character as well as the way Nick Kroll voices the character makes for perhaps the funniest scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>3.Story: One of the weakest part of Sausage Party would be the plot due to being very predictable and clichéd. The plot revolves around the main character trying to find the truth and struggle to spread the truth to his friends. Overall, there's not much to say about the weak plot to Sausage Party other than its very weak and predictable.<br/><br/>4.Jokes: Although Sausage Party is labeled as a comedy, the jokes aren't very funny. The jokes usually revolve around characters either cursing, making a joke involving sex, or a joke involving racism. As previously mentioned, the only funny bits come from Douche. After a while, the jokes become repetitive and stupid.<br/><br/>In the end, Sausage Party is a ""comedy"" that has interesting animation and one funny character. However, the rest of the movie is either generic or repetitive and doesn't evoke many laughs.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 5/10"

","SAUSAGE PARTY is a good movie in the same way someone might describe McDonald's as being a satisfying meal. There are laughs, you get what you paid for, but in the end you leave feeling a bit sick for enjoying it and vow to change your eating habits before next time. I mean viewing habits. Seth Rogen's stoner homage to Disney & Pixar is surely filled with moments that will make audiences gasp and laugh, but if we are going to watch an R-rated animated film about talking food, is it bad for me to ask for better quality?<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was unaware it was an adult-themed movie until about midway through. We see a hot dog weiner flirting with a feminine-looking bun, and I recall thinking this was a bit risqué even for a kid's movie. Then came the carnage and I understood. The basic premise is that food is alive. When we purchase it at grocery stores, they know little of the horrors that are soon to come. Humans are merely gods who are here to take food into the glorious afterlife. They even have a song welcoming our arrival each morning.<br/><br/>It's the Fourth of July so Bun and Weiner (I forget their names, but wouldn't that only confuse you?) are excited to finally get to spend time together. They are packaged near one another, and dream of the day they are finally selected to go to the great beyond. As plot would have it, they are purchased, but by a strange twist of fate, they esape their packaging and roll away in a deadly two-cart collision. The rest of the hot dogs go home to discover the true horrors of dinnertime, while Bun and Weiner meet some friends at the store (a Jewish bagel (complete with Woody Allen's accent) and a Middle Eastern flatbread, complete with beard). Their plan is to return to packaging to be sold tomorrow.<br/><br/>Remember ""The Interview"" and the buzz that was built up prior to its Netflix release? What a disappointment the film ended up being, and in many ways this movie measures up just as well. A sort of passion project for Seth Rogen over the past 10 years, it's sad to think this is the end result. The plot is meandering and the situations these foods find themselves in uninteresting. The dialogue is a barrage of the ""f"" word if for no other reason than the film is rated R. There's also an extended sequence where Weiner and some other non-perishables get high (what can we expect) and an ending that is quite literally a grocery store orgy.<br/><br/>There are laughable parts (a piece of chewed up gum as Stephen Hawking was brilliantly done) and some unfortunate parts (the film spends a large chunk of time joking about the political and global status of Israel), not to mention a barrage of racial jokes that are at times off-putting. The movie is an admirable effort to make animated features more for adults. Apparently adults can't get enough potty humor. Watch the trailer - the funny parts are there. The rest of the movie is fluff."

","While it may seem like a comedy, deep down, Sausage Party is a horror movie, seen through the eyes of various food items...all in computer animated beauty. Take away all the vulgar humor, foul language, and obscenities altogether, and Sausage Party is ( not surprisingly) a very dumb movie. The first ten minutes of this had me, I mean, really had me...I laughed a few times, and thought I was in for a winner. After the first ten minutes, it was already tiresome...the ""f"" bomb dropped more times then I care to count. We get it, it's an R rated computer animated movie, not intended for children. Does it really find the need to abuse the offensive material? In the case of Sausage Party, it does. It just seems like an endless montage to say and do whatever possible to shock us, but after the first 20 minutes, you are actually immune to it, if you make it that far. The story actually makes you feel bad for consuming food, something essential for life, and the idea that food has real feelings and is alive is just pure silly, but for the films purposes, we play along, and therefore it turns out to be an entertaining piece to watch. If you don't think food that can talk and like to cuss is funny, you're in a lot of trouble with this movie. Most of the jokes are misses, but the ones that are hits, they are worth remembering. So when food finds out it is being purchased to be eaten, they decide to fight back. I thought the movie was quite violent, a human head is actually decapitated ( by accident) and after an hour of watching this, there are finally several ""oh my god!"" moments...you may be caught a little off guard by the turn it takes, and trust me, you will know what I'm talking about...quite a bit of gore at the end. So all in all, this is a story about food vs people. Who will win? The question really is, who will care? And how many will laugh at it?"

Maybe if I was 12 I might have been amused with this, but now it just felt bored sitting through this. I just didn't get a kick out of the over the top and crude humor with this one. I can however see how some teens will have a lot of laughs while watching this.<br/><br/>5/10"

","MINOR SPOILER! I laughed a lot for the first half of the movie. But once ""they"" got back to the grocery store, I was over it. The Opening is very funny. The Scene at the druggies house is hilarious. But once they got back to the grocery store, it felt like the same race jokes made in a thousand movies before it. There were a couple jokes in the last half that made me giggle, but wasn't enough to keep me interested. The ending was a little over the top on the outrageous scale. I recommend renting it and seeing how you feel about it. I will definitely not buy this movie or see it again. I am a fan of Seth Rogan but this feels as if he was trying to hard to be over the top."

","Sausage Party<br/><br/>The number one guest you don't want to invite to a sausage party is a starving dog.<br/><br/>In fact, the sustenance in this adult-animated feature should avoid inviting carnivores altogether.<br/><br/>A horny sausage, Frank (Seth Rogen), wants to insert himself into his hotdog bun girlfriend Brenda (Kristen Wiig), but cannot do so until both reach the Great Beyond. But a returned jar of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) proclaims the other side to be a falsehood.<br/><br/>To confirm this claim, Frank seeks out a sage bottle of spirits (Bill Hader), while a damaged Douche (Nick Kroll) and a sapphic taco (Salma Hayek) threaten his and Brenda's happiness. <br/><br/>With an R-Rating and an enviable voice cast, this 3-D disappointment doesn't live up to either asset. The jokes are flat, the characters are grating and the animation is sloppy.<br/><br/>Besides, if wieners could talk they would sound more like mashed up pig rectums. <br/><br/>Red Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

","Astonishingly this R rated vulgar CGI adult cartoon is a lot better than my initial low expectations I had of it.<br/><br/>In fact it really is some kind of rude, crude version of Toy Story with an anti-religious subtext as food products in the supermarket come alive, waiting to be selected by humans but not realising that a worse fate awaits them. They will be cooked and eaten.<br/><br/>The film starts with a Disney lite song (written by Alan Menken) and is about a hot dog who falls in love with the attractive hot dog bun, just the right fit for him and once he discovers the truth he needs to get back to the supermarket and warn the others of what life outside the supermarket really is like. There is another product whose nozzle was damaged that goes after the hot dog as he blames him for his deformity.<br/><br/>The makers play with stereotypes such as the Jewish Bagel, all calm and pacifist and the Arab Lavash being arrogant and rather old fashioned but honourable underneath. You have the German beers who are horrible to the juice.<br/><br/>There is a sexy taco who also has the hots for the hot dog bun but that means a same sex relationship which is taboo. However the film ends with a literal food orgy, straight, bi, gay."

","The trailer for this film broke the internet. For a while, everyone was talking about it and claiming that it was going to be the best comedy of 2016. I wasn't really in the same boat. While I thought the idea of anthropomorphic food items discovering the truth about their existence was a creative idea, I failed to see how well it would carry a feature film and felt like it would've been better off as a short on SNL or some other sketch show. But after seeing it....it was...better than expected. Although that doesn't make the movie amazing by default.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, the concept is pretty creative and they do surprisingly take a few advantages with it. There's some pretty creative ideas buried underneath and they try to work in some satire involving prejudice, immortality, and identity. They obviously don't go very deep in depth, but they do it decently for a film whose protagonist is a talking sausage.<br/><br/>But the absolutely biggest flaw with this movie is the fact that it's not really that funny. By far this movie's biggest faults that bogs it down, is its jokes. While they're not necessarily terrible and there were only a few that I actually groaned at, nothing about them were really laugh out loud hilarious or even worth much more than just a small chuckle.<br/><br/>While the film kind of fails in terms of comedy, I do at the very least give it props for its creativity. A good chunk of the satire works, it boasts a pretty imaginative concept, and the animation is actually pretty solid (despite the working condition controversy) that actually does add to the subject they're satirizing (Pixar.) So the film overall is just okay as a whole. It isn't great, but it is a lot more creative than it should be.<br/><br/>6/10."
"beanbiin","2","0","4","31 October 2016"," I liked how everything started, but it doesn't reaches my cartoony expectation.
","I liked how everything started from hilarious gruesome inspired live foods that interact with each other food and how they termed people outside as their Gods and their promised land like true to life religions. Inspired mortal sins, sexual immorality, murder and physical abuse has brilliantly fits with food since it's just a clear representation of human life.<br/><br/>It's a unique idea that how foods are substitute for a human action into a full 3D cartoon film that supposed to be for children are aren't for. In fact, it was Rated 18 that needs adult supervision for children. <br/><br/>Moving on to the story, It's lame how they slipped with new dimension of the story how it goes, mixing through ideas that getting far from the main story. Over all, it's fun to watch, however major plot holes and strained climax towards the end gave major bad points for the film."

","Since we associate CGI animation with children's films, having an ADULT (and not even explicit) one is a ""Curiosity"", the same way ""Fritz the Cat"" was back in the early 70's. My wife's take on this is spot on: someone was watching ""Book Revue"" (look it up) and doing a lot of drugs...some good, some not so good , and went...""HEYYYYY, how about if we do a MODERN VERSION OF THIS using computer animation???"". Of course, being from a jew, they ALWAYS have to bring up the whole Jewish thing-which, personally I wish they wouldn't-arabs, Nazis (the more you mention them , the more you exalt them...maybe that's what they are trying to do), and then the extremely racist Mexican (has to be Lesbian) main character, etc. It made me chuckle here and there but mostly , I was shaking my head....didn't get a hearty laugh out of me- AND I'M ""EASY""!!!!!

","This is some weird movie right here. There is food porn, talking about things like hell and paradise and more stuff...<br/><br/>It feels more like a movie than a animated movie to me, because almost all of the action happens at the end and the rest is juts a build up. However it is done good.<br/><br/>At first the movie may seem boring, I actually didn't care for the first part of the movie. But when the action starts a little it gets you excited.<br/><br/>The movie itself is also not very long, 1 hour and 22 minutes, which is really good because they did not need any more time. <br/><br/>I actually wanted to rate this movie a 5 or maybe even a 4, but I am telling you man that the ending of this movie is really funny, awesome and well done. There is also a nice treat at the end, more than one."
"DannyDnB","4","0","4","14 September 2016"," A totally underwhelming attempt at Adult Animation.
","This is the latest film to join the oh so great Seth Rogen library of stoner style films, which also happens to be animated. The film attempts to bring a new, more adult dimension to commercial animated movie-making, by making it an R-rated raunch-fest. Sadly, it almost completely fails at this goal. It really is a film with very little substance. <br/><br/>Ever since this film was released, I've been hearing and seeing an insane amount of hype about it all over the internet, claims that it's a smart and funny animated adult movie. Bearing this in mind, and the fact that I've enjoyed some of the previous films by Seth Rogen and his loyal team of writers, I went into this movie with quite a bit of excitement. <br/><br/>The film is about a sausage named Frank, who, along with all of the other shopping items one can possibly find in a supermarket, worship us human beings as gods. They all believe that when they are picked up off the shelf and taken out of the market, they have been ""chosen"" and will be entering heaven. Little do they know what we really do to them. <br/><br/>As Frank tries to seduce a hot dog bun named Brenda, played by Kristen Wiig, he embarks on a journey of finding his place in the world and reuniting all of the diversified shopping products in order to live together in harmony, away from fear and suffering. <br/><br/>The plot is based on a thought provoking concept, that is the purpose of life in a world controlled by systems that we sometimes do not know very much about. It is the extremely crude and obscene humor, which is not always a bad thing in a movie, that, when mixed with this particular plot-line, does not mix well. <br/><br/>The film also tries to get creative with the deaths of the various food characters, and while sometimes these are well done, at other times, they're totally pointless, and even nonsensical. The animation gore also gets old pretty quickly. <br/><br/>The film tries to get our minds thinking about existence, while at the exact same time throwing at at us all sorts of the exact same thing, which does not extend further than sex jokes with a sprinkle of stoner comedy and underwhelming gore, which all comes out quite immaturely. <br/><br/>The good things to be said are mostly on the animation, which can be impressive at times. It is also just cool to see a talking sausage. I found myself appreciating some of the voice acting as well, particularly the voice acting done by Rogen himself, Kristen Wiig, and Michael Cera.<br/><br/>That's about it. Sitting here right now, I really can't think of any other things I really liked about this movie. Seth Rogen fans may enjoy it a bit more than I did, but I just could not have much of a good time watching it. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a totally unpleasant movie and, when the sex jokes and food-gore are stripped away, this film completely fails to live up to the hype. Fans of this type of humor might take a bit more out of the experience, but anyone else should save their money and time."
"svienneau-57689","4","0","4","12 September 2016"," Boring and somewhat disturbing
","The movie got a few laughs out of me at first but that's just about it. About halfway through I found myself pretty bored with it too. Plot is very predictable and at times you can even see jokes coming from a mile away. The orgy scene at the end (as well as the juice box rape scene) was pretty disgusting and added no comedic value in my opinion. Plus you are constantly hit over the head with the movie's stance on religion... it gets old quick. Both me and my girlfriend came out of the theater thinking ""well that was strange."" Some may enjoy it but it was not for me. I need to fill a few more lines before IMDb let's me submit this so let me say that there are some Seth Rogan movies I like and I am not opposed to raunchy comedies. This one was just in bad taste."
"gillbutler-69274","3","0","4","10 September 2016"," Disappointing; Just Never Got Going
","We'd planned on seeing David Brent but it wasn't on at a good time so we went to see Sausage Party. Had looked at the trailer and my initial feeling was that Id seen enough! Anyway went along with an open mind and had been told its 'better then you think'.<br/><br/>Ten minutes in and you feel like the story should be leaving the supermarket but no it stays in the aisles. You're starting to get bored. I hate to say it but it seems to have no aim. Where could this be going? The food was ugly and unlikable. The story line wasn't strong enough to carry to predictable lines and jokes. And yeah if you don't like bad language this isn't one for you.<br/><br/>I thought they might do a South Park meets Toy Story. But no. It was no where near. Half way through I was thinking of the Box Sets I could be watching at home. My husband leaned in, 'This is a bit weird!'.<br/><br/>It isn't for children yet it started to have that feeling when the adult gets bored half way through as the film is aimed at kids, unlike Toy Story. But this is unusual as it is aimed solely at adults.<br/><br/>Couldn't wait for it to end. There was a finale type sex scene when all the food starts having sex. Type of thing computer animators might draw/make as a joke for each other. But not for the public. It was just disturbing.<br/><br/>The Stephen Hawking character made me uncomfortable and the 'Muslim' wrap having sex with the 'Jewish' bagel - just silly and weird.<br/><br/>Feel embarrassed for the actors! It just doesn't work. Sounds like a lot of egocentric actors thinking they can write a script.<br/><br/>Thinking maybe I'm too old for the film (in my early 30s) I looked around the cinema, lots of teenagers and lads in their 20s. No out loud laughing. All looked bewildered when they left.<br/><br/>When we arrived at the cinema there was a massive queue. The cinema is small and only has three screens. We were actually afraid we wouldn't get to see it. Turned out the massive queue was for The Young Offenders. Our cinema was quiet enough. Cant help but think they next door, knew more than us!! Disappointing. Could have been a funny short."
"Fiurilli","5","0","4","7 September 2016"," A missed opportunity
","Animation type movies have been increasing in popularity over the last couple of years. In 2016 alone more than 50 animation style movies have been released. These type of movies are mostly for children to enjoy and, although they're still fairly enjoyable for adults, are never really meant for an adult audience. Seth Rogan and consorts have set out to change that by creating the first ever R-rated animation movie called 'Sausage Party'. In this movie we follow a living hotdog called Frank who lives in a supermarket together with other food products who are also amongst the living. All of them view us humans as gods and are joyfully awaiting the day they are picked up, placed in a shopping cart ready to go towards the promised land. When they get there though they'll quickly discover that things aren't what they thought it would be as they are devoured by their revered gods without remorse. Eventually Frank and his friends get chosen, but they are quickly separated after a horrible shopping cart incident. The rest of the movie has us follow Frank and a few of his friends as they try to find each other while discovering more about the terrible gods us humans actually are.<br/><br/>As an animation style movie 'Sausage Party' really isn't one of the prettiest of the bunch. That does not mean all that much though since Pixar has really spoiled us as of late. The universe that they were able to create was still very colorful and it did actually feel like a living and breathing world. This is really quite an accomplishment considering it was done with a budget that is only ten percent of the one 'Finding Dory' had. The way some characters were animated was also pretty good, but it is quite clear a little more thought should have gone into their overall design as the universe of 'Sausage Party' is not all that consistent. Sometimes the food itself is alive while other times it's just the packaging that's alive and in some special cases this holds true for both of them. The manner in which the characters are presented also varies a lot. Most characters only have a cartoonish face with stick figure hands and feet while others feature a design that actually suits the type of food they are. An example of this would be Sammy Bagel Jr. whose mouth is the big gaping hole in the middle of his body. All of this does not take away from the overall enjoyment of the film, but a little more polish would have gone a long way.<br/><br/>Scattered throughout this film are some amazing comedic moments. For instance the aforementioned shopping cart incident was brilliantly framed as if it was a scene taken straight out of 'Saving Private Ryan', with some minor alterations of course. Even some small moments were very well done. The very first time the f-word is uttered is a great example of this since it was initially presented as if one was watching a PG-rated movie. Most of the jokes do not reach this level however and a lot of them just aren't that clever. It is quite clear that the creators wanted to use their R-rating to the fullest extent and the supposedly funny part in a lot of jokes wasn't really the joke itself but more so the absurdity of it. Initially this works really well however after just a few jokes this novelty quickly wears off causing a lot of jokes to feel repetitive and most of them are dead on arrival. The jokes are also not that well distributed throughout the film. There are almost no jokes in the second act which was probably intentional in a failed attempt at trying to go out with a bang. A lot of jokes seemed forced in and it is obvious that a lot of characters were only created for some minor food puns. What does work really well is the very decent voice acting done by Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and many others. To me it seemed as if they themselves were having a lot of fun recording their voices which definitely helped make some hit-or-miss jokes succeed.<br/><br/>What plagues this film are some weird creative decisions. Riddled throughout the movie are some of the worst attempts at social commentary I have ever seen. Now social commentary itself is not a bad thing and it can really enhance a movie when it is presented with some subtlety. That is not the case in 'Sausage Party' though as almost every scene kept hammering on the idea that one should never have faith in something without questioning it. It is possible that this decision was made in an attempt to parody most animation movies since a lot of them feature social commentary to some extent, but it misses its mark regardless of intent. What could also be considered a parody to some extent would be the movies main antagonist. This character is extremely annoying and only has a minor influence on the overarching story. Again the creators of 'Sausage Party' make a weird creative decision since the overall scenario was already a perfect villain. The movie really did not need a physical one. <br/><br/>Ultimately 'Sausage Party' is a missed opportunity. The few good sequences really hint at what could have been an excellent comedic movie. If a little more thought and polish had gone into its creation this certainly would have been the case, but as of right now it's just a mediocre summer flick.<br/><br/>My Rating: 5/10"
