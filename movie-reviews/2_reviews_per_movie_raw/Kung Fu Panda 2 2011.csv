","Kung Fu Panda 2 was not as good as the original. The story isn't as good and neither is the ""Jack Black humor"" that made the original what it was. That being said, the villain is really good and the plot is still pretty good. 2 is also a little more predictable. Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a good movie, although it fails to be as good as the first."
"MosHr","10","130","166","25 May 2011"," An emphatic return with a darker story; great movie with lots in it for the adults as well
","The question that has been floating around about Kung Fu Panda 2 is if it is Shrek 2 or Toy Story 2 of animated sequels? Well, I'm happy to say it's Toy Story 2 kind of animated sequel - a genuine good movie that takes risks and succeeds rather than rehashing the first movie.<br/><br/>Po isn't as much of a gastro-kung-fu fighter and fanboi from the first movie but has grown in his personality; he's less the Jack Black as a panda and more of a character that stands on it's own. However, Po is now the tragic hero in a Greek style prophecy which foretells of a warrior in black and white who would defeat a certain Lord Shen who has invented a new weapon that could spell the end of kung-fu. As Po learns that he is adopted, he struggles to find out about his past and the strange symbol from his nightmares. The heavy subject matter doesn't weight down the movie and is continually and cleverly able to escape into funny moments without losing gravitas. It successfully weaves the topics of fatherhood, friendship and family into a colorful story that even though we know how it will end, it gets there very very emphatically.<br/><br/>I'm really glad that Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't go the route of being a purely children's movie and didn't go the route of being built on jokes of Po's eating and Po's weight. I suppose the fortune cookie philosophy of master Shifu is slightly missed but purely a small quibble in a good movie. As a final note, maybe it's because of my eyesight with a weaker left eye, I barely noticed the 3D at all. Highly recommended movie."

","Furry, Ferocious and Fun!<br/><br/>This Memorial Day weekend I watched Kung Fu Panda 2, the sequel to the action packed comedy starring Po (Jack Black) and the fearsome five. The first movie was a fun kids movie that had a lot of catchy one liner phrases, a few kick butt actions scenes, a lot of situational comedy, and a story that was about working hard and finding your inner strength. Now three years later, the fellows at Dreamworks have presented a sequel to this animal centered comedy, which follows after the two duds we saw in Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After. Is this sequel following the same path that the last Shrek films took, or does it shine on its own? My answer to this question is that it does indeed shine on its own.<br/><br/>The story starts out with a background story about the villain Shen (Gary Oldman) and his lust for power to rule over China, eliminating any forces that try to stand in his way. Not long after the introduction, Po and the gang come back into the picture before Po is called to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to learn about finding inner peace. However, the peaceful air is soon disturbed by a pack of wolf soldiers and an action fight sequence soon starts that puts most action movies to shame. As the wolves retreat Po, along with the fearsome five, set out to defeat Shen and find inner peace. <br/><br/>Over the course of the journey, Po provides that classic comedy that made him famous in the first film as he uses phrases like awesome, so hardcore, and freaking in providing that awkward and childish enthusiasm that makes him stand out. His enthusiasm is still balanced out by his lack of stamina and large girth comedy which is cleverly integrated into both combat and non combat scenes. Clumsiness also plays a role in Po's ability to make us laugh, as what starts out as the stylish moves of a kung fu master quickly turns into a blundering mistake that somehow seems to work for Po. All of these aspects are brought together by Jack Black's voice work as he finds a way to bring a juvenile tone to the comedy, while still sounding wise and honorable during the serious scenes.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the strongest aspects about this movie is the balance of story, action, and detail. The story, or should I say stories, are detailed enough to provide character development that older audiences will like, but at the same time is catchy, simple, and fun enough to allow younger audience members to get a gist of what's going on. The integration of action and chase scenes keeps the pace of the movie going while also keeping the attention of the audience glued to the screen, a plus for those that have a hard time sitting through a movie. <br/><br/>What really brings all of these strengths together though is the camera and musical works that add that finishing touch to the movie. The camera work is smooth and not really jumpy and allows one to see what's going in almost every scene. An exception to this style occurs in some of the fighting seen at the end, but it's not too bad so most should be able to slide ignore it. While the camera's capture the action, the music that plays during every scene has been selected to bring out the emotions of the scene and make you feel it deep in your heart. Whether it be fast flying punches, sad flashbacks, or the findings of inner peace and the acceptance of the past the music catches all of these emotions in a brilliant combination of strings, percussions, and other orchestra instruments to make you feel like you are in the movie.<br/><br/>Although this movie has a lot, and I mean a lot of good aspects, there are still some weaknesses that one may find. The comedic styles of Po can get a little stale at times, especially hearing the word hard core about ten times. A second thing is that Po pulls off a little too much Yoda at some points in the movie, I won't say too much more to avoid ruining the movie. Perhaps a third thing one might not like is how long it takes to finish off the final battle. Although the movie is only an hour and half long, some might find the final battle dragged out a little too long and want it to just end, this was not a problem for me however.<br/><br/>Overall Kung Fu Panda 2 is a sequel that is a must see, especially for kids and fans of the series. Even if you haven't seen the first one yet, which was the case with my cousin, one will be able to find some part of this movie to enjoy. Laughs, actions, drama, story, and heartfelt emotions are all in this movie and the wide appeal to many audiences makes this a great movie for a youth group or friend outing. Thus my Robbie Rating for this movie is 9.8-10.0. I hope that you enjoy this movie as much I did. Recommended audience members: Kids, Dreamworks fans, Kung Fu Panda lovers, action lovers, comedy lovers, etc. People who should avoid this movie: Horror fans and fans looking for a movie with blood, because it doesn't have any of it."

","""Kungfu Panda 2"" is an excellent sequel to an excellent preceding film and a truly fun film to experience with your family and friends. It is as enjoyable as watching through the first time, maybe even better. Here, the elements from the first film are improved and crafted for this sequel to create a wonderful, stunning, and memorable adventure that will surely entertain all its audiences and leave them hungry for more Po.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is much more enveloping than that of the first film. Po, now the Dragon Warrior is a hero protecting the citizens of China with his fellow friends, the Furious Five, as well as his master, Master Shifu. But then, a threat endangers all of China as well and threatens the existence of Kungfu. This threat is organized by the peacock, Lord Shen, who is after the destruction of China, and the extinction of Kungfu. Now Po, the Kungfu Panda, with the Furious Five, are determined to stop Lord Shen from destroying China and the existence of Kungfu, despite that Lord Shen has designed a very powerful weapon (something like a catapult). But doing so takes Po into learning the truth about the past, about who his parents are, and about who he is.<br/><br/>""Panda 2"" is also the first ""Panda"" film to be shown in 3D, which wasn't quite bad. Depth was practically conspicuous throughout the film and is certainly not a bad choice in how to enjoy this film. ""Kungfu Panda 2"" is definitely a film worth watching in 3D. <br/><br/>With a more threatening premise, and the addition of 3D, ""Panda 2"" also improves on the action scenes. The fighting scenes were very entertaining and should keep kids and adults hooked. <br/><br/>The animation movements and CGI in ""Kungfu Panda 2"" are also excellent and awesome. The backgrounds, and the setting are all very detailed and the complex movements of the characters are simply perfect. Bravo!<br/><br/>Another element welcome to the ""Panda"" movies is romance. In this movie, Po will start to have a relationship with another creature (No, I won't tell who he had it with). Speaking of relationships, the movie will also get emotional as Po begins to discover the truth about his past. <br/><br/>Humor plays an essential role in this film and will leave you laughing in your seats. I think the jokes here can give you more laughs than the jokes from the first film. ""Kungfu Panda 2"" will definitely keep you laugh your head off. <br/><br/>Apart from all these, I was also amazed in how they could use a peacock as a skilled martial arts creature. At first, I thought, how could they use a peacock, full of feathers, as a martial arts villain. Then ""Kungfu Panda 2"" revealed it all and I was stunned by their work in crafting a feathery bird, into a dangerous, and ruthless villain. <br/><br/>In terms of recommendation, I would recommend this movie to all ages. The humor will appeal to little children, as well as older audiences alike, and the fighting scenes will appeal to teenagers, or and older audience. 3D is definitely worth it for experiencing this film. <br/><br/>After analyzing the box office performance of ""Kungfu Panda 2"", I feel pitiful for the movie, especially when Dreamworks have crafted a wonderful and amazing film for audiences to enjoy. I do hope that the box office performance of the film rebounds and becomes a great hit in the box office world. I also do hope that this movie will be successful enough for the sake of ""Panda 3"". <br/><br/>So yes. Po's fist hungers for justice. But I hunger for more Po!<br/><br/>Prince AJB's Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review on ""Kungfu Panda 2"". I hope my review is useful for you."
"Animated_Antic","9","6","6","20 November 2017"," A movie with both good comedy and drama.
","The first ""Kung Fu Panda"" was a big surprise for moviegoers around the world. Critics and audiences, including myself, really enjoyed it's enjoyable martial arts story, beautiful animation and brilliantly developed characters. So when DreamWorks announced a sequel, I actually got very eager to see it. I went into the film very excited and walked out extremely satisfied because ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a very good sequel that steps up everything that made the first film work. It's one of those films that makes the story, characters and animation better.<br/><br/>The dragon warrior Po (Jack Black) and his fellow kung fu master the Furious Five (respectively played by Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and Jackie Chan) have been protecting the Valley of Peace from enemies for some time now. Little do they know that the evil Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) has returned to  Gongmen City in order to test his newest weapon used from modified fireworks to seek revenge after he was banished by his parents for exterminating the panda population in order to avert a prophecy predicted about him. When the kung fu team's teacher Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) receives the news of the return of Shen, he sends the team to the city to defeat the evil Lord and protect the art of kung fu. Along the way, Po is trying to discover his origins along with the mystery with his real parents. After this, we receive some very funny and emotional moments resulting a pretty fantastic movie.<br/><br/>This is one of those sequels that does the proper approach that a sequel should do which continue the story from the first. The film simply doesn't repeat the first story but rather tell a different story. Speaking of the story in this film, it's pretty fantastic. I loved how this movie is able to balance both the comedic and emotional moments very well without making the film feeling like it had to much or even to little. The film once again dove into the philosophy and art of martial arts like the first film did and also added new elements involving inner peace which I found fascinating. The animation once again is beautiful. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson knew how to tell it's story through it's colors very well with the film having a very heavy focus on the color red during evil moments of the film and calming green colors during quieter moments. I also liked that the flashback scenes in the movie were told through 2D animation which is something that I always love to watch. The characters are also fantastic as well. The reason why is because they're properly developed and given more character and don't act like jerks throughout the movie, particularly Po's relationship to the Furious Five. The villain, Lord Shen, is one of the best villains that DreamWorks has ever created. He has a fantastic backstory and a very deviously evil plot, but they also manage to give him some very good comedic moments. As far as flaws, the movie does feel like it did run a little too long and some of the scenes could have been cut a little bit shorter, but that's really about it.<br/><br/>""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a very good sequel that makes everything that worked in the first film better with a very good story, some great animation, and well developed characters. I wonder where DreamWorks will go from here when they do a sequel because based on the end of the film, this might go somewhere exciting. I surely hope that it does."
"C22Man","8","6","6","22 September 2015"," Kung Fu Panda has its Empire Strikes Back
","Kung Fu Panda 2 is pretty much everything a sequel should be. It builds upon its characters, it crafts a plot that is larger as well as more personal and its themes are even deeper than before. It sees Po (Jack Black), who has now been fully accepted by the furious five, forced to battle against a peacock named Lord Shen who plans to conqueror China with a new weapon. It doesn't seem like much on the surface, but Po begins to have flashbacks of why his parents abandoned him and it links directly back to Shen himself. Stories like this are brilliant because the set-up and main goal is relatively simple, but there is a very heartfelt and surprisingly emotion core to the film that is just fantastic.<br/><br/>This feels like its Po's story, and it might annoy some people that the other characters aren't developed more, but for me it was the right move. It makes you always engaged in the journey that he goes through, you want to know what happened to his real parents and he grows as a hero as a result of everything that he goes through. Po himself is again a lot of fun and it impresses me how well balanced the character is, being naive but lovable at the same time with Jack Black adding his usual drive to the role. The furious five are still are really enjoyable team and I think the writers did a great job in giving them all the right amount of lines as well as making them a team you can connect to. Master Shifu has a more limited appearance, but he's still good fun when he shows up. <br/><br/>Arguably the best thing is Lord Shen (Gary Oldman). This is a villain who is both intimidating and really funny, and so many times it's either too much of one or the other yet here they get it spot- on. He is never too serious and he is never too goofy, it is a perfect balance. He has a backstory that explains his actions and connects to Po's spiritual journey. The animation on him looks marvellous and Oldman is absolutely brilliant as usual.<br/><br/>I think one of the main reasons the film works so well is because of the emotion impact it has. The characters all have legitimate reasons for what they are doing and they're feelings as well as flaws are shown fully. The scenes with Po and his adoptive father Mr. Ping (James Wong) are really touching as well as being amusing. The flashbacks are truly moving and even tear inducing. I believe it shows that you can be serious and even somewhat sombre if you can get the balance right. The jokes are consistently funny here, mostly due to Po's behaviour and a lot of Shen's lines. Once again with DreamWorks the animation is absolutely superb with this being some of their sharpest and most vibrant that they have ever produced. Pretty much everything from character designs to the scenic shots of ancient China look fantastic. The more 2-D style in Po's flashbacks is also a nice touch and helps it standout. The speed of the animation is another plus. When it is used for slapstick the quick pace makes everything seem even funnier, and it does a similar thing for the action scenes by giving them even more energy. The score (by Hans Zimmer and John Powell) is another positive, crafting the right amount of soothing melodies and backing the action effectively with some more upbeat compositions.<br/><br/>I think balance is the key word here and it is where Kung Fu Panda 2 succeeds. The story itself is an excellent continuation and the way it unravels as the film goes on is just wonderful. It has plenty of comedy and well placed humour, but it never shies away from darker and more emotional material. I found myself both moved and laughing in equal measure. As said I think the main characters are all great, the animation is spectacular and the villain is outstanding. It is exactly what you want in a sequel and I can't wait to see where the series goes next."
"TourettesPersonal","8","64","91","26 May 2011"," Too Awesome
","My biggest fear about sequels is it's gonna end up pretty bad and ruin the first one. But I remember, Dreamworks already understand how to make a true good animated movie so I don't have to worry. Now the sequel just got more awesome. Non-stop action and non-stop laughs. The heart is also there. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is just as good as the first one.<br/><br/>The trailer makes us dubious but this is Dreamworks. Anyways, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a great continuation of the series. The story still has a heart and some scenes can almost move you to tears. The movie has bigger and more Kung Fu action & yes, the action never stops. It's all kick butt action.<br/><br/>I like it how they improved the editing. Remember Megamind, It feels like you were flying in every flying sequences. They did the same thing in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". Fast Moving Action that it's fun to see it even if it's in 2D. I don't really bash 3D though. The jokes are obviously everywhere. Even in serious scenes it suddenly has humor.<br/><br/>The new comers from the cast did a great job. Gary Oldman is definitely good at being a villain in movies even if it's animated. Michelle Yeoh made her character likable. Jean-Claude Van Damme is awesome even though his scenes were few. This movie still has the same style from the first movie. Magnificent flash animation in the intro, flashbacks, and the dream sequence. Nice music score. And a lot more.<br/><br/>I just said this movie is as good as the first movie but if I had to pick which Kung Fu Panda movie is better then it would be the first one. It's more heartwarming but Kung Fu Panda 2 is already good enough as a sequel because it's bigger and too awesome. Unfortunately, It's too awesome it moderates the depth a little bit but it's entertaining at its best. To be honest, this could be the best movie of the summer so far."
"DICK STEEL","10","62","90","26 May 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Kung Fu Panda 2
","Who would have expected Kung Fu Panda to become a surprising, heartwarming summer hit back in 2008, where I thought it had captured the very essence of a typical martial arts film, and distilled it into an animated piece appealing both to kids and adults alike. The big risk involved is of course coming up with the inevitable follow up film given the profits that it had raked in, that won't be an insult to its fans, and yet maintaining that same level of appeal the original had. Kung Fu Panda 2 succeeded.<br/><br/>Although it certainly did seem that passing the reins over to rookie director Jennifer Yuh was bewildering, but Yuh turned out to be perfect in guiding the sequel and the beloved characters in yet another adventure, with bigger set action pieces, touching dramatic moments, and retaining plenty of humour from the get go. Credit of course must go to writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger in coming up with a natural progression of the story of Po (Jack Black), and filling it with a lot more elements from classic martial arts film formulas such as a jail break involving skilled pugilists in captivity, a pagoda, getting beat down, recovery and recuperation, and the learning of a new, ultimate skill. To think that the worries came from the scribes being responsible for the snooze-fest Monsters Vs Aliens, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 brings back the A-list voices of Black as Po the Panda, now very much comfortable in his celebrity role of the prophesied Dragon Warrior, and the Furious Five consisting of Angelina Jolie as the no-nonsense, hard hitting Tigress, Seth Rogen as the wisecracking Mantis, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper and the underused Jackie Chan as Monkey, recognizable animals used in distinctive martial arts boxing styles. Also returning are Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu and James Hong as Mr Ping, while joining the fray are Gary Oldman as the chief villain Lord Shen the vain peacock, Michelle Yeoh as The Soothsayer, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc, Dennis Haysbert as Master Oxen and Victor garber as Master Thundering Rhino, the latter three forming some formidable masters of kung fu whose city they're protecting falls under siege.<br/><br/>The story continues to loosely adopt from historical developments in China, with the premise being set during the time when gunpowder was discovered and fireworks created, but with the more sinister use of the material also for the creation of weapons such as the cannon, threatening the extinction of martial arts with its formidable firepower. Lord Shen becomes fanatical in plundering metal from the land with the ambition to rule all of China, but for his Soothsayer to predict his downfall to come from something black and white, hence his dogged massacre of pandas with his wolf pack goons, before setting his sights on and signaling his diabolical intent on some legendary martial arts masters.<br/><br/>It's pretty amazing how this under 90 minute film also managed to squeeze in plenty of pathos in the form of Po having to unlock his repressed memory of being necessarily abandoned by his parents following a pattern ala Moses with the pandas being threatened with forced extinction, which provides tons of baby panda to milk some scheming, crafty moments to tug at your heartstrings, and you can hear that audible gasps of ""oh so cute""s from female members of the audiences. Well done, if the studio decides to make money from merchandising. Narratively it's pretty predictable following the generic essence of typical kung fu film classics, what with the learning of inner peace and new skills involved that resembled very much like Taichi-quan, but what mattered of course is the delivery that hit expectations, and not buckle under that same weight brought over from a successful first film.<br/><br/>Then of course there's the spectacular fight sequences, especially when Po and the Fearsome Five combine to protect the innocent masses against hordes of enemies that come with the requisite comedy, from slapstick to lyrical, like poetry in motion when they showcase their respective, distinctive moves. Big action set pieces are well designed, and I give my thumbs up to how the villain is modelled after the peacock, which in itself brings about the theme of vanity that almost all villains possess, but in the context of kung fu, it's extremely smart to design Lord Shen to move and utilize his own innate weaponry, that of sneaky darts and fans - a weapon that in Chinese martial arts film, is the weapon of choice of the ""wei jun zi"" - the ""fake gentleman"" (sorry if my interpretation sucks, but you get my drift).<br/><br/>No qualms about this installment, I would put it in my highly recommended list as a sequel that didn't forget about the spirit of the original, and if the filmmakers can continue to capture exactly what makes martial arts movies tick and distill it like it did for the first two films, I dare say we're in for a mighty strong franchise that will appeal to kids, and every kung fu film fan out there who will probably go nuts at how well this animated series managed to get the formula right."
"neji107","9","97","147","22 May 2011"," Packs twice the punch, in every way!
","Let me preface by saying I was rather unimpressed with the first Kung Fu Panda. As entertaining and well-choreographed as it was, it didn't pass my bar for mediocre DreamWorks animated movies. It was amusing and had some heart, but all-in-all was pretty expected. Now when I got a chance to see a preview of Kung Fu Panda 2, I was rather indifferent to seeing DreamWorks trying to pump out a mediocre sequel and a new franchise. But WOW... was I wrong! I take back everything I said earlier because, man oh man, I have to admit that Kung Fu Panda 2 was one of the best animated films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>In in this installment, we find Po and the Furious Five defending the Valley of Peace from evil when a new threat rises. Lord Shen, an albino peacock banished by his parents many years ago, has returned with a technology capable of ending kung fu and conquering China. As the Furious Five embark to destroy the weapon, Po begins to realize that Shen may be linked to his lost childhood past as a panda bear. I won't say any more in fear of spoiling the story, but be prepared for a powerful emotional experience.<br/><br/>I found a big improvement was that they toned down all the things that made the first movie irritating: over-the-top Jack Black antics, overused slow-mo effects, and dialogue silliness. That's not to say Kung Fu Panda 2 doesn't have humor; actually, it has exactly the right amount at the right time. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot at the jokes in the first movie, but the sequel had me (and the whole theater, for that matter) genuinely laughing! The characters have fully matured and been fleshed out to the point where even Jack Black fits comfortably as Po, though regrettably the Furious Five barely get any screen time. Of course, shining in the spotlight was Gary Oldman as the sinister Lord Shen, whose fantastically evil voice acting tops even Ian McShane's as Tai Lung and is the ONLY way that a peacock could possibly be made scary! The 3D was also showcased quite well, enhancing most of the visuals throughout the movie without being a headache.<br/><br/>Maybe you call it blasphemy, but the comparison must be made. Kung Fu Panda 2 was put together with such a degree of excellence that it rivals many Pixar movies (and in my opinion has a good chance of outshining Cars 2 this year). With some fantastic animation, a surprising and touching story, and convincing voice talent, Kung Fu Panda 2 will easily go down as one of my all-time animated favorites.<br/><br/>9/10"
"alxfdrmn","8","49","72","24 May 2011"," The Power of Awesomeness
","In a summer packed with superheroes, pirates, and aliens, I wouldn't have guessed that my favorite movie so far would involve animals doing martial arts. Kung Fu Panda 2 was extremely impressive.<br/><br/>The Po (Jack Black) of the first Kung Fu Panda is still the same goofy panda with a strong spirit and unique karate moves, but in this movie he faces unanswered questions about his past. While the first movie was more of an origin story, the sequel shows his quest to find out where he came from, a gap that he needs to fill in order to become at peace with himself. If you wondered how a panda could be the son of a goose, your questions will be answered, and Po's backstory is much more emotionally developed than you might think.<br/><br/>Po also has to confront the villainous Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), an albino peacock. Tai Lung (Ian McShane) in the first movie relied more on brute force, but Shen is much crazier and unpredictable. In typical supervillain fashion, he plans to take over China and destroy Kung Fu forever (yes, Kung Fu is treated pretty lightly in these movies, but there's enough philosophy involved, and it is a kid's movie). Though Tai Lung held a personal grudge against Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) in the first movie, Shen is a more fitting antagonist for Po because of a strong connection to Po's past.<br/><br/>And of course the colorful supporting cast is back too. The Furious Five are all well-designed characters, and although they don't have much speaking time, they all have their moments to shine (especially Angelina Jolie as Tigress and Seth Rogen as Mantis). Though Jackie Chan barely had any lines. The new characters all help to expand the world of the movie.<br/><br/>Though the first movie had a lot of juvenile humor, Kung Fu Panda 2 had a lot less fat jokes and a lot more slapstick. Despite the marketing, Po only says ""Skadoosh"" once, and it's actually pretty cool. The movie is darker overall, but that only serves to increase the epic tone. Shen is played by Gary Oldman, and though I didn't realize that until the credits, it makes a lot of sense. The villainous peacock is very similar to other self-obsessed, off-the- hinge villains Oldman has played in movies like León and True Romance. But however dark the movie gets, it's always a lot of fun. Jack Black isn't as annoying as he can be sometimes because Po just seems like the kind of character he's meant to play.<br/><br/>The animation in Kung Fu Panda 2 is extremely well done. It's incredibly cool to see the group fight as a team, and the character animation is expressive in both emotional and action scenes. The cinematography embraces a wide variety of techniques, from slow motion to first person chase scenes, and several sequences use 2D animation to great effect. The set pieces are action-packed, and entertaining. After one scene, I thought the movie was going to end soon just because of how big it was, but the real finale topped even that. And the landscapes and backgrounds are beautiful to look at, artfully designed but still realistic.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in 3D, and for the first time, I definitely recommend it. I haven't had many good experiences with live action 3D, but animation is much better suited for it. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a thrill ride, and the 3D was crisp and well done.<br/><br/>I have to give props to Hans Zimmer. After Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was a bit of a letdown, the soundtrack to Kung Fu Panda 2 is quite awesome, adding to the already epic tone.<br/><br/>I honestly can't think of much that I can criticize about this movie. Po's ""this is awesome"" comments get a bit repetitive, and some scenes with Shen are a bit long. There's a plot point where the group and Po have an argument that kind of doesn't make sense. Otherwise, this movie was really entertaining, both as an action movie and a (admittedly aimed towards kids) comedy, with a strong heart in the center.<br/><br/>If Cars 2 doesn't completely blow everyone away, Kung Fu Panda 2 definitely has a rightful chance at winning Best Animated Feature (which my brother jokingly called ""The Pixar Award"") this year. It's interesting to see animation take on different genres, and if you took out all the animals, this movie could definitely stand on its own as a kung fu epic. Dreamworks really stepped up its game, and I would gladly pay to see Kung Fu Panda 2 (maybe even in 3D)."
"RemusGrey","10","5","5","27 June 2015"," Both funny and touching
","This movie's concept is pretty similar to How to Train your Dragon. Darker and maturer story and plot. But it is different in one way, the comedy is still there and it is a stronger comedy. This is a perfect sequel Dreamworks has done. Stronger comedy with a darker and maturer story, but Dreamworks remembers that this is a movie for kids and they never went ""over-maturer"". But they still made a movie that can entertain adults also. And also this is really touching which can tear up some others. I call this the best sequel and best movie of 2011.<br/><br/>P.S. Don't let adopted kids watch this as this story has Po finding out that he is adopted and may upset adopted kids."
"ja_kitty_71","10","5","5","4 July 2011"," A perfect sequel to go with the original film.
","I had seen the teaser trailer for the awaited sequel for Kung Fu Panda...and I was psyched! Now I had seen Kung Fu Panda 2, and I find that both the original film and this sequel are both AWESOME!<br/><br/>Po is now enjoying being the Dragon Warrior. But then a band of bandit wolves were attacking the Artisan Village for metal. But during the battle, Po noticed a symbol on the bandit leader's armor that triggered a memory from his past - thus letting the wolves escape. Po asks his father Mr Ping ,where he came from, but all the goose can tell him is that he found Po as an infant in a vegetable crate behind his restaurant and adopted him.<br/><br/>Afterwards, Master Shifu had receive word that Master Thundering Rhino, leader of the Kung Fu Council protecting the metropolis of Gongmen City, has been killed by the white peacock Lord Shen with his massive weapon, which threatens to destroys Kung Fu tradition. So Po and the Furious Five are sent to stop him. Now I know I would say this too: that is all I will tell of the film, folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.<br/><br/>So overall, I love really this film from beginning to end, perfect to go with the original film."
"aka_4200","10","8","9","9 June 2011"," Complete Contrast
","The first word I can say about this movie is, wow! Now once again I know that I enjoy animation movies more than anything but this is one of my top 5 favorites. Kung Fu Panda 2 when I first saw the trailer looked like a typical sequel and kind of a corny ending line, ""This could be the end of kung fu..."" despite the fact that I liked the first movie. However, the past tense of my sentence pretty much tells where this review is headed, not to mention the stars, but onto the review.<br/><br/>I am only going to choose four of the many characters to talk about for understandable reasons. Po (Jack Black) obviously going to be the star of the movie has excellently transitioned into the role he played. During the first movie, he was socially awkward and never took kung fu seriously, but in this movie it really makes it feel as if he has been shown the ropes a little more and he has matured significantly. For example he is enjoying himself with the Furious Five rather than trying to fit in, and he is also more comfortable with his technique, shown during fighting sequences. <br/><br/>Tigress (Angelina Jolie) I feel was a lot more accepting in this movie, which does not necessarily fit her description of the previous movie, but once again maturity comes back into play. On the other hand though I feel she is a little too accepting though. I don't know if this was deliberate, but she kind of has a relationship with Po unlike any of the other members of the Furious Five have. The boat scene is a perfect example of this because she tries to get Po to open up to her, and for those who have seen the movie, the jail scene where she gets the truth out of Po. Perhaps Dreamworks did this on purpose, but I guess I will just have to wait and find out.<br/><br/>Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), not really a major character in this movie, actually he is more of a minor one. Shifu looks like he has aged a lot more and he is trying to feel his inner peace as if his job is nearing completion. Now I added Shifu in here because he did contribute to the movie, as little of it as he was in. Shifu in KFP was a master to the Furious Five and Po, and only a master, but in KFP2 he is more of a father figure to them. He gives them the direction that he believes is best for them and the valley, and he is no longer intolerant of Po. When Shifu summons Po, Po interrupts Shifu's inner peace by stumbling and making loud noises, but Shifu just shrugs it off and guides Po to his next phase of training.<br/><br/>Now for the final character which made this an excellent movie, Shen (Gary Oldman). Now this character was one of my favorites. In most animation movies you can look at the antagonist and he will be able to fit into society and not be a threat unless he/she wants to be, but from the very beginning he is just a fearful figure regardless of what he is trying to do. Shen shows the true antithesis of good by just being ruthless, unforgiving, and down right murderous. It does not matter what is in his way he will destroy it or get his minions to do it. That is one of the excellent things about this franchise, the villain was truly a villain. Like Tai Lung (Ian MacShane), he was feared by the Valley of Peace just by hearing his name, same with the name Shen, it just struck fear into the hearts of the people.<br/><br/>These four characters really did add to the movie, but this movie also had everything built into it. Not only did it fill the previous holes from the first movie, where is Po from? Who are his parents? How did Mr. Ping get Po? All of these questions are answered in this movie, it is almost as if this is a prequel-sequel. It is as if the first movie was a rope with stray ends and the second movie weaved all the ends together to make it flow perfectly. Normally when I watch a movie I can find a few things that are just ridiculous, but I brush them off, not in this movie though, it was pure excitement, humor, and enjoyment throughout the whole thing. If you are debating going to see this movie, the decision should be to see it, well worth the money and well worth the time."

","This installment of Kung Fu Panda exceeded my expectations in all respects.<br/><br/>Animation is superb, characters greatly orchestrated, voice-acting is top-notch, fights are well choreographed and there is enough humor to make you feel that you have regained your childhood back!!!

And in many parts where you would normally expect a punch line or superb dialogue, there will be an excellent goof-up which seems to tickle you just enough!! Kudos to the dialogues and screenplay.<br/><br/>The only negative (and that too a little one) is the storyline.

","Having seen and enjoyed (if not been bowled over by) the original, I was surprised and delighted by this movie that seems to prove that Dreamworks, while still not quite on a Pixar level (Yet!) could soon catch them up. It handles much more sensitive material than the first movie and tackles some truly dark and heavy subject material, but manages to keep it from becoming a drama by dropping in comedic material in a manner that is never jarring, out of place, or desperate. Lord Shen made for one of the most delightful villains of recent movie history. His push against the future contrasting with Po's struggle with the past was wonderful to watch. Po's talks with his father brought a tear to my eye in more than one moment in the film. This company and production team have firmly established themselves as formidable storytellers and I'm eager to see what's next."
"julian-mumford","Null","4","4","24 September 2011"," Full of of ""Awesomeness""
","Kung Fu Panda was huge in every sense, $631 million at the worldwide box office and an indelible character amply voiced by Jack Black. This is a voice role that may come to define his career, even though he does not actually appear in a single frame.<br/><br/>Understandably Dreamworks Studios would be failing shareholders not to expand the franchise further and we now have the second film, in what almost certainly will become a trilogy.<br/><br/>Does the film suffer from mid trilogy bloat and irrelevance, well actually no. Everything is subjective but this is the equal or may even surpass in some ways, the original film.<br/><br/>Po Ping or Dragon warrior (Black) managed through his daring deeds and hopeless optimism to save ""Kung Fu"" in the first film, here he has a much harder task. Finding himself, reconciling his own adoption and achieving ""inner peace"" all the while fighting off the genocidal Lord Shen (Oldman) of Gongman City. Shen is intent on destroying everything and everyone to fill the emptiness, due to a lack of paternal love.<br/><br/>As Po would say, ""It's like, quite deep"".<br/><br/>As before, Po manages to complete daring feats and heroic acts, not so much out of bravery but by falling skillfully, more often than not led by his ample stomach in search of a quick feed. He does not do this alone of course, we have on hand his usual fighting crew. Tigress (Jolie), Monkey (Chan), Mantis (Rogen), Crane (Cross) & Viper (Liu), heavy hitting star power for a children's animated movie.<br/><br/>We also have Shifu (Hoffman) returning as a ""Yoda"" like mentor and Mr Ping (Hong) as Po's adopted father, who provides comic relief and some touching scenes in equal measure. The film tidying up the slight oddity of a Panda being the son of a Goose. Michelle Yeo voices the soothsayer that predicts Shen's future, who may or may not be useful to his quest in equal measure. Even Jean Claude Van Damme gets a look in as Master Croc, which always looks good on your filmography.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the animation and sound are top rate and the story unfolds in a natural way and does not feel conceived merely to extend the franchise. We wanted to know more about the character and here we explore Po's past and why this new threat is so personal and debilitating to him, his own Kryptonite if you will.<br/><br/>What made the previous film really stand out was the hand drawn oriental style animation that interspersed the action, fleshing out stories told by the characters. Here we are again treated to similar sequences which lift the film to another level. For every child friendly chase sequence there is a tender scene which manages to appeal to adults without detracting from the on screen colourful antics.<br/><br/>Will Po manage to vanquish evil again, find balance and reconcile his past, well the deviations from the norm can only be stretched so far but the journey is the thing and there is much to enjoy along the way.<br/><br/>Could well be the the best animated film of the year, Pixar have definite competition in this genre and perhaps mirroring the arc from Toy Story 1 to 2. If so, then the third outing could be special indeed.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Equalling or even eclipsing the first film this achieves all the studio could have hoped for. Family friendly with a good heart, exquisite animation and a starry but well used voice cast.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended and as the tagline says, ""full of awesomeness""."
"bob the moo","Null","3","3","2 June 2019"," Enjoyable family film that adds a bit of darkness, and a lot of scale, to the strengths of the first film
","I'd not seen the first Kung-Fu Panda film since it had come out in the late noughties, and I hadn't seen any of the other ones at all until it my toddler started watching them and I picked up 2 and 3 for her. After watching the first one loads, I managed to move her to the second, for my own variety as much as anything else. The plot sees Po trying to settle into his new role as Dragon Warrior, at the same time as a banished son returns to the city to use a new powerful weapon to seize control of the city and country. It has a slightly darker tone than the first film, because it touches on Po's backstory, and it carries itself with more dramatic sequences than the first film did (where we only got to see the power and anger of Tai Lung in a handful of scenes - mostly the film was about Po's training).<br/><br/>This slightly extra weight adds to the characters and the narrative, and at the same time the scale of the film feels bigger as we move into a city, with the stakes high. This means the action sequences feel like they mean more, and in return the actions is bigger, more polished, and fits well with the gravity-defying excess of the genre that the film is referencing and drawing from. It did this well in the first film too, but here it feels much more satisfying in the scale of it all. At its heart though the film remains funny, entertaining, easy for families, and with good moral messages throughout. As with the first film, the use of Chinese culture swings from mostly feeling well used and cleverly adopted, to being a bit cheap - but mostly it works well.<br/><br/>Animation and production is of a very high standard, and the voice cast is even deeper than in the first film, with people like Oldman, Yeoh, Haysbert, Garber, Van Damme, and McBride joining an already very starry cast. Black doesn't always work for me, but he keeps Po funny but likeable, while Oldman manages to bring gravity to his performance and have good comic timing too.<br/><br/>In my mind, the Kung-Fu Panda films were sort of 'lesser' films because I always saw Pixar's deeper content as being superior to Dreamworks stuff, however this second film lifts from the already good first, and is a very enjoyable and satisfying family film."

","Same disappointing effort as the first. This time Po must face some demons from his past and discover his inner peace. Once again it is the villain that really impresses, with Gary Oldman getting all the best material. His voice is everything an antagonist needs to be. Calm, sinister, with a certain ounce of charm. The flashbacks are represented in what looks like 2D hand drawn animation. These segments have more depth and emotion than anything else in the film. By this point even Dreamworks' capable skills look tired. Why concentrate so much on the hairs on an animals face when you can't even build up some believable camaraderie between the Furious Five. If at any point I'd believed these characters were in danger I may have actually given a damn about the action sequences. A few jokes work, baby Po is cute, but I can't really recommend this."

","A few things can definitely be recommended about ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" in 3D and none of them have anything to do with Jack Black. Overall, the film gets mixed grades.<br/><br/>The artwork, the visuals and computer graphics are simply stunning. The production team gets a tip o' the Dodgers cap. Seriously, it's the only reason to see the movie.<br/><br/>Having just raved about the visuals, it's got be be said that at least 10 minutes of the bombastic kung fu fight scenes could easily have been cut.<br/><br/>Why? Because it was nothing but ridiculous overkill, i.e., filler to flesh out a weak and mostly empty script so that the studio could deliver a 90-minute film & justify charging $10-15.<br/><br/>I read that star Jack Black is taking credit for re-writing much of his part. Ten-year-olds loved the results. I'm not sure that many over-10-ers did. Face it, the real Jack Black seems to be nothing more than a big overgrown 10-year-old, so it figures.<br/><br/>Not being a fan of his, a little Jack Black goes a very long way for me. I pretty much think that the guy is minimally talented & basically one of the luckiest, most fortunate people in Hollywood. I do not get his mega-fame.<br/><br/>BTW, John Powell & Hans Zimmer's score stands out in several places.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the big-name cast, octogenarian James Hong as Yoda and Gary Oldman as the chief Blue Meanie are darned good.<br/><br/>However, the rest just don't stand out at all. You could tell me that Jean-Claude Killy voiced Master Croc, not Jean-Claude Van Damme, and I wouldn't have known the difference.<br/><br/>The story & script: Since this is so obviously a kids flick, why did writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger get so deep into the philosophy of finding peace that was what the whole movie was about? This plot went nowhere with the kids I went with & talked to. It was way over their heads.<br/><br/>No, overall, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" was a hodgepodge of good & bad. Good visuals, stunning even - and bad everything else."

","What a terrible movie.<br/><br/>Every single line of dialogue was cringe worthy.

It is a Saturday morning cartoon stretched to one and a half hours.<br/><br/>The Chinese accents were grating. Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman and Gary Oldman's voices did not seem out of place, so why the director felt the need to give all the minor characters Chinese voice actors or Chinese accents to make the movie more authentic when it actually detracts from the experience is beyond me.<br/><br/>The worst aspect of the movie is the fact that Po didn't need to do any hard work or make any effort whatsoever to become stronger; he just got an instant power-up to God mode. It's the antithesis to every single kung-fu movie ever made, where effort and hard work pay off. It's basically telling the audience you can do nothing and still achieve greatness.<br/><br/>The film must've been written by kung-fu fanboys who have no idea about the subject matter beyond the flashy wire-fu.<br/><br/>The very last scene at the end just confirms that this is nothing but a quick and easy cash grab, and that more quick and easy cash grabs are to come."
"bl-606-352256","4","12","29","23 June 2011"," No replay value. Flat, Predictable, and Charmless
","Some characters voiced by famous people were barely used (especially the snake, monkey, and bird). I didn't see the first movie, but they just seemed like baggage that couldn't be cut. I feel bad for David Cross getting about 3 lines and none of them being comedic. This was an all star voice cast, and it was mostly wasted.<br/><br/>There was no emotional build up in the plot or development of the characters. It just stumbled through a series of henchmen fight scenes. You knew how the movie was going to turn out in the end. In fact this was one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen. Let alone the plot, scenes, and character types we've seen 100 times before, I found myself predicting the ends of the characters lines way too many times. There was no charm to this movie. Compare to a Pixar movie, they both use clichés, but Pixar films are actually remembered. Nobody in this film really had a developed personality besides Jack Black's character.<br/><br/>Visually, the entire film seemed to be colored an ominous red and gray. It made for a very uncomfortable movie as the whole thing looked like it was over a fire. Compare to Mulan, where there were scenes in the white snow or woods. That was visually memorable. Who cares about the good CG animation, its like buying a 3 year old expensive crayons. In addition I was confused by the purpose of a lot of the non-kung fu action scenes. I felt like I was watching a video game someone else was playing. They went on for forever. I was later told this would normally be in 3D, makes sense. These scenes are time filling garbage.<br/><br/>Review was harsh, but honestly they created this for the quick cash so I don't think they care. This has almost no replay value and won't stay in your memory for long. It won't bore you to death or anything, I didn't have a bad time watching it, but something irks me when they pull movies like these out of a can and I come here to find it has a rating of about 8. That's on par with Aladdin/Fantasia and above Cinderella/Dumbo. Lets be honest, its about a 4."
"tedg","Null","5","10","6 June 2011"," Seeing Inside
","I've been in China for a month, discovering calligraphic cinematic principles. I had a chance to see this film while there and note two remarkable aspects.<br/><br/>The first is that while this is wholly an American film in its obsession with fathers, character sculpting and pace, it is set in China. Because image in China of China is so tightly controlled, and because the Chinese narrative is carried by outward facing youth and commerce, films such as these build the national narrative as surely as Zhong's efforts. <br/><br/>But what is this film about? The attempt to rule China by force, eliminating the noble nature of the people, here denoted by Kung Fu. (Yes, I know real kung fu has little to do with martial arts, and that the current focus is because temples had to invent something to sell in order to survive. Real kung fu is supposedly the soul of the Tao.)<br/><br/>Though I happened to see this in the most privileged area of Shanghai, Xin Tian Di, I think most of the audience saw it as I did, a successful struggle against tyranny. Shanghai is a city of 22 million. Perhaps a half a million are the privileged, but as much as 75% of the people just in this city are immigrants no different than those exploited in New York 100 years ago. They have no rights. They don't speak the local language.<br/><br/>IMDb is blocked in China, presumably because it did not excise films about Tibet. A ticket to 'Panda' is expensive, though pirated DVDs are a cheap as 25 cents, so possibly only a few hundred million people will see this in China. The first of this franchise was a surprise hit in China, especially among the young college educated. I wonder if this will contribute to democratic action, or simply be another American amusement. <br/><br/>The other remarkable thing was the explicit use of what I call Ted's Law. This law is my observation that when a new narrative layer is explicitly inserted in a film, it is placed exactly one step further on the distance of between reality and the main narrative of the film. So for instance ""Death to Smoochy"" is a film with a certain center of abstraction. It internally features a TeeVee show which occupies its own conceptual space. In all the ways that the film is abstracted, this is abstracted one more step as far, so that we are fooled into placing ourself in the movie as if it is reality. <br/><br/>This principle is used in most films, but I really like it when it is done purely cinematically. Here, we have a three-d animated world that we are supposed to enter. Within that world are suppressed memories of our hero, an event where his tribe was killed in a Herodian massacre. The story, such as it has a human dimension, is about our panda encountering this inner narrative. It is portrayed as an inner cartoon, one that uses crude, two-dimensional animation. Ted's law is obvious. But this is so common that it would be unremarkable where it not for a halfstep back from that cartoon abstraction.<br/><br/>The film starts with a shadow puppet play, of the sort that any Chinese film-goer will know from Zhang's 'To Live,' (and referenced by Scorcese). It is presented as a two-dimensional cartoon as well, but it isn't until an hour into the film that we are allowed to register it against the 'suppressed memory' fold. So we have the distance between us and the film. We have the distance between us and the original segment of the film as a puppet show prologue. And we have the distance between the main film and inner memory of the bear. When that appears, the original puppet show fold is redefined to be placed midway between those two as an example of another phenomenon I study: dynamic reinterpretation.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know this is not a serious film. But that doesn't mean that serious and deep craft is not applied in the investment, and this example is remarkable. To see how well it is pulled off, consider two characteristics of the peacock in his three incarnations: the way his neck moves and the red and white pattern on his tail.<br/><br/>Angeline Jolie continues her journey is redefining the strength of women.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"estebangonzalez10","6","3","5","20 October 2011"," A Decent Sequel
","¨ My fist hungers for justice! ¨<br/><br/>Po has returned to save China once again in Kung Fu Panda 2; with the same writers (Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger), but a different director (Jennifer Yuh). Many consider that the original Kung Fu Panda is DreamWorks's best animated film to date; in my opinion their best one is How to Train Your Dragon, but Kung Fu Panda was still a great movie. I had my concerns with the sequel because I knew it was going to be hard to meet expectations. Cars 2 failed in this respect for Pixar, but Kung Fu Panda 2 worked a little better. This film isn't nearly as good as the 2008 original, but for a sequel it works really well; it probably won't win an Oscar (Rango seems to have it pretty much locked up this year, although I didn't like it), but it is still very entertaining and the entire family will have a good time with this movie. The best thing about the film is the animation. Guillermo del Toro was brought in as the creative consultant for the Art Department and it really paid off because the look of the film is impressive and so are the visuals. The story is actually the weakest link, but it works mostly thanks to the characters we grew to love in the first film. There is also an interesting villain, voiced by Gary Oldman, so that was also a plus, but the story was really predictable. After the first 15 minutes you knew exactly what was going to happen at the end. Jean-Claude Van Damme also has a small role as the Master Croc, and it was fun to hear him. <br/><br/>Po (Jack Black) is living in the temple with the five kung fu warriors he has always idolized since he was little: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross). They seem to be training very hard as we hear Po breathing very heavily, but they are actually all staring at how many breads Po can fit into his mouth. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) calls for Po and tries to teach him about finding inner peace. Po is more of an action kind of Panda and is waiting to show off his kung fu skills as the Dragon Warrior (title which he achieved in the first film). His opportunity comes when the Village where his father Mr. Ping (James Hong) lives is attacked by a group of wolves who are stealing all the metal from the village. The wolves are gathering metal in order to create a secret weapon that will put an end to Kung Fu. They all work for the evil White Peacock named Shen (Gary Oldman) who is threatening to conquer China with this new powerful weapon. There is something about Shen that bothers Po and reminds him of his forgotten past. Po begins to have flashbacks about his childhood and discovers that Mr. Ping is not his actual father. Along with his friends, Po begins a quest to stop Shen before it's too late, and at the same time discover the truth about his past.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 is not as fresh and fun as the first film, but it still was a lot of fun. Po is really a fun character and one can't help but be reminded of Jack Black when watching Po trying to do his kung-fu stunts. Po is not only voiced by Jack Black, but he seems to be inspired by that character. In the same way there is a scene where we see Master Croc (voiced by Van Damme) do one of his singular moves from his action films. Jack Black is an incredibly funny actor and we find some of that comedy in Po's animation. Gary Oldman also brought a lot of things to his new character, and he is always great at playing the villain. Kung Fu Panda 2 might not be as good as the original, but that doesn't mean you won't have fun with this family friendly film. My only complaint relies in the story, but the animation and visuals make up for it. Kung Fu Panda is a fun film you can enjoy with the family, but not much more than that.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Panda and Kung fu China Anthropomorphism Anthropomorphism at its best.<br/><br/>This computer-animated action comedy film from the studio DreamWorks Animation is one movie on the likes of its other production, Shrek. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson, is also the first woman to solely direct an animated feature from a major Hollywood studio. And the impression of a women is clearly seen. The Panda is made lovable like a kid with innocence splattered all over. The screenplay is wonderful and gives some genuine laughter. The lines are small but witty and full of Humor. The animation lacks details like that of Ratatouille but in some scene where The Guru Red Panda is introduced with Inner Peace Practice is shown with extreme details and gives a good feeling. However The 3D version, like always, lacks depth of field and details. The blurred vision is extremely lively only in few scenes. The frame with Apples blurting out of Panda's big mouth is a true Roller-coaster. <br/><br/>The story is about revenge and is unimpressive. The animation was the savior with the rightful dubbing and voice-acting. The voice of Jack Black along with Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu was perfectly scored and synchronized. Especially Jack Black timing were good. Ancient China was shown beautifully , but the selection of animals for Anthropomorphism was dubious. There was a peacock ruling Chinese lands and no use of Dogs and Ox. Other Animals from Chinese philosophy like Goose, Rabbit, Dragon and pigs were wise-fully used. The Mantis was shown powerful was another story untold. The use of explosives to cease Kung-fu was really childish. The enemy was not shown with equal Powers and therefore this one sided flick. The use of digital puppetry shows china in good light and keeping its tradition flawless. The Movie is good and watchable with all age, there is no explicit dialogs except a pinch of digital violence. Panda is lovable and cute and cuddly and tender."

In the first film, Po has severe tension with all the main characters--good and bad. The conflict between Po and Mr Ping his Dad, Po and Master Shifu, Po and the Fantastic Five, Po and Tigress, Po and his eating dysfunction, Po and learning Kung-Fu was severe and superb. All the tension was excellently crafted and laid the foundation for humor to release the tension at just the right times. Ian McShane's Tai-Lung was a far better villain and the tension between them was excellent. This sequel could have created a new type of tension with all the characters. Perhaps there could have been treachery within the Fantastic Five(or just perceived treachery), or perhaps a severe misunderstanding with Shifu. But no, instead the story writers gave very weak tension between Po and Master Ox and Croc and minor tension with Po saving China from the evil Shen. The Wolf Boss and wolves, nor the Gorillas were ever perceived as on Shen's side or even a threat, really. The writers even included a fortune-teller that ruined ANY tension between Po and Shen and the eventual outcome altogether. Very anti-climactic. The story about his adoption was touching, and the only reason I gave it a 2 instead of 1."

","This is one of those sequels that doesn't continue a story but still manages to be successful. Kung Fu Panda has a plot that is so concise and well made that you cannot continue the story. You can however create a new story within the universe and do so with wonderful development of characters you already know and create one centered around the concept of man vs machine. The cast and writing is just as good as the original but it still feels like a sequel. This franchise could have been a solo film and I think that it should have. However, after seeing the first one, the sequel is luckily an animated film worthy of attention."

","Kung fu panda 2 is a better made movie than Kung fu panda.<br/><br/>CHARACTER
Po gets way more development in this movie than in the last movie.
In this movie he goes through self discovery not knowing who he is and were he came from but manages to pull himself together and become a more stronger man afterwards.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
Shen was also a pretty good villain.
He wasn't as good as Tai Lung but they manage to do the same with him as they did to Tau lung to make him an acceptable villain.
He dosent show his strength but he manages to be a good plot device for Pos development and he has a bit of a backstory himself to give him a little bit more depth.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action was yet again amazing and awesomely choreographed.
The different shots and creative techniques they use will definitely get you hooked.<br/><br/>VERDICT
Awesome movie and really a worthy sequel.
I really wonder what they will do in Kung fu panda 3"

He helps makes Po the Axel Foley of Animation. Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen and Dustin Hoffman are also back respectively as Tigress, Mantis and Shifu but this time, they are all a little bit underused. Gary Oldman gives a fine performance as the film's villain, Shen, but is close to other great villain performances such as Ursula and Scar. Also good is Michelle Yeoh as the voice of the Soothslayer.<br/><br/>Jennifer Yun Nelson handles her first film both a little slow and fast at times. Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger's script acts sometimes as an 3-part episode of a 90's animated Saturday morning series running for 90 minutes. The animated effects {both in 2-D and in 3-D} are not as eye-popping or great in the first but it still good.<br/><br/>When I saw it in 3-D, It was good for the first 25 minutes, but during the rest of the time, I began to feel restless and taking off my 3-D glasses twice.

"griffolyon12","7","1","1","11 June 2011"," There is no way a Goose is that Panda's Dad!
","Who am I? Kung Fu Panda 2 is about a panda with an identity crisis. Po, our hero (voiced by Jack Black), has mastered the art of kung fu, but when his father (a goose) reveals he isn't really Po's father (I know, shocker, right?), Po begins to wonder who he truly is. All the while Po has dreams of what he believes to be his real parents, and a peacock who haunts the darkness in the midst of flames.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 is a character piece, that has some astonishing action set pieces, both highly creative and well choreographed with the camera, a rarity in this day and age of confusing whiz-bang action. The villainous peacock, Shen (voiced malevolently by Gary Oldman), has deep ties to Po's past, making him a villain that seems more menacing than your average, ""I wanna take over the world,"" bad guy, even though he wants to do that too. No other character is ever given anytime to develop or grow further than what their archetype allows, which kind of echoes the overall sentiment. There is an attempt at depth to the story, but it is rushed at almost each attempt to reach the next cool action set piece. While the story and humor always works, the emotion is not always there. Perhaps if more time had been taken and certain things fleshed out, this would be more than an enjoyable kid's movie and be something more, regardless, the action and humor of Kung Fu Panda 2 charms the child inside.<br/><br/>I give Kung Fu Panda 2 a 7 out of 10!"
"salmanzaheer9","7","1","1","9 June 2011"," A clichéd amusement
","I went a little late to see this movie. I admit I was a little skeptical at first to go watch an animated movie as 90 minutes mean a lot to me. Though my love for the cute Panda took the better of me and I went to see it.<br/><br/>The movie was full of laughs. It was light; it had me on the edge of the seat during all the action, and the graphics were simply beautiful. But though this movie flowed through perfectly without giving me a second to feel bored, the clichéd story made it almost easy for me to predict that everything would get right in the end... and so it does!<br/><br/>As I watched Po battle Shen(the peacock), I went like, 'Oh we know in the end Po would be this big hero!'Those around me did not like me being a spoiler but fact is fact. Po is the hero in the end and then we go on to the end of a happy ending, with a room for a sequel left behind as well(Surely wouldn't miss that!)<br/><br/>So over-all, it was a good movie, with nice and funny lines and cute animations. The action is intense and the movie is good if you don't like to boggle your mind over the story much. Wouldn't recommend it for those who are mature and think this movie would be different than the other kids movies. But if your a teenager, go ahead and enjoy the movie and the elder sisters of the kids who come to see this title(!). It is definitely worth a watch."

The team behind the movie has taken great pains on the finer details of every character and every single pixel, ensuring the audience is enthralled for the entire movie. Well done to them! The story this time strikes a much resonant and emotional chord, and my kids sobbed when they saw the scene of Po's forced abandonment by his mother in order to save his life. And in the reunion of adopted father and son in the final scene pulls the heartstrings till no end. There's also a big hint of a KP3 just before the show ends.<br/><br/>This is an excellent follow-up to the original, and exceeds every level."
"mamosh17","2","7","19","25 June 2011"," Kung Fu Panda 2
","Kung Fu Panda 2 was produced by Dream works Animation Co. The stream line of the movie is about the relationship between Po (panda) and Lord Shen (peacock). On one side Shen has the dream of making a deadly weapon using which he can take over China and on the other side Po, who wants to be the best Kung Fu warrior, realizes Shen was responsible for his loneliness. Thats it!<br/><br/>These days most animations have the same story. Most of the time there are black and white sides and the whole story is about one side overcoming the other. Nothing new! I myself am sort of getting bored by these kinds of scenarios. Dream works should seriously look for richer contents. Animations like Spirited Away (A masterpiece animation from Japan) could be a very good shinning model for Dream Works Animation Co. to retain their audience appeal. They seriously need to follow such artistic works with richer and more powerful content if they want to make things work again or else they can try to continue with their older better productions like Chicken Run(2000).<br/><br/>Above said, there is however one very nice and emotional scene in Kung Fu Panda 2 which I like the most, and it is when Po remembers his childhood and the way he lost his parents. Such eye-catching visual effects and dreamy colors were used in these scenes."
"richnieh","5","7","19","6 June 2011"," Hardly worth the money
","Well, the story is just dull. I simply find it as normal as it gets and totally predictable. The fact that Po just simply find a way to realize the marshal art by 'thinking' about it and call it destiny is none-sense. For any marshal art, the worriers need to practice and maybe in older age, they will find inspiration so they can realize the true arts and have the break through. Otherwise, you are some kind of genius and very suitable to practice marshal art and learn something from special scroll or something, then you can learn the true art. In the first movie, at least ShiFu somehow find a way to train Po so he becomes strong in the end. Still ridiculous but acceptable. In the second story, that part of the story is just so thin and Taichi just suddenly fall in onto the lab and he becomes the master of it OK, if you just simply for a laugh and try to watch the cute panda, it is OK. However, what you have not seen in the second movie that is not in the first one? The story is not funny anymore, Panda is the same as before and the whole thing really just rushed all way to the end. The parents-son relationship is pretty thin as well. I really enjoyed the first movie and now I find the second one a disappointment. Again, watch in big screen may give the movie a few positive point and really no point to watch it again on small screen.<br/><br/>5 points for the average effort."

"3xHCCH","6","6","16","26 May 2011"," Disappointed: Not as Good as the First
","Just got home from watching the first showing of Kung Fu Panda 4 in local cinema with my kids. We were all very excited about it because we loved the first film very much because of the excellent animation, the snappy dialogues and above all, its heart.<br/><br/>However as the movie was starting, for the first few minutes, I was underwhelmed and even bored with the very slow pace of things. The story dealt with Po discovering that he was adopted by his goose father. This is no spoiler because we all obviously know it. We will eventually learn what happened to his parents and how he ended up in a box of radishes outside the noodle shop. From here to there though, the rest of story was very transparent. There was no thrill of discovery for me. The drama seemed forced. I wanted so much to like it, but there was something missing.<br/><br/>The voice acting of Jack Black is most distinct and identifiable. He gives Po a most lovable personality. The rest of the voice acting felt generic, such that those big name stars lending their voices were not really necessary. Yes, including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Dustin Hoffman. Gary Oldman voices the main antagonist Lord Shen, a misguided peacock. While having a peacock as the vicious enemy was original, it was not executed too well, I felt.<br/><br/>On the more positive end, the artwork and animation was definitely still top-notch. The color and computer effects were astounding. The dialogs were similarly snappy. Too bad, the story was not substantial enough to satisfy me. As much as I liked the individual technical aspects, the product as a whole was ultimately unmemorable. The heart of the film was still there though, but by the time you feel it, you may have already been too disappointed to actually appreciate it."
"atakyle","5","8","24","13 June 2011"," Better than the first, but that's not saying much.
","I have mixed feelings for this film. A part of me thinks it was a fairly decent family film, but another part of me thinks that this was unfunny and mediocre.<br/><br/>First of all, the characters are very poorly developed (besides Po). Tigress only has a few lines in this sequel, Viper only has 3 or 4 lines, and Mantis barely speaks at all. Also, about 3/4 through the movie, we're introduced to 2 new characters named Master Croc and Master Rhino. What? Who are these guys. Then, Po says ""(gasps) It's Master Croc and Master Rhino! One of the greatest martial artists of all time!"". They don't get very much of a backstory. Master Croc and Master Rhino just randomly show up. Secondly, what kind of bothers me a little is that everyone keeps saying ""Becuase of Shen (the villain), kung fu is DEAD, man."" What?! That doesn't make any sense! Don't they know that they can pass it on from generation to generation?! Lastly, *SPOILER ALERT* Shen's ""secret weapon"" is a CANNON. Seriously? You couldn't come up with a more threatening and more frightening weapon? Honestly, why can't you just demolish it by going all Kung Fu on it? I mean, Po and everyone else had the chance to do so when they were standing next to it, but they didn't!<br/><br/>Also, the action scenes are just ridiculous. I mean, since when does Martial Arts gives you the power to roll a drop of water around your hand and throw back a cannonball after it is thrown to you? Also, when the characters fight the bad guys, they go super fast and then they start fighting someone else, and then someone else, and then someone else! It makes me very dizzy, and most of the time, I can't tell what's going on!<br/><br/>Thirdly, the jokes really aren't that funny. Some kids were laughing their heads off, but everyone else around 12 and above didn't even chuckle at this movie.<br/><br/>The thing that really bothers me is that Kung Fu Panda 1 & 2 is giving everyone the wrong idea. Martial Arts isn't all about the punching and kicking, it's about learning courage, perseverance, self-control, honor, and friendship and giving it to others, and this series does a TERRIBLE job at delivering that message!<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good movie for kids, but for everyone else, you may not like it."

Many time we can laugh at the dumbness of the Panda. <br/><br/>There were few moments when movie was very interesting, especially the Panda's chase around the city. Otherwise, it seemed like those old fashioned movie where hero(s) family is destroyed by villain and hero takes revenge.<br/><br/>My rating is only basic on the graphic content for the movie, have tried to portray things very realistically.

"Mathewdixon42","10","2","4","13 May 2016"," Dark. Deep... and better than the first?
","SPOILERS INVOLVED HERE:<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 exists as not only a wonderful film, but a benchmark for sequels in general. The animation is fantastic, the story is deep and dark, the characters evolve, and the acting is tremendous!<br/><br/>Starting with the animation. This is a very energetic and fast moving film for the most part, and the animation follows suit. It's bright and colorful. It is a feast for the eyes, and it doesn't insult the audience by skipping through the animation too quickly. <br/><br/>I don't know if it directly came from Guillermo Del Toro's involvement or not, but the story here took a very dark turn from the original. Po's past comes into play leading to some very real tear-jerking moments. Particularly his flashback to his last memories of his parents. This is handled with very little dialogue in two different animation styles. Po's budding friendship with Tigress is explored in this film. There are some very adorable and intense scenes between these two. It could almost be construed as a possible future romance, but this is just an interpretation. Po and Tigress have both taken steps forward as characters in this story. Tigress grows to accept and even like Po. This is a relief after her hard nosed disrespect for him in the first. Po is still a large clumsy Panda for the most part. He has learned Kung Fu and realized his dream, and has even shown to grow up a bit. He has some very serious moments this time. <br/><br/>Jack Black is, as usual, very funny and breezy in this one. It's simply Jack Black being Jack Black, nothing special. Overall good. <br/><br/>The real scene thief in this film is Gary Oldman. His slow, creepy voice is perfect for the calculating Lord Shen. His character and design is the opposite to Tai-Lung from the first. Lord Shen is the most interesting character is this film by far. Gary Oldman is always fantastic in his villain roles, and this is one of his best. His masterful voice work dwarfs just about any other animated villain of the modern age. <br/><br/>Overall this is a wonderful sequel that builds upon everything established in the original in the best way possible. <br/><br/>10/10. It is mind-blowing just how great this turned out to be, considering it is a sequel. The world general agrees that follow-ups rarely match the original in quality, let alone to succeed it. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a better film than the original. Due mostly to the dark and engaging story-line, the growth of some characters, the fast paced animation, and in particular Gary Oldman's incredible performance."
"MartinHafer","6","2","4","17 July 2012"," Nice CGI, but otherwise rather unnecessary.
","I loved the movie ""Kung Fu Panda"" and gave it a well-earned 9. However, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is like MOST CGI movies these days--an unnecessary sequel that was simply an excuse to bleed just a bit out of the original source material. Frankly, the plethora of sequels just seems very lazy and cynical towards the audience. Sure...""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is pretty good, but 'pretty good' is a far cry from the original. I sure would love to see an end to this awful practice.<br/><br/>The story once again finds out hero panda filled with uncertainty (though he sure APPEARED to have come into his own in the last film!). This is a problem since an all-new baddie with cannons is on his way (Gary Oldman)--and kung fu doesn't seem to be effective against this super-weapon. However, since this is formula, you know that by the end of the film all will be well once again. However, in the meantime, be prepared for a movie that is almost non-stop action and with a very dark tone--very dark. In fact, it's so dark that the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten one important thing--to make it fun. Overall, watchable and with incredible graphics--but it sure was a lot better in the first installment. I've heard they are making a ""Kung Fu Panda 3""...whoopee."
"weathergirl98","10","2","4","3 January 2012"," Even better than the first
","When I sat down to watch this movie, I was hesitant. By the time it was over, I was utterly shocked. This sequel had such a deeper, serious tone that was really surprising to see. It had its comedic relief moments, but the way the story was told was beautiful, really. Po's story comes to life before your eyes, and you can't help but cry a little when you discover what happened when he was only a child. Gary Oldmen was probably the best voice-actor in the movie. He did such a wonderful job of capturing Lord Shen, and I was captivated in every scene he was in. Jack Black adjusted well to the panda he was playing as, and his voicing improved greatly.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in the last movie when the Furious Five hardly had any part, but I was pleased to have them brought forth much more. Tigress, especially, was one of the biggest characters, and I loved it. You definitely see a much more sensitive side of her, especially the emotions she portrays when Po confronts her of being ""too hardcore she can't understand feelings."" It's hard to say a relationship forms between the two, but it is enough to satisfy.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are well choreographed in the film. I found myself backtracking many times just to re-watch one of the fights. It was intriguing, really. As was the animation! It was superb.<br/><br/>The ending was so shocking! It gave a serious cliffhanger that could well lead into another movie, but at the same time, is really moving and well-thought out.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was excellent. It is made for any age, and even adults would thoroughly enjoy it. The sequel was definitely wonderful, and if this is the end of Kung Fu Panda, they finished wonderfully. You won't regret watching this.<br/><br/>10/10"

It's embarrassing, but there were portions that had me tearing up as much as the five-year-old next to me. Overall, the sequel lives up to the first movie and even manages to exceed it in terms of the level of depth of its message.

","In my opinion, Kung Fu Panda 2 is severely underrated. Many seem to prefer the first one over this. However, I completely disagree. The first Kung Fu Panda movie is funny and has a simple story. This film is more emotional and character driven. Whereas the first film was about Po learning Kung Fu, this one focuses more on Po coming to terms with his tragic past.<br/><br/>Already the film has done what every sequel should do, giving the main character a new arc. Another thing is the world building. Most of the film takes place in Gongmen City, and the tall buildings and more advanced architecture is a refreshing change to the setting of the first film. It also further develops the Furious Five, especially Tigress, who's friendship with Po grows much stronger over the course of the story.<br/><br/>Shen, like Tailong in the first film, is the best character. Unlike Tailong, he does not pose a threat to Po in the physical sense, but rather in a emotional way. It was Shen who massacred Po's village, and ergo created his own greatest enemy. Shen is cold and cruel, and a lot of things he does and says are not what you usually see in a animated film. Shen is a great villain to succeed Tailong and a far more dangerous antagonistic force.<br/><br/>Po himself changes. He learns the truth about his tragic past and how he came to be adopted. But Po learns that although his story may not have started out well, his life has become much greater since, which is how he finally gains inner peace by the third act. He is overall a much more mature person than he was in the first movie, although he still has the goofy one liners that are integral to his character.<br/><br/>The action in this film is even better than the first film's. The unique locations and stunning color choices along with some of the best action choreography I have ever seen in a kids film all combine together to make gorgeous looking battles. Most of this film takes place during the night time, so the fire and explosions really stand out. Shen himself is a pure white peacock, and he contrasts heavily with his surroundings, making him instantly recognizable in any scene.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also as good as, if not better than, the first film. Here it's less noticeable and more subtle, blending in perfectly with the action. In the third act it really elevates the feeling of suspense. Po standing up to a dozen enemy ships and throwing fireballs by achieving pure peace is my favorite moment during the entire trilogy. His final battle and Shen's defeat are done perfectly.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 is the Empire Strikes Back of the Kung Fu Panda trilogy. It does everything a sequel needs to and then some more. It is slower paced than the first one, but that is in favor of more emotional beats and better build up. It is a movie that everyone can enjoy and love for many different reasons, and I for one, look forward to revisiting it."

","The question that has been floating around about Kung Fu Panda 2 is if it is Shrek 2 or Toy Story 2 of animated sequels? Well, I'm happy to say it's Toy Story 2 kind of animated sequel - a genuine good movie that takes risks and succeeds rather than rehashing the first movie.<br/><br/>Po isn't as much of a gastro-kung-fu fighter and fanboi from the first movie but has grown in his personality; he's less the Jack Black as a panda and more of a character that stands on it's own. However, Po is now the tragic hero in a Greek style prophecy which foretells of a warrior in black and white who would defeat a certain Lord Shen who has invented a new weapon that could spell the end of kung-fu. As Po learns that he is adopted, he struggles to find out about his past and the strange symbol from his nightmares. The heavy subject matter doesn't weight down the movie and is continually and cleverly able to escape into funny moments without losing gravitas. It successfully weaves the topics of fatherhood, friendship and family into a colorful story that even though we know how it will end, it gets there very very emphatically.<br/><br/>I'm really glad that Kung Fu Panda 2 didn't go the route of being a purely children's movie and didn't go the route of being built on jokes of Po's eating and Po's weight. I suppose the fortune cookie philosophy of master Shifu is slightly missed but purely a small quibble in a good movie.

In order to defeat his new enemy, Po has to remember his past and unlock secrets from his mysterious origins.<br/><br/>They say that the second parts are bad, but this is not always the case. There are many good things that this sequel has that makes it so good:<br/><br/>1) As always, Hans Zimmer did a job as good as the music in this movie as it did in the prequel.<br/><br/>2) It has the same good quality animation as that prequel.<br/><br/>3) Worth seeing it over and over again.<br/><br/>4) It has catchy phrases Who doesn't remember the phrase ""My fist is hungry for justice.

This scene can upset these viewers, especially those who lost their mother when they were little.<br/><br/>I remember seeing the movie for the first time on television, not only on television, but also on the Internet.

","Hitting the ground running with a beautiful prologue using, I guess you'd call it cut out puppetry.<br/><br/>Thus they establish a mission statement to not try to fix a formula that was never broken while still trying to give it a new sheen.<br/><br/>The most memorable aspect of this movie is its antagonist. Having said that I think they wasted him a little bit. I don't mean that he doesn't get as much air screen time as he deserves, but they show us this amazing, charismatic formidable bad guy with a theatrical edge (wink wink) and he is so badass a part of me sort of wanted to route for him instead. Sadly they decided to commit him to the role of clownish villain when he could have been so much scarier. Again, it's not campiness that dampens it but that he is so blatantly an emotionally damaged character he starts to look pitiful when if they had had more of a feather touch he could have been an intimidating villain while maintaining a complex edge. In practice his motivations just seems abstractly about power but never mind.<br/><br/>His back story is thematically consistent with Po (that's the panda) main problem: this movie is based around that old chestnut of the theme of belonging i.e. wondering who your (birth) parents are. The conclusions this draws are predictable and it can be hard to really relate to how much Po obsesses over biological relation.<br/><br/>But fortunately this does not dominate the picture. You will quite feasibly want to watch this a few times for all the amazing visual detail with intensely impressive martial arts choreography and a sumptuous display of sinitic color. The score is unusually infectious for a Hans Zimmer score and all the laughs you'd expect are there with Jack Black in top form. The interplay of traditional and CGI animation is most effective and when it gets sentimental it almost brought a tear to my eye because they earned it.<br/><br/>We also get to see Po's developing relationship with Tigress and the rest of the Furious get their moments too."

","""Everybody was kung fu fighting!"" much more so in this sequel when compared to its predecessor. The Furious Five were slapping Shen's army of diabolical wolves left, right and centre. Master Shifu prodding his stick conveniently during the climactic battle. And a plethora of other anthropomorphic beasts harnessing the power of said martial art. This very much felt like an animated martial arts feature, one aspect the original was sorely missing. However, despite DreamWorks' best efforts in continuing Po's search in becoming the Dragon Warrior, its quality offers no improvements. Unable to surpass the boundaries of family-friendly humour that reduces the visual splendour and narrative heft to progress the story onto the next level.<br/><br/>Po, having realised who his parents truly are (not a goose...), must save China with the Furious Five from the malicious peacock Shen and his fascination with metallic weapons. DreamWorks constantly pump out family orientated animations with powerful morals every year. This sequel illustrating the ability to manipulate our past childhoods to shape the person we want to be. For Po, this meant ignoring the familial scars that Shen caused, producing his prepubescent abandonment. A notable moral that many should abide by, but unfortunately is weighed down by excessive comedy that diminished a vast amount of beautiful moments. Aside from the tantalising scene when Po finally discovered what happened to his parents, conveyed through mesmerising hand-drawn animated flashbacks, all other heartfelt examples were brutalised by Po's apparent requirement to exercise his bumbling personality. Black's prolific voice doesn't help matters, with a lack of sincerity to his vocal performance, but the frantic pacing and rushed sequences made for a frustrating central narrative.<br/><br/>That's not to say this sequel is poor, in fact it's just as consistent as its predecessor. Rather infuriating is all given the tender bamboo seeds that were lovingly planted, unable to grow into ferocious stalks. The humour, as overwhelming as it is, does provide characterisation to these animals. Po in particular. Making it hugely accessible for all members of all families to watch and enjoy.<br/><br/>The action sequences were splendid and vibrantly colourful, with some ingenious editing that made one chase scene resemble 'Pac-Man'. The oriental aesthetics and environments built a beautifully inclusive world for the characters to roam in. The antagonist, Shen, was far more memorable and sinister in comparison to...ummm...I forgot his name. The snow leopard? We'll go with that. Mostly due to Oldman's vocal work that has a larger range than the entirety of his filmography (and that's saying something!). The red and black lighting was, at times, excessive in depicting ""evil"" and surprisingly dark. No, not thematically. It was literally difficult to see anything!<br/><br/>Aside from that, Kung Fu Panda 2 slaps. And punches. And kicks. But also tumbles repetitively due to Po's constant buffoonery. It does however set the third film up nicely, so guess I'll have to give that a go..."

"oneguyrambling","6","0","0","27 December 2011"," Thankfully not the cash grab it could have been.
","Let me start out by saying that most of the charm in the original KFP was found in getting to know Po (Jack Black), Master Shifu and the Furious 5. The plot was fairly unspectacular and served only to pad the gaps between the action sequences. Well Dreamworks can't use the 'getting to know them' shtick anymore.<br/><br/>We know that Po was a starry eyed son of a goose with no Kung Fu skills. We know that he coincidentally was nominated by an elderly short sighted turtle to be trained by a surly possum named Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) alongside a praying mantis, snake, crane, tiger and monkey to become the Dragon Warrior, saving China from danger.<br/><br/>Re-read that Anyway this time we know all that, so all they have to 'wow' us is the action sequences and the plot. The action sequences are effective and occasionally as awe-inspiring as the posters demand we must find them. The plot is actually pretty thin and derivative, and is actually where Kung Fu Panda comes perilously close to Kung Phooey.<br/><br/>This time around Po is instructed by Master Shifu to find inner peace in order to save China from Shen (Gary Oldman), a naughty peacock banished from China as a chick I guess – who dreams of taking over the country with his army of wolves and other nasty looking creatures through the introduction of weapons, with which he plans to kill kung-fu! Shen is particularly concerned that the Soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) has foretold Shen's death at the hand of a black and white entity – gee wonder who that might be? Meanwhile Po and the Furious 5 are now local legends and spend their days as peacekeepers in the area, defeating ne-er-do-wells with kung-fu skills and exceptional teamwork. In a convenient revelation just before Po heads off to save the day he finds that his Father the goose is actually perhaps not his real Father after all who woulda thunk it? So off Po and the 5 go to kill two birds with one stone, only in this case there is in actuality but one bird, and they eschew weapons in favour of kung-fu, leaving the bird to use the 'stones' in his newly invented cannons.<br/><br/>In Kung Fu 2 Master Shifu takes a noticeable step into the background, appearing only a few times through the film, Tigress (Angelina Jolie) steps up to almost co-star duties, with her serious and determined ying counterpointing Po's casual and carefree yang. The rest of the Furious 5 retain their famous voices but are consigned to being mere comic relief and being momentarily spotlighted in the frequent battles that dominate the second half of the film.<br/><br/>Of course in between battles Po learns of his true origins alternately through interactions with Shen and the Soothsayer, and continues to search for his own inner peace deemed necessary to defeat his many feathered foe. This leads to an all star animal showdown with fur and feathers flying all over the shop in intricately choreographed and animated ways, and I don't think I am letting the cat out of the bag by saying that at the end of the day 'skadoosh goes the weasel'.<br/><br/>As with the original Kung Fu Panda the action sequences and growling menacing animals might prove a little much for the tots under say 7, but even though this was reasonably similar to the original film the action carries the bulk of Kung Fu 2, and the moving sequence that ends the film will leave you heading home with a warmer feeling than perhaps the slightly hackneyed story deserves.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Not the best animated movie you'll see this year (Rango will take some beating), but also not the most blatant shoulda been direct to DVD cash grab that I've seen."

","Okay!! Its official now, you can associate the word Awesome with Kung Fu Panda till eternity, because, it just is. <br/><br/>I am not going to spill out the beans but here is the gist of it. Po is a pro in his own style of Kung fu and is aware of his abilities now. He is living his dream to be the Dragon Warrior. With the Furious Five he heads towards a city to save Kung Fu and in his fight against the evil, unravels his own origin.<br/><br/>When I actually got up from my chair, I actually said these two words ""JUST AWESOME"". For me, Kung Fu Panda 2's USP is the story. The story was extremely important for the sequel especially when the first did set some mightily high standards to live up to. Good 3D effects & even better animation have undoubtedly added outstandingly to this exceptional movie. Even though Po achieved a new avatar, the lead character's trademark goofy manners had to be maintained because that's what makes the character adorable. Needless to say, Jake Black is tailor-made for this character. The man actually looks like Po, just kidding. <br/><br/>The movie has hilariously funny moments mixed with heartwarming scenes as well. Its wittiness is immeasurable and is unexpected. Amidst, all the seriousness intended in the scenes, comedy has been stitched quite intelligently. Moreover, the direction is also worth applauding. Successfully stuffing a story which is as good as this one with an Panda(animated or otherwise) and Kung fu is definitely not a piece of cake and the director achieves that humongous task with ease as you highly connect with the emotions projected throughout the movie and you absolutely forget that the characters and the happenings are fictional. At the end you actually want more and that is when you realize that this awesome flick will be followed with something worth finding out about. But for the time being, be prepared to fall in a bowl of AWESOMENESS again as Po is back."

"JazzKnight","7","0","0","19 June 2011"," Awesome? Well... almost.
","Having watched ""Kung Fu Panda (KFP-1)"" so many times and having fallen in love with those characters and humor again and again, the expectations were just so high for ""Kung Fu Panda 2 (KFP-2)"" when I watched it, and which it slightly fell short of. The IMDb ratings don't tell the real story. Ratings are high because the movie was visually spectacular. Agreed. Awesomenss in 3D! But as a movie, is it watchable as many times as the first part? And that, time can only tell.<br/><br/>KFP-1 was constantly hilarious and it was just nonstop fun. The villain ""Tai-Lung"" was ferociously special. KFP2 is a different breed. It touches various other aspects of life like - pain, sacrifice, vengeance, inner-peace... The villain ""Lord Shen"" is cunningly evil. So this movie, in a way, is more mature than the former, but not as flamboyantly hilarious.<br/><br/>One of the strong points of KFP-2, is the way it deals with the emotions. The sensitivity of relationships between Po (Panda) and his father (Duck), his friends - the furious five, especially Tigress, is dealt superbly well. Parts of the movie involving 'Po' as a baby, are very cute and touching. The sequence where 'Po' finds his inner-peace almost got me crying, and when he uses the same technique in the climax fight, that gave me goose-bumps. That was AWESOME!<br/><br/>DreamWorks has done a great job. Awesome graphics, action sequences, characterization, good humor, but not so awesome plot. Plot is not bad but small, which makes you feel the movie is short. It has lot of fights alright, which are mostly amusing so the movie never gets boring. But one of the weak points of the movie, I felt, are some of the dialogs of Po (Jack Black), which sounded half-baked to me, and could have been a lot more refined and funnier than they actually were. They probably were way too slapstick for my liking. But funny nevertheless. And forget not the voices of Shen (Gary Oldman) and Tigress (Angelina Jolie) in this movie. Fantastic!<br/><br/>All in all, it's an almost AWESOME movie which had the potential to be utterly AWESOME."

","Jack Black is at his best when embodying an unlikely kung fu fighting Panda named Po. With more action and even better visuals than the original, Kung Fu Panda 2 is successful at being a memorable and entertaining sequel. Behind the scenes, Direcor Jennifer Yuh creates the visuals of the film by pairing unique 2D story telling animation with traditional contemporary 3D distinguishing between various elements of the film's story. The story builds off of the first film very well continuing the growth of Po as the Dragon Warrior. Questions not explored in the original are delved into uncovering where Po came from. Because lets face it Mr. Ping (James Hong, ""Mulan"") isn't exactly a panda and is only Po's adopted father. Even so, Mr. Ping acts as a very good loving father and is aided by Po's newfound glory with the growth of his noodle shop's popularity. Po does not see his adopted father as much because of Po's new responsibilities and search for his real parents. A new power crazy antagonist by the name of Lord Shen (Gary Oldman, ""The Dark Knight"") joins the series threatening the extinction of kung fu forever with the creation of a new weapon. With the help of the furious five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie, ""The Tourist""), Monkey (Jackie Chan, ""The Karate Kid""), Mantis (Seth Rogen, ""Paul""), Viper (Lucy Liu, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1), and Crane (David Cross, ""Megamind""), Po must save kung fu and China. But where would these six be without Dustin Hoffman reprising his role as the wise Master Shifu providing Po with a new challenge to find and master inner peace.<br/><br/>The film is all about the visual choices of 2D and 3D animation contrasting flashbacks from Po's present creating colorful, visually pleasant film. This is necessary when showcasing the significant increase in action over the original film. This is rightfully so because this is a film about animals showing off their kung fu fighting skills creating an action movie for kids. Also, the voice actors in this franchise could not have been chosen better. Jack Black is in his element masked by a big cuddly panda backed by the writers holding back the urge to overuse the famous phrase ""Skadoosh"" skillfully waiting for the most epic moment in the film.<br/><br/>A weak story comes with sequel territory; therefore, it almost goes without saying that ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" has its plot flaws. However, this does not hurt the film as much as it holds the film back from being great. Instead it has to settle for a good solid predictable flick. In the end the story is not the selling point of the movie and acts as a setup for the third installment of the series leaving the audience with an open ending.<br/><br/>Entertaining blockbuster animation at its best placing Jack Black back into his comfort zone as a voice actor within a spectacle of action and color. Perfect timing with the completion of the ""Toy Story"" franchise leaving room for ""Kung Fu Panda"" to grow into something great."

","And so the battle between Pixar and Dreamworks rages on. Dreamworks have been somewhat in the shadow of it's rival in the recent years, only managing average output such as Shark Tale, Over The Hedge and Madagascar, while Pixar have been formidable with the likes of The Incredibles, the Toy Story trilogy, and WALL-E, all of which could easily be called masterpieces. But Dreamworks had something up it's own sleeve back in 2008 with the extremely funny and enjoyable Kung Fu Panda, which was a huge success for the studio. And three years on, the more-than-welcome sequel arrives, and it's really rather good.<br/><br/>After establishing himself as the Dragon Warrior in the first film, Po (Jack Black) heads the Furious Five, consisting of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). All is well, as the powerful group easily dispose of any potential threat to the realm, under the watchful eye of Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Po is seeking out answers to his birth, when he realises that his father Mr. Ping (James Hong) couldn't possibly be his biological parent, what with being a goose and all. But there is a new threat in town, and he is in the form of peacock Shen (Gary Oldman), who is stealing all the scrap metal he can to aid his new powerful weapon, which could see the end of Po and kung-fu.<br/><br/>The thing that appealed most about the first film was it's genuine affection for kung-fu and China. It used Chinese-style animation in one sequence, and some traditional drawing in the end credits. Plus the action scenes were better than the majority of real-life action films, combining thrilling action with slapstick comedy to good effect. Here, they've changed into second gear, and the action is twice as ambitious, and twice as impressive. The epic climax sees many kung-fu warriors, including our heroes battle Shen's army, and I've not been as excited while watching an action scene since the hotel corridor scene in Inception. And in showing Po's childhood, they've created another beautifully drawn sequence that uses China's traditional paintings as its influence.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the sequel is not a mere re-tread of the original. The fat jokes are kept to a minimum, the scope is expanded, and they've developed Po's story in revealing his childhood. One of the main things that concerned me was that it may miss Ian McShane, who for me stole the first film as the menacing Tai Lung. But in Gary Oldman, they've created a different sort of villain. Just as menacing as Tai Lung, he is not half the warrior, but he possesses something that Po and the Furious Five may be helpless against - a big gun.<br/><br/>Not quite as good as the original - it lacks the freshness and under- uses Dustin Hoffman's kung-fu master - but a more than worthy follow-up. It even manages to make Jack Black likable, who after years of playing the same character in s**t films (not including The School of Rock), wears me down. And the sheer number of talented actors that have been brought in (apart from the already mentioned, there's also Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dennis Haysbert, Danny McBride and Michelle Yeoh) shows that the film is puffing it's chest out at Pixar. I'll be looking forward to the inevitable third instalment, and hoping it can carry on impressing.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Po (Jack Black) returns in another kung fu animation adventure which sees our ever hungry panda face up to a new and devastating threat in the form of angry albino peacock (Gary Oldman) Lord Shen. Having been cast out by his parents years before for his atrocities, Shen has been biding his time returning with a new technology that threatens to enable him to conquer China.<br/><br/>Po is joined once again with the Furious Five as well as a few new characters to try and save not only the local people but also the very fabric of kung fu and all that it stands for. Aside all of this, we also learn about the childhood of Po and how he came to be at the doorstep of Mr. Ping (James Hong) and his noodle restaurant. This film definitely takes on a darker feel when compared to the first and will surely give the younger kids in the audience something to keep them awake at night. It also has more packed into its story with extra depth and variety than the first did not necessarily have ie. lineage and upbringing and the effect that has on us as adults.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic and despite not hitting the heights of a Pixar movie is up there with some of the best that I have seen to date. My favourite scenes are the fighting scenes in particular one where they are assaulting Shen's stronghold. The combination of action with the impressive visuals drags you right into the fight alongside the characters.<br/><br/>Po can get a bit annoying/repetitive at some points as the Jack Black from within is released and a torrent of 'awesome' and similar such catchphrases are rattled off one after the other but this did seem to be toned down slightly from his usual self so I began to think of Po as Po rather than Black in a panda costume.<br/><br/>I think this is a case of the sequel running the original very close and I would be hard pushed to say which one I preferred. Whereas the first was original and purely a kids flick this builds strongly on the first opening it to a wider audience with more of a slapstick feel to it which has me just siding with this one as the better of the two. Why don't you make up your own minds as it's definitely worth a watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

","Kung Fu Panda - 2 is definitely a worthy sequel... worth a watch(maybe more), worth the money, worth the expectation. It never falls into any of the commonly know pitfalls of sequels. Quite refreshing a story... wonderful performances... nice animation... good action sequences... most importantly, punchlines are not wasted.<br/><br/>The story in a nut shell: Po is back with his kung-fu legion and is busy fighting and protecting his village. Eventually, it falls upon him to protect kung fu from a deadly foe, a peacock who promises to end kung fu with the help of a deadly machine while fighting with haunting memories and devastating revelations.<br/><br/>The story line is a bit predictable. Prophecies, fragmented flash-backs and avenging the death of murdered parents are a bit old-school now (Some may want to scream ""Harry Potter"")! However, the screenplay ensures that you do not get bored with the predictability. The comedy of errors keep flowing in at a steady pace. Timing is the keyword here. Both in terms of the script and acting. Special effects is good. It's just about appropriate, with a nice little 3D touch. However, I felt a slight bit of refrain in the weightiness of the visual graphics.... a very masterful touch that stops you from getting overwhelmed by the CGI and lets you concentrate on the story instead. What truly overwhelms you are the performances of the actors. The impossible physics of the action sequences never bothers you, just like it was in the first installment. <br/><br/>Jack Black is awesome. Yes you may die due to overexposure to awesomeness. Everybody else is excellent. Not a single character goes wasted. All points considered... it's a nice entertainer, not deep, but rib-tickling, energizing flick that brings out the inner child in you. Well done Jennifer Yuh Nelson."

","I could not enjoy this movie at all. In the first movie, every next scene came with its own surprise, fun and adventure. But in this sequel, many a times things did not make any sense. On one hand, Panda defeats the enemies with his super kung fu and on other hand, he cannot give a single punch to the tigress. I think it was a failed attempt to make Panda funny, which ended up making him look rather stupid.<br/><br/>I went to the movie with great excitement.

","I thought it was OK, but no more than that. The writing wasn't very much inspired. There were no amazing jokes, no good story twists and no exciting action sequences. The plot (Poh embarks on a mission to both discover who are his real parents and defeat the inventor of gunpowder, which would make Kung Fu obsolete) unfolded exactly as we expected, but it unpredictably felt very slow at traits. The characters, although funny, are flat in a way that Pixar characters never are. Tigress is perhaps the most disappointing with some 10 lines in total (With so little, she is not even a supporting character: just a dramatic trick for making the story advance.) Poh's traditional laziness seems a bit of an old joke here. The visuals are however beautiful, and the idea of showing Poh's faded memories in 2D is quite cool."

","While I didn't enjoy this movie as much as the first its still a good movie (especially as far as sequels are concerned). <br/><br/>The animation, like the first, is great eye-candy making it a joy to watch while the general plot, villain, and personal back story's are all well done. <br/><br/>Po's history is tied in well to the main plot and leads to some nice moments between Po and his noodle dad. Even one of the Furious Five shows some emotional vulnerability (setting up for the third movie of a planned six so I read). So this movie, like the first, delivers on the personal/emotional side pretty nicely.<br/><br/>As for the main villain this go-round (an albino peacock), while less physically imposing than his predecessor (Tai Lung), he uses his wits to present a unique set of challenges to our heroes which leads to another one of the franchises unorthodox final battle sequences which I enjoy. Some might be disappointed, but I found him to be very majestic and formidable in his own way so I thought he was a nice choice.<br/><br/>My only pet peeve is in the humor department as for me it lacked a feel of spontaneity and flow. Rarely did it catch me off guard like the first movie did so no LOL moments. Instead it was often predictable, over-the-top, out of place, or just flat out not funny. Sure there were some scenes like Po on the roof giving his speech (minus his bad overacting after the hat toss) etc that brought back memories of the first, but quite a few others had Po behaving so childishly or trying too hard to be funny that I began to find his antics a little annoying. Running around ""yeah lets go woo yeah!"" got old quick for me and a lot of his one liners felt like that person who you meet who isn't funny at all but for a need of attention continually tries to be anyways. Even one of the Furious Five looked tired of it as there is a scene where Po is talking about his two-step plan and Tigress has to reply with an agitated ""Po!"" as if to say ""okay we get it, but its not funny...knock it off already!"" I felt your pain Tigress.<br/><br/>Still an overall enjoyable movie. No reason to not watch it unless you absolutely hated the first."

","If i had the option of writing a one word review for kung fu panda-2, i would leave it at that - incredible! Kung Fu Panda-2 is spectacular, excellent, awesome and better than the first one. Better in animation, better in action, better in effects (i watched it in 3-d by the way), better in the story and so so much better in humor. My god, this movies's humor had me in fits.<br/><br/>Po, you are the god of kung fu. In some ways Po reminds you of Jackie Chan's style of fighting; there's action and there's humor at the same time. This movie also has a lot of new characters. What a creative imagination of bringing a peacock as the deadly villain - shen. and of course Po's pals, the tigress and mantis, are awesome as well. <br/><br/>Watch The return of awesomeness. Watch Po save the world from the end of kung fu!!"

","ohhh what a pleasure! :)) yes, it was twice the awesomeness!! GO to this movie... it worths every single cent...<br/><br/>Honestly, I went to this movie with high expectations since the first one was my most favorite animation movie ever especially with the characters... since 3 years my mind was hungered for Kung Fu Panda 2 and IT MET and EXCEEDED my expectations...<br/><br/>Only few points I noticed: - the soundtrack of the first one was not here which I expected as well - wisdoms of Oogway was missing, since he is already dead, it is not easy to fill his character place... which is proofed... (during Po's flashbacks there was not Oogway was will a bit disappointed me... which I see as future of Kungu Fu Panda...) - the fight scene between Po and Tigress was completely unnecessary.. - Po was a bit too much loosing his coolness... there was no full script you can call him as cool, most of time he had to done something really funny (for instance when he first catches fireball, his hand burns, but he brought fun to this moment (unucessarily), by placing his hand inside his mouth... some people loved it I believe but for me there are some moments you can be NOT funny at least)...<br/><br/>sorry for bad English! :)"
"gregeichelberger","6","2","5","31 May 2011"," Finally, a worthy sequel
","A day after viewing the debacle that was ""The Hangover, Part II,"" I was able to see an example of how a sequel should really be made. Now, I know enough not to compare live action films to animated ones, but the fact remains that movie fell flat while ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" was a surprisingly pleasant experience.<br/><br/>Following its 2008 predecessor, which became one of the year's sleeper hits, this version keeps the same vocal talent in tact and even adds Gary Oldman (""JFK,"" ""Dark Knight"") as the voice of a violent, despotic peacock (yep, that's right).<br/><br/>Leading the cast is the irrepressible Jack Black as Po, the moronic, clumsy, gluttonous panda bear who overcomes all to become the animal kingdom's most unlikely kung fu master. Also joining in on the fun is the Furious Five, Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Seth Rogen (Mantis), David Cross (Crane), Jackie Chan (Monkey) and Lucy Liu (Viper), as well as Dustin Hoffman (as the spiritual leader, the Yoda-like Shifu).<br/><br/>This group of martial arts junior justice league all-stars is called together again after part one to save the entire country of Cathay (China for the uninitiated) against Lord Shen (Oldman), who leads a vicious pack of wolves and has invented artillery.<br/><br/>Plus, Shen is guilty of a horrible act of genocide, turning this into ""Kung Fu Panda"" meets ""The Lord of War"" meets ""The 10 Commandments."" We also learn a bit about Po's origins, while there are some genuinely touching and funny moments with Po's adopted father, Mr. Ping the noodle-cooking goose (James Wong).<br/><br/>The conflict begins when Shen and his minions crank up the war machine, building cannons and ships to take over a country that is still apparently peaceful and bucolic. Only the Furious Five can stop this evil plan, but the odds are stacked against them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Shifu attempts to teach Po the meaning of inner peace with a classic scene in which Hoffman intones, ""When you became a Dragon Master, it was the worst day of my life. No, I mean it was the absolute worst day."" Black's mournful, ""Okay, I get it,"" is the perfect retort.<br/><br/>Putting aside some major disbelief of a peacock ruling over wolves (whom in ""real"" life would have just eaten the bird and got it over with), as well as the chemistry between Po and his super hero friends being almost non-existent, I still have to give a big thumbs up to this effort.<br/><br/>The children will no doubt love the colorful animals - especially the cuddly panda sequences, while the adults will relish the many one-liners, many coming from the Po-Mr. Ping relationship.<br/><br/>My mistrust of sequels was only exacerbated with the release of the second ""Hangover;"" thank goodness my faith was - somewhat - restored just one day later."
"Kiszczak","9","2","5","28 May 2011"," Great action for kids and adults
","The first Kung Fu panda movie was great for kids and even adults with lots of comedy. This one was even better with comedy and even more kung fu action the whole way through.From the trailer of this movie, I didn't think it was going to be that great, but it didn't dissappoint. It had a great story that was easy to understand and a little darker than the first. It was action the whole way through.<br/><br/>For those of you who didn't like the first movie, maybe you will want to check this one out. It has all the comedy of the first and much more action than the first.If you enjoyed the first one, definitely try to see this on."
"blackmambamark","7","2","5","26 May 2011"," Not as great as the first, but still fun never the less
","I have never really liked anything Dreamworks animation had to offer. Call me crazy, but I'm not the biggest fan of Shrek or Ice Age. That is until i saw 'Kung Fu Panda'. Something that was worthy enough to challenge the ranks of PIXAR. I can only expect more great things to come from this series.<br/><br/>What made the first film work was a combination of things. Obviously there's the depth, humor, and amazing character development. But what really sold it for me was the progression. The progression of the main character 'Po', and him discovering that everything can be special. It was a beautiful thing to watch unfold on film, and it really tapped the nerve of Chinese philosophy. My main problem with this film was how it didn't follow the same progression. Sure it had those deep rooted elements. But i felt like it was lacking just a little more heart.<br/><br/>Now i'm not saying that this movie was bad at all. I did enjoy it. But i've already seen what these writers and actors can do with a subject like this. So needless to say, it wasn't as epic as the first.<br/><br/>However, the movie is worth the watch. If you do get the chance, see it in 3D, because this is certainly worth the couple extra bucks. But aside from the visuals, the characters are all still fun, the action sequences are fun, and there are some portions of the story that will damn near break your heart.<br/><br/>Bottom Line....the storyline still does have that deep Chinese element to it, which i really love. But it's not as eye widening as the first. I still had a good time, and the ending did kind of leave me excited. If you loved the first one like i did, i think you'll have a great time watching this one. But in my opinion, the first was way better."
"oshram-3","3","2","6","2 January 2012"," Sadly no better than the first one
","See, when you start to get older, you forget some things, like sometimes what you thought of a movie. Not a major crime, but it can lead to little mistakes, like renting this film. For some reason (Angelina Jolie's voice acting? Encroaching senility?) I recalled, incorrectly, liking the first KFP. I got my hands on this, queued it up, and then read my review of the first one (maybe I should have performed those tasks in a different order). When I recalled how kind of flat I thought the first one was, I thought, well, maybe this one will be better.<br/><br/>It's not. It's not a terrible film, but it's flat and lazy like the first one. Here big fat Po (Jack Black, the titular panda), now a member of the legendary Dragon Warriors, has two dilemmas; he and the other Dragons must take back a remote city from the new bad guy, a crane (really? a zillion animals in Chinese folklore and the bad guy is a bird?) and also has to find out his true heritage, as it's really blanking obvious his father cannot biologically be a duck. The two plots progress slowly, and of course are tied together, and naturally we have to stop every dozen minutes or so to let the cartoon characters duke it out.<br/><br/>The design work is fine, and executed very sharply – it's a pretty pseudo-Chinese pastoral world, and we have the requisite gorgeous scenery paired with the evil, red-lit infernal machine factory of the crane (in a plot that felt wholly stolen from Detective Dee). KFP character design tends more toward the cartoony – and for some reason flashbacks are done in traditional animation, to help separate them from the CGI stuff – and that doesn't change here (I liked the addition of the rhino, even though he does nothing but stand around). <br/><br/>The problem here is, once again, a lazy script full of fat/eating jokes and some uninspired voice work. How is it that Jolie could make a fish seem sexy in Shark Tale, and yet fails to do anything but a straight reading with the most eroticized of animals, a big cat? Maybe that's direction, but it seems like she's sort of phoning it in, as does everyone, excepting of course James Hong, who once again is amusing as Po's duck daddy.<br/><br/>I'm sure the kids enjoyed this film (it did depressingly well at the box office), but unlike, say, Despicable Me or almost any of the Pixar films, there is nothing here for anyone over the age of ten. I tend to prefer family films that work on at least two levels, so the poor parents aren't bored stiff for eighty-five minutes, but the only other consideration other than cranking out a requisite sequel for this film seems to be to sell more action figures. Much like the first one, you could give this uninspired flick a pass and not miss much. My only subtextual giggle was seeing all the flashbacks with the panda village, which reminded me of the next expansion for Warcraft. But I doubt many of you would make that connection."
"princebansal1982","2","2","6","6 June 2011"," As Good as the Previous One, And with good 3D
","My expectations were a little low for this film. Mostly because sequels are seldom able to capture the magic created by the original work. But Kung Fu Panda 2 was able to recreate the same magic again. I think the 3 year gap also helped.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 retains the same sense of humor and appears really fresh. Po shows some vulnerabilities and has to go through an emotional journey, albeit a short one. More stress is on humor here than anything else, just like in the previous installment.<br/><br/>There are some animation sequences which are pictured in past which were really fantastic and quite a nice change from the usual style of the movie. The 3D is really good unlike some other recent movies. There are enough good 3D scenes here to make it worthwhile to wear the clunky glasses."

"Leasebergfladstad","6","1","2","30 December 2018"," I'm the only one or few who like better Kung Fu Panda 1 & 3!?
","The third movie Kung Fu Panda 3 reminded more and especially relived memories and feelings for the first movie Kung Fu Panda and the villain Kai at least looks more scary as a bull and was against pandas as Shen too.<br/><br/>The reasons why I dislike Kung Fu Panda 2:
1. I especially didn't like there was too serious and dark theme at the same time for lighthearted, funny, non-serious and innocent characters as Po who are just especially one of my most favorite characters.<br/><br/>2. There are more plot holes.<br/><br/>3. It's focusing more on the Furious Five.<br/><br/>4. The villain Shen is a killer rabbit villain who looks less scary as a peafowl, even though he was just responsible for Po being separated from his family and killing his mother, but Po let go of it a little too easily and was happy even before he knew it and/or after since he had no experience of it.<br/><br/>The plot holes:
1. It seems first Shen wanted to weaponized fireworks because he was power hungry to conquer China as he was a evil psychopath, his parents was worried about him because of his evil nature and tried to kill all pandas too make sure the prophecy about a warrior of black and white as pandas would stop him to conquer China wouldn't come true, but other source says Shen wanted weaponized fireworks to impress his parents and business of Gongmen City at first. How can Shen become power hungry to conquer China because he wanted to weaponized fireworks or his parents exiled him who had nothing to do with China, kill all pandas if Shen didn't want to conquer China at first and believe his parents would be proud of him for killing all pandas and conquer China when they weren't even evil too and even let his cannon crush him if he want to conquer China anyway? Shen would at least get his will to conquer over a kingdom since he was at least a prince who are the only heir after his parents to conquer over their own kingdom, usually royalties who have and are jealous of their older siblings who are the next to rule over their kingdoms and advisers who dislike their job or never get any praise and honor, become power hungry and will only conquer over their own kingdom instead of entire country or the world that have nothing to with them. How could Shen believe his parent would be proud of him to weaponized firework and conquer China if his parent weren't evil too? Would Shen want to take revenge on his parents? It were his parents who banished Shen because he want to conquer China and massacred pandas, but why did Shen still want to seek revenge when his parents was nevertheless died before his return?<br/><br/>2. Why did Shen want to make an end of kung fu? Even Shen was a kung fu master too, kung fu had nothing to do with his backstory, his main goal was to conquer China and kung fu could be useful to conquer China. Shen created a cannon that would put an end of kung fu, but it's not only kung fu it should make an end of if there are anything else are as powerful or more powerful than kung fu, as chi.<br/><br/>3. The kung fu masters seems more weaker. How could the kung fu masters believe even only one cannon could put an end of kung fu and conquer China and didn't even knew first that Shen at least had more than one cannon and could create multiple cannons quickly that they should rather stop him from doing instead and how could even Po believe a cannon figurine was Shen's actual cannon when and didn't even laugh just because of it was too small too put an end of kung fu and conquer China? Aren't kung fu masters smarter, too quick and has high strength to hit the cannons and wasn't there other more kung fu masters than just Po, Furious Five, Shifu, Storming Ox and Croc who could also go to stop Shen if they needed more help? Cannon is too slow and heavy to swing fast enough and can only shoot on one place at once if there are more kung fu masters than cannons and are in different directions, even Tai Lung was shown to be cunning and swift enough to avoid firing weapons and was able to defeat the Anvil of Heaven, the Furious Five and Shifu on is own, Tigress hit the cannon down to the bottom floor of Tower of the Sacred Flame, Kai easily defeated many kung fu masters by taking their chi on his own and Thundering Rhino didn't even dodge the cannon's fire. Shen must at least have kung fu skills and learn his wolf and gorilla army kung fu to defeat kung fu masters, Kai and Taotie could make an end of kung fu, Kai easily defeat many kung fu masters by taking their chi on his own and once Taotie created a machine that easily defeat Po, Shifu and Furious Five (without Tigress). Why didn't Thundering Rhino try to dodge the cannon's fire and how could the other kung fu masters survive blow from the cannon when Thundering Rhino who easily dies of just a one blow by the cannon when he was bigger and stronger? Po survived probably because of his enormous body fat. Wasn't most important to stop Shen from conqured China than to stop him to put an end of kung fu?<br/><br/>4. Why is Thundering Rhino's physical appearance different than in Kung Fu Panda Holiday? Why is shown in the credits of Kung Fu Panda 2 Po made the the Furious Five action figures when he was a child if he was fan of kung fu since he was a teenager and the Furious Five were just formed then as revealed in Secrets of the Scroll?<br/><br/>5. Why is not even shown or mentioned that Shen began his plan years before or it was lesser than 30 years ago for the panda massacre and when he was exiled if it was 20 years ago as revealed in Kung Fu Panda 3?"

","""Your story may not have a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. It is the rest of your story, who you choose to be."" KFP2 is a combination of human spirituality and a brilliant touch of humor; which is very hard to come by. The story maybe not as original as the first movie but more enthusiastic and entertaining; and above all, the animation are flawless with lots of scintillating Kung Fu action. <br/><br/>Here I was watching Kung Fu Panda 2 for the Intermittently-forgotten-TH time at my 26th B'day, right there I got the mood to write something about it. Though I didn't write it instantly as I was through some critic that gave me an emoticon face like :@ as none of them were 100% satisfied with that particular movie. However that didn't lessen my interest instead makes me feel like ""step aside Sire's, I am in a mood."" For the recent 3D-ish spectators, I won't mind stating that I was not lucky enough to watch it on a giant IMAX 3D screen.<br/><br/>With an amazing voice crew (including Jack Black as the fluffy panda Po, Angelina Jolie playing the adverse Tigress, Dustin Hoffman as the one smart master Shifu, Gary Oldman this time as the evil Shen and chunky Jackie Chan as the best Monkey around) under the best visual team of DreamWorks studio, this film fires on nearly every cylinder. KFP2 is a visualization of complex hypothetical touch through a fun-flown story. Talking about the hypothetical-term here firstly comes to the mind; is a face of a goat 'The Soothsayer'. It was visible that the future teller Soothsayer enriched the humor revealing his clever appearance like telling lord Shen, ""If you continue on your current path...you will find yourself...at the bottom of the stairs."" or in another conversation like, ""Lord Shen: One panda lives. That does not make you right. The Soothsayer: You're right. Being right makes me right.""<br/><br/>Again simply remember master Shifus inner peace. The concept of Inner Peace was presumably created along with Kung Fu by Master Oogway centuries ago. Through meditation, the power of Inner Peace was shown when Oogway's senses were heightened immeasurably. When PO introduced to that spiritual inner peace concept by his master Shifu, what was his instant answer! ""PO: So that's it? I just need inner peace? My innards(Showing his bowl) are already super, super peaceful. So all I need to do is just get this thing going. Inner peace?"" Isn't that super humorous? Anything but the movie was never boring for a moment, because of the comic presence of that panda. Po was cool as usual with his awesomeness of the delivery of quotes like ""I'm not freaking out, I'm freaking in!"" Before Po sets out for Gongmen City with the Furious Five, Shifu's last words to him are, ""Anything is possible when you have Inner Peace.""<br/><br/>The fat fluffy panda touched my soul when after much pain and suffering through the encounters with Lord Shen and his own repressed memories, he finds his inner peace in the remains of the village where he was born. By coming to terms with his inner conflict, Po achieves Inner Peace, signified by Po performing his masters final teaching apparently comes in the form of catching a rain drop and redirecting it into the ground without breaking it (Which was an eye comforting visual masterpiece). <br/><br/>Most of the conversation between PO and the violent peacock Shen were amusing which makes it different from the first part of the sequel ""Po: Scars heal. <br/><br/>Lord Shen: No, they don't. Wounds heal.<br/><br/>Po: Oh, right. What do scars do? Fade?"" <br/><br/>In summary Kung Fu Panda 2 is vigorously fast developed story which includes life lessons and lots of Chinese cultural references with plenty of adorable vibrant animated characters. Before watching it I was confused when many renowned critics hailed KFP2 as a financial disappointment, despite earning more than $660 million worldwide. Yes, it underperformed in the US, grossing a lesser millions, but the film was hardly a mild disappointment. Usually I don't wait for a sequel, but after the film's awesomeness, I can't help but long for at least one more adventure with Po and the gang. <br/><br/>After watching some hundreds of IMDb top ranked movies I wrote my first ever review not for FORREST GUMP, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GODFATHER, THE LORD OF THE RINGS or THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, considering the ensuing realization of having an Animation-Geek in myself; even not for the WALLE, TOY STORY or HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. I choose Kung Fu Panda 2, which was released some three years back."
"karagoraymond","10","1","2","18 March 2015"," I always thought sequels are not better than the original. I guess I was wrong !
","Sequels never usually measure up to the standards of their predecessors. However, Kung Fu Panda 2 is an exception, not only is as good as the first film, it's even better. This is what I would call a perfect film, from the beginning to the end. A strong factor of the film is that they have continued the story instead of rehashing it. For example, Po is still likable but has developed in his Kung Fu, while the Five and Shifu have grown to respect and care about Po and not just making fun of him. There is an introduction of new likable characters such as the wise soothsayer or the humorous Master Croc(voiced by martial arts icon Jean Claude Van Damme). In the first film I felt the villain (Tai Lung) was cool but Garry Oldman's Lord Shen is quite the opposite. He has the right balance of malice and humor that in my opinion puts him on the same levels of animated villains such as Scar, Shere Khan or Gaston. The animation and action were both superb while Hans Zimmer and John Powell combined to make one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is not only an animated masterpiece but is also one of my favorite films of all time. <br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 has the right balance of humor, drama, action, suspense and warmth that make it what I consider to be a perfect film."

It is also needed to work out issues with his father Mr. Ping.<br/><br/>The Panda is as funny as ever. The whole gang is back. I love the adoption story with Mr. Ping. It's actually good emotional stuff. That part provides the heart. The action is better than ever. It's even exciting as well as exhilarating. That part provides the fun.

"HOTlavaB","10","1","2","12 March 2014"," I mean..... wow!
","If you saw my other review for Kung Fu Panda, you would know that not only was Kung Fu Panda a surprising film, it was an overall great film for all ages. I still love the original KFP. So much so that I was pumped for KFP2. Then the trailers came out and I was getting a bad feeling with them. The first teaser with the staring contest is great but the actual trailer rubbed me the wrong way. I'm not entirely sure what it was, but I think the trailer made the movie seem way more focused on comedy than anything else. That would be a problem because KFP1 did a great job at being more than a comedy. Regardless, I want to see it anyway, and oh my god! This movie is not only as good as the first but its even better. Everything is stepped up to the next level. The story, the characters, & the villain are all stepped up from the first. The movie goes for 2 acts and its great, but at the end of the second act something happens, and the entire way I saw this series changed. The third act in this movie is something you have to see to be believed. If you don't know, this movie gets extremely emotional and legitimately sad to the point of tears for me. I know it sounds so strange that a movie about a kung Fu fighting panda made me cry. But that's the biggest strength to these movies. They are so much more than just that. I'm not the only one who cried either. The group I was in when I saw it were crying as well as most of the audience. They're are not very many sequels as good as Kung Fu Panda 2! If there is a gripe I would say it isn't as funny as the first. Considering the rest of the movie, that's an extremely small complaint. Its a film that moved me to tears and a film that may be the most surprisingly moving film I've ever seem. Again considering the movie is called Kung Fu Panda 2 staring jack black."
"gavin-lordofthefutur-776-426631","10","1","2","4 December 2013"," An epic & heartwarming sequel that is more superior than the original
","After being a fan of the first film, I went to see this in theaters with my brother back at 2011, hoping that it would not disappoint me. Turns out, during the summer of that year, it didn't disappoint me and has been one of my favorite movies that managed to be a lot more superior than the original.<br/><br/>Everything is great and it has the same things that made the first so compelling. The characters are as likable as ever. Po is still his hungry self, but he becomes more serious throughout the rest of the movie. While Mantis, Monkey, Crane, and Viper get little to no screen time, Tigress gets some character development in this movie and his interactions with Po is beyond terrific. Master Shifu, whose relationship with Po became the heart of the first film, is a bit underused, but it's great to see him in the film's climax (I'll get to that in a moment).<br/><br/>The new characters are great. Lord Shen may be a bit too similar to Tai Lung, but I think he's a cool villain and is easily one of the best. He kicks some butt with his cannons and his connection to Po and that he felt unloved by his parents explains the reason why he's been forcing his wolves to make them in the first place. His motives are great and Gary Oldman's creepy voice work explains; not to mention he has a great sense of humor. His henchman, the Wolf Boss, is great and his menacing appearance was so intense. Master Ox, Master Croc, and Master Rhino aren't given much to, but it's great to see them in action. The Soothsayer, the fortune telling goat, reminds me a lot of Rafiki from The Lion King, but the way she explains Lord Shen's reasons for murdering his panda family is good and while having a sense of humor, there's a creepy atmospheric feel about her.<br/><br/>The voice acting is great and it's awesome to Jack Black, Gary Oldman, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, and Seth Rogen return along with some new ones. The action is great and the script is smart and strong much like the original film. The dialog is also sharp and witty at the same time.<br/><br/>The animation is great. The character designs are as solid as ever with realistic emotions and the texture of their fur is fabulous. The visuals are the strongest point in the animation. The Jade Palace and the Valley of Peace is beautiful and so is Gongmen City and Lord Shen's palace.<br/><br/>The best part, however, would have to go to the story. It's as emotional as the first and while it has bits of elements from that film, it continues the story and adds Po's back-story, which made me felt sorry for him it would leave you teary-eyed. It has a nice moral about having the rest of your story and that life goes on forever.<br/><br/>Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a solid sequel with complex themes and a mature story line. With the anticipation for the third film coming in two more years, I will never stop watching this and the original film."

","The first Kung Fu Panda I would give an 8, it's pretty solid all the way around and the concept is a little new and fresh. This 2nd outing of the Kung Fu Panda doesn't have the new aspect to it, and the story is a little lacking, but for the most part, it's not too bad. <br/><br/>I like the zen like quality both Kung Fu Panda's bring to the table. The characters are likable and funny and I really give this movie it's 6 because of the theme it has, which is, 'You don't have to condemn yourself for eternity, your past is your past, what you do now is what define's you and makes you who you are.' <br/><br/>Both movies have a good feeling of hope and a Zen-Eckhart Tolle like atmosphere. Kung Fu Panda 2 is good for the kids and is a good lesson for the adults."

","If you liked Kung Fu Panda #1, you will love #2. With the exception of a little bit of a cryptic ending, the story is perfection. It's also the kind of movie that will make you want to run out and buy a blu-ray if you don't already own one. The detail in every scene is just mind-blowing. It's also my 4 yr old's favourite movie. He's watched it about 40 times. And no, it's no too scary for that age. Anyone who thinks otherwise, is probably a helicopter parent who bubble wraps their kids at night. Yes, there is fighting.. but hey, it's 'kung fu!' - I mean that in a fun way. It's 'good' vs 'bad' and there's no blood. I watched much scarier movies that Disney put out when I was a kid, and me and my whole generation grew up just fine. So get the family together and enjoy it, I guarantee you'll want to clap and cheer by the end!"

"Rectangular_businessman","9","1","2","27 December 2011"," An enjoyable sequel
","I liked a lot the first ""Kung Fu Panda"" film, but I wasn't sure about the idea of a sequel (Especially considering how disappointing ""Cars 2"" was.) Fortunately it ended being incredibly good and funny, just like the first film. I think that, in some aspects, it was even better than the first movie, having more character and plot development. Instead of focusing too much in the new characters (Which, in my opinion, was the worst mistake from ""Cars 2"", and it is a common flaw in many sequels) ""Kung Fu Panda"" keeps the story focused in the characters from the first film, developing their personalities (Being the only exception Master Shifu, that here has just a secondary role) Anyway, I enjoyed a lot ""King Fu Panda 2"": The animation was excellent, the comedy was pretty effective, and it also added more elements to the plot from original movie, making it even better. And it also some heart-warming moments that worked very well, being one of the most enjoyable movies for the whole family from this year. <br/><br/>I highly recommend it, and not only for the kids."
"hcsr1982","8","1","2","12 November 2011"," Fast paced, cute and thoughtful
","I did not expect much from this title other than a few laughs and maybe some cool stuff from master Shifu (much like the first one). As a sequel the risks were to the downside but this time it was the other way around. It is light, colorful, packed with pretty cool action scenes, and most importantly, it was engaging and touching. The search for the ""inner peace"" and for Po's family history at the same time worked very smoothly. As the story unfolds the concept of inner peace is developed and the ending is magnificent. Very touching for an adult. I can't imagine how special this is for a child (I believe they must get this easier than anyone else). I highly recommend this film for everyone but specially for those with children."
"he_who_leads","Null","1","2","6 August 2011"," The Year of the Peacock Begins Now!!!
","Po has settled into his role as the Dragon Warrior (although, lets face it - Tigress could destroy this guy in her sleep), and things are peaceful. Until a villainous peacock named Shen (Gary Oldman) pops up with a machine that can destroy kung-fu and plans to conquer all of China with it.<br/><br/>I loved the first film and this is a worthy sequel. It was always going to be hard (impossible?) to recapture the constant wonder of the first film, when we all had no idea how the hell tubby fanboy Po would ever defeat Tai Lung and fulfill his destiny. But kudos to the filmmakers for not restingon their laurels and coming up with a moving story, where Po has to confront buried childhood demons.<br/><br/>The good news is that the film is funny, entertaining, and moving. A scene or two really tug at the heartstrings. There are some cool new characters voiced impeccably by Gary Oldman, Michelle Yeoh and others. And the old favourites do well too. And, like the first, the film is respectful of Asian culture and martial arts.<br/><br/>The downsides are pretty minor. Shen's WMD (actually many of them) is a bit goofy, but provides a nice set piece at the end. The action scenes are more generic and don't match the first films ones (the bridge, the training, Tai Lung's great escape, Po vs Tai Lung). But overall fans of the original will be very satisfied with this. Bring on the third!!!"
"Meven_Stoffat","7","1","2","23 July 2011"," A sequel with real kick
","I guess I will have to make a confession that will get the Dreamworks crowd all worked up: while I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda, I'm not one of the many who hold it up on as high a pedestal as the superior Monsters Vs. Aliens or the movie that may be the epitome of all things cute, How to Train Your Dragon. So nail me to the cross if you want. I also have, in recent times, developed a distaste for sequels. This year we had Pixar's first terrible movie (Cars 2), the disastrously messy Pirates 4, and the carbon copy Hangover 2 (though Deathly Hallows Part 2 is my pick for top movie of 2011) <br/><br/>So while I, as I stated, enjoyed KFP1, I initially had low expectations for it's sequel in place. And with that in mind, I can say I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 2. Although it's not perfect, it managed to be very entertaining, and a worthy follow up. <br/><br/>The sequel takes place some time after the first movie. Po has continued training to be a true Kung Fu master, but there's one thing he hasn't yet truly mastered: inner peace. Of course, to a panda like Po, Kung Fu is all about kicking butt, but he soon learns that the only way to be a true Kung Fu master is to be at peace with himself. However, a new gang, sent in by a Peacock who seems a ghost of Po's past, has terrorized the village, sending Po and the gang on an adventure to stop him.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 works... for the most part. The good news is, it overall provides for an entertaining ride that the whole family can enjoy. The script is filled with tons of funny lines that are bound to have the kids repeating them for hours on end. As well as the voice cast is just as charming this time around; Jack Black still manages to charm as Po, Angelina Jolie still manages to put her street tough kick to good use. However, Gary Oldman, as usual, steals the show. He makes a great villain and it shows.<br/><br/>The animation also manages to dazzle. I can safely say that the animation quality has come a long way since Shrek. I didn't see this in 3D, but I guarantee I would have loved to. There are a lot of moments in the animation where I wanted to reach out and run my fingers through Po's fur, or move my hand along the cannon near the end, and had I seen this movie in 3D, I probably would have reached out and tried to feel them! It reminded me of when I saw Sanctum in 3D earlier this year, where I felt like I was actually underwater.<br/><br/>However there are a few flaws that prevent me from calling it a perfect film, let alone near perfect. For starters, it took me a while to be able to connect with the movie, as the pacing unfortunately is rushed to the point where it moves at a machine gun pace. Thepacing does slightly slow down in the middle but even then, the film still feels like the filmmakers were trying to cram too much in. Also, the story seemed convoluted. There was a story but it was rushed, to the point where I had myself questioning halfway through the film what the movie was about. <br/><br/>Overall, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very enjoyable film that is not without it's flaws. I would say go into it with an open mind, and don't expect Pixar level entertainment. Oh, and even if you don't go to movies for the actors, it's still worth seeing for Gary Oldman alone.<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10<br/><br/>Pros: The film provides good action, humour, laughs, alongside a stellar voice cast, a terrific Hans Zimmer score and beautiful animation that would convince even 3D sceptics to buy a ticket.<br/><br/>Cons: The film's pacing is rushed, to the near point of being disorienting, as well as the story could have been more fleshed out as well as the villain."
"mcgriff1290","Null","1","2","11 July 2011"," Doesn't have as much punch as the first, but still good
","This movie seems to fall short of the previous film like most DreamWorks sequels do. The studio seems to make entertaining original flicks, but they try to cash in on the fame of the first movies and overstuff the audience with weak follow ups. When it was announced that they were making a sequel to the first Kung Fu Panda it caught a lot of people of guard because the first movie ended well enough that it shouldn't have been a follow up. This movie tumbles short of creativity and freshness that the first movie had, but improves the action and exploring the world of Kung Fu Panda. The action in this film is top notch and very dazzling at times. It has more fight sequences that I would not expect in an animation film, but works quite well. It brings the movie full speed when flat moments arise. The plot of the movie is not as fresh as the first and seems to drag at times, but that's when the other elements start to come alive. The additional component that works well in this movie is the CGI. Its so well done and life like that you are pull visually to a new level. There are certain scenes that just had me stunned at how breath taking it looks. In addition to that, the 3D works well with the film and I believe DreamWorks studio does a great job of adding that portion into their animation films. Other than those various things, this movie has nothing else to offer. This movie in a way feels lazy at times as if the screen writers just start to throw things in the film to propel dull moments. The past animation characters and new ones they bring to the film do nothing to make their present worthwhile. They are mainly placed in the film to carry the story along for us to learn more about Po back story. The movie also tries to hit on an emotional level just as the previous film did, but seems to try too hard and fails at its task. Adding this extra feature is an attempt to connect with the older audience, but doesn't get plugged in all the way. This movie has enough distractions that keeps the flow of the film moving quite nicely for kids to enjoy, but older spectators will not be easily swayed like the first Panda movie seem to accomplish."

","Its always a happy and very rare day when you go to the cinema to watch a sequel and come home believing it to be better than the original. Today was one of those rare days for me.<br/><br/>For starters the movie has the return of all your usual characters. The movie has the same old light hearted humour in it and possibly even funnier than the previous one and don't worry just because Po is now considered good at Kung Fu it still doesn't mean he gets much right as you will see in the film.<br/><br/>The only slight disappointment to this movie is the fact that the plot is quite similar to the original. I wont give too much away but the plot is strong yet similar to the original.<br/><br/>Due to the disappointment of Cars 2 this year I definitely believe this is the film to watch this summer especially if you have kids.

","I took my grandson to see kung fu panda because I really enjoyed the first one. This one unfortunately is not as fun as that one but it passes. The animation again is stellar and Jack Black again does a good job as Po. I am going to disagree with the critics the story is coherent and both stories (Po's search and the peacock's) do work if you are intelligent enough to see it. What I found irritating though is that it seemed to go on longer than the 90 minutes. I think it was because on like the first one it took too long for the Po to get it. Also the fight scenes were way too long and draw out for me. Yes the kung fu was good but it seemed to go on forever. The movie did redeem itself in the end and that's why I gave it 7/10."
"Reel_starz","7","1","2","13 June 2011"," Kung Fu Panda 2: Sequel packs less punch than original
","When the first Kung Fu Panda movie came out in May 2008, no one expected much. All anyone really knew was that the plot centered around a fat, martial-arts-oriented panda voiced by Jack Black, a pitch that doesn't quite scream gold of either the box-office or awards kind, and the trailer wasn't exactly the most innovative thing out there. Besides, this was Dreamworks, the studio whose trademark in films is a heavy reliance on pop culture references and broad satire to the point of overkill and whose greatest hit, arguably still the first Shrek at that point, had been diluted by a series of mediocre, unstoppable sequels; they weren't Pixar, after all. But then, something surprising happened: it premiered at Cannes to shockingly positive reviews, and when the audience also responded with fervor, gone were the Pixar comparisons. Instead, people began to buzz about the rich, colorful animation, Black's pitch-perfect voice casting as Po, the way it managed to be light and fun (not to mention funny) while still having a sweet, heartfelt message without the *wink wink* pretensions of films like Ice Age or Shark Tale, which always seemed to be trying too hard – and failing – to engage adults as well as younger folks. Kung Fu Panda wasn't just ""good for Dreamworks""; it was genuinely great.<br/><br/>Given its status as a clear financial success, a sequel was probably inevitable. Though the surprise factor that helped the original stand out was now gone, it seemed to be a more promising venture than most. The main vocal talents were all returning, for one, and with box-office and critical hits like How to Train Your Dragon and Megamind under their belts, the guys at Dreamworks were steadily moving out of the shadow of their rival in the animation business.<br/><br/>For the most part, Kung Fu Panda 2 is not a major disappointment. The plot is weightier with a villain who not only aims to bring all of China to its knees but also played a dark role in our hero's past, though the earnest intensity saps the movie of some of the optimistic energy that characterized the first one. Newcomer Gary Oldman makes for a lively and delightfully hateful, if fairly obvious, choice as the voice behind the evil peacock Lord Shen. However, the real strength of this movie lies in its visuals. Vivid colors and sweeping shots through mist-shrouded landscapes and old-fashioned villages make good use of 3-D, and the creatures that populate this world are expressive and detailed. The decision to render the dream and flashback sequences in a more traditional, hand-drawn style of animation proves effective and, at times, even poignant.<br/><br/>If only this same joy and creativity could've gone beyond the aesthetics! Though, as previously stated, the plot is indeed more serious than the simple ""finding his destiny and overcoming expectations"" setup of the first movie, it feels oddly stretched, particularly in the half-hour or so around the climax, which mostly consists of Shen trying over and over again to eliminate Po and Po miraculously escaping each time. What's more, a lot of the time seems to be spent on action sequences, which are mostly staged in too much of a swift blur to be truly impressive, and aside from a touching subplot about Po and his goose ""dad"", character development is minimal; a greater focus on the interactions between Po and the individuals that make up the Furious Five would have been welcome. Despite their recognizable names, many of the voice actors are either indistinctive or underused, with the notable exceptions of Oldman, Black and Dustin Hoffman, though the last was MIA for the majority of the film's running time. In particular, Angelina Jolie should be tough and icily demanding as Tigress, but instead, comes off as merely bland. Though she was passable in the original, an expanded screen time provides too much exposure to the lack of personality in her voice.<br/><br/>Still, discounting a plot that becomes fairly repetitive and casting complaints, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a more effective sequel than most. Those looking for some good family-friendly entertainment will no doubt be satisfied, and the spectacular visuals are a reward all on their own. Just don't bring your kid if he can't stay still throughout the whole movie. I got a couple of criers, in addition to a few that ran through the aisles during the last twenty minutes, and trust me, it's not fun for anyone involved."

","Sequels are almost never better then its originals. The Bourne Ultimatum and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 might prove me wrong, but those are more like final parts of a three- or two-part story, so it is true anyway: sequels rarely beat originals. And so it is in Kung Fu Panda 2 as well.<br/><br/>The animation is breathtaking, the humor very fun, the kung-fu action extremely stylized, the story fine and morally educating to children as the original Kung Fu Panda, but it is still a tiny bit worse. But it is nothing wrong with that. As i have learned from watching many sequels, i expected it to be worse and Kung Fu Panda 2 is still a very fun, spectacular movie for children and adults of all ages."

Most of the jibber jabber can be just thrown out of the window since most ""FAILED SEQUELS"" are at present bringing in the big bucks at the box office. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is an original. Entirely different plot goes a wee bit sinister I would say. The mild violence works. I recall just being 12 and watching ""The Lion King"" and I loved it when the hyenas were torn to shreds by Simba. Well that was on good old VHS and this time it's in 3D. Po and his friends are entrusted on a task to save Kung Fu from being wiped off the face of the earth by the Evil Peacock Shen. Shen who has daddy issues has built a new weapon, which is no match for Kung Fu, or so he thinks until our famous panda warrior goes soul searching for inner peace. <br/><br/>Heartwarming it was not, as it were in 2008. It was more on the sides of slick action and an immense amount of war. This took the movie to an all new level and it took the movie away from temple and noodle shop. This works at times. But I believe the winner and the bestselling angle for this is definitely the well-crafted fight sequences. I watched it in 3D and it was off the hook. It's the exact kind of thing that would wow a young kid, or even at times adults like us. The way they introduce Shen as the evil Peacock and the way Shen fights, the moves and his amazing feathers just nailed it! A lot of thought seems to have gone into the animals they bring into life in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". Hats off for all the creativity.<br/><br/>Jack Black & Dustin Hoffmann so far are my favorites. They are sharp and always on the lines so hard that it's impossible not to laugh. By no means does this imply that Jolie, Chan, Rogen, Crane, Liu were over shadowed. I just felt that some of the best lines just happened to have just gone by their way.<br/><br/>Although it has PG rating just like before, this is a wonderful movie for kids and adults alike.

Other than that as a sequel and as a film, Kung Fu Panda 2 is an excellent film and ideal for the entire family.<br/><br/>The animation is absolutely stupendous.

Not just in the likable characters(every single one of them has a personality and are delightful to watch) and crisp pacing, but also in the sharp and hilarious writing and fun and heart warming story.<br/><br/>The voice work is superb across the board. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffmann stand out among those who return, and I liked how Po and Tigress'(nice voice work from Angelina Jolie) relationship is further explored here, but overall the standout was Gary Oldman who is absolutely brilliant as the villain Shen the Peacock, who happens to be of now my personal favourite Dreamworks villain because he is actually given layers in alternative to being the standard villain you love to hate.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film and better than the (entertaining) original film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Sage-c4","Null","1","3","23 December 2012"," My old enemy - stairs
","This film jettisons the essential tone and message of the original, while retaining the superficial elements of the characters and setting.<br/><br/>Having successfully manipulated the clichés of the mono-myth and countless references to action films into an original, funny and heart-warming masterpiece, the franchise loses its way with this dud. Here the writers become the tools of the story-we-all-know, every step predictable. Gary Oldman plays (as usual) the villain with a thousand faces, flawlessly, yes, but that's the problem. There's no humanity in the peacock to make it interesting. Only Dennis Hopper can project a villain less sympathetically. James Woods or Jeremy Irons? You know the type.<br/><br/>Where is the REAL Jack Black? David Spade, Jay Baruchel, or Norm Macdonald might as well have voiced this cartoon panda with as vivaciously. The rest of the cast follow suit. Gone is any sense of play. The characters just plod along in the ruts left by countless re-tellings. <br/><br/>The one good line in the film indicates what's wrong - up and down the stairs every hero story follows - one step at a time, skipping few (there's no panda princess locked in the tower). It's just boring!<br/><br/>And then the ominous threat of another cliché-driven sequel tagged onto the end.

The master turtle and Shi-Fu really made the whole movie shine and the good and sad moments were truly remarkable, that movie was a dead serious hit for me, it surely wasn't done just for kids, so I was so eager to see this one.<br/><br/>Sadly, Kung-Fu panda 2 returns to the formulaic premise of Hollywood these days, our hero doesn't need more training so the lessons are replace with a very bad villain who doesn't know how to fight and then recurs to weapons (not my kind of villain). <br/><br/>The tone of the movie is darker than the original, sadly, the mood, the way the movie is made and the way characters develop is it not. It's like they tried so hard to made it more serious than the first one, but the excessive action and special effects really contrived the movie to a merely two or three scenes of peaceful nature. There are so few quiet moments that it really feels like ""producers and execs"" told the writers, "" more fun, more action, more dark"" and this is what we got.<br/><br/>I really don't know why people loved it, I hated it, not because it's a bad movie, because the first one was so deep, and this one so dull. Comparing this one to the first one is like comparing star wars episode 5 with episode 1, one is deep, the other is dull.<br/><br/>My kids liked it, the increased action will have a positive feedback for people that don't have inner peace (clearly the majority of the market this movie goes for), but, for people that search some deep meaning to the things that happened on screen, they will better be served with Kung Fu Panda.<br/><br/>Kung-Fu panda 2 excels at action but lacks heart, not giving us master Shi-Fu through the movie was a big mistake and the lack of a master like the turtle in the first one was a serious error me thinks.<br/><br/>Tai-Lung was a glorious villain, the peacock no, it wasn't scary, it wasn't evil, it was just a resentful guy trying to be bad, also, what's up with dumbing down our dragon warrior?, after the first one this guy was a real master that defeated a truly difficult villain, in this one it behaves like a moron the whole movie up until the end?, it just doesn't fit and it was done purely for jokes and fun and it was forced.<br/><br/>So sad that it turned out to be like this.<br/><br/>My score 5/10"
"cosmo_tiger","5","1","3","11 December 2011"," A kids movie that comes off as too adult. I didn't like it, and my kids were bored with it. First one was better. I say B-
","""Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. it is the rest of your story, who you choose to be... So, who are you, Panda?"" Po and his friends are back and this time they must stop an evil peacock from destroying kung-fu. Po must learn to deal with his past in order to once again save China and the art form. To me this movie and ""Cars 2"" both had the same problem. Both were made as kids movies but with adult story lines. The problem with that is the adult aspect of it is too watered down for adults to take and the rest is not childish enough for the kids to really enjoy. I was never a fan of the first one but my kids were. Watching this one we all thought it was kinda boring. If they would have gone for more of Po hurting himself like the first one they would have liked it better. Sequels to kids movies try to actually be different from the first one, and that's why so many fail. Two and eight year olds don't care about stories they want up beat and funny, not a panda figuring out his past. Overall, a kids movie that tried to be to adult and didn't work. I give it a B-...my kids give it a B."
"Lightsoncn","8","1","3","19 November 2011"," Awesome one!
","As a whole, the story continued the style of Kung Fu comedy + cute panda of the first ""Kung Fu Panda""; the script may be a little weak compared with the last one, but still a masterpiece. Po the panda understood the importance of self-confidence in the last movie, and in this one he realized the Eastern philosophy of Conquering the Unyielding with the Yielding. However, the ending part of Kung Fu defeating artillery reminded us of the ignorance of the time of ""the Boxer"" in the very beginning of the 20th century more or less, which I really would not regard as a good point.<br/><br/>The villains were somewhat weak in this movie, perhaps I gave them too much expectation. Gary Oldman's voice failed to chill me.<br/><br/>In fact, just as the same with the first Kung Fu Panda movie, the essence of this one was still the combination of both Chinese and Western. The first story was the combination of the western self- struggle and a Chinese Kung Fu teacher-student routined story, and the second one was the combination of the western family rebellion and the eastern philosophy of Conquering the Unyielding with the Yielding.<br/><br/>As some Chinese newspapers said that this was the assault or insult to Chinese culture or so, I rejected them all. The high political pressure in China made domestic newspapers lack the creativity for animations and everything, so they need excuses to blame the other countries' wonderful movies. This sense of inferiority was nothing but truly ridiculous."
"FilmFanatic03","9","1","3","4 June 2011"," A fantastic, substantial sequel
","The sequel to the hit ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008) (excuse the pun) really developed into a new level. From the first film we see Po's character develop from a big blob of a panda into a kung fu warrior. We also are introduced to the Furious Five. So the foundation of the characters is laid to allow the sequel to go all out in creating a substantial story. Yet, there is still development in Po's character for we discover his past and find out how indeed his father is a duck (or goose) anyway...I loved that the story was deep and it was still character driven. The relationship of the father and Po is really special and amusing due to the obvious appearance differences. This film is so much fun, for both adults and children, you will not be disappointed. I also loved the fact that the film managed to convey a deep message and yet it did not feel corny or cheesy. The message is about letting go of your troubled past and moving on into your future. There is also a shocking and awesome ending, the ending sequences are awesome. DreamWorks has done it again!"
"squash1324","9","1","3","28 May 2011"," Great family film
","I just got home from taking my kids to see this film, and they are already asking when we can go and see it again. It was a wonderful film, and lived up to the expectations that I had going into it.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is that of Po fighting to defeat a powerful weapon that Master Shen has created that will end kung fu. There are several themes mixed into the movie including working towards your inner peace, overcoming your fears to accomplish great things, and most importantly (I feel at least) the feelings someone has about being adopted and the basic family structure.<br/><br/>The voice acting in some parts of the film are the only drawback to this film, but overall most of the actors did a fantastic job. The pace of the movie was perfect. My kids never once looked away other than to ask me a couple of times why Po was afraid of his dreams. Younger children may not understand the genocide that Shen committed to the pandas, but with a little explanation my kids understood what Shen did.<br/><br/>Speaking of Master Shen I believe that he was a better villain than Tai Lung was. Master Shen wanted to have something that he couldn't have (just like Tai Lung), but you also see the devastation he brings throughout the film as opposed to just seeing flashbacks to what Tai Lung does. The way he destroys everything he cares about just to kill Po showed my kids just how evil he was even to the very end.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is the movie of the year for children. I honestly do not see anything that could top this movie this year."

"beronginigo","4","1","4","28 June 2015"," All flash, no substance
","What a great disappointment this was; the first Kung Fu Panda dared to be different from the rest of the corny and bland, goody two shoes crap Pixar and the other studios was churning out like Ratatouille, Madagascar, Ice Age. It was a breather from those films that took themselves too seriously; it was funny and along with the Shrek movies, tried to summon the cartoony feel of classic Looney Tunes (at least in the feel and tone).<br/><br/>The sequel sucks for several reasons. The humor is virtually gone and replaced by some dour ""drama"". We discover Po's real parents which, is kinda boring; nobody gives a damn about Po's biological parents and this actually downplayed and undermined the screen chemistry and dynamic between Po and his goose dad so carefully built up in the first movie; the promise of the first film, on Po using his new found skills as a martial arts master against more formidable enemies is discarded, replaced by a ""Once a Upon a Time in China"" like storyline.<br/><br/>Honestly, I can't stand all the China ass-kissing on display here. It's like the Dreamworks investors and shareholders were on a meeting and agreed that ""hey, China is one of the most populous locations on the planet, let's make a movie that panders to their cultural and national motifs and we're sure to make bucketfuls worth of dollars in Chinese currency"".<br/><br/>The verdict: Kung Panda 2 is boring, needlessly gloomy, tedious and a waste of potential."

","Kung-Fu panda 2 just amazes the viewers through out all cinemas. Just when you think that every sequel you watch will amount to little compared to the very first, Kung-Fu panda comes out with an entertaining and hilarious movie which had me rolling in the aisles. <br/><br/>Whilst the first one focused more on the story behind Po's path to becoming the dragon warrior, the sequel brings you non-stop action and laughs. The cast are back and in tip-top shape, each complimenting each others acting skills. We now see more from the characters that play the furious five but less from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). However, the story line that suddenly appears with a new foe just surprised me. <br/><br/>Kung-Fu panda is definitely one movie that must be added to your bucket list."
"Hellmant","6","1","4","7 June 2011"," Chan and Van Damme together in a film at last!
","'KUNG FU PANDA 2': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Jackie Chan and Jean-Claude Van Damme together in a film at last, even if it is just as voices (hopefully they'll do an 'EXPENDABLES' film together next)! The rest of the all-star voice cast, from the original, returns with Chan as well including Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, James Hong and Jack Black as Po (the 'Kung Fu Panda'). New voices (besides Van Damme) include Michelle Yeoh, Gary Oldman, Danny McBride and Dennis Haysbert. This time the film is directed by Jennifer Yuh, an Art and Animation Department vet but first time film director. It was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (who also co-wrote the first film). The movie is not quite as much fun as the original (which wasn't a great film to begin with) but it does deliver the laughs and action fans expect.<br/><br/>The first film dealt with Po living out his dream by joining his kung fu heroes, 'The Furious Five', and becoming the chosen 'Dragon Warrior'. In this chapter he struggles with coming to terms with who he really is and where he came from (now knowing that he's adopted). While battling his inner demons he also must lead 'The Furious Five' to face a new enemy with a weapon that destroys kung fu. Of course he won't be able to conquer this new found enemy and deliver peace to his people until he finds peace within himself. To do this he must discover the secrets of his past.<br/><br/>The movie is just about what you'd expect from a sequel. If you're a fan of the original you'll probably enjoy this chapter as well, just not quite as much. Black and the rest of the cast are funny, a lot of the jokes are of course silly and geared at kids but the film has a decent amount of laughs to deliver a slightly older crowd as well (like the first). The action scenes are entertaining although I heard from my two young nephews (who I saw the film with) that the movie is too scary at times and much more frightening than the original (I personally didn't notice). Guillermo del Toro was an executive producer and creative consultant on the film this time around and some say he added a darker tone to it. As I said I didn't really notice much of a difference in that way from the original but I'm sure that could be a slight possibility. The movie is fun regardless and should please most fans of the original.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBr4LOQxrmg"
"matttheshadowman","9","1","4","6 June 2011"," A much deeper film than the original
","Kung Fu Panda was released in 2008 and marked a dramatic shift in focus for Dreamworks Animation. The pop culture and childish humour of the likes of Shrek, Shark Tale and Over The Hedge was replaced with a more measured approach that while still had some childish humour was considerably more intelligent and deeper than most of Dreamwork's other films. The first film was a turning point I believe for the company in making animations that the industry could take more seriously. Then last year How To Train Your Dragon appeared at cinemas and I will admit that I preferred it to Toy Story 3 (probably the first time I can truly say I have enjoyed a Dreamworks feature more than one by Pixar). How To Train Your Dragon was deep, well-written but also fun, enjoyable to watch and all the childish humour had gone. It didn't talk down or sink low to entertain children just like most of Pixar's films. The animation was beautiful to behold and the music provided by John Powell was incredible using a mostly orchestral score with the visuals taking you on a fantastic journey as a young boy becomes a man in a way that only he can in bonding with an elusive dragon. It set a new standard for Dreamworks with the only other film I enjoyed as much was the co-production with Aardman on Wallice & Gromit: The Curse of the Ware-Rabbit.<br/><br/>So onto 2011 and the sequel to Kung Fu Panda. The second film was entrusted to a female director (the first such female to direct a big budget CGI film). Jennifer Yuh Nelson who had was the head of story on the first film was given the opportunity to direct the second. The story is even deeper and much darker than the original with Po (Jack Black), now the Dragon Warrior, being tasked by his Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to find inner peace in his next stage of training. This will be much more difficult for Po then he realises as during a fight with wolves he has a vision of his real mum as a baby. This of course causes him to speak to his 'dad' Mr Ping (James Hong),who being a goose was never Po's real father, to tell him where he came from. However Mr Ping only knows of how he found him and it's the journey Po takes to find who he is and to help stop a new evil, Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) , from using a new weapon from destroying kung fu and taking over all of China that he will have to take on to find inner peace. Travelling with the Furious Five, Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross), Monkey (Jackie Chan) and Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Po journeys on an adventure where he has many physical and personal demons to face. I will not spoil the plot too much more but the film tells a story that has been told before but in a very polished and intelligent way that children and adults alike will enjoy. The darker edge to film may well be the work of executive producer Guillermo del Toro whose work such as the Hellboy films may not seem to fit in with family entertainment but it gives this film the edge it really needed.<br/><br/>The story may be fairly traditional but the animation is truly spectacular to behold. Using more traditional styles of animation mixed in with the CGI worked very well for the first film but here the level of detail and mix of the styles with the dream sequences with real life are some the most artistic work American animation has ever done. The 3D is also used to great effect as well given the film an extra layer to the animation that Dreamworks seems to really be able to master perhaps more than any other animation company (yes, including Pixar).<br/><br/>The music provided by Hans Zimmer and John Powell helps to immerse you further into this Oriental world. Using cues from what he had achieved with How To Train Your Dragon Powell uses again an orchestral score that gives the film an epic sense of scale and really the music never sets a foot wrong.<br/><br/>The voice actors seem to of come of age too with Jack Black as Po really toning down the silliness that he had from the first film but without losing the fun and lovableness that the character had in the first place. It is a shame however that the Furious Five still had to take a back seat again in the film with Lucy Liu and Jackie Chan having barely a dozen or so lines between them. There is an exception to this and that is Tigress who Angelina Jolie really brings the character to the fore. Michelle Yeoh as the Soothsayer brings a strong performance too. However it is Gary Oldman as Lord Shen who steals the show as the main villain and who was probably the only person to make a peacock as scary and menacing as possible.<br/><br/>Without any shadow of doubt this is a must see film for fans of the original but not only that anyone who enjoys a great film will enjoy this film. It has set a new standard again for Dreamworks and we can only hope that with Del Torro's influence that Puss in Boots doesn't end up as bad as I fear it may be. That is for the future and, as the film says, the most important time is now and I would recommend anyone to watch Kung Fu Panda 2. Funny, clever and with a well rounded story Dreamworks has set the bar pretty high for Pixar to beat with Cars 2."

So, what do you expect in the sequel of the film? It really lived to it's tag line though it didn't lived my expectations because it went BEYOND. The story follows the dragon warrior - Po and the furious five; Tigress, Viper, Crane, Mantis and Monkey in their journey trying to save Kung Fu from the evil Lord Shen - who invented a new weapon that could end Kung Fu. The evil lord returned in making his plan into a reality with the help of this new weapon to end kung fu and conquer China after being banished by his father. Then later, Po realizes that the evil lord may or may have not done something in his missing childhood memories and he began to question himself 'Who is he?' I don't wanna spoil so better watch it. Kudos to the whole team behind this movie. I loved how they put a very good sense of humor. Plus, the comedic timing of everyone was great! And you can see that the characters really matured especially Po. Casting of the voices in the new characters were great too. And the I liked the fact that in some scenes you can't feel it 3D - unless you want it 3D the whole time and regretting it later for the soring of your eyes. They really did a good job on the effects, animations and colors were freaking great! it's 10 over 10 movie for me :)"

Left by his mother to escape the carnage by Shen (Gary Oldman) who uses the dark arts of making black powder more powerful as a weapon. In the care of Ping (James Hong) as his adopted father, starts Po on his journey to discover his true roots. The movie is excellent as the original cast was used to give their lively voices the needed boost to give the audience what they crave. To see Po and the furious five back in action. Yet this time, Po learns the way of inner peace using old memories of his past to stop Shen and his madness. Dustin Hoffman is as always, though through a smaller part, excellent as master Shifu, Po's instructor who tries to explain to Po how inner peace really works. But Po gets his idea from another who is a soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh). I thought this was a great addition to the character cast, her ability to give the mysteries of the universe using her juxtaposition conundrums was quite inspiring. And of course, new additions to the group, such as Master ox and Master Croc (Jean Claude Van Damme) who give a performance just as lively and inspiring as the furious five do. But now in this case, it is the furious seven. Plus this also opens a door for another movie for which Po's parents might still be alive and in hiding. All in all, a fantastic movie with action, humour, fireworks, and puzzling riddles for which a person or panda might bang their head against a wall for to try and figure it out. Highly recommended."

"omsarmalkar","10","1","4","29 May 2011"," Kung Fu...' is a return to awesomeness
","Jack Black returns as the voice of mighty martial-arts panda Po in 'Kung Fu Panda 2', the sequel to that 2008 animated gem. After establishing himself as the Dragon Warrior by vanquishing the evil Tai Lung and retrieving the Dragon Scroll in the earlier film, the new adventure involves Po's search for his identity, and his quest for inner peace. He's pitted against an evil peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) who killed his parents when he was a baby, and who is now threatening to conquer China using a fiery canon that will all but end the ancient art of kung fu. Naturally Po's accomplices in this showdown against Lord Shen are the members of the Furious Five, and much of the fun and inventiveness of this film comes from the teamwork between them. Po himself is the star of the show, and those who enjoyed the earlier film will be happy to know there are still plenty of jokes about Po being fat, lazy and constantly hungry. In fact, the very first time we see him in this film, he's accepted a challenge to stuff 40 buns in his mouth. The action scenes are bigger and better than the last time, and the animation itself is exceptional in terms of textures and lighting. Flashback sequences unfold in rich, comic-book style, and a climatic sequence in which Po dodges deadly canon-balls is the most visually arresting set-piece you've seen in an animation film recently. But 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is also a film with heart. There are touching scenes between Po and his adoptive father, and an important message in the end: that inner peace can be attained only by confronting the past, then letting go of it. A very worthy sequel to the first film, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is a treat for animation lovers. I'm going with three-and-a-half out of five for this return to awesomeness!"

"jboothmillard","5","1","5","23 June 2011"," Kung Fu Panda 2
","The first film was a good fun cartoon film, I was told by one or two people that the sequel is just as good (and it wouldn't really matter if you hadn't seen the first), so I decided to see it. Basically the film starts with the past, seeing the villain Shen the albino peacock (Gary Oldman) wanting to take over with the power of fireworks, and being told by The Soothsayer the elderly goat (Michelle Yeoh) that a warrior of black and white will one day defeat him, he obviously knows she means a panda, so has them all killed. Then skip forward to the present day, Po the tongue-in-cheek giant panda (Jack Black) has now established himself as the Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside the Furious Five: Tigress the South China tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). Master Shifu the red panda (Dustin Hoffman) tells the hero however he needs to achieve inner peace, and while there is an attack by Shen's army of wolves, Po has an unexpected flashback of his mother, and his Chinese goose father Mr. Ping (James Hong) admits he found him in a basket of radishes and adopted him. Shifu receives word that Master Thundering Rhino (Titanic's Victor Garber) has been killed, and that Shen has created a powerful cannon to destroy the kung fu tradition and conquer China, so the panda and the Furious Five head for Gongmen City to stop her. They find imprisoned Master Storming Ox (Dennis Haysbert) and Master Croc (Jean-Claude Van Damme), but they refuse to escape believing the weapon is too powerful and they will all be defeated, but they do leave, but are captured by the Wolf Boss (Danny McBride). They are taken to Shen, and breaking free they destroy the weapon, but Po allows the villain to get away after being distracted by another unexpected flashback, so he wants to question the peacock about his involvement. Despite being told by Tigress to stay behind, Po goes to Shen who tells him that his parents abandoned him before blasting him with the factory cannon, but he is found alive by the exiled Soothsayer. She tells the panda hero the story of what happened in the past, his parents sacrificed him during the attacks on all pandas, and his mother placed him in the crate of radishes. Realising he had a happy life with his adoptive father, Po finds inner peace at the critical moment when the cannon is going to attack, and the kung fu power destroys it, and Shen ends up killing himself refusing to give himself up. In the end Po returns to the Valley of Peace once again praised by everyone as a hero, and he declares his love for his adoptive father like his real one, but the final moment of the film sees Po's true biological father (Fred Tatasciore) sensing that his son is alive. Black once again give a good vocal performance, Oldman is just as good the villain (even though I didn't know it was him until the end), and the supporting cast all do good too, it is pretty much the same quality as the first film, and of course the open ended final scene gives way for another follow up, a fun family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year. Worth watching!"
"FairlyAnonymous","9","1","5","3 June 2011"," A truly good movie that stands out on its own, and is better than the first
","OK now remember the first Kung Fu Panda movie? Well next to the first Shrek movie that is arguably my favorite Dreamworks movie. Kung Fu Panda was a good movie even though some people didn't like it. Either way is Kung Fu Panda 2 a good movie? Dreamworks hasn't done so well with sequels, but let me tell you, this is a great sequel and a good movie. First off this movie has terrific animation. Seriously. The graphics, and fine details on everything is very good, and the lighting effects really make this movie stand out. The movie has a great artistic style, even more so than the last movie. So now you know that this movie will not disappoint graphically. One of the things I really liked about this movie is that the main villain is established very early on... like at the beginning credits. This allows you to understand the main villain throughout the entire movie. This makes Lord Shen much better than Tai Lung who was still a good villain, but not as good. Lord Shen is a white peacock which really makes his evil side stick out. He was son of the rulers of China, and after being banished for reasons I won't say, he wants his throne back. This villains as I said before is good. When he fights it is unlike Tai Lung because he is a peacock. Tai Lung fought with muscle, Lord Shen fights with agility, speed, and blades. Also Lord Shen does act like a bird which is cool. When you see him walking around, or observing people, he really does look like a bird which I thought was really neat. The characters in this movie get a bit more face time which was a problem in the last movie. They have more dialogue (especially Tigress) and you get to see them fight a lot. Shifu doesn't have much face time in this movie which I was kind of sad to see, but when you do see him it is always great. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. It has tons of action sequences and they are all good. The choreography was excellent, and the fights scenes were original. If there is one thing that slightly bothered me, it was some of the slapstick humor kind of got old. It sort of distracted when there is a serious action sequence and then slapstick gets thrown in. But that's just me. Like the first movie the soundtrack is very good. Only in one scene did the music seem off, which was a jail breaking scene. Thankfully that track was only a minute long or so. All in all an excellent movie that deserves to be watched. 9.3"

","I loved the first Kung Fu Panda as it showed that Dreamworks can tell a great story and rely on the story to carry the movie. The same can be said about this wonderful sequel.<br/><br/>Jack Black returns as Po, who must now find inner peace in order to master the next phase of kung fu. In order to do that, Po must find out where he came from and who he is. A new villain from Po's past comes into the picture named Lord Shen, a peacock who wants to take over China. Now it is up to Po and the Furious Five to stop Shen and bring peace to the valley again.<br/><br/>The actors from the original who return for this film all do great jobs again. Gary Oldman voices Shen, and is great at making a peacock sound like an evil character. I also enjoyed hearing Michelle Yeoh in this film as she voices a soothsayer who says that Po will defeat Lord Shen.<br/><br/>As I said, what works best with this film is how director Jennifer Yuh shows that a good structured story will carry the film and make this sequel well worth watching. The best part of the story is that there are new parts of this film that we did not see in this one and make this film exciting to watch."

","Kung Fu Panda 2 was a delightful watch! Totally loved it. There are some movies that makes you glad and satisfied till the end...and Kung Fu Panda 2 is one among them...each scene is crafted with the best dialogues, visuals and a chockful of humor that'll make you laugh/content till the end. There's not a single scene that will bore you. Jack Black as Po, this time is accompanied by the first movies' cast, Angleina Jolie as Tigress, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper, Dustin Hoffman as Shifu...with a few new additions including Gary Oldman as the wonderfully voice-overed (Po's) menace, Shen; Michelle Yeoh, Jean Claude Van Damm, Dennis Hayesbert etc. Jack Black & Gary Oldman steals every scene they are in; together or apart.<br/><br/>The legendary Hans Zimmer & John Powell's combined score was pure 'earcandy'. The 3D was delicious...this movie, like Avatar & Tron LEGACY is meant to be watched in 3D. Absolutely amazing CG visuals coupled with equally awe-inspiring 2D animation makes it a treat to watch. Past movies like Thor, Pirates Of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides were only excuses to cash in on the 3D...though Kung Fu Panda 2 was made with all passion & sincerity to provide the best and right use of 3D.<br/><br/>My only minor complaint here is that some of the cast were underutilized, esp Po's mates' dialogues IMO were so less compared to the first movie. KUDOS to Jennifer Yuh for a wonderfully entertaining sequel and yes...those are a rarity these days. There's obviously a Kung Fu Panda 3 coming, as evident from the last scene, and my fingers are crossed for it..until then Ska2oosh! :D"
"lasttimeisaw","6","1","6","9 June 2011"," Kung Fu Panda 2
","Saw this one in 3D version at the cinema (4th time this year, after RIO, THOR and Captain Jack Sparrow), my expectation was not too high as I was in a numb state of receiving bombarding Hollywood summer momentum, a yearly-recurrent compulsory course (my sole anticipation lies in X-MEN: FIRST CLASS right away). <br/><br/>It turned out that the exotic appeal is roughly null to me (thanks to my Chinese identity), and confidently I can claim that I do prefer RIO after comparison. The Zen-inspired quintessence of the story is all-age beneficial but superficially indoctrinated and without any originality inside, the gags and set pieces are ample but in lack of a punchline. I find the editing is clumsy at some time and thwarts the coherence of the whole picture. The shadow play is a nice trick which makes amends for the corny plot of memorizing Po's provenance. <br/><br/>A fully-fledged exploitation of Kung Fu and panda is foreseeable, nevertheless this time no improvement from its precedent, the original cast is on a stable level and new characters like evil peacock Shen and the goat Soothsayer all fall into flat. <br/><br/>The 3D effect work much better with animation than other SFX-padded live-action blockbusters, but I think an IMAX 2D could be a better choice. Due to its lukewarm North American box office, if the red-hot 3D trend will be put in a halt or a slow-down, I will be happy to see it (Although very probably the international income will eliminate this idea for the film companies)."

","KUNG FU PANDA 2 is a sequel to the first Dreamworks animation that improves things considerably, although the film is still flawed in having an annoying, unsympathetic hero in the form of Jack Black's Po. The good news is that the plot is more action packed this time around, with less time for the kind of dumb slapstick comedy that spoilt the first, and the voice cast is better: Gary Oldman on villain duties alongside many famous faces popping up in support. Not particularly watchable, but better than the first at least."

","12 June 2011. The sequel out of necessity was unable to capture the freshness and the character development of the first movie and had to rely more on the action thrills and more of the me vs. them plot of good and evil. There were so slow parts but by the end the emotive climax was solid. The movie was helped along with some substantive and well balanced tidbits of one-liners of humor and the involving action sequences (some reminiscent of Croaching Tiger, Flying Dragon (2000) animated style maintained the momentum and interest in the movie. The actors' voices were less pronounced and distracting as it appeared that the sources of the real actors didn't seem to be so identifiable, except Jack Black, and enabled the audience to focus more on the animated characters than the actual actors as actors themselves."

"maxmages","8","0","1","12 November 2018"," It's clearly one of the best animated movies I've seen and one of the best sequels I've ever seen.
","I'm impressed that the makers took the relatively small concept and actually the expanded the story.
And I'm glad you've improved all the things that did not vote in the first part, at least with the characters here.
You clearly see a change but also a form of confusion compared to the predecessor because they can not believe how they all started and you see that the respect of others has earned and the recognition that he built here.
But ""A hero is only as good as his villain.""
And this is even better managed. This ""Lord Shen"" is everything I want from a good villain. He is strong, smart, brave and a good fighter. But above all, really diabolical.
Really has a personal connection to our hero unlike any other.
Is everyone still funny that makes it so entertaining to see I like to see him but thanks to his actions I want to see how he loses.
That makes a great villain and his wonderful noble design gives him even a bit of class so he really deserves the title Lord.
I did not expect to hear anything about genocide in a children's movie. And it did not just seem to be thrown in, it was as if it had been planned from the start. A personal vendetta against the hero is one thing, but eradicating the entire Panda people puts them at such a new level of villains that I'm used to in animated films.
That was just great, that's why every time the two clashes at the edge of my seat, I did not know who was going to win and because I did not know how to cheer.
Unfortunately, he dies in a rather unspectacular way and loses his coolness in the last few moments, but it's literally only 2 seconds, so he's forgiven.
It's just wonderful I want to see where the journey leads us next and I can not wait to see more of it."

","1. It seems first Shen wanted to weaponized fireworks because he was power hungry to conquer China as he was a evil psychopath, his parents was worried about him because of his evil nature and tried to kill all pandas too make sure the prophecy about a warrior of black and white as pandas would stop him to conquer China wouldn't come true, but other source says Shen wanted weaponized fireworks to impress his parents and business of Gongmen City at first. How can Shen become power hungry to conquer China because he wanted to weaponized fireworks or his parents exiled him who had nothing to do with China, kill all pandas if Shen didn't want to conquer China at first and believe his parents would be proud of him for killing all pandas and conquer China when they weren't even evil too and even let his cannon crush him if he want to conquer China anyway? Shen would at least get his will to conquer over a kingdom since he was at least a prince who are the only heir after his parents to conquer over their own kingdom, usually royalties who have and are jealous of their older siblings who are the next to rule over their kingdoms and advisers who dislike their job or never get any praise and honor, become power hungry and will only conquer over their own kingdom instead of entire country or the world that have nothing to with them. How could Shen believe his parent would be proud of him to weaponized firework and conquer China if his parent weren't evil too? Would Shen want to take revenge on his parents? It were his parents who banished Shen because he want to conquer China and massacred pandas, but why did Shen still want to seek revenge when his parents was nevertheless died before his return?<br/><br/>2. Why did Shen want to make an end of kung fu? Shen even was a kung fu master too, kung fu had nothing to do with his backstory, his main goal was to conquer China and kung fu could be useful to conquer China. Shen created a cannon that would put an end of kung fu, but it's not only kung fu it should make an end of if there are anything else are as powerful or more powerful than kung fu, as chi.<br/><br/>3. The kung fu masters seems more weaker. How could the kung fu masters believe even only one cannon could put an end of kung fu and conquer China and didn't even knew first that Shen at least had more than one cannon and could create multiple cannons quickly that they should rather stop him from doing instead and how could even Po believe a cannon figurine was Shen's actual cannon when and didn't even laugh just because of it was too small too put an end of kung fu and conquer China? Aren't kung fu masters smarter, too quick and has high strength to hit the cannons and wasn't there other more kung fu masters than just Po, Furious Five, Shifu, Storming Ox and Croc who could also go to stop Shen if they needed more help? Cannon is too slow and heavy to swing fast enough and can only shoot on one place at once if there are more kung fu masters than cannons and are in different directions, even Tai Lung was shown to be cunning and swift enough to avoid firing weapons and was able to defeat the Anvil of Heaven, the Furious Five and Shifu on is own, Tigress hit the cannon down to the bottom floor of Tower of the Sacred Flame, Kai easily defeated many kung fu masters by taking their chi on his own and Thundering Rhino didn't even dodge the cannon's fire. Shen must at least have kung fu skills and learn his wolf and gorilla army kung fu to defeat kung fu masters, Kai and Taotie could make an end of kung fu, Kai easily defeat many kung fu masters by taking their chi on his own and once Taotie created a machine that easily defeat Po, Shifu and Furious Five (without Tigress). Why didn't Thundering Rhino try to dodge the cannon's fire and how could the other kung fu masters survive blow from the cannon when Thundering Rhino who easily dies of just a one blow by the cannon when he was bigger and stronger? Po survived probably because of his enormous body fat. Wasn't most important to stop Shen from conqured China than to stop him to put an end of kung fu?<br/><br/>4. Why is Thundering Rhino's physical appearance different than in Kung Fu Panda Holiday? Why is shown in the credits of Kung Fu Panda 2 Po made the the Furious Five action figures when he was a child if he was fan of kung fu since he was a teenager and the Furious Five were just formed then as revealed in Secrets of the Scroll?<br/><br/>5. Why is not even shown or mentioned that Shen began his plan years before or it was lesser than 30 years ago for the panda massacre and when he was exiled if it was 20 years ago as revealed in Kung Fu Panda 3?"

","A prologue explains how a peacock named Shen's family were the city's ancestral rulers of Gongmen City but his parents exiled him after he massacred the pandas because a soothsayer told him one would thwart his ambition to rule china. Now he has taken the city by force, using cannon to defeat the kung fu masters would had protected it.<br/><br/>After the events of the previous film the panda Po has been accepted as the legendary Dragon Warrior but his training is far from over; before he can truly be a master he must find inner peace. After his first clash with Shen's forces he starts recalling his past and realises that the goose who raised him wasn't his actual father. When word of what happened in Gongmen gets out he, and the 'Furious Five' must go there and defeat him; if they are to prevail Po must come to terms with his past.<br/><br/>This sequel is a lot of fun; I'm sure anybody who enjoyed the opening instalment in the franchise will enjoy this too. There is lots of enjoyable, well animated martial arts action and plenty of humorous moments; frequently at the same time. It is fun seeing the established characters again, if anything it is more fun than before as they have become friends. Shen is a fine antagonist; the backstory we are shown at the start of the film gives him a touch of King Herod as he attempts to eliminate the pandas because one is foretold to defeat himÂ… of course as with all such prophecies it is ultimately correct. The animation is impressive with great looking backgrounds and nice character designs. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to those who enjoyed the first film."
"neazy","7","0","1","24 August 2017"," Spectacular
","Whilst not quite as well-balanced as the first film (perhaps because of the greater emphasis on spectacular action throughout - the the story doesn't build quite as effectively), this is such an entertaining film. It is stunningly beautifully animated, especially in its set pieces, which are even more ambitious than the first film. The music is once again wonderfully atmospheric. Whilst it would have been nice to see a little more character development from characters other than Po, this might have over complicated matters, and the film relies, quite rightly, on its slickness and pace to ramp up the drama. The story itself is well crafted, the villain excellent, and the finale is, strange though it may be to say it, one of my all-time favourite pieces of cinema. It is exciting, moving, and amusing in one explosive great cocktail (or should I say peacocktail?) A film I never get tired of watching - superb entertainment."

","Kung Fu panda 2 is one of the best film sequels of all time IMO. It took everything that made the first one great and made it better.The story line is more emotional, the villain was much better, the music was better, the furious five had more lines and development especially tigress.<br/><br/>The animation is more crisped and it looks great! Every animal has a unique design and the fur detail especially is awesome! <br/><br/>Every character in this film is better for example PO is more confident then before and is more wise while still being hilarious. Tigress is more likable and bad-ass here as well as having more personalty. The villain lord Shen voiced by Gary Oldmen did such a great job in making him believable. Lord Shen is way better then Tai lung since he more bad ass, more developed, had more screen time and did something horrible to PO which i won't spoil.Mr ping is more loving and kind here then he was in the first film (even tho I still found him likable in the first one) The films comedy is just as hilarious as it was before but I found the first film to be a bit more funny.<br/><br/>The voice acting is better here to and displays more emotion then before. The pacing is very fast but that makes it more entertaining in my opinion and it never feels slow. The film is rather short too but then again a lot of kids movies are short so I can kind of understand why.<br/><br/>The only down side to the film is Shifu being a minor character, but then again I think it helped the film in a way because it gave the furious five a chance to shine and somebody has to protect the valley of peace! not to mention he was in the climax which was epic!<br/><br/>Overall Kung Fu Panda 2 is epic, emotional, beautiful, heartwarming, dark, hilarious and is worth checking out if you are a fan of the first film."
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","26 August 2016"," From a comically 3D to an emotionally three-dimensional character...
","In every good sequel, there's a little bit of prequel and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is another proof that DreamWorks knows how to handle sequels, especially the second ones. If you look at ""Shrek 2"" or ""Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa"" you'll notice the same pattern, they exploit the back-stories of the main characters for their individual development and for the plot. The premises of Shrek meeting Fiona's parents or Alex the Lion discovering his roots in the savanna inspired entertaining and emotional stories. And if I was more entertained by ""Madagascar 2"", I was certainly more emotionally involved by ""Kung Fu Panda 2"".<br/><br/>The film opens with an expected narration, the tale of the peacock lord of the city of Gongmen who had troubles with his son, Shen, a soothsayer predicted that if he went to rule the city, he'd bring chaos and desolation by turning fireworks into a weapon, but he'd ultimately be defeated by a creature in black and white. Shen hears the prediction and pulls an Oedipus by destroying the peaceful panda. Actually, it was Jocasta, Oedipus' father who sealed his fate by abandoning his son but never mind, we know the film will finally give an answer to the biological difference between Po, the panda and his father, the goose. What was a funny sight gag inspires a very poignant story.<br/><br/>Indeed, the sequel gives an unexpected dimension to a character who was supposed to be droll and funny, and with the voice of Jack Black, it's hard to take him seriously, but as the plot advances, and we have more glimpses on Po's past, we start to take the film more seriously than the first, 'Disney' serious. The comparison is not fortuitous, when I saw the flashback sequences drawn in quite a beautiful 2D animation; I thought it would have fitted the film as well as 3D. I understand the animators took for granted that 3D would be the best vehicle for action sequences and spectacularly acrobatic move but the highest spots of ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" owed nothing to 3D.<br/><br/>There's no denial that action is integral to the franchise's appeal, but the origins of Po were enough to turn him into a fully three-dimensional character (in the nobler meaning of the word), the scene where he finally confronts his adoptive father carries some powerful emotionality. And besides the hero, the film had the worthy villain: Lord Shen, voiced by Gary Oldman, a self-centered peacock whose childhood trauma nourished hatred, anger and a constant obsession for power and mass destruction. With the help of an army of wolves, he decimated Po's village, had his mother killed and created such a powerful weapon it could make Kung Fu as useless as a peashooter.<br/><br/>Lord Shen is a very hard to beat villain, literally, and the film surprisingly features many confrontations between him and the Five-now-Six Warriors, it's almost one hour and half long, but there's not a moment wasted, except some action sequences that are a little overblown. The length also allows to explore the personalities of the other warriors but again it's Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) who takes the 'lion' share of interactions, and there's a word that is used so many times it becomes some sort of running-gag. She's called 'hardcore' because she's so cold and bad-ass in the same time, her capability to hide her feelings almost equals her fighting skills, but whenever Po's life is at stakes, she reveals a sweet and maybe fragile side of her, is there more than friendship and respect? <br/><br/>There's no time to figure because Po's vulnerability was the main point and he had more urgent things to do, and when he gets to the final confrontation with Shen, the dark flashback that reveals Po's past seals the coming-to-maturity of Disney's rival, as even the buffoonish panda can make your heart melt. But DreamWorks animators have a talent of their own; they know how to 'copy Disney without copying it'. Let me explain: in ""Shrek"", the Beauty becomes the Beast after the kiss of true love, in ""Madagascar 2"", Alex doesn't follow Simba's example and ""remembers who he is"", but sticks to what he is inside without any blood predestination. In ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", when Po learns the truth, he doesn't jump to kill Shen, but finds the inner peace so he can dodge his secret weapon and uses the fireballs like drops of water (good call on the continuity).<br/><br/>Still, there was more than a MacGuffin in that 'inner peace' thing, it showed that Po stayed true to himself; he defeated Shen but didn't want to kill him for what he did to his parents. But we all know that a villain of such cruelty can't be forgiven by the laws of animation, so Shen pulls a desperate fight and is defeated for once and all. The team triumphed and Kung Fu will prosper, but more than that, Po declares his love to his friend and to his Dad, and the ending almost had me in tears and I wish it could have closed that way. The last ten seconds were in my opinion the only useless thing about the film, granted they wanted a cliffhanger or gives us a foretaste of the third opus but why showing Po's dad alive? <br/><br/>All the animosity we built toward Shen is because he was an evil dude who killed a whole village and decided to take over China, that evilness was quite understated by the last shot. I wouldn't have cared about this detail if the film was average, but it was so awesome, I wish it didn't end like that."

","Making excellent use of all the ingredients that made its predecessor an instant classic, the follow- up chapter to Kung Fu Panda is another rollicking, ravishing & riveting adventure that lives up to its hype, adds more depth & flesh to the arcs of all reprising characters, further expands the world we dived into in the first film, and is a worthy sequel that even surpasses the original in few aspects.<br/><br/>The story of Kung Fu Panda 2 presents Po now living his fulfilled dream, serving as the Dragon Warrior, & protecting the valley with his fellow kung fu warriors whom he once idolised. His latest adventure begins when Lord Shen returns from exile with a fearsome new weapon & has plans of conquering all of China, following which Po & his friends attempt to stop him before he could destroy the entire kung fu tradition.<br/><br/>Directed by Jennifer Yuh in what is her directional debut, the film begins on a promising note with a prologue that quickly briefs us through the villain's background & how all of it is connected to Po's very own past, after which it dives into the present and sets the stage relatively quick, just like the previous feature. For a first attempt, Yuh's direction is highly commendable for she exhibits a very firm grip on all aspects.<br/><br/>The writing staff does an equally impressive job with the script by further evolving the characters' arcs, brilliantly balancing the elements of comedy, drama & action in one tightly-structured story & putting up a better sketch of the Chinese culture. The computer animation is lively, zestful & more complex than before, thanks to its energetic camera-work, rich colour tones & apt lighting that give its images a vivacious look n feel.<br/><br/>Editing is carried out amazingly well for its 90 minutes of narrative is expertly paced yet there are a couple of moments it could've done without. The flashback sequences are brought to life with care and a few of those segments are genuinely touching. Hans Zimmer & John Powell contribute with a familiar yet improved score. And Jack Black plus the rest of the reprising cast deliver exactly what was expected from them while the new additions are no slouch in their given roles.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Kung Fu Panda 2 heads into a slightly darker territory but it never discards the effervescent wit, unbridled passion & unadulterated quality of the original in doing so. Packing in just as much fun, madness & awesomeness as the first film, exquisitely steered under Yuh's direction, and marking another creative high for DreamWorks Animation, Kung Fu Panda 2 is another triumph of its genre that's highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying from the first frame to the last. Definitely recommended."

","One thing that DreamWorks does well (with the exception of Shrek the Third) is sequels. They prove time and time again that they are very legit company in many cases, does better then its animated counterparts. Kung Fu Panda 2 is no exception as it seems the franchise is well at hand. After the incredible year of 2010 for DreamWorks after the cultural success of How to Train Your Dragon, and ending a great franchise (Shrek) they follow that year up with this. The movie's strengths are found within the story, not that its unique, but the secret ingredient found within. The secret ingredient is heart. Its not totally comedic as one would expect, but in the middle they tweak the film's tone with heart and emotion. This is what a proper sequel should do, taking the story and making it more then what we'd expect. Is this film a rehash from the last? Well, not really it offers new elements, especially to Po's character. The other characters are still they're same likable selves. In this however they really showcase the relationship growing between Po and Tigress which is the most unique and pleasurable relationship. The next thing is the villain voiced by Gary Oldman. He is the most interesting and menacing out of the villains so far. And that's hard to make a peacock menacing, and they did it like pros. Now the negative I have is what I said before, with the story not being unique and refreshing, but that's a slight error as the film makes up with heart. So a very small negativity. As a whole this film is one of DreamWorks' best. Now to grade. Animation: A Voice Acting: A- Story: C+ Music: B+ Characters: A+ Overall: B+"

Eventually, I decided I would actually like to see this in theaters, so I went on Memorial Day.<br/><br/>All I could say after seeing this movie was ""Wow"". It was truly something else, something that I never would have dreamed of seeing in an animated film. <br/><br/>Where to start? Well, I was shocked at the beginning of the movie when we're learning some of Shen's background. The panda genocide wasn't surprising when I learned about the Soothsayer's prophecy, but it was surprising that we were discussing such a dark topic. I would've thought that the powers that be would consider it to be too ""sensitive"" for children, but I was impressed that it was being addressed. <br/><br/>This brings me to the villain who carried out this heinous act. Shen was a despicable being. He was cowardly, sadistic, and just delusional when it came to being ""wronged"" by his parents. I hated the guy and found Tai Lung to be a more likable character. But I believe that Shen presented more of a challenge to Po due to the negative psychological effect he had, whether it was from his feathers causing visions or his toying with Po before lying about the circumstances of his separation from his biological parents. Shen clearly got into Po's head. And he did something so terrible and traumatic that Po didn't even remember it for years. He did scar Po for life, but Po might not have found the means for progression as a kung fu master if it hadn't been for Shen's actions.<br/><br/>This is a big one for me. Tigress. Now, I'm not one of those people who fawned over this movie because they're in love with some pairing. No. But I did enjoy seeing Tigress open up more, and I was glad to see that her continual scowl from the first movie was replaced by a smile here and there. I noticed that she and Po seemed to be best friends, which had me wondering what happened between the first movie and this one to make her go from intense dislike to best friends. The hug she gave to Po and the reactions of the rest of the Five made me believe that her character development is somewhat attributable to him. This development came as a relief. I found myself wondering whether or not she'd treat him with a more mild form of her attitude from the first.<br/><br/>My only qualm was that Tigress' time in the spotlight meant that the rest of the Five took a place on the back burner. I noticed that in the first movie, too. However, considering the fact that they're with Po for the majority of this movie, they should either have spoken more or had lines that added to their characters or the plot in some way. Tigress is my favorite character among the Five, but there's a lot of talent among their actors, and I thought it was wasted by giving the characters 5 lines apiece. <br/><br/>I have to say that I enjoyed this movie way more than the first. I like a little darkness in my movies. I've heard some say that they didn't enjoy the movie as much for this reason, but being a movie geared toward kids doesn't mean that it can't address serious or even grim themes. I applaud the director and the writers for delving into this. Some of my praise must also go the composers, John Powell and Hans Zimmer, who managed to create a great score that perfectly matched the scenes in the film. I'd definitely say that this is one of Dreamworks' better movies. Regardless of whether or not you can empathize with what's happening in this movie, many can probably sympathize or even compare Po's search for the truth to their own experiences in some way. Kung Fu Panda 2 is definitely something that any person can potentially enjoy."

","I'm still found this movie as hilarious as the first one, especially since all the seven main cast still reprising their role to lend their voice in this sequel.. New cast like Gary Oldman, Michelle Yeoh, just made this movie more full of stars.. The story itself still logical, since we never know the past that Po had so exploring them in this sequel is a great idea, since they never end up with ideas when they talked about a sequel.. As I remember, there's more action than the first movie and I'm fine with that... The flow of the story walks rapidly and leave me surprised when this movie ended in less than 90 minutes.. Overall, it's still enjoyable and hilarious as the first movie.."

From 1 hour and half short length time, the animation, plot,art, scores and character development just better than I expect that gave me a teary eyes in the end and show us meaning of family and love. The soundtrack composed by John Powell and Hans Zimmer made it extraordinary and best thing I've heard. Show us behind the music of Chinese instrument that made it...godly. I'd prefer this than the 1st movie, it gave me a lot of feels and relate to me at some point and the villain is very unique I love it, and thing that made the character a-bit mature, especially Po in this film. They were few laughs. After I get out of the cinema, it had me good vibes around me, it inspired me, it was a really good movie."

","You don't do a sequel unless its created by Dreamworks Animation and directed like Kung-Fu Panda 2. <br/><br/>That could be the bumper sticker for the movie theaters. Seriously.<br/><br/>Many times, sequels just throw a couple of new villains and force us to like the characters, eventually fail in that. Here we have a sequel which runs more like a prequel and uncanny for a Animation movie. The movie has got lot of story to it, you do not expect that at all<br/><br/>Granted it's got the Po moments and a Mission Impossible style mission to save Kung-fu. But it's likable. The more difficult part in sequels is people have a frame of reference to compare, and it's hard enough to satisfy that when the first movie was just a huge success. The bars are set really high and reach them would be a big ask, but if that's done the movie will succeed. Most times sequels are rated down because of this fact alone, in this franchise this movie reaches the predecessor success but is scared to take it further.<br/><br/>Positives about this movie: I like how the story unfolds and how the movie has got a lot more purpose than just creating another animation movie.<br/><br/>A lot of unanswered questions are looked at, which is nice. You might not have wondered about it in the first one as it was way too mind-blowingly awesome, but the director has taken a second reading at that script and addressed those open ends, Good work.<br/><br/>Colors: One word -Fantastic. Yes the fight with Tai lung was epic, funny and to up the ante in this movie, the movie writers have taken colors as a option and it has made wonders. It looked so good in the theaters that i wanted to see the movie again.<br/><br/>Negatives: Well, there were some and i did not expect them in this franchise 1. The villain, yes he creates cool weapons but not menacing enough as Tai Lung, he is a Peacock and the fact that worked for the movie was a tough ask, but again doesn't look villain enough 2. Too many cooks, the finale was supposed to be peacock versus panda, but bringing in Shifu, the other fighters just shows the directors is not confident about the script.<br/><br/>There are a couple of more negatives but not worth mentioning, i guess more of these come on board because the first movie was so good, Other sequels such as Madagascar, Ice age have been rated better than its predecessor because they got better with sequels. Here the director has matched the success of first movie which was a huge ask, but the movie feels a bit dragged by legacy sometimes, nevertheless a must watch fun movie by Dreamworks, i would be glad if they stop with this, but i guess they are not going to, let's see the next one pan out"
"anaconda-40658","4","0","2","19 June 2015"," Another Swing and Miss.
","Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011): Dir: Jennifer Yuh / Voices: Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman, Seth Rogen: Every bit as bland as the first film despite its colourful images. This time out Po the kung fu Panda desires to know where he came from and what happened to his original family. Shen the peacock is the new villain who leads a pack of wolves into battle and only Po and his allies can stop them. Sounds standard and delivers on just that. While the first film is no dud, it certainly didn't avoid every martial arts cliché it could find. Jennifer Yuh does well directing but the film fails to deliver a compelling story. Jack Black voices Po who remains a likable presence despite his stereotypical friends. He searches for his past and realizes that he has forgotten it due too a trauma. He proves to overcome his dilemma while his enemy cannot. Angelina Jolie voices Tigress who comes to life more as an animation as oppose to a personality. The same can be said of Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman who seems only as the countless reference to Yoda. The only other character of interest is villain Shen, voiced by Gary Oldman. We learn of Shen's upbringing and how he was banished, and the revenge he sought that would ultimately consume him. Other characters are paper thin although any one of the animals would make for a great documentary on wildlife program. The animation is as stunning as that of the first film but the story itself fails to lift off the screen. We are left with images of Asia and greater desire to watch something far more entertaining such as Animal Planet. Score: 4 / 10"
"AStormOfSwords13","8","0","1","7 May 2015"," A Fight for Identity
","In what was a sequel to the successful 2008 movie known as Kung Fu Panda, the titular panda must fight not only to save China, but to find out who he truly is. This becomes easier said then done through a series of kung fu mishaps that provides some laughs. It also provides a story surprisingly darker than the first, but it's exactly the plot's darker turn that gives it more depth.<br/><br/>The first film shows Po, the panda, being raised by a goose. It's obvious they're not really related, but we don't really don't touch base with that until this film. It's in no way, shape, or form a new concept, but I get why it took 2 films to explain such deep roots about what happened to his parents. Furthermore, I get how Po got to where he was, from the attack on his birth village to being raised by a goose to becoming a kung fu warrior. It all works in Po's favor and makes me care for Po. This will mean that whatever happens next, Po is past character development. He is fleshed out and he becomes a very likable protagonist and hero.<br/><br/>I can't say the same for anyone else. I still care nothing for any of the Furious 5. Maybe the spin-offs might give more tiny details, but since I don't watch those, I am forced to look only at the context of the movie. Other than Tigress, the Furious 5 were pretty much nonexistent for me in the film, and even with Tigress, who Angelina Jolie again lends her voice to, I only see her tough persona turning into a kind of mother figure that has been done before and/or better. Master Shifu is a fine supporting character, but I won't remember his right away either, and neither will I be too quick to remember most of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The villain is really unlikable, which is good since I end up rooting for Po that much more. That being said, he does have a story of his own and it adds to the plot to give it purpose. Because of this, it makes his fights against Po that much more meaningful.<br/><br/>The character animation stays true to its predecessor, but the flashback animations is nothing to scoff at either. Babies are supposed to be cute, and baby pandas are no exception to the rule. Thankfully this was remembered when creating the final product and it not only made Po look adorable as a panda cub, but gave this new side of its animation flesh when mixing with the darker parts of the story. In turn, this movie explains a lot of the Kung Fu Panda universe, making it not just an obligatory movie sequel to rake in cash, but also necessary to really get what Kung Fu Panda is about.<br/><br/>Overall, despite feeling left behind with some of the characters, this movie works in ways it needs to and I am satisfied with the result. A great film for families who live a more comedic lifestyle, but also want more understanding in relation to the characters."

","This is a Dreamworks' animated sequel to ""Kung Fu Panda,"" a story about noodle-shop worker-turned Dragon Warrior Po Ping, a giant panda. He joins elite Kung-Fu group the legendary Furious Five -- Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey -- in protecting his home and the Valley of Peace. However, Po and the Furious Five learn that the treacherous Lord Shen of Gongman City is threatening the valley with a new weapon that threatens to end Kung Fu. While battling memory flashbacks of Lord Shen, Po attempt to stop Shen and learn the truth about his past. <br/><br/>Like its prequel, the film has the action, tense and adventure of any martial arts-themed movie. The laugh-out-loud comedy and humor continue as well, mixed in with a memorable cast of characters provided by an all-star voice cast by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and James Hong. New to the cast are Gary Oldman, Michelle Yeoh, Dennis Haysbert, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Victor Garber. Oldman gave a menacing, dark and crafty voice performance for Lord Shen and Yeoh gave a motherly, yet wise and eloquent voice portrayal of Soothsayer. <br/><br/>Like its prequel, this movie's animation and visual effects capture the many beautiful characteristics of China including Shen's magnificent pagoda tower and the boat where the climactic battle takes place. Jennifer Yuh did a great job directing a movie with courage and power, but with darker tones than the previous film. The writing team of Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger provided another daring story with enough action and adventure to keep the movie exciting, but with a darker and suspenseful subplot that gives the film an intrigue twist. And, Composers John Powell and Hans Zimmer provided another brilliant music score, with beautiful Chinese-style music accompaniment.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this is one of the best animated film sequels that stands well on its own - fun and terrific for the entire family.<br/><br/>Grade A"

","Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animated films of all time. Everything about from its characters to its animation to its story was great. When they announced a sequel, I didn't know how it can top the first one. But to my surprise, it did.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 has doubled the action, doubled the comedy, and even doubled the drama. The animation really makes the film powerful with its drama and action. Po's journey as a hero and his inner struggles are great. The villain, played by Gary Oldman, is very sinister and you can see that this peacock is no joke.<br/><br/>Not only is Kung Fu Panda 2 one of the best animated films I have ever seen, but it is one of the best sequels ever made. My only downside was that the movie was released the same weekend as The Hangover Part 2, in which everybody went to go see and everybody hated it. Also, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a much better film than Cars 2, because unlike the Hangover Part 2 and Cars 2, Kung Fu Panda 2 isn't a repeat of the first film. It continues on with the story and I can't wait for Kung Fu Panda 3."

","Let me start by saying that while i enjoyed the first Kung Fu Panda (7/10), i cant say its a classic or a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Having said that i was expecting the second part to be a way to milk the cow and make as much money as possible. I was totally wrong!<br/><br/>The second one manages to keep the quality and in my opinion even improves compared to the first one. Kudos to Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger for delivering a good script.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman shows how important the voice actor can be. He gives the villain so much charisma.<br/><br/>That cant be said for the rest of the cast... while Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman deliver solid performances, the rest of the cast seems to put in no effort at all and it feels like they are just doing it for the money. On the other hand the producing company seems only to hire them to put some big names on the poster.<br/><br/>Anyway this was a really good movie and even though its not a masterpiece, it entertained me enough to make me want to see the third part of the series."

","Jennifer Yuh's sequel is just as charming and funny as the first one. It does feel a bit too 'American' but fun nonetheless. Po returns with his gang, this time to rescue Kung Fu. However, in his quest, he is confronted by a secret from his past. Most of the splendid characters from the first movie, including Shifu (voiced superbly by Dustin Hoffman), are back. The lively characters are given hilarious lines (with adult humour) which certainly makes this entertaining for adults and children.<br/><br/>The animation is quite detailed and colourful. The motions still give away the 'CGI-ness' but that doesn't stand in the way of enjoying it. The handdrawn flashback sequences were great. The story is stronger and deeper than in the first film and it does echo a lot of historical events such as the fading away of Kung Fu after the introduction of weapons (such as guns and cannons). It is also darker than its prequel as themes of revenge, war, death and forgiveness are developed into the story but at the same time, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' manages to stay suitable enough for children. Moreover, there are some cool action sequences that are amusing to watch.<br/><br/>But, I still haven't figured out how they managed to chain Viper. Overall, 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is an exception to the statement that sequels don't live up to the first film. 'Am curious about how the third movie will go as near the end, there's an indicator. I just hope the makers keep up with the brilliance of its predecessors."

","Don't get me wrong, I loved the first one just as much as the next person. However, it is rare to find a sequel that boasts to be just as good if not better than the original, and this is one of those rare films. This one takes you behind the story of how Po came to be who he is, and I loved that concept. They took all the great elements of the first and emphasized them in this one, which is a smart move...the only thing missing was the ""skidoosh!"" and that is a shame. They gave every character a little more. Even Tigress, who barely had any lines in the first, had a bigger role in this one. The action was greater, the villain was greater, and the story was greater. To top it off, the very final scene before the credits caused me to burst into tears of excitement! I really hope they make a third because I am dying to see them play on that scene!"

But when the sequel came out, I didn't have much interest in seeing it because so often sequels aren't very good. Once again, I was wrong. <br/><br/>Since the plot of the first movie was, klutz who learns to be spectacular, the writers had a choice between trying to recreate that, as some writers do (either by introducing a new klutz character or by somehow reducing the star), but this movie takes the more intelligent approach of continuing the character arc. Po is still a goofy panda, but he is also a fantastic fighter who along with his fellow animals is immediately shown in impressive, exciting action. <br/><br/>The animation is terrific, with humorous fights and foreboding enemy strongholds. The bad guy is appropriately nasty and quick, and the movie tosses in quick, never soggy moments of emotion. <br/><br/>I will be less hesitant to watch the next film in the series."

","Seems like we have another case of SEQUEL-itis this summer, and most of them are garbage. <br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 dares to shake that trend, and succeeds and improves upon its predecessor in every way. Some may deem it childish, but this is an animated film with polish and directed with such expertise that is rarely found in animated films (nothing comes to mind except the recent RANGO and Toy Story 3). <br/><br/>The AWESOME(ness): Fantastic casting and voices. This movie would be nothing without the voice of Jack Black. Other characters are great though. Amazing action for a kid's movie. The first film had action for more a comedic affect, but this time around huge set pieces drive forward huge brawls and battles. The fights are also extremely well choreographed and I never was confused about what was going on. Visually stellar. Animation has come a long way and this is the movie to further justify the credibility of the team at Dreamworks. The animation is smooth, and the visual effects are stark and vibrant, and colors pop off of the screen. Also, the 3D is fantastic, serving more as an extra layer of depth rather than cheesy Spy Kids pop-out effects. The soundtrack and sound mixing is also fantastic. Great story and overall sequel. With an original film that was so well received how do you make a great sequel? By answering those lingering questions and throwing a ton of action right at the viewer. Don't worry, it still has that Jack Black brand humor. And it's excellent. <br/><br/>The Bad: The pacing of the entire film is very fast, and at a runtime of only 80 minutes, it's over surprisingly quick. I would've liked to see more character development here and there, and a break from the action sequences, but then this movie would lose its charm. It's so blitz paced, making Kung Fu Panda 2 incredibly entertaining, but also making me hungry for more substance.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 is just a great sequel. It's fast, surprisingly action packed, filled with hilarious situational humor, and tells a wonderful, if a little too fast paced, story and is visually stellar.<br/><br/>It is easily the one of the better sequels Dreamworks has ever dished out, and is a must see if you are a fan of the original."

In this worthy sequel, the call is clear for The Dragon Warrior's skills as China is faced with a new threat. With a joyful spirit and an active appetite, it is of great news that Po is ready for another adventure. Foes should be fearful. Once they hear the first echo of a rumbling stomach, they should start running away.<br/><br/>A new villain rises as Lord Shen, a depraved peacock, plots to end kung fu and take control of China. He has created a special mechanism that shoots fiery balls of fire and metal. So in short, he has made a very powerful cannon. Lord Shen comes off as a more dangerous villain than the one in the first installment because he is accompanied by a vast army of wolves. The structure of the animal kingdom here is interesting in a way that a peacock is able to command these wolves without ending up as breakfast. I guess this is okay, since it would be harder to imagine an evil wolf in charge of a legion of peacocks.<br/><br/>Anyway, while Lord Shen is busy constructing ammo for his weapons, Po is advised by Master Shifu to learn inner peace. But Po is distracted by involuntary flashes from his past, making him wonder about his true origins. Only now does Po really think about how he, a panda, could be fathered by Mr. Ping, a goose.

"japamo","8","0","1","26 June 2012"," Kung Fu Panda 2 - The Quest for Balance (or Yin and Yang, if You Like)
","Most of Dreamworks's animated efforts have complacently settled for being rousing, diverting, and knowingly satirical action-and-violence stories, but not especially memorable (thinking about Shark Tale, for example). Occasionally, some of their movies leaven all the crazy action and movement with important themes, like the meaning of isolation and innate virtue and love in the Shrek movies. However, at the pinnacle of Dreamworks's animated features is one that poignantly delves into the character of a seemingly silly, corpulent, and superficial panda who somehow possesses devastating martial arts skills. Yes, Kung Fu Panda 2 (hereafter KFP2) has all the action, color, adventure, and conflict of its lesser Dreamworks cousins, but it is also profoundly different. Besides being a chop-socky martial arts adventure for the kiddies, KFP2 offers food for thought for more mature viewers, namely, the importance of balance (or yes, master, yin and yang) for a full and healthy life.<br/><br/>At the beginning of KFP2, it appears that the panda, Po (voice of Jack Black), has that full and healthy life. He is now the accomplished dragon warrior and leader of kung fu wizards the Furious Five, and has the respect and admiration of his sensei Master Shifu (voice of Dustin Hoffman), and the loving supervision of his restaurateur father Ping (voice of James Hong). But in the Furious Five's latest mission to prevent a horde of wolves from looting metal from a local village, Po's confrontation with the Boss Wolf (voice of Danny McBride) triggers a disturbing memory that knocks him off his stride and lets the wolves get away. As the usually cheerful Po solemnly ponders these memories which seem to show a wolf attack on a village and two parent pandas leaving their baby behind, those memories intertwine with the machinations of the latest garden-variety megalomaniac, Lord Shen (voice of Gary Oldman). Shen is a colorless peacock who, partly fueled by resentment against parents he sees as stifling, wishes to conquer China and perhaps the world. Although adept at kung fu, Shen plans to use weapons and artillery to attack, hence the minion wolves' metal raid. Thus, if we are careful, we see both the main protagonist and antagonist (Po and Shen) as ""unbalanced"" individuals seeking to stabilize themselves. The genius of KFP2 is its demonstration that, in a way, each needs the other for balance.<br/><br/>Nagging at the back of Po's mind is the realization that Ping cannot be his true father. But as his dreams gradually show, HE was that baby panda abandoned by his parents in the radish box as the wolves attacked. That box gradually made its way to Ping's shop. Since Po's parents did not arrive to claim the child, Ping raised Po as his own, with the usual frustrations and complications. Po is grateful to Ping, but he is out of balance because he can't understand why his parents would leave him. A calm, unperturbed, ram seer (voice of Michelle Yeoh) eventually shows Po that Shen instigated the attack on his parents' village and that they had to abandon him for his own safety. But instead of easing his mind, this knowledge awakens feelings of vengeance against Shen and unbalances Po further.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the ram seer nominally works for Shen and constantly reminds him that a force of black and white (i.e. panda Po) will be his undoing and that he should refrain from his conquest. Shen petulantly and arrogantly refuses to listen. Who - Po or Shen - will embrace balance and, by association, inner peace as exemplified by Master Shifu? The ram seer advises Po not to obsess on the past but to improve on and develop the present and future. You know, let it go, and go on. Does Po listen? You will see when you witness the climactic confrontation between Po and the Furious Five, and Shen's armed armada sailing down the river to the sea.<br/><br/>KFP2 is an astoundingly towering tour-de-force. It takes the standard worn-out martial arts trope, and balances it with respect of ancient Chinese geography, architecture, and philosophy. It shows ALL its anthropomorphic characters with multifaceted, sometimes opposite, characteristics (serious and playful) striving to keep them working together. Finally, KFP2 shows us that balanced inner peace is one of humanity's greatest gifts, symbolized by the familiar black and white yin and yang symbol. Po is of course black and white. Does he eventually symbolize that peaceful yin and yang? Again, watch the climactic battle, and you will definitely find out.<br/><br/>With this consoling philosophy, KFP2 is a considerable, Pixar-level production, and promises to continue to do so with its sequel-hinting final shot, which promises more conflict but also more consolation for Po."

","You know how tough it can be to follow up a truly well-done movie, especially an animated one. I think Kung Fu Panda 2 surpasses the original, and it's because it introduces some heretofore unseen layers of Po while combining some contrasting animation styles. It's expertly directed by Jennifer Yuh and features the returning voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and others.<br/><br/>In this installment, the Dragon Warrior panda Po (Black) is now teamed with the Furious Five, defending the town from evil doers. Exposition tells us of the banished son of the old king and queen, peacocks, who became prideful and menacing, and now he's back to avenge his parents' treatment of him and to take over China - and, by extension, the world. This son, Shen (Gary Oldman) plans to do this by using fireworks as weapons to usher out the era of kung fu. Meanwhile, Po comes to realize that he is not the natural son of his father, the goose (James Hong). Don't ask why this is news.<br/><br/>During flashbacks, we get to see what tiny snippets of Po's childhood emerge in his subconscious. He was placed by his mother in a pot of radishes and found by Mr. Ping (Hong). But why was he left there? What happened to his parents? Does Shen hold some of the answers? Probably. For - not a spoiler - it has been foretold that Shen will be defeated by a black-and-white warrior, by the local soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh). Shen knows this, Po does not. <br/><br/>So much to like about this movie. In those flashbacks, Yuh uses an entirely different style of animation, mostly black and white, to underline the intensity of the scenes. It's reminiscent of the O-Ren Ishii's flashback scenes in Kill Bill, come to think of it. Dazzling and detailed, these scenes are emotional and provocative. A little more than you'd expect from a kids' film, but trust me when I say that the scenes are well done and by no means dwell on violence. They're tense, but not truly intense.<br/><br/>Po himself takes on a role exuding more confidence and leadership. He's not just a bumbling panda this time around. He is a little quicker, a little smarter, although just as unwieldy and ungainly. He lends the team both clear vision and witty repartee. Although he's just as big as ever, he's become more agile and more thoughtful, more inclined to listen to Master Shifu (Hoffman) and Tigress (Jolie) than before. This makes the action scenes - and there are some terrific ones - honestly compelling.<br/><br/>It's nice to see everyone resuming their old roles, even if actors like David Cross, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu get short shrift (someone has to). It's Po's story. Importantly, I never felt as if this was an example of stunt casting, as each actor seems to be fitting for his or her role. <br/><br/>Be warned, though - the movie, like most animated films, does have its hankie moments. Here, they come at the very end, and they are as beautiful and touching as the rest of the film is charming and invigorating. The denouement offers a fitting coda for this masterful film."

","Kung Fu Panda was a critical and commercial success in 2008, making over $630 Million worldwide and was very popular in the lucrative Chinese and Asian markets. It was considered a return to form for Dreamworks and of course with all these factors a sequel was inevitable. And you know what, Kung Fu Panda 2 is just as good as the original.<br/><br/>In Gongmen City in ancient China the peacocks rule a peaceful and prosperous land and bring joy with their invention fireworks. But the heir to the throne Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) wants to use fireworks as a weapon to conquer China. A soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) warns that Shen will be defended by a ""black-and-white"" warrior and he leads his army commit genocide (you know for kids) against the panda village. Yet one baby panda survives.<br/><br/>Po (Jack Black) continues as the Dragon Warrior and protects the Valley of Peace from bandits and pirates with the Furious Fives. But Shen returns to Gongmen City with a new weapon that can defend kung fu. As Po and co set out to stop the most powerful peacock imaginable Po stars to have memories of his past and wants to know what happened to him.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 continues what works in the original film, excellent action sequences that are quick, fluid and easy to follow because of the camera movements which follows fights, lots of well done slapstick and visual gags and a few funny lines and clever plays. The story is a little darker then the original film but that is why it has a PG rating.<br/><br/>The animation is wonderful as you would expect from a Dreamworks production. The CGI is detailed from the hair, to the Chinese buildings and everything you can think of. It is a fast and fluid and some of the creations were very creative, particularly Shen with his eyebrows, his metal claws and use of small knives. Baby Po was a very cute. As well as the CGI Kung Fu Panda 2 has two other styles of animation, a very well made old fashioned paper animation for the prologue giving the start a story book look like the first two Shrek films and still very creative and the other was using traditional 2D animation for the flashbacks which is fitting for the setting and it is great to see director Jennifer Yuh Nelson incorporates these different styles into an entertaining action film.<br/><br/>The voice cast is solid as expect, the highlights being Black and Oldman. Black because of his earnest performance and being a natural comedian and Oldman because of his deadly sinister and serious delivery, making him a compelling, power-hungry villain.<br/><br/>Some have stated that the sequel follows the formula of the first film. Whilst the need to find inter-peace is similar to first film and the heroes have to stop a big lethal bad guy Kung Fu Panda 2 is more of an adventure as the heroes are forced on a journey and liberate a city. It is different enough to be its own adventure and felt like it actually continued the story. Lets hope Dreamworks does not stuff up the third film like they did with Shrek the Third.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very fun family film that is in keeping with its Chinese influences because of its art style and music and with the likes of How to Train Your Dragon shows what Dreamworks can do without the need to rely on pop-cultural references. It is a fast paced action film with plenty of jokes.<br/><br/>A solid 4 out of 5."

","I was one of the many fans of the first 'Kung Fu Panda' movie. It was an entertaining piece of animation, and the action was quite enjoyable for an entire family. Now, DreamWorks Animation has brought us ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". The sequel now brings some action-packed fight scenes, and some exciting new characters. The film brings us back to the tale of the Dragon Warrior, Po, portrayed by Jack Black, who has spent the rest of his life as the Dragon Warrior, learning the sacred teachings of Master Shifu, and fighting crime with the Furious Five (Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Crane, Mantis). Now, a villainous peacock named Emperor Shen, voiced by Gary Oldman, has been planning revenge to the land of China, and has created a deadly weapon that could destroy China, and the existence of kung-fu. But while Po and the Furious Five must team up to defeat Shen, Po faces problems of his own, by trying to understand his origin, who he really is, where did he really come from, who were his real parents, and how did he live with a long-necked goose for a father. Then we have our movie, and it's awesome! From start to finish, this movie is entertaining as hell. The voice talent is just super, since the ensemble from the previous film has returned, such as Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Jackie Chan. Now, there's Gary Oldman, who's one of the most perfect actors to play villains in the history of cinema. He resembles the previous villain, Tai Lung, perfectly. You really love to hate this guy, and he delivers the role in such a powerful way. The animation is gorgeous, the humor is hilarious, and the heart of this movie made me cry of joy. Also, the fight scenes are both exciting and family-friendly, and we also receive some interesting character development on Po's character, and the movie perfectly reveals his origin. But, the ending of the movie will make audiences go ""wow"". But it mostly means that a ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" may be in session. Fun characters, great storyline, terrific animation, and incredible fight scenes. What a family-friendly piece of entertainment. Go check it out with your kids, they will love it, and so will you. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"", in my review, ""family-friendly action, funny and moving""."
"strawhat_sylar","8","0","1","20 March 2012"," A Very Amped Up Sequel that may even top the Original!!!
","Here's my review of the Movie Kun-Fu Panda 2.<br/><br/>First I think the movie is very good and does a great job at expanding and detailing more of Po's world. Though it is not a perfect movie there are some ""bleehh!!!""-moments that keeps repeating that certainly degrades it in some way, Kung-Fu Panda 2 is a nice movie for kids and kids at heart that likes to watch Kung-Fu movie.<br/><br/>Let's start with Po and the revealing of his origins in this movie. Since i have watched the first film way back in 2007 I know in my gut that they would explore the possibility of Po being an adopted child, I mean duh?! his father's a duck and he's a freakin panda. Not only does the film cleverly uses this plot string as the base story,they also made it much meater by adding elements that enchanced it and would set the bar high for the 3rd film. Another great thing about this movie is not a PO movie alone...since most of the first film focused so much on Po,every one of the furious five got their dreamed airtime. The Action Kung-Fu scenes did NOT disappoint , since they had a true kung-fu choregrapher as always the action scence's are very bad-ass: whether it's the dragon warrior fighting side-by-side with the furious five ; The final battle between Po and Co. Vs. their Adversary(which i will not name for spoiler purposes.) that really is pure awesomeness; the action clearly delivered more than the comedy. Po's search of ""inner peace"" is a great sub-plot the co-incised with Po's past and origins and made it the key in defeating their Adversary to became on of the most powerful kung-fu master.<br/><br/>...The ""bleeh""-moments I'm talking about are the (for me it is) extensive flashback of Po's mom leaving him again and again, Is it really so hard for a child(watching the movie.) to understand this that they have to repeat it every time he see' a certain character. *cough cough a wolf that helped killed their family* One of the other setback is the movie ditching some of it's comedic moments(which is sooo much fewer compared to the first one ) to make way for a more mature and serious story."
"artistgp","8","0","1","10 March 2012"," Surprisingly Excellent
","I was quite surprised to watch this film and discover that it was full of hidden jewels. There was some very interesting ""camera work"" as well as various nice montages though out the film. There was also a very nice mix of different styles of animation. The paper cut out puppet segments of the film were wonderful.<br/><br/>That being said, my favorite part of the film was the relationship between the lead character and his father. For an animated film they truly tugged on the heart strings. I must also add that the subtle acting in the faces of the characters was incredibly well done by the animators.<br/><br/>You should definitely check out this film if you're even the least bit curious."
"robert-710-767167","6","0","1","8 March 2012"," It was okay, but I smell sequels
","The second installment of Kung Fu Panda 2 was okay. No real new characters, nothing totally exciting. The normal gags and jokes were increased twice in this movie. The story was pretty much the same, only with a new enemy. I do admit that i felt some nostalgia when the 2d drawings of the panda in the past were played, as it felt like everyone's happy childhood from the past. There was a lot of nostalgia during those scenes.<br/><br/>The ending was pretty much predictable, which was disappointing. I was impressed with the inner peace scene near the end.<br/><br/>Of course the kicker is the obvious smell of a sequel with the last scene in the movie. Which started to kick a little bit of nostalgia, however I'm sure if there's a third one it won't be in theaters for a few years.<br/><br/>And does the panda seem to have a crush on the tiger?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll rate this 6/10."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","2 March 2012"," Less clever and funny, but a visual improvement and contains the same heart
","Animated sequels have yet to disprove that timeless adage about movie sequels, but they're giving it a real go. DreamWorks Animation hasn't always gotten the formula right (the ""Shrek"" movies got worse and worse), but even ""Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa"" had entertainment to offer. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" marks the studio's third try at extending a franchise, and from a production quality standpoint its their best effort to do so.<br/><br/>No, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" doesn't outdo the original, especially not in terms of humor, but it improves on the visual mastery of the first, which was strong to begin with. The action sequences in particular still have no rival to this series. Director Jennifer Yuh stays true to the winning combination of action, character development and heart that made the 2008 original a success.<br/><br/>The story works well, but its predictability holds the film back. The original offered a lot of surprises in telling the story of a fat and lazy panda who learned he could be great if he put his mind to it. In this movie, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) tasks Po (Jack Black) with another seemingly impossible mission, one in which the film's narrated introduction sequence already foreshadows his success. Sure, kids won't know the difference, but it zaps the film of any excitement for the rest of us.<br/><br/>The story takes Po, the now infamous Dragon Warrior, to Gongman City, where the three kung fu masters that protect the city have been ousted by the villainous peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman). Shen was exiled by his parents — who once ruled China — because he had a fondness for turning fireworks into dangerous projectiles. Years later, he uses these cannons to uphold his new reign, because not even kung fu can stop them. We'll see about that.<br/><br/>The strong voice cast returns for the sequel and delivers. Black has simply become Po at this point he does it so well, and characters such as Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and Po's father Mr. Ping (James Hong) get more of a spotlight, albeit at the expense of everyone else. Oldman makes a terrific addition as the cocky peacock; he demonstrates some lovely dashes of insanity and Shen's facial expressions match it perfectly.<br/><br/>On all accounts, the production value of this series has gone up in this installment. The film moves at a good clip and the action sequences have no shortage of wowing moments. Shen's fighting style is something to behold and the storyboarding of the film's first sequence when the Furious Five defend their home from Shen's wolves does not lack for ingenuity to say the least.<br/><br/>Also at work in the film is a subplot involving where Po came from, as one must imagine he is not literally the son of a noodle-cooking goose. The answer to this mystery becomes clear from the moment the question surfaces. <br/><br/>All the other aspects of the movie satisfy, but Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger's story possesses no creative energy. The choice to go with it was safe. Rather than venture too outside the box, ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" takes the cookie-cutter route. It looks good and it is good, but it doesn't meet the standard raised by its predecessor. Fortunately its dedication to character and heart make it stand taller than your average CGI-animated effort.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Check out my site, moviemusereviews.com"

","Although it certainly did seem that passing the reins over to rookie director Jennifer Yuh was bewildering, but Yuh turned out to be perfect in guiding the sequel and the beloved characters in yet another adventure, with bigger set action pieces, touching dramatic moments, and retaining plenty of humour from the get go. Credit of course must go to writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger in coming up with a natural progression of the story of Po (Jack Black), and filling it with a lot more elements from classic martial arts film formulas such as a jail break involving skilled pugilists in captivity, a pagoda, getting beat down, recovery and recuperation, and the learning of a new, ultimate skill. To think that the worries came from the scribes being responsible for the snooze-fest Monsters Vs Aliens, and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 brings back the A-list voices of Black as Po the Panda, now very much comfortable in his celebrity role of the prophesied Dragon Warrior, and the Furious Five consisting of Angelina Jolie as the no-nonsense, hard hitting Tigress, Seth Rogen as the wisecracking Mantis, David Cross as Crane, Lucy Liu as Viper and the underused Jackie Chan as Monkey, recognizable animals used in distinctive martial arts boxing styles. Also returning are Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu and James Hong as Mr Ping, while joining the fray are Gary Oldman as the chief villain Lord Shen the vain peacock, Michelle Yeoh as The Soothsayer, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc, Dennis Haysbert as Master Oxen and Victor garber as Master Thundering Rhino, the latter three forming some formidable masters of kung fu whose city they're protecting falls under siege."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","1","2 February 2012"," Better than the first? Possibly so!
","Of course it's a rare thing for sequels to be better than the original, especially for animated movies. It's hard to say if this movie is truly a better one than its original predecessor but it at least is on some fronts.<br/><br/>Looking back at it, the first ""Kung Fu Panda"" movie was really one that set up its characters. This movie wastes absolutely no time on that and gets right into the action. Quite literally and it never really ever stops or slows down and I mean this as a positive thing. This is a real action flick, that is filled with some spectacular looking fight scenes, that are well animated and choreographed. <br/><br/>And compared to the first, this movie has also vastly improved visually. You could tell the the animation techniques had been improved over the years (the first movie was released in 2008) and this no longer looks like an in-between movie for Dreamworks, which was perhaps still a bit the case for the first movie.<br/><br/>But it has not improved just visually but it seems that it's more matured as well. And with that I mean its story, characters and comedy. It has very little childish humor and characters in it and it seems that they focused more on the older audience as well this time. It's not simply just a kids movie but it's a great adventure- and action filled movie, which the whole family can enjoy together.<br/><br/>This are most of the things that make this an even better and more enjoyable movie to watch than the first one was already. But there are also some things that are less great about it.<br/><br/>The story unfortunately really isn't that special. I personally feel it could had done with one or two more little side-plots. It could had made things more interesting, since it now mostly is being a very straightforward movie, that follows mainly one main plot line, which was a bit of a simplistic one to begin with.<br/><br/>Also the main villain was a bit lacking. He just never came across as all that threatening, despite the fact that he got voiced by Gary Oldman. Or perhaps it's simply just because a peacock of course doesn't look all that powerful or threatening. No, I definitely still preferred the villain out of the first movie (the snow leopard Tai Lung), who was simply awesome in it.<br/><br/>Oh and I still don't understand why such minor characters had to be voiced by such big stars. It really doesn't matter or impresses much that Dustin Hoffman's, Angelina Jolie's, Jackie Chan's, Seth Rogen's and Lucy Liu's voices are in this movie, since they hardly have any lines at all and their characters might as well just had been voiced by a couple of unknowns and not much would had been all that different about it. But oh well, at least the movie is consistent with this, since this also was probably still the biggest complaint about the first movie, in which mostly the same characters and actors appear.<br/><br/>So in some ways it's better than the first and in others it's worse. But overall it is a more than welcome sequel that more than serves its purpose and is watchable and suitable for basically all ages.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"kdnor2011","8","0","1","31 January 2012"," On Par with the original
","This is a sequel that I can't tell is either better or worse than the original. Now I did really enjoy the first movie, it wasn't perfect, but it was fun, funny, had great animation, good voice acting, and actually had a pretty good story. This film is fun, funny, has great animation (as well as some really good 2D animation sequences, it has great animation, good voice acting, a a story that adds to the original. So what you get is a pretty damn good sequel.<br/><br/>I still am not a big fan of Po, while he did grow on me more in this film I still felt the furious five was better. And thankfully they are in this movie a little bit more than the first one. I did laugh quite a bit, I always had a smile on my face. The animation is great, and unlike other Dreamworks films, it includes quite a bit of 2D animation in it that really looks good. The voices once again are good, Jack Black gives it his all, and the rest of the cast is good, and they let Jackie Chan have more than one line! But the story is really well done here, it adds to the first film, as we find out what happens to Po's parents. I won't spoil it, but the ending actually had me go, ""WOAH!"""

"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","0","1","10 January 2012"," What the first film should have been, a great animated movie
","A couple of years ago during the summer time Kung Fu Panda came out, it was a cute film with a very predictable story. I liked it over all, but I couldn't get into the voices as much and also the story had been done to death. The overweight goofy outcast wants to be with the cool group, he finds out he can but doubts himself but gets with the group when he discovers who he is. The sequel I was thinking I could just wait for the rental which I did and I have to say that I'm disappointed in myself that I didn't see it in the theater. Kung Fu Panda 2 is very original and has some amazing characters as well as some very beautiful animation.<br/><br/>Lord Shen, heir of the peacock clan that ruled Gongmen City in ancient China, sought to harness the power of fireworks as a weapon with which to rule the entire country. When he learned from the court's goat soothsayer that ""a warrior of black-and-white"" would one day defeat him, Shen assumed she was referring to a panda and exterminated much of the panda population to avert the prophecy. Shen's parents were horrified at this atrocity and exiled Shen, who swore revenge. Thirty years later, Po is living his dream as the Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside his friends and fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five, but is told by Master Shifu that he has yet to achieve inner peace. While fighting off a pack of wolf bandits who have been stealing refined metal for Lord Shen, Po is distracted by a symbol on the head wolf's armor, which causes Po to have a flashback of his mother and allows the wolves to escape. The group realizes they must stop Shen from taking over China, but there's more to the story of Po and his parents that Shen knows about and it becomes very personal.<br/><br/>One of the things I loved about this movie was the villain, Shen. He wasn't just a typical bad guy who really had no motive to be bad, but his parents had banned him from his home when they realized that he was bad. You can see the pain I his eyes when they are mentioned around him and could really understand his pain. Plus the animation on him was just beautiful, being a peacock he has some really great weapons with the knives as feathers. Po, despite Jack Black's voice still being a distraction, was really wonderful in the film as well and gives some great laughs. Although there were some moments where I wished they toned down the slap stick a little bit. There were some moments where silence would have worked better to make this a perfect film.<br/><br/>While the film has little flaws here and there, this was still a terrific film just on the story alone. The characters are all likable and the message of the film is very beautiful. To find an inner peace with yourself is very hard, but to let kids know that it's alright to let go of anger was a wonderful message. I loved the way the characters were animated and the fight scenes were just exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend Kung Fu Panda 2, it definitely was what the first film was missing and was what it should have been the first time around. This was a big step up and if they make a third film going in this direction, I'll be the first in line buying a ticket.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Our story begins at a time when the Peacock Clan ruled Gongmen City. The heir to the throne, Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), is informed by a Soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) of a prophecy in which a warrior of black and white will defeat him. Shen, believing he could outsmart the prophecy, oversees the slaughter of all pandas. Discovering what their son has done, Shen's parents banish him from the City.<br/><br/>Many years pass, The Dragon Warrior Po (Jack Black) along with the Furious Five, consisting of Tigress (Angelina Jolie); Mantis (Seth Rogan); Monkey (Jackie Chan); Crane (David Cross); and Viper (Lucy Liu), have become the protectors of the Valley of Peace. As Shen plans to retake Gongmen City, using a powerful new weapon, orders his henchmen to steal all the metal from the surrounding areas. A pack of bandits invade the Valley and meet resistance from our heroes. Po, spotting a symbol on the armor of one of the bandits, has flashbacks to his youth with his real parents. Po and the Five, in hopes of saving all of China, travel to the Gongmen city; however Po's journey includes one of self importance as he hopes to discover where he came from, and to achieve the inner peace he so desires.<br/><br/>Dreamworks Animation has come a very long way since Shrek. In earlier years there were too many adult innuendos incorporated into their movies. Although the films were entertaining, parents were presented with a level of discomfort when allowing their younger children to view such films. The same cannot be said for Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and Kung Fu Panda. These movies are enjoyable by children of all ages, and adults alike. The innuendos are gone, and replaced by wholesome stories, beautiful backgrounds, and wonderful characters that are easy to relate too, and learn from. Kung Fu Panda 2 continues this trend with a welcome addition to the story of Po and the Furious Five. The comedic style and warmth that Jack Black brings to Po makes the character lovable and innocent. Gary Oldman is perfectly cast as the evil Lord Shen, bringing a welcome nastiness.<br/><br/>My seven year old son and I viewed the movie in 3D enjoying the experience immensely. Although the 3D glasses darken the brightness of the film, the picture jumps off the screen. I believe the animation is more enjoyable when viewed in 3D (not necessarily IMAX). Kung Fu Panda 2 is filled with martial-arts action and is a throwback to the old kung-fu movies I watched with my own father as a kid. My only hope is that Dreamworks continues to make more movies of this quality so I can continue to enjoy these experiences together with my own children.<br/><br/>Summer Movie Grade: A <br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

While Pixar has not to be too afraid yet, another animation studios have proved they can put out great animated movies too.<br/><br/>While the Panda probably won't get an ""animated"" Oscar (and I'm sure it won't go to Pixar either, no offense against Cars 2), this shouldn't be the way this movie is judged.

","It is hard to believe that it has been 3 years since I saw the first one, ""Kung Fu Panda."" I just reviewed my comments from that earlier movie and see that it was not explained how a Panda came to have a goose as a father. This movie covers that quite nicely, as it fits into the story. Plus, it ends with Po's biological Panda dad realizing that his son lives, and I imagine that will set up part of the story in ""Kung Fu Panda 3."" That remains to be seen.<br/><br/>Also as I commented 3 years earlier, the animation is just eye-popping, the detail and the movement of both characters and their layers of costumes. <br/><br/>Jack Black of course is back voicing Po, and a new menace has arisen to threaten the very existence of ancient China. That menace is aptly voiced by Gary Oldman as the peacock Shen. Angelina Jolie again is the voice of Tigress, and Dustin Hoffman is the voice of the old master, Shifu.<br/><br/>The story isn't easy to explain so I will not try. However it involves Shen getting lots of metals to make very destructive canons, and Po, Tigress, and the others thwarting their plans. <br/><br/>And we do find out, as a baby Panda Po had to be abandoned for his own survival and Mr Goose found him and raised him, an adopted son."

Po and the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, and Viper) must find a way to stop the evil Lord Shen from taking over China once and for all with all the skill and awesomeness they have.<br/><br/>It's great to see the old gang come back like Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui, etc. Likewise, we have an all new group of actors coming into the fray: Gary Oldman (Lord Shen), Michelle Yeoh (Soothsayer), Jean-Claude Van Damme (Master Croc), etc. There's a lot more action going on and it's pretty intense. The jokes are still a load of fun, guaranteed to make you laugh at least a few times. The story is actually more complex and a little darker than what we're used to from these kinds of movies, with emotions from some the characters being conveyed quite well.<br/><br/>Lord Shen has become one of my favorite movie villains of all time, being fairly complex and having a deadly combination of both brawn and brain. Being an albino peacock makes him seem like an unlikely threat, which helps to hide his sinister nature. What makes even more great is his connection with Po, which is something that is sure to shake things up a little bit and raise the stakes for our heroes.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see characters like Master Croc have a bigger role in the plot, but there's nothing I can do. Overall, this is one of those sequels that surpasses the originals. Wonderfully done and I look forward to more sequels. Check it out. Skidoosh!"

","Kung Fu Panda 2 reunites the audience with Po Ping (Jack Black), the tubby and somewhat lazy panda bear who has been named the fabled Dragon Warrior. He still has much to learn, however, and Po's teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) spends most of his time trying to make Po understand the concept of inner peace. Things take a bad turn when Shen (Gary Oldman), an evil and power hungry peacock who was banished from the country long ago, returns to his former kingdom in the possession of a diabolical weapon. Po and his team are tasked with ending Shen's reign of terror before he can take over the whole of China but as their battle unfolds, Po is faced with the realization that this is a much more personal fight than he ever could have imagined.<br/><br/>I didn't see the first Kung Fu Panda until a couple of years after it was released. Looking back, I'm not sure why I chose to stay away because I really enjoyed it. It isn't up to the level of Pixar, of course, but then again, that is an unfair standard to hold any film up against, let alone a kid's movie. KFP is pure, unadulterated fun and contains just enough brains to make the storyline run smoothly. This sequel picks up right where the original left off and the two films work together in almost perfect harmony. KFP2 jumps directly into the action and it doesn't let off the gas very often, exactly what you need to keep the attention of the kiddos while simultaneously preventing adults from finding issues to nitpick at. It's one of those films that would become tiresome if it was even ten minutes longer but at 91 minutes, there's nothing to complain about. This is a very lively film and (I would imagine purposefully) a bit reminiscent of the better elements of a Bruce Lee flick, only if Bruce Lee was funny and a bit overweight. <br/><br/>KFP2 has an outstanding collection of talented voice actors, ranging from Angelina Jolie to Seth Rogen to Jackie Chan and director Jennifer Yuh uses them well. I've said this before but one of my pet peeves in an animated film is when a character (or characters) is relegated to second fiddle behind the actor providing the voice. I don't want a constant reminder that ""actor X"" is the face behind the drawing. I never had that issue here. In the back of my mind, I knew that the praying mantis is actually Seth Rogen but it wasn't constantly shoved in my face. And then there's Gary Oldman, of course, who brings a brilliant, villainous tone to the role of Shen. I've often said that if you want to make your film better, just add Gary Oldman and you're done. Shen is a more intimidating baddie than you could reasonably expect from this movie and an improvement over the villain in the first Kung Fu Panda. <br/><br/>The area in which KFP2 sets itself apart from the average kiddie movie is in the sheer beauty of its animation. This is a gorgeous film that mixes sweeping landscapes with exquisitely detailed characters and powerful action sequences. For my money, the Kung Fu Panda franchise is the most visually compelling of the Dreamworks properties and I almost (almost) think it might have been worth seeing in 3D. All told, this is a highly enjoyable and funny movie that should please viewers of all ages. And in a year that is devoid of a strong Pixar entry, I would make the case that this is the best animated film of the year.<br/><br/>Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com and ieatfilms.com"

There is no way of connecting with po in this film, it doesn't seem like he is on a journey you can relate too and the villain, though voiced well, is incomparable to the villain of the first movie.<br/><br/>For me its just big disappointment, and its score on IMDb is ridiculous."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","0","1","24 August 2011"," A nicely made kids film
","A summer of sequels. A weekend of sequels. After enduring The Hangover Part II, I really looked forward to this 3D Sunday matinée. If you've paid attention at all, you know that I love animation. Even something as kid-friendly as Kung-Fu Panda gives me the slightest butterflies of anticipation for what animation marvels I will see.<br/><br/>Animation-wise, KFP 2 served up a pretty impressive palate of animated delights. The intro was a 2D, paper-cutout styled sequence with colorful versions of the film's 3D characters. All the flashbacks were a traditional 2D animated style that accentuated the dreamy/horror feel of Po's mystery-shrouded past. I appreciate 3D animation as much as the next person. Wall-E ranks in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. 3D has its own artistry, but it's so mass-produced, that I don't enjoy the creative aspect as much as the realistic (I could see each individual hair!). I love to see creative 2D sequences integrated into a 3D film.<br/><br/>Enough gushing over technology! As a children's film, the story really revolves around easy-to-grasp themes like loyalty, trying really hard even if you don't want to, doing your homework, and uh genocide? This will be a bit of a spoiler if you have not seen the film, but it's only spoiling the first 5 minutes of the film before the credits. The Nazi White Supremest Peacock, who SHOULD have been voiced by Christopher Waltz but was instead voiced by Gary Oldman, plays a cross between Herod and Hitler when he takes out his wolves and murders all of the pandas in China when it is foretold that he will be defeated by something white and black (and read all over). Kids-in-mind.com, a site that has probably promoted searching for nudity in movies more than it has helped avoid it, lists ""discussion topics"" as adoption, families, friendship, loyalty, misuse of power, working together, Eastern religions, magic, destiny, revenge, healing. Hmm. Missing mass-murder there, fellas. This movie is perfect for queuing up the conversation with little Timmy on why the Jewish kid gets so agitated when he shows up on Halloween wearing his vintage Hitler Youth outfit.<br/><br/>The plot drops in without a lot of character development, since we got all that gobbelty-goop out of the way in the first film, but it does fill in all the missing blanks about Po's past and continues with his personal growth. Overall, it's a nice feel-good movie. Except for the murder, I guess. Pay attention at the end of the film for a nice Zionist tip of the hat.<br/><br/>If you've got kids, or just need to see something easy after watching some terrible R-rated comedy, then head to see this nicely made feature."

","This is probably one of my favorite CGI animated film. It is very close to being good as the original. The story just wasn't as gripping as the original and the development of the characters wasn't as good. But what this sequel does have is way better action, in fact it has more action than the previous movie. Watching this movie was like watching a Americanized CGI anime or something. The build up isn't as great this time, it's okay but not great. But when the action kicks in, you just can't help but be amazed at how creative and entertaining the action sequences are. The main flaw of this movie is the pacing, it just seems kinda off but that is only a very small complaint. This is a movie that kids and adults will enjoy while watching. I had a blast seeing all the awesome fight sequences. This really felt like a legit kung-fu flick that kids can watch and have a blast with. Right after the movie was over I wanted to watch it again to see the action sequences all over again. Yeah some people judge a movie by the plot the most, the plot here is okay. But c'mon it's a CGI animated kung-fu flick and for a kung-fu flick this movie was awesome. I highly recommend anyone that like fighting movies or even CGI animated movies to check this movie out.

It was more of the same fun from the first film but progressed a little bit more with character background, a simple cultural story, and plenty of action. And it wasn't just these points I enjoyed, it was the general 'feel' of the film as a beautifully crafted homage to a few Chinese animated stylings. Voices were once again perfect for each character, with special note towards Gary Oldman and Danny McBride. Music was as fantastical as the animation and really builds the film as an excellent artistically entertaining piece. A superb sequel that other sequels should take note of. I left the theatre feeling both satisfied and elated, wanting just that little more of the film. And yes that does mean I would like to see one more Kung Fu Panda sequel."

","I went in knowing that the first KFP could not be topped. The newness of the concept, the opening fantasy sequence, the Tai Lung escape scene, the clumsy humor of Po, I could go on...no beating it or duplicating it. The sequel doesn't beat it. But it's still very good. And for very different reasons from those that made the original was so awesome. In KFP2 the Furious Five have grown, moved on. They've improved their kung fu. They work as a unit, with a new leader, Po the Dragon Warrior, whom they've fully accepted. The banter between the team is raised to a new level. The rocky relationship between Tigress and Po is replaced by friendship. The action scenes where they're all fighting together are...something not seen in the first movie, actually. The story is excellent, centering on Po's search for his real parents. It's a little bit more intense than the first, with a lot more weapons used than last time. It's just more of an action movie. There were a lot of kids there when I saw it(ages 6-12 I'd guess) and I heard a lot of comments during and after the movie. Universal approval. There will be another in this series. Hopefully we'll see more of Shifu, who only shows up at the beginning and end of '2.'"

The storyline was darker and it was definitely more violent than the first (maybe a little too much for little ones) but I really enjoyed it and laughed out loud and cried more than once. There were just enough clever one-liners for it to be cute without overdoing it, and there was just enough meat to the plot to interest kids and adults without it being boring. I also think Po was less Jack Black as a talking panda and more of a character on his own.

","I wasn't a big fan of the first Kung Fu Panda and found it ultimately boring though I described it as mildly entertaining. I was persuaded to give Kung Fu Panda 2 a try by my friend and to be honest I was willing to give it a go even though I was quite sceptical. But surprise and behold this was a really great sequel to the first, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I felt that much more effort was put into this and a result it is much more entertaining. The story itself was better with more in-depthness about Po's past, the animation was far better visually then the first one with the 3D being quite impressive. The action was choreographed better and more exciting to watch with the voice-over being great from the likes of Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman (Shen), Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen. But Jack Black was the revelation as Po who bought even more charm to his character. However for me Gary Oldman as the voice of Shen the villain Peacock stole the film and was superb and made quite a menacing villain for a kids movie (plus funny too). <br/><br/>Two revelations though that made this sequel a high rating as I gave it of a seven was the fact I came to care more about the characters in this, particularly Po and the fact the script was much wittier than the first with more comedy that was actually really funny at times. The best bit for me though being when Black says as Po as he holds his fist up. ""My fist hunger's for justice."" His stomach then rumbles for hunger and he pauses and says. ""That was my fist"" had me in fits of laughter.<br/><br/>I know I was quite critical of the first one, but I really enjoyed number two and this is a animation the whole family should enjoy. I would happily see this again for enjoyment and hope for the first time there will be a Kung Fu Panda 3.

Firstly, Po is now a bona fide hero and doesn't have to go through the tiresome passage of personal growth which defined the first movie. This time the personal growth element concerns searching for his roots (turns out Mr Ping isn't Po's natural father - who knew?). Plus we have a villain with a nefarious plot, so there is a fair amount of drama and action as well as some heartwarming moments.<br/><br/>This is a pretty good film which the kids will love.<br/><br/>I found that, in common with so many movies these days, the action went so fast that it was difficult to follow.

","In 2008, Dreamworks brought us the marvelous tale of a giant panda who dream nothing more but to do kung fu with his heroes, The Furious Five, and was now accidentally chosen to be the dragon warrior and save china. Since then, everyone love the film. But the question remains; where did Po come from? Why was his dad a goose? Well 3 years later, we finally got our answer in Kung Fu Panda 2. In the latest news of the sequel, a peacock named Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) wanted nothing more but to make his parents proud (much like Tai Lung wanted to please Master Shifu in the first film.) but when a Soothsayer confirmed to his folks that he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white (remind you of anyone?) Shen did all that he can to make sure his future would not happen to him, but as he done the deed of getting rid all of the pandas he could find, Lord Shen was banished, but vow his revenge that he would return.<br/><br/>Now many years later, Po finally gets the chance to learn about his past and finds out why he's at where he is right now as he faces his greatest fear; battling Lord Shen.<br/><br/>I haven't really review that many sequels expect for a couple of bad ones (like Open Season 2 and Open Season 3) but this? This one was very promising! New bad guy means more new action, which means more challenges Po has to take care of (even if he's by his own or not.) It almost stood up as much as the first film did, but it also delivers a very special message; and that message was to let go of the past; no matter how bad it might of been. The flashback scenes were done incredibly beautifully as it brings out much a lot of tear-jerking scenes (think of the ending from Toy Story 3. Did that one made you cry? Cause it did for me.) The music is set wonderfully (though I think it's almost the same similar ones in the original, if you have listen to the soundtrack, but just only half of the tracks don't always sound like they're alike.) And the direction where it took us brought us to an unforgettable adventure.<br/><br/>If you love Kung Fu Panda 1, then don't miss out on seeing the second one because more stories will be told very soon into the future as the years for us passed."

A bit on the scary side for really young age groups and not quite as compelling to older viewers, the movie is still successful overall but lacks the magic of the first. It also leaves the door open for more sequels by its finale. 4 stars out of 5."

But, rather unexpectedly, it IS good fun. Shen - the new baddie, voiced by Gary Oldman, is well-developed and pleasantly sinister (particularly considering he's a damn peacock - who'd've thought?), and the back-story that's gradually presented tying him and Po together is surprisingly dark for a kids' film. It sounds like a trivial point, but I also enjoyed the styling of the flash-backs and narrative sequences too. The other Kung Fu warriors have become sidelined slightly which is a shame, but Mr Ping comes into his own and the little sub-plot about Po's adoption is actually rather sweet.<br/><br/>It's not brilliant, but it's engaging and funny in places.

On top of this, the disgraced peacock prince Lord Shen (Gary Oldman at his intimidating best) has taken over Gongmen City with a deadly weapon that threatens to destroy China and Kung Fu, and if Po and the Furious Five can't stop him, Shen will accomplish his dark goal.<br/><br/>The first Kung Fu Panda was a really good movie. It opened in 2008 to high critical praise, and to become a smash hit at the worldwide box office. Kung Fu Panda 2 improves upon a lot of the first film's traits, but falters in other ways, basically keeping both movies on a nearly even keel.<br/><br/>The movie covers familiar grounds to those who liked the first movie, and you can detect the clichés of other, better animated movies, but the movie makes up for those things in many ways. A common demise for sequels is that they just keep adding more pretty visuals, more action, and more characters, but fails to give the story proper development, thankfully Kung Fu Panda 2 is not a movie that succumbs to that.<br/><br/>It never loses sight of putting heart first, and continues to properly develop character, and explore sides of them never before seen. Another plus is the incredible voice cast, specifically Gary Oldman. But it is worth pointing out that the jokes in this film weren't as funny as the jokes in the first film, and I feel that one or two action sequences had a bit too much slapstick, but those are only minor gripes. I also thought that the film's third act was really exciting.<br/><br/>It may not be perfect, but it's still a decent movie, so I'm gonna give Kung Fu Panda 2 **1/2 out of ****"

","Oh, it's so on. After a less than spectacular beginning to animation and still having the occasional misstep, Dreamworks has put themselves in direct competition with Pixar. While Fox Animation Studios continues to be unsuccessful in their attempts, and with Blue Sky Studios being even worse (they insist on hanging onto the irksome Ice Age franchise), Dreamworks animation has put itself on pace to being nearly as good as Pixar. <br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 is just the latest in a string of great movies from this production studio. With Jack Black leading the cast as Po, the Kung Fu Panda, it was going to be, at the very least, entertaining. It's also proof that a writing ""team,"" as it were, can do a great job. Most cartoons do this with great success. Primary writers Aibel and Berger are also responsible for the Alvin And The Chipmunks stories, so perhaps it's even better they have consultants in the matter. <br/><br/>The character development was top notch. They could have chosen, as plenty do, to keep things status quo, but instead, we area treated to a progression of the characters, and even a look at things to come, should there be another sequel. The characters were likable, as in the first. It allowed for an attachment, and therefore an investment in them, particularly Po, his father, and Master Shifu. They also did a good job in making the villain, Lord Shen, loathsome. <br/><br/>Jack Black had much to do with the success of Po. His Shtick can become tiresome in live action movies, but in Kung Fu Panda 2 he brings Po to life. He gives Po a connection with the audience that few main characters in movies do. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is magnificent as well. Dustin Hoffman didn't have the same screen-time as in the first, but he has a good voice that puts Master Shifu in the spotlight when he's on screen. David Cross and Seth Rogen and also have talent voicing characters. Gary Oldman lends his villainy voice. He is rapidly gaining experience in voicing, now even doing video games. <br/><br/>Director Jennifer Yuh has nearly 2 decades of animation experience in everything from TV to feature films. Her work in Kung Fu Panda 2 is meritorious. She worked on Kung Fu Panda as well, winning awards for storyboarding. I'm not sure how involved Guillermo Del Toro was, but I'd bet he had at least a small amount of input. <br/><br/>I don't watch 3-D movies much anymore, but the 3-D in Kung Fu Panda 2 is supposed to be the best so far. Either way, it's a superb movie and a sequel that can arguable be better than the first.<br/><br/>Visually stunning in 3D, strong cast and a good story about Po finding his true identity. More action than the previous one."
"elephantcat99","8","0","1","24 June 2011"," Wonderful, fun, action-packed and even touching.
","Let me start off by saying that I am not a fan of the first Kung Fu Panda. The villain was cool, the acting was good, and the animation and music was awesome (Dreamworks always seems to manage that). But it was just a plain stupid movie. It really was.<br/><br/>Now, as for the sequel... where do I begin? It was breathtaking.<br/><br/>Lord Shen's story wasn't quite original, but it still was great and it really just made you feel bad for the character, filled with anger and a lust for revenge. But besides his unoriginal story, he was actually a way better villain than Tai Lung. I mean, I like Ian McShane and all, but you can't beat Gary Oldman. The man's a legend. Lord Shen had a creepy, yet almost soothing voice, which matched perfectly with the personality of the white and red peacock. Like all peacocks, he struts and walks gracefully, but can change into a swift, skilled fighter that could quite easily kill you if he wanted. Lord Shen was elegant, insane, pained, hungry for revenge and is a damn good fighter. He's just awesome.<br/><br/>And as for Po's story, it was surprisingly interesting. I'm not going to lie: I came very close to crying when his whole story was revealed. What I had once thought was just a stupid main character for a stupid movie had turned into an actually very well developed character. And I love it when Jack Black does this: Jack Black is pretty much known for playing fat, idiotic heroes. But it's never funny. He tries to be funny, but he just can't pull it off. But this is the Jack Black I love. He actually tries to be serious when he needs to be. And when he does a movie where he actually is serious, even if just for one scene, his comedy is funnier. Po's actions in this movie was, this time, at least chuckle-worthy. Thank you so much, Mr. Black, for not making me want to yank my hair out this time.<br/><br/>And I love how the Furious Five actually got more than two lines each this time. Finally! We got to know the characters' personalities a little bit more!... but just a little bit.<br/><br/>The action... oh my gosh. There was much more action in this one, and it was awesome! Dreamworks, you amaze me with your animation and visuals. It was just... awesome. I don't know how to explain it. The fighting scenes, all of them, were just awesome. I'm usually not a fan of movies with a bunch of fight scenes as they are usually boring and pretty unnecessary, but I loved every moment of the fighting scenes this time.<br/><br/>And as for the visuals of Kung Fu Panda 2...<br/><br/>All I can say is that I think Pixar has some competition.<br/><br/>They were absolutely gorgeous. Breathtaking. Amazing. Stuff like that. It does, on average, take about 2 years to make an animated. This took about 3. But to be honest, it looks like it took longer than that. Everything was very detailed, it was smooth, and even though I don't like the first movie, I've always adored the style of the art. It's not an Asian style, but it's beautiful nonetheless. I really could not believe my eyes. And I simply love the traditional animations that they had every now and again in the film. Those were pretty cool, I must admit.<br/><br/>And this movie (as I believe I said earlier) was FUNNY! There were some parts where I could barely control myself from bursting with laughter. Whenever I see an uneeded sequel, if it wants to be funny, it tries really hard, but it just can't do it. It's pathetic, really. But the humor here was a whole lot better than the first.<br/><br/>Main complaints: Dustin Hoffman, for one thing. Yes, I know he only had a few lines in the movie, and yes, I know he's a good actor, but I just can't stand his voice-over work. In live-action films, he's always great. But whenever he does cartoons, he has no emotion and always seems really uninterested in the project. And the ending was pretty bad. I mean, Po going to see his ""dad"" in the shop, and the two going into the kitchen to make noodles? Okay. Cute ending. I like it. But then suddenly, we see that far over the mountains, there's someone. I was pretty confused, but then the mysterious character turned around.<br/><br/>BAM! Po's real father. And a thriving village of pandas.<br/><br/>And then, the credits. That's it.<br/><br/>What the hell kind of ending is that? Did they really feel the need to put that in there? And do they really need (as it was obvious what they were trying to say) another Kung Fu Panda movie? Are they really going all ""Shrek"" on this thing? But, still, this was an absolutely incredible movie. A rare thing has happened: A sequel is better than the original. I was shocked! Despite it's flaws, it was still great. And now, because it makes me feel special: 8 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>Well done, Dreamworks. Well done."
"sildarmillion","8","0","1","19 June 2011"," Dreamworks is on fire!
","Kung Fu Panda 2 is just as awesome as the more recent Dreamworks masterpieces like Megamind and How to Train Your Dragon, and like Madagascar 2, it by far surpasses the original. <br/><br/>With less focus on slapstick, and more on the story, the characters and the animation, Dreamworks is on a roll. The action sequences had superb animation. They weaved 2D animation in with the 3D when exploring the past; and the especially significant scenes had a great ""epic"" feeling about them, which was perfectly complemented by the brilliant comic timing and witty humor. And the movie was surprisingly touching at times, which was possible this time perhaps because the story involved Po's past and so the events of the movie had a much greater emotional impact on him. It also had a star studded cast, so the voice acting was excellent - especially Gary Oldman's, who played the villain.<br/><br/>I can't believe I was actually debating on whether to go watch this in the theater. I was especially shocked to hear some people actually cried watching it, and that caught my interest. It was a two-and-a-half-hours well spent, and they showed us Baby Po! OMG!"

","Not having seen the first film I'm unable to define how bad or good this one connects to it. From what I do know of it, the lead character is still pretty much the same - thinking with his belly, not completely help- and clueless but almost there, but still a hero. Either way this film starts with an old enemy of Po rearing its ugly head and Po being called in to protect the citizens from him.<br/><br/>Story wise there's nothing too fancy about this film - it's all been done before. It doesn't affect the film negatively though, it's an animation film designed to please kids and their parents and it does that.<br/><br/>Animation wise I must say I was pleased by the colour scheme. It gives a radiant hum. The details in the background are just high enough as well, and the added 3D effects aren't wasted (though they can be missed without missing out on anything of the film).<br/><br/>The character development may go a little over the heads of the kids - but I didn't see any of that bother the kid I had with me. So, all in all, enjoyable for kids and parents.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 Pandas behaving fiercely"

"jon.h.ochiai","9","0","1","10 June 2011"," Let It Flow
","In ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" after an exquisite Wushu display, Shifu (voiced by venerable and irreverent Dustin Hoffman) says to student Po (Jack Black), ""Anything is possible, when you have inner peace."" This belies a certain authenticity. The Founder of Aikido said, ""True victory is victory over oneself."" At the narrative arc, sage Soothsayer, voiced with eloquent gravitas by the amazing Michelle Yeoh, instructs the Kung fu Panda Po, ""Let it flow."" She tells him to let go of his painful stories of the past. In doing so, he has nothing, and everything is possible. She reminds Po that all he has is right now, and the rest of his life. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is whimsically funny in the unexpectedly transformational journey.<br/><br/>The story by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger, and Robert Koo enhances the original ""Kung Fu Panda"". First time Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson captures the essence of the martial arts path from ingenious angles without significance—a smart thing. She seamlessly fuses kung fu choreography and the spirit of the way in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"". I did not see the movie in 3D, though it is visually breathtaking. We see serene mist covered mountain forests, austere castles, and elegantly crafted pagodas.<br/><br/>In the movie's preface, Soothsayer (Yeoh) narrates the story of the ruling Peacock Clan in ancient China. The heir to the Kingdom is the arrogant Shen (ominously dark and wounded Gary Oldman). Prophesy foretells of his defeat by the Black and White chosen one. In a Machiavellian attempt to alter his fate, Shen orders the genocide of the Panda. Abhorred by the bloody actions of their son, Shen's parents banish him from the Kingdom. Shen vows vengeance. But has Shen truly altered fate? <br/><br/>As no surprise and the source of irony in ""Kung Fu Panda"" Mr. Ping (wise and funny James Hong) reveals to Po that he was adopted, somewhat. Given that Mr. Ping is a goose, not a real ""aha"" moment. So Po must discover who he is, physically and spiritually.<br/><br/>Since Po became the Dragon Warrior, profoundly getting that there is no great secret, he leads the Furious Five against all evil doers. However, Po still seems a bit of a goof, not really the Kung fu Master. This may just be the clumsy charm of Jack Black's embodiment. Strong and slender Tigress (sublimely confident Angelina Jolie) is clearly the powerful martial artist. She in fact schools Po in her prowess on occasion. We begin to wonder if, Tigress was really the chosen one, not Po. Jolie is subtle in dialing down Tigress's arrogance and impatience with her leader. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" works in the compassionate partnership of Black and Jolie, and the evil force of Oldman as the merciless Shen. Other members of the Furious Five appear relegated to the background this time around.<br/><br/>In this story, Shen has created a massively powerful weapon that may vanquish Kung fu. So Po must end Shen's path of vengeance and domination. More importantly, Po must discover who he is and find the peace within. Yeoh as Soothsayer is impeccable eloquence assuming the helm for Shifu (Hoffman) as Po's guide in his transformation into mastery. Black is surprising in balancing humility, gravity, and whimsy. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is hilarious, and state of the art CGI animation. What really inspire are the performances of Yeoh and Black, in the story of the hero reconciling the world and finding peace. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" gets it right in this noblest of pursuits."
"faisal_khatib","8","0","1","9 June 2011"," Highly recommended movie to any animation fan because no one else manages to pass humour during a serious scene like Po does.
","Every sequel/trilogy comes with its own dosage of circumspect. Too often have there been brilliant movies ruined by mediocre sequels cashing in on the wave of popularity. While talking about such movies, Shrek comes to mind. But then we do have gems like Toy Story 3 that manage to close the chapter with perfection (with a red bow on top). Fortunately or not, Kung Fu Panda falls somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Po (voiced by Jack Black) is now an integral part of the Furious Five fighting crime (and weight loss) under the supervision of Master 'I am so awesomely calm' Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Po continues to entertain with random enthusiastic phrases and his lack of stamina (he gets carried/pushed quite often) along with his unorthodox 'squishy cuddly' style of kung fu.<br/><br/>With a back story about the villain Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) who desires to conquer the whole of China to get things rolling, the film revolves around how Po must search his muddled past that is scarred by a certain symbol to find out who he is and where he came from while trying to attain inner peace and beat Shen at the same time. A done and dusted formula that honestly always works if carried out the right way, and DreamWorks managed that with aplomb.<br/><br/>Jack Black once again shines as Po with his variable voice tones of ecstasy to sorrow that helps the viewers plunge right into the action. Baby Po is truly adorable in a 'huggable teddy bear' way. Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong) as Po's father was a bit of a surprise adding a lot of heart to the film. The emotional scenes he shared with Po were almost tear-jerkingly good. The other four characters of the Furious Five apart from the Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) are almost missing from the action and dialogues, which is a waste of talents like Jackie Chan (Monkey) and Seth Rogen (Mantis). Master Shifu's role seemed more like a special appearance as he was just featured at beginning and the climax of the film.<br/><br/>With most of the previously adored characters sidelined, you'd be worried if this has become just a one man show. But that wasn't the case because the creators chose to introduce equally interesting new characters. Shen, the evil 'shooting feathers steel clawed' peacock is a beautifully sketched out character with shades of fear of the black and white creature. The fortune teller goat, Soothsayer's (voiced by Michelle Yeoh) funny antics that always kept Shen on the edge were amusing. Master Rhino (voiced by Victor Garber) was a well controlled act with ample support from Master Croc (voice by Jean-Claude Van Damme). It's not often that the evil side kick manages to get noticed but the Wolf Boss (voiced by Danny McBride) manages to stand out with his comical chemistry with Po.<br/><br/>DreamWorks animation is spot on with everything being pixar perfect even in mostly annoying 3D. There are plenty of wide and close shots of both the scenery and the action, giving the viewer the complete picture. The soundtrack is spot on for both the action and the emotional scenes with the first action sequence standing out due to its integration with the action itself.<br/><br/>It's not all a happy story though. Po with his phrases does get a little tedious by the end of the movie and his comic acts a little humdrum. More could have also been done with the rest of the Furious Five characters because they did have abundance of screen time. The story was in comparison to the original was a letdown to be honest even with all the emotions thrown in. And lastly Po looked thinner and that annoyed me for some reason.<br/><br/>Overall, highly recommended movie to any animation fan because no one else manages to pass humor during a serious scene like Po does. *Skadoosh!*"
"Skadoosh11","9","0","2","4 June 2011"," A Sequel With Heart
","To be honest, I've always like the sequel to every single Dreamworks movie that had a sequel more than the original. For example, as much as I loved Shrek, I loved Shrek 2 more. I hated Madagascar but found Madagascar 2 pretty enjoyable to watch. And it's no exception that I actually liked Kung Fu Panda 2 more than Kung Fu Panda (which I thought that although it was good, it was a tad bit overrated).<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 talks about Po (Jack Black) teaming up with the Furious Five to defeat their new enemy, a peacock by the name of Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who created a weapon that could destroy kung fu and the whole of China. The problem now is ""how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?"" That and Po has some daddy issues.<br/><br/>But after watching Kung Fu Panda 2, I realised what makes a sequel so great. Just like Toy Story 2, they never made their characters go to level zero again and learn everything from the start. Po can kick butt right from the beginning of the movie. Like he is a total pro which is very cool since a lot of movies tend to make their main character who the main character was in the first film. Instead, they move on to the next level and answer some unanswered questions in the first film or bring up some new questions for the viewers to ponder over. And, this is by far my favourite sequel out of all the Dreamworks movie in terms of a sequel (I still liked Shrek 2 more). It was a vast improvement of the original in terms of heart, story and visuals.<br/><br/>Po is still as likable as ever. Jack Black did a surprisingly fantastic job at the dramatic scenes. I actually forgave him for that horrid movie that my friend dragged me to watch ""Gulliver's Travel"". I mean, that movie was just terrible! But I learnt that Black is a pretty good actor if given the right script. I enjoyed his presence. He made Po so funny and energetic but so vulnerable at the same time.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman as Lord Shen was as good as I predicted it to be. That man is fantastic in everything he does, that's all I need to say. I found Shen to be a very interesting villain. He has his sad backstory and you feel for him. You don't root for him but he's basically a Tai Lung from the first movie. He's a three-dimensional character and I was appreciate a villain that's 3 dimensional Beside Tigress, the Furious Five didn't have much lines but really loved their team dynamic in this film. Team Furious Five and Po! And Shifu and Mr Ping are as awesome as they are in the previous movie I loved the Tai Lung/Shifu backstory. That was the reason why Shifu was my favourite character in the whole Kung Fu Panda series (even though he made a very brief appearance in this movie). However, though it made me feel for both characters, I never felt the urge to cry. Heart-wrenching as it was, it never pushed your emotions any further. KFP 2 is different. When you find out what happened to Po (though the story was, admittedly, not original), you can't help but feel your heart being punched a thousand times and your tears are just threatening to fall down (and that's not good since I was watching it in 3D, which was superb and I would get on that later on). On the last note on the story's heart, loved Po and Mr Ping's relationship.<br/><br/>Visually, it was.... stunning. I mean, it's Dreamworks. Although they've got a bad record of making terrible movies (which I didn't think were THAT bad), their animation has always been very impressive. And they just keep improving with every single new film. Kung Fu Panda 2 is no exception. 3D: It wasn't dark and it was effective. I recommend 3D but it'll be fine if you don't watch it in 3D too.<br/><br/>Take note, though, that the humour in this movie was not as good as the humour in the first. Mostly because they replaced the humour with heart. Fortunately, this movie is well-balanced out between the humour and the emotional point of the story. And not one part funny and then sad and then funny again.<br/><br/>Now here's a very interesting part to this film: The climax was just... wow. You would expect some big bad explosions with Po fighting off thousands of evil bad guys. But, no. The climax was nothing like that (though he does fight off hundreds of evil bad guys in the film for those who really want to see that happening). The climax was surprisingly.... a character moment. They never tried to do anything big (okay, to a certain extent, i guess it was pretty ""big""). The climax was really all about Po and what he had learnt. And it was really really satisfying. I was just sitting there going, ""Wow.... I LOVE this movie"" And it really proves to me that this movie never tried the ""bigger is better"" ploy. The climax was basically what the whole movie was about: The main character and the emotions that he was struggling with and I really respect the filmmakers for such a wise decision.<br/><br/>And I am really looking forward to the 3rd movie! (but, DW, PLEASE don't make 6 movies unless you have it all planned out like Harry Potter)"

","One of our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics reviewed this, 14-year-old Gabriella Chu from New York. She loved it and thought that kids, ages 8 and up would as well. View her videotaped review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZmOZ4FaCY4<br/><br/>Or read her written review: The Kung Fu Panda is back with more adventure! This movie is an irresistible action comedy that's pure fun. In case you have not watched the first Kung Fu Panda before, the protagonist Po, is a panda who transforms from noodle shop employee to kung fu master joining the Furious Seven (a group of heroes who fight villains.) In this sequel, Po finds himself conflicted with his past. He starts to question where he has come from, and why his father is a goose instead of the panda. He also has to defeat evil Lord Shen, a peacock who plans to use a secret weapon to conquer China and destroy kung fu. Will Po be able to defeat Lord Shen even when conflicted with this past? You will have to watch this movie for yourself!<br/><br/>Watching this movie in 3D felt so life-like, especially the action scenes. There are so many action sequences and they all are very intense. My favorite sequence is the one where Po finds his inner peace because the movie is in slow motion and incorporates scenes of his past as well as scenes from Master Shifu's technique of inner peace. The slow motion emphasized Po's technique, and made the scene much more interesting. I also thought the humorous voice of Po, Jack Black, is perfect for his role as a lively and entertaining panda. The movie also has inspiring messages such as: look to the future instead of the past, and discover who you are. However, I did not think this movie was as good as the first one. I did not find the story as touching and upbeat. I also didn't find the voices of the characters recognizable, except for Po and the Tigress's voice. In addition, the colors of the movie were not very vibrant. They did not fit the comical mood of the movie so much.<br/><br/>Overall though, I think this is a great animated family comedy. I would recommend it to children ages 8 and up because younger kids might not be able to follow the storyline. You should definitely go see this if you are into adventure!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Gabriella Chu, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"

","KUNG FU PANDA 2 marks the return of Po and the Furious Five as they embark on a new adventure to stop a weapon so powerful it threatens the very existence of kung fu itself. Now the Dragon Warrior, Po is tasked with the responsibility of destroying this weapon, before the evil Lord Shen uses it to conquer all of China. <br/><br/>The first KFP was a pleasant and heart-warming surprise for most people, myself among them. To see the film actually respecting the culture they are portraying, and imbue it with multiple levels of philosophy while remaining hilarious and kid-friendly, is a dream come true in this age of trashy movies where money comes before quality and everything else. KFP 2 retains that sincerity, and delves even deeper into the little profound life messages that surpasses it's predecessor in every way.<br/><br/>Po is now enjoying his new life as a hero and a kung fu master, but is suddenly faced with the mystery of his dark past, and must deal with his inner demons as the truth slowly unravels. This leads to the character being far more emotive than in the last outing that affects those around him as well, giving this sequel a tone that is far less bright than it's predecessor. It offers the film a more emotional side as Po's investigation of his heritage and his new hero role causes ripples in his relationship with his Dad, and the father-son relationship serves as a powerful core to Po's inner conflict. His opponent this time, the albino peacock Shen, also contains far more character depth than Tai Lung in the first movie, and his ambitions more sinister and larger in scale. Both creatures of black and white compliment each other perfectly as the paths they choose are destined to meet and determine their eventual fate.<br/><br/>The references to Chinese culture and old kung fu movies are there yet again, with the dumpling fight in the original film succeeded by a terrific battle with Chinese musical instruments, playing to oriental music that evokes a vibe of several movies, Zhang Yimou's Hero among them. The action is fantastic with the Five having their distinctive styles, while Shen's thin limbs, sharp weapons and ferocious feather-blades come in stark contrast with Po's free flowing, soft-over-hard Tai Chi style.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the philosophical content, which I had previously feared would be toned down, gets full blown instead with many layers slid in. Po embarks on a quest to find inner peace, to create harmony within himself and ""let things flow"", as it is revealed that only when one's heart is unclouded with doubt and grudges can one tap into his or her hidden potential and, most importantly, attain true happiness. That is the main powerful message of the film and it is so brilliant in it's simple logic that makes it accessible to all races and religions. There are tons of other references to the theory of yin and yang throughout the movie that made me gasp and impressed with how much work the makers of the film have put in yet again.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2, as expected and anticipated, is touching, full of heart, awe-inspiring at times, hilarious in others, and constantly filled with meaning. It is a film that can entertain and capture a child's imagination, but also tug the heartstrings of adults and give them something joyous to think about when the credits roll. And it made my fist hungry for justice."
"Dallinschmidt89","9","0","2","2 June 2011"," I love Kung Fu!!!
","Star Wars. X-Men. Indiana Jones. Lord of the Rings. Kung Fu Panda. What do all these things have in common? Well probably a lot of things, actually. But here is my point. All of the first films in these franchises were good, if not great, films. But it doesn't end there. Also, in all of these films, the actors came back, having grown into their characters, and delivered a second film that was not only up to par with the first, but also delivered something extra. Story and emotion. In all of these film franchises, the second film carries a powerful message, and strong emotion. Luke and Vader's relationship becomes clear. Wolverine learns of his past. Indy has his life saved by the least likely person imaginable. A small army of men put their lives literally on the line at Helm's Deep to fight the forces of evil.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 is no different. I love Kung Fu Panda. It is one of my favourite films. So I was excited and nervous for the second instalment.<br/><br/>With the 3 year break between 1 and 2, Po has become a much more talented Kung Fu warrior. He can actually fight now! The Furious Five + Po fight together as a group, really for the first time in this film. They set out to stop Lord Shen from destroying the world of Kung Fu, along with all it's Masters.<br/><br/>Along the way, in order to find Inner Peace, Po must face his past, learn about himself, and his real parents, and decide who he really is. Is he just a Panda? Or is he the last Panda, who's destiny it is to save China, so that he can go home and cook some noodles? I thought that the villain in this film, the Peacock Lord Shen, was a great choice. Gary Oldman did a superb job bringing this character to life. I even thought he was a little scary. He had this really creepy feel about him, that, coupled with his apparent heartlessness, made him a force to be reckoned with, and a bad guy to be remembered.<br/><br/>A lot more focus is also put on the returning characters, minus Master Shifu. He is somewhat absent for most of the film, but returns when he is most needed. I would say that the dialogue that the Furious Five had in the first film, is almost doubled, if not more, in the second film.<br/><br/>The new cast for this film is great. Star studded, but not over the top. This is a great film. I loved it. And just like all of the previously mentioned film series', I can not wait to see what the third Kung Fu Panda will bring to us. And there will be a third. Ski-doosh."

But Po's new life of awesomeness is threatened by the emergence of a formidable villain, who plans to use a secret, unstoppable weapon to conquer China and destroy kung fu. Po must look to his past and uncover the secrets of his mysterious origins; only then will he be able to unlock the strength he needs to succeed. -- (C) Dreamworks<br/><br/>KUNG FU PANDA 2 is an example of a sequel that surpasses it's predecessor. Instead of repeating the plot of the first film, the creative minds behind this sequel made the rightful decision to continue expanding Po's emotional story, in this case meaning that we finally find out Po's origin story. By doing this, KUNG FU PANDA 2 feels much more emotionally involving than the first, and it just goes to show you that Dreamworks Animation have matured in the past few years, although PUSS IN BOOTS looks like it'll bring the studio back a few steps.<br/><br/>With that being said, the film does suffer from having too many things going on at once, as if afraid that it'll bore the kids in the audience. The film moves at an lightening speed and, before you know it, the credits are rolling right in front of you. Part of this is due to the film's amazing narrative economy. For example, in the first few minutes, we have already learned the villain's origin story told in a fairytale kind of way with Michelle Yeoh as the narrator, à la THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR. I just wished the film took its time in certain parts because the film could have certainly been better if we had time to breathe.<br/><br/>As with most sequels, everything is bigger in KUNG FU PANDA 2. This includes the action sequences, which are amazing, stunning, and wildly imaginative, all enhanced by the 3D technology and the gorgeous cinematography. The 3D also provides amazing depth in almost every scene and moments of pop out gimmicks. With a bigger scope and the ability of animators to manipulate everything on screen, the extra dimension is certainly worth the extra cost. Hans Zimmer's score is terrific as usual, continuing the theme from the first film.<br/><br/>I also liked the villain a lot, the peacock Shen, voiced by the great Gary Oldman. The character is fleshed out more than your usual 2D villain, and he was pretty bad ass. Jack Black continues to prove that he's a great voice actor and provides the charm of the film with the lovable Po. His relationship with Angelina Jolie's Tigress is explored further in here as well, and it'll be interesting to see where they'll end up in the next sequel. I also liked the addition of Michelle Yeoh, who's pretty much great in everything she's in.<br/><br/>The wicked fast pace doesn't ruin the film, but slowing it down could have made it better. While not an amazing sequel, KUNG FU PANDA 2 is still better than the first film. With a great visual sense of wonder, funny jokes, and fantastic action sequences, this is an entertaining and emotionally involving sequel that branches out the story from the first film. In 2D or 3D, do yourself a favor and just go watch it. 7.5/10"
"kpraveen-iitk","9","0","3","31 May 2011"," Awesome but not as much as the first part.
","When I watched the first movie it immediately became one of my favorite so I was both excited as well as afraid of watching the second part cause it could have spoiled the original one for me. Thanks to dreamworks it didn't and i laughed my heart out watching it.<br/><br/>If I count the good things about the movie the list never ends it has excellent cast, amazing action, awesome humor,some real cute and emotional part, not to mention the best 3D effects i have ever seen(you will never realize that the movie is played on a 2-D screen) but the real gem was the rich comic style animation that is used to depicts the past.<br/><br/>Having said all that I will still have to say that I liked the first movie more for the story line and character builds because I define how good a movie is not by how much I liked the first time but by whether this movie is forcing me to watch it again or not. may be it is my personal bias towards the character build because I like batman begins more than the dark knight but I always wanted a bit stronger story and some element of surprise which the movie denied right in the beginning. all in all its a movie not to be missed by any animation lover in fact this movie will force some non animation fans to start liking it."

","What can be better than watching Kung Fu Panda 2? Watching it in 3D, of course! The 'awesomeness' of the movie pops right out (pardon the pun).<br/><br/>With the involvement of so many voice talents, including the triple J's (Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan), Van Damme 'The Muscle From Brussel', Charlie's Angel Lucy Liu and legendary actor Dustin Hoffman, it is no wonder that the entire animated film scores wonderfully BIG on the family 'fun' scale. I could hear kids' laughter resonating throughout the theater the entire time (adults too).<br/><br/>I think DreamWorks Animation is fast establishing itself as THE leader in developing novel materials that explore new grounds, which will ultimately attract new audiences around the globe (from the Hollywood perspective).<br/><br/>Hopefully, for the next installation, acclaimed director Lee Ang can be roped in to inject more 'pow wow' spin to the entire Kung Fu Panda franchise and boost it to even greater heights."
"patsydon","9","0","3","30 May 2011"," Awesome! Loved this movie and will probably drag hubby to it. :)
","I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. I can't write a verbose review but I have to do 10 lines to meet guidelines here. To put it simply, I think this movie may be better than the first, which I enjoyed. My 9 year old loved it. But to my surprise, my 18 year old who tagged along with us thought it was great too! A tiny bit slow to start or it would have gotten a 10. Within 20 minutes it was hopping. Made me laugh pretty often. Sappy me, had tears in my eyes at the end. The colors and animation were a delight. The comic delivery from Jack Black came at just the right times. I'm not sure how I'd feel about a 3rd which they left the door open for. I think this ended on just the right note."
"CSHaviland","9","0","3","29 May 2011"," Even better than the original
","Po is a kung fu legend who can't seem to act like one. He's a goofball with a good heart, and tries hard to fill a serious role, but he thinks that also means being cool, which unfortunately never works out for him. You have to give him credit for lack of embarrassment. He's not ashamed of himself, because he knows he's doing the best he can, and people look up at him anyway.<br/><br/>The story naturally fills a gap left by the first movie that we didn't realize was there, so it did not feel as though it was repeating itself. His lesson is a new one, and the lessons fits well with the adventure that has been thrust upon him this time. <br/><br/>Funniest animated feature since Tangled, and well worth an afternoon with your kids!"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","2","29 May 2011"," A joyful, glorious animated adventure . . . especially in 2D.
","""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a joyful, glorious animated adventure, fast moving, quick-witted, and a lot more fun then I had expected. The animation is crisp and beautiful - more-so in lovely 2D - and clearly shows the advances of the art form. Here is a movie that isn't simply a clone stamp of the original but actually expands on its story and its characters to create something really special.<br/><br/>The previous film simply dealt with the cheerfully goofy panda hero Po (voice of Jack Black), discovering his destiny though the art of Kung Fu and being groomed to become The Dragon Master. That adventure was fun, but not exactly deep. It was an odd mixture of Chinese folklore and western 21st century sensibilities. It was jarring, but now that I have gotten use to that odd union, the sequel is a little easier to swallow.<br/><br/>The story this time is a little heavier and far better. Po, as the movie opens, has begun to wonder about his past especially since his father Mr. Ping is a goose (voiced by James Hong). Po decides that there may be some need-to-know information. The answer comes from a problem that is looming over the land, an army led by an evil knife-throwing peacock named Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) who possesses a new element called gunpowder and intends to use it to dominate all of China and wipe out the art of Kung Fu. Shen knows the secrets of Po's past and our furry hero determines to uncover the truth.<br/><br/>So, Po amasses his Kung Fu fighting force, The Furious Five, which includes Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie), Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogan), Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu), Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan) and Crane (voiced by David Cross). The joy of the characters in this sequel is that they are given more screen time and a little more depth, especially Tigress who is a fearsome warrior and may, in some future sequel, win Po's heart. I also loved the presence once again of Po's master, the red panda Shifu, voiced beautifully by Dustin Hoffman. Shifu has much less screen time in this sequel, but his brief scenes are really touching.<br/><br/>What is special about ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is that it doesn't just repeat the formula of the original but takes its characters onto a much larger canvas. Po's search for his real parentage is deep and quite moving, told in flashbacks using some really beautiful hand-drawn animation. That story is connected to the main plot with Shen, who is a wonderful movie villain. Here is an evil white peacock with an erudite manner and an evil presence. We might be inclined to laugh at the possibility of an evil peacock but, in the world of this movie, it works.<br/><br/>The action scenes are breathtaking. When the characters fly through the air, there is a sense of depth and balance and weight. The action scenes, unlike so many these days, are fast-paced without ever becoming just a series of confusingly edited shots. We understand where the characters are in relation to one another and we know what is at stake. The animators really seem to have thought out these scenes and figured out how to make them special, not routine.<br/><br/>There are moments in the film of startling originality especially a great comic moment when Po must sneak through town to the tower that houses Shen's army. He uses one of those parade dragon costumes to get himself and his Furious Five past the guards. When he needs to speak to someone with information, Po has the dragon simply drag them inside the costume by gobbling them up. When he must fight an enemy guard without being detected, the dragon gobbles him up, and the costume drops him out the other end. There are at least two dozen moments like that, my favorite being a scene in which the portly Po faces his arch nemesis: a flight of stairs.<br/><br/>Seeing the movie is 2D was a breath of fresh air. The 3D process tends to get in the way, making the scenes look muddy and dark. Watching the movie without the intrusion, I was able to focus on the beauty of the animation. There are wonderful textures on the surfaces and on the characters. When we get a close-up of Po's fur, it is finely detailed so that we can see the individual hairs. More than that, the faces are wonderfully expressive, not just in eyes that open and close, but in pure emotion.<br/><br/>Some may think that I am overpraising this film, but I can only report how I felt. I settled into my seat and kind of knew what I was getting. Having seen the original, with its vision of China completely populated by various types of animals, I was ready for this one. It does what great sequels do, it moves past its original concept and broadens the horizons of its story possibilities. It offers new sights to see and new characters to behold. I enjoyed this movie, much more than I expected."
"meeza","8","0","3","28 May 2011"," Kung Fu Writing! Just for pun kicks!
","I Want Pandy!!! So I decided to get my kicks with a ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" viewing. I was aware that it was a sequel and there is always a ""more of the same"" element to sequels. However, I was pandily surprised that ""Kung Fun Panda 2"" played at more being a prequel than a sequel. Dragon Warrior Po (awesomely voiced again by Jack Black) is now on a mission to defend Kung Fu & China with his mates ""The Furious Five"" against an evil peacock called NBC, I mean Shen. However, within the fighting pandamonium there is also a subplot in the movie of Po trying to search his past and figure out who he really is and where he is from. The two plot lines interconnect in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" not just to provide narrative depth to the movie, but to present how one's upbringing is so relevant to one's survival & also character. ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" looks beautiful on screen, and besides the latest computer graphic animation design included in the movie there is also ""old school"" simple animation inserted to differentiate the time periods. Director Jennifer Yuh did a yeoman's job or should I say yuhwoman's job by incorporating noble Chinese culture into the narrative, as a love letter to China. However, Yuh did get carried away with too many explosion sequences that for the most part bombed. Nevertheless, it is the comedic protagonist Po that makes the Kung Fu Panda movies work. Po still demonstrates that his love for the culinary arts is still his favorite thang! This Panda still loves to munch it down. I just hope we don't see an offshoot of his dietary habits in a Part 3 called ""Kung Poo Panda"". Besides Black, Angelina Jolie also nailed it once again with her lipwork as Tigress, 20% of The Furious Five. Gary Oldman playing a villain never gets old, and he does some badass vocal work as Shen the Peacock. Dustin Hoffman just gets in a scene or two this time around voicing Master Shifu, but when Hoffman speaks you better listen ""He's talking here!!"". ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" does not hit on all cylinders, but it is no ancient Chinese secret that it is quite entertaining, mostly due to its Black comedy! **** Good"
"spartanl36","9","0","3","28 May 2011"," A fantastic sequel to an original movie!
","When my friends and I discussed plans for after our last day of school, we eventually settled on seeing Kung Fu Panda 2. Having never seen the original Kung Fu Panda, I decided to watch it a few nights before and loved its great performances, excellent animation, and powerful moral. As i went into Kung Fu Panda 2, however, I remembered: this is a Dreamworks movie. Can this really measure up to the first movie? Answer: I need not have worried.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 excels in every aspect of a movie. Once again the animation and visuals are top notch, as is the musical score. The plot this time focuses around the rise the powerful new threat of the peacock Lord Shen (played by a fantastically sinister Gary Oldman)just as the panda Po (a very funny Jack Black) is beginning to settle comfortably into his life as the Dragon Warrior. While the original KFP was a fairly light-hearted origin story, Kung Fu Panda 2 introduces darker experiences to Po and to the movie as a whole, and the movie is much deeper for it. That's not to say that KFP 2 is full of despair, far from it. The movie builds off the humor of KFP to make one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. The plot is helped along by the supporting roles, such as the aforementioned Lord Shen, and Master Shifu and the Furious Five. I was especially pleased with the development of Tigress. (Angelina Jolie) One of my complaints about the first movie was that you could tell that Tigress had the potential for being a great character, but ended up spending the entire movie as a bitter, no-nonsense character, which seemed a waste. In Kung Fu Panda 2, Tigress has a more compassionate personality, while retaining her strong fighter traits, and has warmed to Po, sharing a strong friendship with him and helping him to cope with the more mature events of the movie. The rest of the Furious Five were also given far more screen time in KFP 2, but Tigress by far was the best of them.<br/><br/>In the end, I would find it more likely that Kung Fu Panda 2 came from Pixar rather than Dreamworks. The movie is a testament to what a studio can do to retain the charm and draw of an original idea and fix its flaws and improve on what worked. The only problem I had with the movie was the 90 minute run time. The movie is so well done that I can't resist wishing it were longer. On the other hand, maybe this avoids us from overdosing on too much of a good thing. In any case, I well be waiting excitedly for Kung Fu Panda 3, which KFP 2 shows is inevitable."
"mitchincoo","9","0","3","28 May 2011"," Beautiful martial arts film
","Since I typically watch 3 or 4 great martial arts films a week, KFP2 was a typical outing of great martial arts, with a story recognizable to every one who has ever seen more than 10 chop socky flicks. There are few sequences in here that aren't familiar. That is no dig at the film. What it lacks in originality, it far surpasses in sheer beauty. Like the greatest of martial arts films,its beauty is its motion. Each expression is artistry. Like all great martial arts films, there is no wasted motion.<br/><br/>From the opening piece, to the old school flashbacks, to the nod to every Jackie Chan film made in the good old days, this film fit the bill."
"rudlefuz","8","0","3","28 May 2011"," Find your inner peace!!!
","Now let me begin by saying that this may be one of the greatest animated sequels that we have ever seen. It is now totally in the league of Toy Story and Shrek.<br/><br/>I loved how the storyline continued from the last film and matured along the way. This time its a lot more serious and also very emotional. here we get to have a look to the sad past of Po the Panda as he quests to unlock his lost childhood memories, find his true origin and most importantly find the inner peace. The story was fast paced and well crafted, it didn't felt rushed or stuffy even though they have given a lot in less then 90 minutes.<br/><br/>There is way more character development than the previous one. There is a perfect balance of humor and action of and thankfully the humor are less about Po's eating disorder or weight problem and more witty and funny.<br/><br/>The voice talents are great as before. The animation was nice with just enough 3D elements and some 2D flash-back stories.<br/><br/>At the end it is safe to say that Kung Fu Panda 2 was a delight to watch and well worth of your time and money. If you are a animation lover you just cant have this summer without watching Po the Panda."

","With the success of Kung Fu Panda Dream Works finally managed to surpass Pixar with it's heavily detailed and achingly beautiful animation.<br/><br/>3 years later it's sequel picked up from where it's predecessor left us in a small tiny village in the Republic of China no wait,China wasn't republic then it was still under the Imperial rule.Never mind history,Part 2 begins with the Villain Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) embarking upon a mission to take over China,as the story progresses Lord Shen's and our Hero Po (Jack Black) paths intertwine as prophesized by his soothsayer.Po discover's his past while in pursuit to stop Lord Shen from destroying Kung Fu and taking over all of China.<br/><br/>I particularly found Lord Shen a bit tamer than Tai Lung from the first part.Lord Shen when compared to Tai Lung cannot do awesome Kung Fu or does he emit the same evil as Tai Lung does.Though Tai Lung had a lot less of dialog than Lord Shen i prefer Tai Lung over Lord Shen as Villain for his super powers and imposing character.<br/><br/>The heart of the story remains the same with Po overcoming odds to see out any challenge to the peace and tranquility of his village.Underneath the silly gags and Laugh Out Loud moments there is an underlying message in the movie.""Your Past doesn't matter,it is what you choose to become"" Po chose to become the Dragon Warrior and he finally finds ""Inner peace"" and come to terms with his past in the movie.Audiences often ignore the message a movie tries to convey to it's viewers,all they want from a motion picture is to be entertained the whole 2 hours.Even the first Kung Fu Panda had a beautiful message,which urges one to go out and achieve their dreams despite the many obstacles that confront them.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 has a lot more ""Kung Fu"" in it.It's fast paced action and equally fast editing leaves you bedazzled with you wanting more of it.I personally feel the animation got better than the previous Dream Works production's,it had the same detail and shades of their hit animation picture 'How to train your Dragon'.However i felt the sequel was less comical than the prequel.Part one was a laugh riot with every passing scene,also part two had it's moments but not in the same volume as part one.<br/><br/>Another comparison between the two being the movie's climax.Part one wins hands down with an epic sorts of fight sequence laced with humor over part two's slow ending with a hint of a possible 3rd movie in the making (i learnt today that Kung Fu Panda is a 6 part franchise,can you imagine the fun that awaits us?)."
"Eternality","8","0","3","27 May 2011"," While not as fun and carefree as the first installment, Kung Fu Panda 2 still packs a solid punch.
","What's there not to like about a fat panda demonstrating his prowess in the art of kung fu fighting? Po (Jack Black) returns in the second installment of the much loved Dreamworks' Animation hit Kung Fu Panda (2008), once again teaming up with his fellow band of warriors to try to defeat a villain, Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), who harbors the evil dream of conquering China with his latest invention – a cannonball weapon. Very much adhering to the action-comedy formula laid down by its prequel, Kung Fu Panda 2 is a blast to watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>Directed by newcomer Jennifer Yuh, Kung Fu Panda 2 impresses with its attention to cultural detail. The computer-generated visuals give a distinctive Oriental feel and many of the majestic architecture bear striking resemblances to that of Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001), though they are not as magical or poetic as the hand-drawn quality of the latter. Yuh's direction is excellent for someone embarking on her debut feature. The film never lacks energy and vigor, and packs quite a lot of action into ninety minutes, though it could be said that there is a slight overdose of action scenes, which sometimes can be chaotic to follow.<br/><br/>Unlike sequels that see no growth in the development of their lead characters, Kung Fu Panda 2 tackles Po's backstory through a commanding use of intermittent flashbacks that are depicted using interesting ""paper-cut style"" animation. This provides ample development to Po's character and gives us a strong reason to empathize with him. Surprisingly, the filmmakers handle the emotional nuances of Po's early years very well, with an especially touching scene involving his mother abandoning him in a wooden crate of fruits and vegetables while hunting wolves presumably lead her to her death.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda 2 references popular culture, though not as explicitly as some of Pixar's films like Toy Story (1995) or Finding Nemo (2003). Most notable ones include a reference to Jackie Chan (who voices one of the characters here) movies involving trying to avoid signs on top of a moving vehicle, and a Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) reference that sees Po ""coming back up"" on a rotating wheel ala Schwarzenegger. While not as fun and carefree as the first installment, Kung Fu Panda 2 still packs a solid punch. I do look forward to the certainty of a part three, which will most likely involve an emotional paternal struggle over Po.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."
